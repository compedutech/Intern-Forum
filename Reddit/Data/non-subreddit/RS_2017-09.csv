6xb54v,67,2017-08-31,[PI] It turns out that spiders want to be roommates and pay rent by putting change in your couch. They pay proportional to their size. One day you return to find two large bars of gold in your couch...,Jon_the_Human,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6xb54v/pi_it_turns_out_that_spiders_want_to_be_roommates/,"Hello. I am new to this subreddit and this is my first real response to a prompt. I obtained this prompt from /u/The-Potato-Lord [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6wt7wu/wp_it_turns_out_that_spiders_want_to_be_roommates/) who got part of the idea from /u/waddlewoodle [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6wmniq/which_conspiracy_theory_makes_you_cringe_the_most/dm9dbd9/). I was originally responding in the comments section and editing as I went but it got too long. So here it is! Part VI will be the end.  


**PART I**


Huh? What? I pick my head up, peel scrap papers from the side of my face, which has become beet red from the unforgiving desk it had previously laid upon. A sound, something struck the floor as I sat slouched over my desk fast asleep. 


The boss has had me in the office training the new interns and expects a full twenty-page analysis of our firm's most recent condominium design due Monday. It's Friday and I'm not even ten pages through! Probably explains why I just woke up with my eyebrow resting against the front entrance. What was that sound?


Still within a semi-conscious state from having just woken up, I gaze with my groggy eyes below my worn leather office chair. I see stringy brown, grey and black spindles of carpet scrunched against the transparent plastic mat atop which my chair sits. Nothing out of the ordinary there. I spin clumsily to the right and peer into the kitchen. Inspecting the floor, all is well. I stand to get a better view of the counter-tops. Nothing unusual.  *PING* The sound again! And this time I'm ready. I heard it from the living room behind me. I quickly shuffle to turn the light on, excitement building within me. My excitement was delayed however due to the slight inconvenience of the light switch not being where I thought it was. I recently took over the lease here and haven't quite got a hang of the place yet. Left side of the couch, right! I scurried around the couches edge to reach the switch *flick*. I gaze quickly into the living room. **AHHH** You could have told me someone tossed a flash-bang into my apartment and I would have believed you. Its two in the morning, my eyes were not prepared. 


After thirty seconds of what could have looked like sign language directed at the ceiling fixture, I had regaining my vision. In the middle of the floor between the couch and the television stand lay two exceptionally grudging coins, both of equal size. To the side of the coins lay a note, taped at its ends. Curiosity and excitement had now started to become fear and loathing. I retrieve the note and examine it. On the outside of the note written in deep black ink: 


**For Brian, DON'T RUN**

*edit: spacing*


**PART II**


*Hey Brian, what's up buddy? This is from Geoff Fultz, the dude who leased you this place! Hope all has gone well in your first week, sure hope Spencer got this to you on time. You'll meet Spencer later. Anyway there's a bit more information about this place that I kept secret, and since you are now officially on the lease and moved in I feel safe in confiding in you.* 


*You see, Brian, I have lived here in this very apartment for a number of years now. I have made quite a few friends while staying here and with those friends I have created quite an invaluable service. Though I would very much like to stay here and continue to tend to my costumers I have much more pressing matters ahead. Now, I know you must be wondering why I did not inform you of this beforehand but that is due to the nature of it all. You remember the DONT RUN bit? Most people tend to run when I tell them about it. So I figured to hell with telling you, and here we are.*


*Don't think of trying to find me or get into any legal business as maybe you have assumed by now my name is not Geoff Fultz. Who spells Jeff with a G anyway? Nope, you're stuck buddy. But to be honest with you, this situation isn't half bad. If you give it time I think it might really grow on ya!*


*I'm just gonna dive right on in: I run what is basically a hotel for spiders. Myself and my assistant Spencer, who also happens to be a spider, have constructed tiny hovels throughout the interiors of the walls within the apartment. There are approximately 1000 spider rooms throughout the apartment in every wall but the kitchen and master bedroom, but you wont need to worry about logistics, Spencer handles all that. The best part of all this is that the spiders pay for the rooms! Each spider pays a dollar per gram of body weight. Spencer pays half the normal rate, she demanded I grandfather her in when I made a rate change last year. She's probably already paid you. Anyway, you shouldn't ever have to worry about the spiders not paying for their rooms. Surprising spiders are quite honest creatures and they are also super adept at finding loose change and bills. Spencer is the most keen, though her payments generally tend to be the more disgusting looking coins. The apartment is completely vacant aside from yourself and Spencer. ting ting* 

I jolt my head up as something taps against the sliding glass door.


**PART III**


I look to my left and see nothing but myself, mirrored in the darkness of the outside world. Just then a small smudge darts from the bottom of the glass pane into exactly where I had been looking. My heart is racing at this point, blood flowing to every each of my body. Once I can focus I notice that the smudge is what I suspected it would be, a spider. And from the information I have gathered so far, I'm left to assume this is Spencer. The spider remains still, eerily so and stares blankly back at me with beedy black eyes. I inspect further and realize, to my horror, that Spencer might just be a black widow. Red lightning bolt shape on the thorax and completely coated in glossy black death. We continue examining each other, both still as can be. Her slender, toothpick legs begin to move. The widow disappears in a blur of silk and darkness and then everything is still. 


**Are you going to answer it?** The letters were strewn about, haphazardly but legibly so in spider silk on the pane of glass. *Ting ting* 


I hesitate, knowing full well the devastation a black widow can create, standing firmly in the middle of my poorly decorated living room. The widow seemed to sense my uncomfort and scurried onto the wall beside the sliding glass door, well away from myself. Looking back at the letters on the glass a second time: **Are you going to answer it?** After a couple deep breaths I make my way toward the door handle. I grasp tightly, slide the door open and bolt to the other side of the couch, all the way across the living room. Without pause, the widow crept to the opening and seemed to usher a second and third spider into a notch in the wall and underneath the fireplace in the corner of the living room. Everything become still and I sat cautiously on the couch, half expecting five more spiders to come crawling out.  


This is nuts! All my life I have either ran from spiders, stomped on them or tried to get them out of my home. Now I'm letting them into my home? Am I dreaming? Could this all just be a weird nightmare? To get my head straight, I head to the sink to fix myself a glass of water and realize I am still clutching the note ""Geoff"" left me. Water first. I gulp down the entire glass and things are starting to set in. This isn't a dream or a nightmare, this is real. I set my glass onto the granite counter top and and open the note once again. 


*The apartment is completely vacant except for you and Spencer. That is until Freddy and Tilly show up. That's one part of the business that you're responsible for, you gotta let the spiders in. Spencer isn't able to get the door open and I could never figure out a plausible way of having entry other than opening and closing the back door. You know how I said that spiders are surprisingly honest? Well they are also some that are incredibly dishonest, just like any other species. We gotta watch out for those folk, Spencer has a keen eye for em'. Aside from all that there isn't much else you really need to do. Spencer will fill you in on any arrival/departure times of our guests. She knows your work schedule and will plan around it as best she can. Good luck and I hope you end up enjoying the place Its got a great view of the city, recently remodeled kitchen, new carpeting (fitted with spider tunnels), and above all else, Spencer is planning a five-hundred room expansion!*


*Oh yeah, and make sure to check the couch, for whatever reason that's where the spiders like to deposit their rent.*


After finishing the note I decide it best that I get some sleep. I still have a lot of work to do on my analysis paper and perhaps all of this still really is a some sort of dream and a good nights rest will cure it all. I lumber to my bed, instead of my desk, flop myself on my mattress and am asleep in an instant. Tomorrow will be different.          



**PART IV**


I awoke the next morning with a peculiar feeling. Rising from slightly damp sheets, cautiously I sniff the air. No rancid smell, it isn't pee, just sweat. I sigh thankfully yet the odd sensation I felt upon waking remains. My muscles are stiff from rough sleep yet none more so than my stomach. It turns as I make my way to the kitchen. A scramble sounds nice. Eggs, potatoes, sausage, cheese that about does it. Potatoes in the oven, all else set aside. Those damn spuds take forever to cook. Suddenly I feel a jolt...


I keel over, grasping my abdomen tightly. This time it is pee. As I reach the toilet, seconds before sliding my way there, I wonder how I hadn't realized I needed to relieve myself until just now. Come to think of it I haven't really felt quite right this morning. I really did sleep terribly. I seem to remember having some crazy dreams. There was something about spiders living in couches and another part about a hotel for spare change. At one point I was floating around the living room with papers stuck to my face. 


After finishing in the bathroom I find myself sitting on the couch, not quite remembering how I got there. I'm forgetting about something and it wasn't just the journey to the sofa. Hmmm... **SPINACH**! Which also reminds me that I need to finish cooking. Hopping to my feet and I aim toward the kitchen and... *tap tap* 


My body quivers and I feel my bones shake. In that instant everything from the night before came spiraling back to me. I felt dizzy but looked meekly toward the sliding glass door. **Jesus Brian, answer the door...** The words glimmered in front of the rays of the afternoon sun. I don't see Spencer but she's probably pretty close by. Feeling quite terrified I figure I might as well get it over with. It wasn't terrible the first time, shouldn't be any worse this time. Ready to pull open the door I gaze out upon the back patio beyond the shielding layer of glass, viewing stringy brown, grey and black spindly legs coupled with an eighth the amount of hairy, glossy and grotesque masses. Spiders, at least 100, are piled in front of my back door. Spencer appears between myself and the disgusting blob of legs. She motions her front appendages toward the handle, which I had released a while back. With a sigh I submit and proceed to open the door. 


Huh, Spencer has these spiders moving in a single file line through the door and under the fireplace. Chaos on the porch, order in the apartment. Within a minute every single spider is underneath the fireplace. Awestruck, I close the door and suddenly my ears are invaded by a horrendous moaning. The fire alarm is going off! **THE SPUDS**! I race to the kitchen. Actually, the potatoes are fine, just a shit oven. After snagging the spinach from the fridge, my scramble is cooked and eaten in less than an hour. 


I'm sitting on the couch, thoroughly satisfied with the meal I just ate, yet also very dissatisfied with the fact that there are currently about a hundred spiders inside of my walls. But really what can I do? I could ask them to leave but I doubt that they would like that very much. Furthermore I doubt I'd win in a fight against a hundred spiders, if it came to that. Hell I wouldn't even win against Spencer alone. Or could I? Speak of the devil, here is Spencer now. 


""Look, can you understand me, Spencer?"" I felt foolish even attempting to communicate with her. 


In a flash the word yes appeared on the floor beside her. 


""Alright then."" I said mostly to myself. ""This might be a bit easier.""          



**PART V**


""Susan said you came in ten after eight, that's three times this year, Brian."" quipped a voice from behind my cramped, poorly lit cubicle. The boss. It's true, I did show up ten minutes late today. 


""Yeah, a moving truck blocked my car in this morning."" I responded, dishonestly. Truthfully I was assisting Spencer with some of the hotel maintenance. She would prefer I didn't help, and I definitely don't need to. But I am really starting to enjoy this whole thing. And I also feel kinda of guilty if I'm not doing anything. From Saturday morning to today I've made about $500 dollars. Mostly coins and small bills, likely found in sewers and on the street, but after a quick wash they look brand new. 


""A moving truck? Two months ago it was a flat tire."" 


""I sent you a picture with my face next to the wheel..."" I truly did have a flat tire then. Come to think of it every time I have come in late I have had a reason. Well, except this time. 


""Well I expect more from a person in your position. Do you have that report for me?"" Shit! The condominium project. I haven't worked on that since Friday night. 


""Actually sir, I was thinking of making some slight alterations to some of the designs. I haven't quite finished them and I was hoping you could give me an extension?"" The ideas I had in mind I hadn't actually given much thought to at all. The idea first came the me when I picked up ""Geoff's"" note and read over it a second time. *1000 spider rooms throughout the apartment in every wall*. The note even said Spencer was planning a 500 room expansion. That got me thinking, if 1500 spider rooms fit in an 800 square foot apartment, how many would fit in a 3000 square foot condominium, with an actual architect designing them? 


""I'll allow two more days. No paper in my hand Wednesday morning and you're out of a job."" That's alright, once I finish this project I won't need a job.



Eight hours later I return home, toss my bag on the floor and plop down on the couch. I'm exhausted and my feet ache from having to wear terribly restricting dress shoes all day long. I quickly toss my shoes off and reach around the couch for the television remote. At this point my eyes are closed as I rest them thankfully. Prodding the couch, no signs of a remote. Reaching my left hand to the opposite side of the couch, underneath a blanket I am met but the feel a a silky smooth surface. Hard and cold to the touch. I open my eyes , grasp the end of the blanket and slowly uncover what lies beneath. Resting stoutly upon the far cushion lay two dazzlingly brilliant gold bars, pushing mightily against the fabric beneath it. I sat for a moment, thinking why on Earth these to marvelously looking objects come to be in my living room, when a thought occurred to me. The spiders put their rent in this couch. This must be a rent payment. Maybe the spiders coupled all their payments into one lump sum? I stick my hand into the crease between the two cushions beside me and am met by an intense jingling sound, like a bag full of coins. I check the other crease, same thing. The couch is basically full of change. After ten minutes I have the couch empty but have left the gold bars where they are. They are heavy as hell and I don't know where else to put them. There must be a crap ton of spiders in this place right now. *Creeeeeeek*



The penetrating sounds rang out through the hall way and into the living room like a train engine. A dagger of fear stabbed deep within my chest. An intruder. I rise to my feet woefully and creep toward the edge of the hall. I seem to here the sound again, but this time it's muffled. I continue down the hall, I have a baseball bat in my room but that's the location I heard the sound from. Whoever this is must have gotten in before I came home. As I inch closer and closer to my bedroom door, I press my ear against it. *CRACK*


The sound of wood snapping startles me and I reel my neck back from the side of the door. The sound came from behind me, across the hall from my room, in the guest bedroom.


""What the hell.."" I said under my breath as I turned and faced the opposite direction. After a moment of preparation and and hopeful prayer I bravely reached toward the handle and opened the door wide, ready to face whatever came before me. ""Oh my God!"" I shouted as I shut the door and through my back against the wall, heart pounding.



**PART VI**




**PART VI**


The room was silent. The hall was silent. The entire apartment was silent. Nothing moved, not even my chest, breathless. I remained flush against the cold wall beside the door that lead to the beast. Actually, I'm pretty sure there were two of them. Giant spiders lounging in my guest bedroom. What do I do? Why are they here? These aren't guests, are they? 


""Spencer?!"" I yelled, demanding. *thud* My head knocked against the wall upon Spencer's unexpected arrival. She dropped in from above me, very eerily extending all of her limbs as she descended. She dropped to the floor and twirled out of a sight for a second and reappeared, as she so often did. **Open the door**. I obliged, as I so often did, and Spencer swept into the room, bringing the door with her. It slide shut and there I stood, alone in the middle of the dark hall. 


I waited for about ten minuted until I heard a knock against the door. I opened it slowly. Out came Spender alone and again she shut the door, sending a web behind her as she walked. She walked into the living room and I followed hotly. 


""No! We are not having two giant spiders living in this apartment. I will not have it."" I said with surprising enthusiasm considering my counterpart. Spencer halted for a moment in the middle of the room and again went to writing her response. 


""Only for a couple days. Their forest was torn down during the construction of an outlet mall."" Not surprising, this town has been expanding for years. That's basically how I've made all my money the last couple years, designing most the buildings. But I won't need to do that anymore. Not once I finish working on this last project. 


""I'm designing a new spider condominium. It's going to have at least 8000 spider rooms, all designed by me. I can even work our two new.. Uh.. Friends into the plans. Give me a couple hours and I'll show you the plans. The place is going to be completed in a matter of months."" 


Spencer paused, longer this time time than she had ever before. Then disappeared again. **Okay, sounds good.**



I spent the next six hours working in my new design plans. Using some fading ink I detailed each room into the walls of each section of the condominium. I put rooms in the bedroom walls and in the kitchen too, with the spiders travelling through various pipelines. Once I finished I showed the final details to Spencer and she looked over them quickly. She had seemed very busy since I spoke to her about my plans. She indicated that she was pleased and darted underneath the fireplace. It was late so I decided to get some sleep. Tomorrow I needed to think of an idea to show my boss, I only needed the extra time for the spider designs, which I wasn't showing him. I crashed on my bed and fell asleep. 


I awoke early the next morning. The apartment seemed peaceful, quiet but unlike it had been yesterday. I rose to my feet and opened the door. Odd, the guest bedroom door is open. Maybe the megaspiders left? I crept up to the side of the doorway and peered in slowly. Everything was empty, however the frame of the bed was completely destroyed. That must have been the sound I heard yesterday. Other than that all is well. I turned and made my way into the living room. As I stand, basically waiting for something to happen, I look toward the sliding glass door and see a note hanging by the grasp of a single strand of spider silk. Grabbing the note I realize how similar it is to the note ""Geoff"" had left me before. I open it and begin reading:



*Hey Brian, what's up buddy? I hope you've been well. Well, I know you've been well. Spencer told me and really I haven't actually gone anywhere. You know those ""pressing matters"" I said I had? The reason I had to leave? Well really I was just waiting for you. I was waiting for you to do what you did last night. That expansion Spencer was working on was actually what you created. So I thank you for providing us with these designs. The time I spent away I was working on finding a location for my new condominium. I was also working on raising the funds to build the place before Aran and Berny showed up. Tragic what happened to their forest but it gave us all a new opportunity. With the strength of their silk I'll be able to modify your design to have the structure supported by spider silk. Obviously no silk will be visible so that people will want to move in. It's going to look roughly the same. Don't worry, we changed the appearance a little bit. Nobody will know that our building is the same as yours.*


*All the spiders from the apartment have moved out. We're planning to be finished with construction in the next few days and they'll be moving in right away. Everyone wants those premium rates! Since we can only work during the cover of night we expect to be done within the next couple nights or so. Once we're finished I'll be sending the plans back to you with you're new assistants. You remember Freddy and Tilly? Spencer trained em' up and they are going to manage your new condominium. I'm allowing you to take all the proceeds! What an opportunity!*


*Again, Brian, thanks for doing this for us and thank you for understanding about this whole situation. The spiders really appreciate it, and I sure as hell do too! We're gonna be rich buddy!*


I sat down after finishing the note with a smile on my face. Even though I had just been duped by this man, I was happy about it. Not just because I was also about to become filthy rich. More so than I already was as I was sitting next to two gold bars. No, I was happy because I loved how much my life had changed since moving into this apartment. All the work I had been doing along side Spencer and with designing the spider rooms really started to grow on me. I still need to finish my designs to show my boss but after the creation of the building, I am planning to quit my job which is definitely a reason to smile. My building wont be done in the next couple nights. This project should be complete in about four months. The problem is I can't building it with spider silk. What an idea though. Maybe I could talk to ""Geoff"" about that. I still don't know what his name is...

On the day Harvey hit, I was supposed to hear back from two jobs. The interviews went super well and one of the recruiters kept in touch with me for the past three weeks updating me about where they are in making a choice. 

The other job I interviewed for last Monday and it went super well. But of course I couldn't hear back because Harvey hit. I sent update emails to both jobs this week asking if they were okay and safe. 

I've had high stress and anxiety levels. I've been on the job search for close to three months since my internship ended in May. And I nearly had these two jobs in my hand before Harvey hit. 

I'm really anxious and scared right now. I don't make much money at my part time job and Harvey had me on edge because if something happened to my house or family, I would be so alone, broke, and hopeless. I am so thankful that my family and home stayed intact and that nothing happened to us. 

That is my story and my dealings with anxiety. What about you guys? "

Collectively the donors can change the law if organized. Start with the largest economies first: CA, TX, NY, and FL.",RageLionRising,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6xckx3/the_bill_of_family_rights_2_befriend_the/,"**TL;DR: Privately contact the offices of political donors to your state level government. The donor class of men are our key allies. They have the power and the logical self-interest to repeal and replace the state Family Codes.**          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 1: STATE LEVEL GOVERNMENT**          
&amp;nbsp;

The legal base of authority for the Family Courts exists at the state level — not at the city or national level. Our state legislatures are the only ones with the authority to completely re-write the Family Codes. To change the law overwhelming financial pressure must be placed on state level government.          
&amp;nbsp;

*Note to Civics 101 newbies: Your state level legislature is completely separate from your federal level legislature. Both legislatures are bicameral, meaning they have two chambers. The lower chamber is called the House of Representatives. The upper chamber is called the Senate.*          
&amp;nbsp;

*The state House of Representatives and state Senate are one level lower than the federal House of Representatives and federal Senate. They are entirely different people. It's the difference between the state Governor and the U.S. President.*          
&amp;nbsp;

The Family Courts derive their legal power specifically from state level laws called the Family Codes. This means the problem is very spread out. And it has lead to the current legal diaspora family men find themselves in today. This nationwide but decentralized legal structure raises the question: Where do we start to apply pressure? The answer is a matter of economics.          
&amp;nbsp;

Prioritize the states with the largest economies first. California, Texas, New York, and Florida. States with smaller economies will be inclined to follow their lead in a legal domino effect. A prime example of this occurred after Governor Ronald Reagan signed into California law ""no-fault divorce"" in the early 1970s. No-fault divorce soon went nationwide.          
&amp;nbsp;

If state government politicians stonewall after you call them — they almost certainly will — then onto Part 2: Befriend the donors.          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 2: BEFRIEND THE DONORS**          
&amp;nbsp;

After contacting your state legislatures they will be on notice. However, the legal inertia will not be there for them to pass legal reform. Expect to reach an intern. The intern will take down your message, but a politician will likely not return your call.          
&amp;nbsp;

Here's why. Even if your State House of Representatives authors a bill, the danger always exists for any *individual legislator* that a media pile on will occur. This will be driven by female-centric advertisers and businesses hungry for the female dollar. The media tone would be like any Mike Pence post as written in the TwoXChromosomes subreddit.          
&amp;nbsp;

As a collective, the donor class can place a financial strangle hold on the legislature, and thus force a change to the state Family Codes regardless of media uproar. They have the power to eliminate the Family Courts profit motive entirely. *And it's in their personal best interests to do so.*          
&amp;nbsp;

The Family Courts are at their heart an evil business empire that goes straight for the heart of any man — his family. It makes sense on an economic and moral level to put these evil competitors out of business. The donor class can pressure the legislature to eliminate the current profit-driven model of the Family Courts into a tax subsidized one. The tax subsidized model will discourage the use of the courts in the first place. It's good for every man's wallet.          
&amp;nbsp;

Right now the political donors are the (unwitting) financial base of power that keep the poorly written Family Codes in place. They are a sleeping giant waiting to be awakened.          
&amp;nbsp;

Many of the donors are business men, union heads, and political action committees (PACs). All run by men — men who want to protect their children and hard earned wealth from the potential of vindictive ex-wives, psychotic ex-girlfriends, and the profit-driven Family Courts.          
&amp;nbsp;

The political donor class are our allies regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans. So when you reach out do not disrespect them. Even if they tell you to *fuck off* provide your contact information and stoically move onto the next donor. Leave the door open for them to join us down the line. The goal is to gradually slither our grip around the state legislatures like a boa constrictor. Once tightened the grip won't be loosened, but this process will not happen quickly.          
&amp;nbsp;

There are simply too many politicians for change to occur overnight. And those politicians are magnified by an even larger pool of donors. I want to emphasize: *each and every individual politician has a pool of donors.* Our work is definitely cut out for us.          
&amp;nbsp;

One lawmaker may have only ten donors. Another may have a hundred. The pool of donors is gigantic. There are too many donors to list here, but an effort needs to be made to contact all of them. These men have direct influence over our laws.          
&amp;nbsp;

Votesmart.org lists the major donors for state level politicians in CA, TX, NY, and FL. Ballotpedia.org and Followthemoney.org are also good sources, but I have found that Votesmart.org tends to provide the information with less clicking around and digging.          
&amp;nbsp;

**Once you have reviewed your state government from Part 1 above, make a list of their individual donors using Votesmart.org.** Build a telephone call list complete with street addresses. Find out the top guy at each donor's organization, and give him a call. Avoid dealing with subordinates as much as possible. You want to talk with the top guy. If you get them on the phone, be quick and to the point. Identify yourself. Inform him you are calling since he donated to X state House Member, X state Senator, or X Governor. Explain that Family Law is corrupt and places all men in the state in great financial jeopardy. The Bill of Family Rights aims to fix that. Tell him you need his support to enact such legislation because he holds leverage over the politician.          
&amp;nbsp;

The largest donors give away millions of dollars, and may not be reachable by phone. In those cases I recommend driving to their office and forcing an impromptu meeting. Expect to be told to fuck off. And again, provide your contact information and leave respectfully.          
&amp;nbsp;

A list of suggested laws for the Bill of Family Rights is provided below in the comment section.          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 3: ORGANIZING A ""CLOSED DOOR"" STRATEGY**          
&amp;nbsp;

I recommend creating a core group of ten to twenty men per each of the major four states. Utilize GeoTRP, the TRP IRC channel, or TRP.RED (if the forums are unlocked) to create a cyber team that is geography based.          
&amp;nbsp;

To defend against the feminist uproar it's best to avoid the limelight, stay private, and be systematic.          
&amp;nbsp;

It will be harder to attack us with independent state teams. Couple that with a slow and gradual befriending of the donors to our state House of Representatives, state Senate, and state Governors; and legal reform will become unstoppable. They will go after our jobs with a nasty doxx article. In response, we will slowly tear their asymmetrical feminist laws to shreds.... With a Mike Pence smile on our face.          
&amp;nbsp;

Make one-on-one phone calls, drive to an office, engage in closed door meetings, talk to guys on manosphere forums, e-mail your buddy or relative who got screwed in the divorce, text message your male friends, quietly inform your work colleague, etc. Keep spreading the word through any *private means* available. If you want to remain anonymous purchase a burner cell phone, communicate through TOR, and create throwaway accounts.          
&amp;nbsp;

With time the numbers could grow beyond a core group of twenty men to a thousand plus. Though a thousand men may be overkill as it risks becoming chaotic.          
&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, huge numbers will work in our favor to change the laws faster than just twenty men could. That's assuming we keep our state teams organized. A clear chain of command, a hierarchy prioritizing the duties, and clear instruction for each man would be necessary. Guys outside the core group could engage in simple duties like once-a-month phone banking or leaving messages with legislator interns.          
&amp;nbsp;

As a secondary measure of spreading the word, I suggest reaching out to Matt Drudge, Philip Defranco, Karen Straughan, Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, and Dr. Drew (narrator of Divorce Corp). I am pretty sure they would portray us in a fair light. Just understand that media attention is a low priority for us. The ""open door"" media path that feminists walk with ease is most often blocked to men.          
&amp;nbsp;

This is because advertiser supported media outlets are dependent on the female dollar (television, radio, public protests, youtube trending, reddit front page, etc.) And unfortunately MRAs have an awful habit of struggling in vain to obtain mainstream acceptance. They mimic victimhood culture, and they gravitate repeatedly to outlets that marginalize, laugh at, and ignore them.          
&amp;nbsp;

In contrast, our one-ally-at-a-time ""closed door"" strategy is not only indifferent to being ignored, it will push through any media uproar.          
&amp;nbsp;

It is the organizational equivalent of the Youtube honey badger video. The honey badger takes repeated bites to the face from the feminist cobra and keeps on going. It is a method not dependent on good luck, mainstream media approval, or widespread public sympathy. It *forces* a change to the law by applying increasing leverage to our lawmaker's financial pressure points.          
&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately, that application of financial pressure will be up to you, the silent reader, to make tangible. This post is nothing more than a rough roadmap for reform. Personally, I don't have as large of a dog in this fight as some of our older readers do. The guy who is not commenting or logged in right now — the one who is buried in draconian child support — has the most incentive. Not me.          
&amp;nbsp;

If you have the motivation, please speak up in the comment section below. A show of hands will tell other readers the potential strength we have. Based on my experience I typically see ten times the amount of readers than the number of votes. So if I get 200+ votes on my post I can see that there were 20,000+ readers who voted neither way.          
&amp;nbsp;

This means there is a silent majority. And the potential is huge. Whether that majority has the will to organize will soon be seen.          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 4: AFTER THE GOAL HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED DISPERSE**          
&amp;nbsp;

To avoid the same errors of 1970s 2nd wave feminism — which mutated into 2016 3rd wave feminism and a proto-form of authoritarian communism — any state group that has accomplished the goal of passing a Bill of Family Rights should disperse immediately afterward.          
&amp;nbsp;

Like Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus and President George Washington once the objective has been obtained it is time to step down from influence and go back to the farm. That is how we stand as a symbol to future generations of men, to serve the greater good of Western society, and to uphold the principals of civic virtue.          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**LESSONS LEARNED:**          
&amp;nbsp;

**1. Form state teams. Start with the largest economies first: CA, TX, NY, and FL. Review their state legislatures on the wiki pages:**

&amp;nbsp;

**2. Create a list of donors for every state House Representative, state Senator, and state Governor. Votesmart.org, Ballotpedia.org, and Followthemoney.org list their donors.**          
&amp;nbsp;

**3. Avoid the limelight and stay private. Network with each other, the state lawmakers, and donors behind closed doors.**          
&amp;nbsp;

**4. My recommended changes to the law are provided below in the comments section.**          
&amp;nbsp;

**5. Disperse once the Bill of Family Rights is implemented in your state.**

(X-post /r/sfr4r)",Brindican,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/6xd7zi/23_m4f_south_bay_california_chat_coffee_and_dates/,"I moved to the South Bay just over a year ago for work. I grew up in Massachusetts and went to school in Boston. I was lucky enough to have plenty of friends come over for internships and work, but recently they've all disappeared into their work, moved further away or gone back to school. This has left me kind of lonely and being the awkward nerd that I am, I've turned to the internet for companionship! I'm hoping to meet some new people, get to know them through messages and maybe calls and see where things go from there.

About me - 5'11 Brunette - Half British, half Indian (not that you can tell) - full disclosure I am on the heavier side, not morbidly obese, but definitely not fit. Working it off slowly though. - I'm a programmer (go figure) - I try to be an open book, so anything you want to know, (not my bank accounts, mothers maiden name, passwords :P) just ask!

Likes - Video games (ps4 and occasionally Nintendo, sorry PC master race) - TV/Movies/Anime (Rick and Morty, Steven Universe, DC and Marvel movies/shows, Psycho-Pass, etc.) - Food! (Trying to eat healthier, but doesn't mean I have to sacrifice flavor) - Reading (sci fi, fantasy, science-y non-fiction) - Going to pretty places and taking pictures with my drone - 420 friendly (chill and listen to music) - Chatting about cool science things and trying to sound profound about the universe (more often than not as a result of the previous like :) ) - Cuddles - I do drink and happy to go to a bar, but I prefer coffee

TL;DR Hit me up if you want to chat with a nerdy, British panda."

So without further ado, take a look at this week's update! We are all very appreciative of /u/MurphD for helping assemble this week's update! 

______________________________________

**BAT Now Supported on the Uphold Platform**

Today we are announcing that the support of BAT within the Uphold platform is live. Uphold members can hold, send, receive, and convert BAT into many fiat and crypto-currencies that Uphold supports. BAT is supported in Uphold’s Tier 3 reserve (others T3s are ETH, BTC and LTC).

If you are new to Uphold, you simply need to create a free Uphold account (available worldwide) to get started. You can securely hold your BAT, or place your holdings in any number of currencies by creating new cards in your wallet. More details are available via Uphold’s how it works section.

We are excited about this integration, and look forward to the next step of Uphold’s support for BAT. Brave users will soon be able to set up accounts with Uphold, fund their wallets via a variety of currencies, and contribute to content producers. Publishers, as well, will soon be able to establish an Uphold account, receive BAT, and automatically convert it into fiat currency. Uphold’s support of BAT will increase its accessibility, thus enhancing its utility within the digital advertising and services platform. ([Blog here](https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-now-supported-on-the-uphold-platform/).)

**Brave expands its leadership team with Ben Livshits as Chief Scientist and David Temkin as Chief Product Officer**

We’re excited to welcome Dr. Ben Livshits as Chief Scientist and David Temkin as Chief Product Officer to our 30-member staff. Ben and David are critical additions as the team integrates the Basic Attention Token and the Brave browser. This includes the roll out of BAT Mercury and the full development of the BAT platform. Both report to Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO, and work closely with Brian Bondy, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer; Brian Brown, Chief Business Officer; and Yan Zhu, Chief Information Security Officer.

**Weekly BAT Regional Leader Spotlight Interview (with Viking Karwur of BAT Indonesia)** 

*When did you hear about Brave/BAT, and what got you motivated to help out?*

&gt;“For Brave, it was in early January 2016 — when I heard that my friend from Mozilla, Brendan Eich’s new startup had released a developer preview of Brave... Then I contacted Brendan Eich, and said that I want to bring the Brave Browser &amp; Brave project to Indonesia. I believe that Brave will become a ""Game Changer,"" especially in Indonesia.”

*Why would BAT/Brave be a good thing for Indonesia, or why do you think BAT would be a great fit for people in Indonesia*

&gt;“Brendan Eich had once said: ""We need to fix the web together."" In Indonesia, we are in need of another alternative in terms of Internet browsers, because basically the users need options and they are free to use for their benefit. Users in Indonesia need to be introduced to internet browsers like ""Brave"", which has innovation with BAT integration where Users benefit.

&gt;Here is some information I got from one of the leading newspapers in Indonesia: ""The survey, conducted throughout 2016, found 132.7 million Indonesians have been connected to the internet, with a total population of 256.2 million.""

&gt;The problem of ads that disturb the experience of surfing the Internet requires a real solution. The ""Brave Browser"" and the ""BAT"" project will provide [solutions] that will benefit all parties. Looking at the real thing above, I personally very sure if the project ""Brave Browser"" and ""BAT"" will be successful in Indonesia. But it takes hard work to make it happen.”

*What are some future initiatives you hope to put in place?*
 
&gt;“There are several things that I think about in developing more BAT users in Indonesia. BAT Indonesia community will have a leadership structure with special tasks. Continue to socialize about the presence of BAT Indonesia Community in several big cities in Indonesia. Supporting the establishment of an IndoBAT City Chapter in major cities, and done gradually. Continuing to educate new users about everything about BAT. Use all lines of communication and social media to share information and all BAT activities in Indonesia. Cooperating with the information technology community in Indonesia. Of course all that I can do with full support from BAT.”

6xg6lo,45,2017-09-01,Career fair advice( X-post from r/engineeringstudents ),thekid2009,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/6xg6lo/career_fair_advice_xpost_from_rengineeringstudents/,"Hi all, As a recent grad, I've been through my fair share of career fairs and have a lot of experience/advice that I would love to share with other students. I wrote this article in the hopes that it would reach someone who, like me, struggled in their search for their first or next internship.


**Introduction**

Invoking the words 'career fair' or 'internship fair' to an engineering student can evoke a number of emotions: dread, fear, resignation. I haven't met a single colleague or classmate who has actively looked forward to a campus career fair, and for fair reason. At UCLA, fall career fairs have often consisted of thousands of students, dressed in business formal, packing into a hot ballroom and waiting sometimes up to an hour for a 30-second pitch.
At the same time, most engineering students are familiar with the black hole of applying online: you upload your resume and then never hear back. A quick Google search shows that up to 85% of jobs are filled through networking. Career fairs are the most efficient way to convert applications to interviews: all the benefits of networking sans small talk.
As an undergraduate with an unremarkable resume, I found few successes with online applications. The only interviews I ever received were through the career fairs and info-sessions; I believe having the right credentials is 20% of the battle, with the other 80% of the battle selling yourself and your skill-set. Following this rubric didn’t mean I had offers falling in my lap, but it at least got me past the recruiter and landed me phone interviews with Northrop Grumman, Ball Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, L-3, and SSL. And it can for you, too!
Note that this is not the definitive way to navigate career fairs or develop a pitch: this is just my experience. Nevertheless, I hope you find something useful in the following article.


**The Salesperson’s Mindset**

I want to take a second to talk about the mindset of the pitch. All of the companies in attendance are looking to make an investment. You are both the salesperson and the product, but at career fairs, you have companies receiving hundreds of proposals and all the products are (at least at the undergraduate level) more or less the same. At this scale, the key differentiating quality is your communication skills. Summed up in a few words: keep it relevant, and keep it concise.
Relevance is extremely important: every single sentence should relate back to the company’s immediate needs. It’s okay not to have a perfectly-aligned resume for an internship; most student projects/research groups involve soft skills like cross-disciplinary work, client management, multi-tasking, etc. All of these are marketable and relevant – you just have to sell it!
Along the same lines, concision is absolutely critical. Your pitch is an highlight reel, not a comprehensive presentation. It’s not essential to stick to 30 seconds – feel free to go a little over, but the longer you talk, the longer you run the risk of losing the recruiter. If the recruiter starts looking bored or trying to interrupt, that’s your signal to cut it short.


**Preparation**

Too many students come in a superficial view of the company’s goals, products and business areas. This is my tried-and-true method of doing my research prior to the fair:

1. Narrow the list of companies down to 5-8 based on your preferred interest and the company’s hiring availability. I would recommend doing this a couple days before the fair, because often companies will post their internship listings just prior to the fair. (One career fair, I did my research the morning of the fair, and noticed that L-3 had posted an internship requisition that very morning, which I noted. Later that afternoon, when I spoke with the L-3 rep, I mentioned I was interested in that position. Would you believe that she was the one who had posted it the day before? That turned out to be my first interview!)

2. From those 5-8 companies, jot down on a notepad the following for each company: biggest company events in the last 6 months, core product lines (typically 3-4 most relevant to you and 1-2 products per platform) and jobs you are interested in. This information is critical as it will be what you to refer to in your post-pitch chat.

3. Apply for at least one of those jobs per company! This is critical – recruiters love to hear that you’ve already applied. It shows initiative, and seeing as many companies hold interviews take place just a few days after, it leaves a good impression.


**Making the most of those 2 minutes with the recruiter**

So, you’ve made it to your career fair, and you’re waiting in a long line to get your chance to talk to Google or Lockheed Martin. Now I’ll walk you through an example of a pitch I’ve given and why (I think) it’s worked. This was for a Systems Engineering position that Boeing posted a while back that wanted candidates with MATLAB competency, as well as some experience working in integration and testing of aerospace systems.
Hi, my name is John Doe, I’m a fourth-year aerospace engineering student, and I would love to talk to you about your Systems Engineering position.
Don’t forget your fundamentals: open with a strong handshake, a smile, good posture, and a quick 5-second introduction about who you are and what you’re interested in.
In terms of my relevant background, at my internship at [Aerospace Company], my role spanned test, evaluation and integration of MEMS devices. I was responsible for setting up and executing high-temperature tests on gyroscopes, as well as examining the test data and writing brief reports for our client.
I also worked as the trajectory engineer on my rocketry capstone project where I focused on developing a trajectory analysis algorithm. The algorithm was used to generate velocity and altitude plots of our rocket based on unique flight conditions: initial angle-of-attack, drag coefficients, payload and launch mass, etc.
This is the meat of your pitch. This is where you discuss how their current needs align with your skillset. Even if your entire resume is a good fit, stick with 2, 3 items tops and focus on your highlights and responsibilities. Don’t worry if you can’t cover every little detail - if they’re interested in other items or would like follow-up on a specific resume item, the recruiter will ask you.
In my experience, recruiters place importance on internships, then hands-on projects, then research, and finally leadership experience. As an underclassman, you might be relying more on hands-on projects and leadership experience, which is fine – just sell it!
I think the combination of my internship experience and the work on my spacecraft design project make me a strong candidate for your position.
This closing line slightly alludes to what I mentioned earlier about aligning yourself to their needs.
Be cognizant of who you are talking to. If you are talking to a chief engineer, or a project manager, feel free to dive into a little more technical detail during your pitch but keep it brief. But if you’re talking to an HR rep, keep the technical details at a high-level because you don’t want to lose them with technical details. Along the same lines, don’t be afraid to add a little personality! These recruiters listen to hundreds of pitches a day so play your personality up. If you are a jokester, make a couple jokes. If you’re passionate about a certain project, let that passion show.
You might be wondering why you needed to do all that research prior to the fair if your pitch covers only your background and a job position. You need the company information for the follow-up questions, where the recruiter will likely dig past the rehearsed pitch. It's very common to be asked ""What do you know about our company?"" as one of the first follow-up questions to the pitch, and this is where most students falter, as they have scant understanding of what the company does. This is really where you can shine as a candidate and move yourself into interview consideration, if you can align the company’s direction and competencies with your resume.


**Post-Career Fair**

Congratulations! You made it through the most difficult part of the career fair process, and your work is almost done.
If a recruiter tells you to apply online, that does not mean your effort is wasted! Quite the contrary – many companies, especially in the aerospace industry, require candidates to submit an application online before they can be considered for any position. To be clear: You cannot be considered for an internship without having submitted an online application! For example, I have been told after a pitch to the LinQuest Corporation to apply online, and not 24 hours after my online application did I get an email from the company requesting a phone interview. Make that online application your #1 priority!
If you managed to procure any business cards, follow up with the recruiter especially if you feel good about your pitch. As with any professional correspondence, keep the email brief and to the point!


**Conclusion**

Career fairs are not easy. You will sound awkward, you will slip, you might mispronounce the company name, or even accidentally refer to them by another company name (likely why I got nowhere with AeroVironment). What you have just read ahead may not be your style; maybe you prefer applying online. However, in my opinion, career fairs are the most efficient use of your time and a much-faster way to get your resume to the decision-makers. I hope that you found this article helpful, and if you have any questions feel free to reach out! I wish you all the best of luck on your professional ventures!"
6xg7ej,2,2017-09-01,20M4M New Prompt - Slutty birthday surprise. More prompts inside for you kinky dominant tops!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6xg7ej/20m4m_new_prompt_slutty_birthday_surprise_more/,"Hi, Hello there anyone reading this post. To start with I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read what I've written.


 I am a short slender bodied guy with a nice ass to contrast my skinny frame. there are so many options and paths within these scenes I hope you get the opportunity to explore them with me! I'm a total sub/bottom. Kinks and fetishes aside, what I enjoy the most is arousing my partner, so I'm confident that if we share interests, we'll be able to have a lot of fun together.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


**Cleaner - New Slut**

Your partner knew what you liked. You weren't a couple to hide things from each other, you knew about her tendencies and she knew about your love for slim effeminate guys. A lifestyle you no longer indulge in because of this relationship. She enjoyed going out of her way to please you, so much so that the cleaner you hired was a twenty year old slim bubble butted guy for you to glance at occasionally. Your partner wanted to give you a special birthday present though...



Weeks of casual flirting left me swooned for your partner. Half my day was spent cleaning the drool i spilled thinking about her. She was a master with her words and managed to expose my deepest fantasies without much of a thought. Before long I was wearing her panties while i worked and she encouraged this lifestyle. Bringing me to a sexually tense tipping point where when she offered her plan to me I loved it and insisted I helped. 


Now...three days later I lie on your bed with my face down ass up waving in the air. My body smooth and a pair of panties wrapped around my knees. Your wife spent all day preparing my ass making it nice and lubed but still tight, practically dripping. My eyes blindfolded and my mouth gagged just for that kinky effect.


When you got home you read a message from your wife ""Happy Birthday! Pizza, Beer...Oh and a lubed up slut for you upstairs...have fun""

 
**Neighbour Scene**

I'm your petite neighbour. You first took notice of me one day when I was sun bathing in my garden. With the sunny haze you almost mistook my ass for a females until a gentle cloud cover came over. Your bedroom looked directly into mine and those nights where I forgot to close my curtains walking around naked exposing my ass unknowingly to you were good nights!


One day you spot me in my room squeezing in a buttplug before sliding jeans over my ass. 20 Minutes later you find me knocking on your door with very hot red cheeks ""I...I just locked myself out...can i use your phone?"" i say obviously concerned...probably cause of that faint vibrating noise.



**Spa Scene**


This spa was for rich men or anyone who had connections. After a lucky lotto ticket I had won a trip here and stood out like a sore thumb. The rooms happily filled with heat whether you fancied a mud bath, saunas or even just a massage it had it all. cocks hung freely and there was a strict no clothing policy. I felt intimidated given the magnitude of some of these cocks, little did I know many eyes were peeled on my ass for the majority of my first day.


When i got to my hotel room I wrapped a robe on and heard a knock at the door. ""A meal compliments of room 224"" the butler says with a smile pushing in a feast and closing the door for me. I am lying on my bed stuffed feeling an ego boost a few hours later when a knock arrives on my door again ""Did you enjoy?"" you shout. I open the door thanking you


**Party Mansion**


This mansion was immense and the party was insane. From Maths gurus to celebrities I feel like a bit of everyone was here. Me? Oh I was one of the waiters who did the 12-9 shift and now got the rest of the night to party with whoever.


My phone rang as I looked for an empty room in the mansion, I found one and climbed in closing the door ""Hey...yeah no its late tonight"" I say before you barged in with another guy both with your trousers at the ankles. I instantly hang up my phone and blush wondering how to react. I clear my throat appropriately, both sets of eyes look upon me as your partner whispers in your ear ""He is cute""



**Bosses Slut**


My cheeks kept getting redder and redder as your cock throbbed inside my mouth and throat. My jaw achingly hinged wide as you slowly pull out of my mouth finally letting me pant and gasp for air. slut imprinted on the collar that's wrapped around my neck tightly reminding me of my new role.


My internship was a disaster, Three strikes within the first three weeks which included breaking the backups. My ass clung to my trousers though and my shy attitude screamed future slut. So that's exactly what happened, halfway through a business trip now with my lips thoroughly used what else can you claim?"

6xgmth,27,2017-09-01,I am a fucking failure.,AngryAsian94,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6xgmth/i_am_a_fucking_failure/,"I am a fucking failure.

You read that right. I am not writing this for attention. Or for someone to say, ""There there, it's going to be okay.""

Because it's the truth.

I am a fucking failure. Everyone knows it. I know it.

I graduated from university last year. A top tier Canadian university where I studied business. Marketing, specifically. When I was graduating high school, I actually wanted to study English because well, I loved reading and I loved literature. But my family told me to pick business. ""Pick the safe route"", they said.

And so I did.
And I didn't regret it. I enjoyed my undergrad. Had a a few internships here and there where I did well. I even was recognized as top intern at one company. Even landed an internship at one of the Big Four accounting firms where I did reasonably well.

Yet, when I was about to graduate, I still couldn't find a job. I set out to and spent hours each week trying to find a job. I don't know how many damn hours I spent rewriting my resume and cover letter, catering them to each role and company. I even hired a professional resume writer to help me out there.

I went away the summer I graduated to work a military contract in another city. It was a stressful job but keeping in touch with my girlfriend helped keep me sane. She was my sole source of comfort when I was feeling down and shitty about my luck. She was my shelter.

That is, until I found out she cheated on me at a party. Imagine that. My best fucking friend cheated on me. And she didn't regret it, apparently.

It still bothers me to this day. Reading those messages. My depression and anxiety got to me. At the end of the summer, I was 120 pounds. I had lost 25 pounds in just one month.

The past year has been the worst year in my life. I think that in the past year, I've sent out maybe over 100 applications. I think I've had 5 interviews in total in that time frame.

But you know what? I did eventually end up getting a job. Through a family referral. But take this in. It was a job I was 100% unqualified for. Accounting. Like, what the fuck.

The job offered decent money but it wasn't a job that I gave a fuck about because it was a in a field that I didn't care for or was even qualified for. Do you know how much that bothers me, given how many hours I spent on applications for jobs which I did feel I was qualified for?

Trash. That's what it made me feel like.

At first, I threw everything I had into my job. I thought, ""I got this job through a family friend. I gotta make her proud.""

But then, my anxiety and depression started rearing up again. They were compounded even more by the late hours I was working. I wasn't happy. I didn't feel like I was living. And I guess my seniors could tell, because I was laid off in May.  guess it was evident that I just didn't care much for my job.

I've been job-seeking ever since. And it fucking sucks. I would say it's humbling, but it goes far beyond that. The process makes me feel like I am fucking worthless. Everyday feels like a pain in the ass to wake up. To get out of bed. To brush my teeth. There are days where the person I hated the most in the world sometimes is the person looking back at me in the mirror.

It all exploded when I came downstairs one day to eat some yogurt for breakfast. My father and I have never had a good relationship but when he saw me eating, he flipped out on me, saying ""I ruined his life"" and that ""I don't deserve to eat.""

I don't cry much. Hell, I barely shed a tear when I found out my ex cheated on me. But I cried for almost an hour that day.

I am a fucking failure.

So who am I? I'm the guy who picked the safe route. And fucking failed in doing so. I'm the guy who can't figure out what the fuck to do with his life.
 
I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

I am a fucking failure.

But it's got to have that I-fucking-want-you-right-now quality to it. I want that primal, urgent, unstoppable lust.

As you may have guessed, these are the rantings of an unfulfilled married man. Everyone wants what they can't have, and for me right now that's passion. So instead I fantasize about meeting the intern in that dark hallway behind the break room, or hate-fucking the bitchy supervisor who loves to show off her tight little body. There comes a point where that's not enough anymore, though.

What I'm looking for: An online friend with benefits. I want to talk about every dirty little thing under the sun. I want to tease you until you can't help but sneak away to the bathroom. I want to swap dirty pictures and audio and video (if you're game for that). But you can't have the benefits without the friend. Bitch about your boss and then we can fantasize about what it would be like to fuck in his office and make a mess of the place. I'll complain about my lack of sleep and you can tell me how you would make me look forward to waking up in the morning.

This is maybe starting to sound more like an online relationship, but that's not really it. I'm just hoping for something casual and fun to take our minds off reality.

Who I'm looking for: If any of this sounds good, then it's probably you. Being married as well gets you bonus points (all the better to commiserate with). Being over 22 would be nice, but exceptions can be made. I don't care about race or body type, as long as you have that passion.

6xiohu,52,2017-09-01,Back when Molehill Ruined my Graduation Dinner,Anonnymoose73,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6xiohu/back_when_molehill_ruined_my_graduation_dinner/,"WHELP. Its 105 degrees out, I apparently hit a molotov squirrel and bust a tire (I swerved out of the way of the squirrel, and have no idea what I could have hit) and my car jack is mysteriously missing so now I have an hour to kill before roadside assistance arrives. This happened many years ago, but has been on my mind a lot lately. 

Both of my parents lie a lot. My dad is an N and lies for fun, which makes his lies more believable because why would you lie about what you ate for lunch or how many potatoes you bought? My mom lies to cover her ass and once you know she does that, it's easy to tell she's lying. Dad also spent years teasing/making fun of Molehill in front of other people, and she's not exactly great at taking things in stride. At this point they'd been divorced for about 8 years. 

I was finally graduating from college, which I was incredibly proud of. My parents got divorced and went bankrupt when I was 16, so I got very little help from them. I worked 2 or 3 jobs all 6 years (hard to graduate in 4 when you work so much), graduated magna cum laude, had an internship my last year in my chosen field and they were keeping me on full time after graduation (I still work there!). Graduation was a really big fucking deal to me, and I wanted both my parents there because education was a big deal in my family despite how they fucked me over. 

It stared first thing in the morning. My school was in Big City and most easily reached via public transport. For some reason Molehill was convinced that we would all die of thirst and stated packing in tons of water bottles in the backpack my best friend was going to carry. Water is heavy and I told her not to pack so many. It's a college campus; they have water. She kept insisting/packing anyway and I snapped and told her ""You're not in control!"" Major CBF. 

She sulked the entire way there. Some BEC stuff. She didn't like that one of the speakers cracked a joke at Jerry Falwell who'd just died.  She was uncomfortable around my girlfriend, and cold towards my dad. 

After the ceremony, we're headed back to the shuttle to take us to Public Transport System. Dad cracks some joke at Molehill's expense and a random lady hears and smiles. It was such a small thing I can't remember what he said, but I do remember it was referencing some story from when they were dating and it didn't make Molehill look bad at all. She was stewing anyway and snapped at him on the shuttle, which of course meant he cracked another joke and even more people heard (she always managed to walk right into it with him. He could play her anger to perfection). 

We get back to my house where the plan is that we change, rest a bit, then head out for celebration dinner. Molehill, instead, lets my sister out of her car, and then fucking peels out. I try to call her, no answer; sister tries, no answer. We wait a while and keep calling. She never answers. 

If I had the spine then that I have now, I would have said fuck her and lets go eat. Instead we waited.

Two hours later she still won't answer her phone, everyone is hungry, and sister and best friend decide to go to her hotel and see if they can get her. After a while she calls me and says that she's soooo sorry. She says she had terrible diarrhea and was too embarrassed to use our bathroom so she'd decided to leave for her hotel and she didn't answer her phone when I called because when she reached for it she accidentally ""flipped"" it into the back of the car. She says she's feeling better now and will meet us at the restaurant. It's such an obvious fucking lie. 

Best friend and sister come come, tell me Molehill was throwing a huge fucking tantrum -yelling, cursing, kicking stuff- but they calmed her down and she's on her way. 

Again, no spine. I was so used to her tantrums, it didn't even occur to me that I could tell her not to come. 

Dinner is fine. She tells her lie again to everyone and nobody buys it. Dad behaves himself. Afterward she pulls me aside to apologize again and give me the same lie. Dog bless me, a little shine appeared on my spine and I told her that sis and BF told me what really happened, and she flat out denied it. I'd never been so disgusted with her. After this, I went LC/VLC for years with her. 

She's never admitted the truth. I think she's actually convinced herself that she was sick and it was just a coincidence that she was angry at my dad also.

I realize that sounds pretty vanilla ... and is probably not actually a kink at all. But god help me nothing turns me on more than that hungry-eyed, lip-biting look. That desperation. That need. Plenty of kinks come from that. Cheating is thrilling, especially when there's the danger of getting caught. Public sex really gets my motor running, and not semi-public, I want an audience. But it's got to have that I-fucking-want-you-right-now quality to it. I want that primal, urgent, unstoppable lust.

As you may have guessed, these are the rantings of an unfulfilled married man. Everyone wants what they can't have, and for me right now that's passion. So instead I fantasize about meeting the intern in that dark hallway behind the break room, or hate-fucking the bitchy supervisor who loves to show off her tight little body. There comes a point where that's not enough anymore, though.

What I'm looking for: An online friend with benefits. I want to talk about every dirty little thing under the sun. I want to tease you until you can't help but sneak away to the bathroom. I want to swap dirty pictures and audio and video (if you're game for that). But you can't have the benefits without the friend. Bitch about your boss and then we can fantasize about what it would be like to fuck in his office and make a mess of the place. I'll complain about my lack of sleep and you can tell me how you would make me look forward to waking up in the morning.

This is maybe starting to sound more like an online relationship, but that's not really it. I'm just hoping for something casual and fun to take our minds off reality.

Who I'm looking for: If any of this sounds good, then it's probably you. Being married as well gets you bonus points (all the better to commiserate with). Being over 22 would be nice, but exceptions can be made. I don't care about race or body type, as long as you have that passion. Also, please understand that I could disappear for a day or two because of personal and professional responsibilities, and I'll extend you the same courtesy.

So hit me up and let's get to know each other. I'm good with reddit or google or kik, whichever you prefer.

Thanks for reading!"

**Part 7**
-

James had absolutely no damn clue where they were. He was grateful that Mathilda was not the fainting type. When Daisy managed to teleport them through space itself, he had not realized just how rural Mathilda lived. They drove almost forty minutes before James finally saw a few small buildings on the horizon. This part of Montana was flat, all plains and pine and that immense sky, as far as the eye could see.

The truck jostled Mathilda’s leg again. Her brow creased, barely. She drew the flask from her coat pocket and took a long healthy swig.

“How far is it to the rest of town?” James asked. They passed mostly grain silos and trailers, a low-slung and slanting bar, a wilting gas station. 

“Bout fifty minutes from here. An hour at most. I’m afraid we have to go to Billings. There’s no emergency room in Laurel.” 

“Jesus, at home if I drove for two hours I could almost hit Connecticut.”

Mathilda smiled out the window. She seemed pleasantly drunk, which made James feel a little better. “You know that’s not your home now, right Jimmy?”

“I don’t see what you mean.”

“It’s not like you can go back there.”

James bit his lip. He had been trying not to think about that. “I suppose.”

They drove the rest of the way in silence, until James could finally find a radio station that actually *worked*.

When they arrived in Billings, James only got out of the car for a moment. He ran inside the emergency room wearing one of Mathilda’s baseball caps, pulled as low as it could go without looking absurd. “Hey,” he said, “there’s some lady outside in a pickup truck. Said she broke her leg at her house. She lives way out, drove herself. She asked me to come get somebody.”

“Do you know her?”

“Naw,” he said, copying Mathilda’s intonation, “just passing by.”

The nurse nodded and sent someone out with a wheelchair.

James hurried away before the nurse could ask him any more questions. He kept his collar turned up and his eyes down as he went. He ended up just sitting in front of Mathilda’s truck for hours, grateful that the nurse who parked it for Mathilda had found a spot in the far back lot. No one was around to see James clamber into the back of it and lay down on his back to wait, unseen, until Mathilda came out at last.

He told himself to stay calm. That even if a camera had seen him, surely no one was checking all the way out here.

The empty consolation did not help.

The big break-through on the Trial 39 case came a full fifteen days after the girl and the scientist disappeared. 

After hours of pressuring and cajoling, Captain Baum finally allowed Anderson Hunt to use the experimental facial recognition software against the NSA’s record of all IP-connected security cameras, search warrants be damned. It was not technically legal, and in fifteen days, Hunt had not managed to dig up anything useful enough to justify overstepping the law. He had nearly resigned himself to a bellowing final lecture and a swift termination when one of the interns approached him late in the afternoon.

It was Saturday. Since Trial 39’s escape, no one in Anderson’s department had weekends until she was located and securely captured. One exhausted intern flopped a file folder on Hunt’s desk in the afternoon and sighed. “If this is that asshole Murdock can we all go home early?”

“Obviously not.” Hunt opened the file folder, already ready to scorn the intern for mistaking an obvious stranger for their runaway doctor. But then he paused. And stared. “*You* definitely can, however.” He jumped up from behind his desk and patted her shoulder so hard she nearly lost her balance. “You just saved my job, and—I honestly can’t remember your name.”

“Suzie,” she said, flatly.

“Suzie. Take the whole weekend,” he told her, and then he hurried down the hall for Captain Baum’s office.

***
After the first four hours, Daisy got tired of waiting. She decided to just walk to town and find them.

She did not have much more of a plan than that. Probably she could pick up a ride once she got to the highway. She could surprise Jim in Billings, make him look all scared and happy at once. If she couldn’t hitchhike her way there, she could always teleport herself back to Mathilda’s and pretend as if nothing had happened. 

So Daisy marched down the long gravel road leading to Mathilda’s little homestead. Mathilda’s massive dogs followed her closely after barking at her did not make her stop walking down the path. It turned out Jim wasn’t right in saying that Daisy could do *anything* she set her mind to. No matter how hard she tried to imagine she could understand the dogs, for example, their barks remained senseless to her. Maybe not even she could put words to a language without any words at all.

But at least they seemed to understand her. She could not force them to follow her if she tried. They were a pair of Anatolian brothers who, in Daisy’s esteem, seemed more thoughtful than many humans she had met. They flanked her as she wandered down the dirt road, feeling bold and brave. The dogs’ shoulders came up to her hips. She felt like a great warrior queen, on a mission in the wild with her trusty bear-dogs. Daisy coiled her fingers into their dense fur as they walked, because it was soft and made her feel strong.

Daisy stopped and picked up a huge stick off the side of the road for her staff. She would not be acting like such a child if anyone was around to see her but the dogs. For once she did not second-guess or over-think herself. The dogs continued through the grass, snuffling excitedly as they went, while Daisy stayed on the dusty drive. She traced lines in the earth alongside her footprints and pretended she was charting a path through an undiscovered land.

Jim had always been the only doctor who would play games with her. She always liked him for that. The other doctors were too afraid to give her physical materials, because she might combust it. And then when they did finally decide to try it with her she blew up their shit just for assuming she would in the first place. No. None of them understood her but Jim.

She wished she had just told him what she thought instead of getting angry when he couldn’t guess. But the way from her thoughts to her mouth was winding, and she lost almost all her words on the way. Jim should know that by now. He shouldn’t hold it against her.

Daisy smacked her forehead a couple of times to make herself stop obsessing. She looked up to see the dogs both staring intently down the road ahead of them, their hackles raising. The particles at the edges of their fur danced frenetically, as if they were about to charge into battle themselves.

Someone was coming up the road. It had only been a few hours. It couldn’t be Jim.

She waved a hand just as the dogs began to surge forward. “Sleep,” she hissed, and the dogs flopped  into each other, snoring. Daisy raised her palm and imagined them floating, and just like that they rose in a furry mass and floated into a thicket of raspberries, where they could not be seen from the road. The air began gently rippling in the distance, the low sine rumble of an engine her weak ears could not yet detect.

The forest surrounding the road was thick but patchy. Anywhere she hid felt too exposed. She could not dive from one tree to the next without being spotted. There was no brush to hide herself in. Just scattered pine trees, their branches too tall to even give her any coverage.

Daisy sprinted back, away from the road. Now she could hear the engine and the faint crunch of wheels tearing up gravel. Whoever was headed up the road was coming *fast*. She pulled an immense boulder out of the earth and hid behind it, panting hard, still clutching her stupid staff. She nearly threw it away until she heard the car come to a stop only a couple hundred yards away. 

She clutched her spear and tried to imagine being a tree. But her mind was racing too fast for her to truly relax. And such a form commanded total stillness,  like a breathless yoga pose in a dark room. She could not hold it, not out here, with the huge sky full of silver strings of sound, waving in the wind: car doors opening and closing and people, walking. Her blood boiled with fear. A thousand thoughts veered through her mind like dropped marbles. 

She ran a shuddering hand over the end of a her stick. It turned into a sharp and gleaming spearhead. 

Daisy clutched it to her chest and watched the soundwaves lap larger and larger overhead as the agents crept toward her.

6xjycs,43,2017-09-02,"Saintly Sharon and Wedding Planning Part 3: The Dress &amp; how the wedding is making her ""lose sleep""",ghostgirl16,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6xjycs/saintly_sharon_and_wedding_planning_part_3_the/,"Hello again llamas! I thought I'd share this last current story before sharing a few worse stories.

Quick cast recap:

Saintly Sharon: JustNOMom. Plenty of Narcissistic tendencies, but has some crazy etiquette stuff drilled into her head from another era and she manages to behave/put on a facade in front of others. Church secretary, kind to children and the homeless but a terror and controlling rage beast to her family.

(E)Dad: My often-enabling dad. He's a great guy, I have never met a harder working person. But he really lets Sharon run rampant.

S: Sister- studying in a medical-related field in college, still early in her degree process. She's financially beholden to Sharon &amp; EDad. She has the shortest temper of us and doesn't put up with Sharon. My maid of honor, honestly a badass. :)

B: Brother. In a branch of the military ROTC while finishing college. Moved out, leaving S and I to deal with Sharon.

FH: Also my age, graduating in December. He's very kind to me and has tolerated way more of Sharon's BS by now than anyone should be expected to. He has a promising job future via awesome college degree that he's worked his ass off for, but we just have to hang on until September to get free...

**The Dress**

* I had bought an inexpensive dress on sale because I originally planned for a simple wedding. Think ""Chiffon so GhostGirl doesn't sweat and can sit comfortably in September."" This didn't match Sharon's more glamorous idea, and since the idea of having an inexpensive wedding was out the window, *sigh* let's go get another dress... S drove me to a 45-minute away week long bridal sale. I was only expecting to get a veil or shoes, but lo and behold, there are ONLY dresses on sale so we just go with it. It was a sample sale, figured nothing would fit me- and then I find THE DRESS which fit me so awesomely and was the correct height with only minor adjustments. PERFECT. Everything else was made for 8 foot tall skinny amazons in my size, though the other sizes that were a little less common had more selection. Oh well.

* Given that I didn't PLAN on getting ""the dress,"" I did not bring mom. OOPS. Well, I wasn't going to leave it and go back and fetch her for someone else in this pretty common/picked-over size to snatch it up! So my sister fronted me the cash (cash-only sale) and we brought it home. Dad was in the area for work and actually drove over to quickly see me in it while S had me laced up, and he definitely approved. Said it looked ""elegant and classy""

* When we got home, Sharon CBF'd because we didn't take her. She was at work, so... Then I practically gave her the doe-eyes and asked if she wanted me to put it on and show her, my little starry-eyed ""oooh"" bride-to-be self that was excited because the most stressful part was over. Wrong again, GhostGirl! She said it could wait until after dinner, ok. So after dinner, I ask again and she sighs and says, FIIIIINE.

* Saintly Sharon just gives me this silent, stony face while I come in and twirl it and then S fastens the sleeves off-the-shoulder and it's so magical annnnnd... CBF. She just sits there, made me turn, and said nothing. UGH. FOR FUCK'S SAKE. Break my poor little heart. So I just shook my head, cried a little quietly and took off the dress with S's help. Then, from down the hall I hear...

Sharon: THAT DRESS ISN'T PURE WHITE! (Not a screech, but loud bitchy voice)

S: THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY PURE WHITE ONES, GEEZ. NOBODY LOOKS GOOD IN BLEACHED SNOW WHITE! IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD UNLESS YOU'RE TAN. GHOST GIRL IS PASTY, this looks WAY better on her.

Dad: It's fine, Sharon. It looks really classic, like from the thirties, anyway. It's a nice dress. I like the style.

To passively get even and take ownership of the dress choosing even though she was so cold to me about it, before I could go and withdraw $100 to pay sis back (yup! Good sale!), SHE FUCKING PAID MY SISTER FOR IT BEHIND MY BACK. S told me about it and I was LIVID. There's a lot about this wedding that I won't remember fondly, no matter how things may be pleasant at times between us.


**Sharon claims the wedding is making her ""lose sleep""**

* I hate phone calling people. It's just one of those awkward things that makes me feel awkward and I avoid it. Plus, I had (long internship commitment in order to graduate) in my field of degree and I finished in May, so finally had time to start doing this shit. Each day Sharon gave me a list of 5 different vendors/people we know to call and get pricing/talk about menus/schedule appointments, etc. If I forgot one during the day, she would screech at me that I'm causing her to lose sleep because I'm not doing stuff and it won't be ready for the wedding. This included the hair/makeup booking, which, on my part, was a bit late, but that was because I had to keep asking bridesmaids for a final count on hair and what kind of makeup and some people changed their minds.

* Sharon planned THIS HUGE ASS BRIDAL SHOWER which was very nice, but so elaborate that I'm not surprised it took her a month of shopping and stuff to pull it together. She was so tired every night and stayed up so late that I swear she's probably averaged 4 hours of sleep plus a separate ~1 hour nap each night. Unfortunately, I can't show pics because they'd give away too much info, but I can describe the ridiculousness (deliciousness) in this menu for 60 guests:

2 egg bakes, yoghurt bar w/ 8 toppings, assortment of donut holes (with sprinkles! That was its own shopping odyssey...), 8 pounds of bacon, giant batch of sausage &amp; gravy and biscuits, a fluff dessert, a giant batch of punch, a coffee bar and the keurig we had to haul to that place, 8 flavors of liquid coffee flavors, fruit salad, actual salad with raisins/stuff on it, 3 boxes of fancy desserts from a catering place (scones/stuff), cheese and crackers, and a few flavors of mini muffins in a big arrangement.

This menu was literally like Pinterest threw up on the bridal shower. Tasty, but so much work! So much work that I got CBF and screeching on the phone if I said I was going to go spend time with FH. ""You can see him later you need to help me with the planning/gift bags/cooking/etc.""

Well, that's most of the drama. Again, I have some bitter feelings about the wedding setup because of the perception that she is using my wedding as a ""nah, nah"" tongue-stickingk-out at my relatives for how they raised their kids. I'm no saintly child. The whole idea that you should compete with your siblings as a parent is ridiculous and just makes me shake my head. BUT, FH and I really love each other and no matter what, that day I'm going to look my best for him and smile like an idiot and be so happy and S has my back. 

**EDIT:** One last bit of drama. SHARON elbowed her way in on arranging for our hotel stay for two nights in a nearby town on our wedding night &amp; night after! FH's kinda poor but so wonderfully thoughtful grandma wanted to offer us a motel booking for two nights because she could afford that, but she happened to call Sharon about something and Sharon bullied poor grandma into booking us a fancier hotel for the two nights. UGH! And I wanted Sharon to not know which hotel we were staying at... -_-"

What should I do?,butiswearimnot,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6xk449/my_friends_22m_girlfriend_21f_thinks_that_he_is/,"This summer I moved to a small town with a bunch of other people my age to do a summer internship. As the summer has progressed, I've become very good friends with one of my coworkers, Cole. We really clicked as friends and are now close friends, but we do not have any sort of feelings whatsoever for each other. I'm somewhat tom-boyish and he is kind of a bro and we are very much not interested in each other's type. Cole also has a long-term girlfriend, Liz, who I've met before when she came to visit him over the summer. I got on really well with her and she was super cool. I even told Cole multiple times how much I really liked her. 

Anyway, Cole is leaving our internship in a few days and we've made arrangements (along with another coworker of ours) to visit Cole in California (where he is from) in November. Unfortunately, over the past two or three weeks, Liz has made some accusations that Cole is cheating on her with me.

Cole and I work together a lot, so I'm with him a lot when Liz is texting him or I get featured in his snapchat stories. Whatever. Well, she started making small comments like, ""oh, I see you're hanging out with her again"" and stuff like that. Cole brushed it off and said that she was drunk or feeling insecure and told me not to worry about it. But just tonight, when I was working with him again, she saw I was with him (AT WORK) and flipped out, essentially full-blown accusing him of cheating on her with me, which he is obviously horrified at and is defending himself.

My problem is that I'm REALLY uncomfortable with the idea that she hates me and the fact that I've booked tickets to go and see him in November. I should mention Liz essentially lives with him too. But at the same time I'm really sad at the idea that I would cancel because his gf is making crazy accusations and I feel like I shouldn't give into her insecurity like that. 

Should I tell Cole that I'm uncomfortable with visiting him if his girlfriend actually thinks this, or should I wait it out and see how it blows over?

  **tl;dr**: Friend's gf thinks I'm the other woman. While I'm most definitely not, I have booked a flight to visit him in November and now I'm second guessing if I should go. What should I do?"

So, he sent Jon and Jon's nephew Howland to rent out a few lodging buildings that connected to each other. Knowing well that the Warden of the North would need the largest room out of respect. He wanted the North to know he cared for all them plus safer in numbers and people you trust.

""Lord we found and paid for the lodging tho it was a big hit to our coffers"" Howland informed Alester while he had his men move his stuff to the new lodging. ""What is the name of this place?"" Alester asked the young Howland ""The Sleeping Wolf my Lord"" He grinned fitting for the North.

""Get the men up, pay the inn keeper, and send out the information to the other Northerners!"" He command Jon and Howland who intern nodded.

Alester had his men place his thing which wasn't much in the room west of the lodging building. In the North Ironrath is in the west. The Guards station themselves around the building with a few in front to welcome any Northern Lord or Lady that came. Alester walked into the small garden that this place kept. It had reminded him of his godswood back in Ironrath. He took a seat on the ground and took WhiteIron the great sword of his house. He slowly polished the blade and sharpen it. Calming the sound of sharpening metal is to him, finding peace in it. As he finished he rested his sword's hilt on his right shoulder, as the wielder of this great sword felt the hilt lay on his shoulder. A feeling of security and home washed over him like a cleansing steam.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Howland Redsword just watched over his Lord's sleeping form. Howland is young around 17 had the features like his family with the black hair with some red here and there with the reddish colored eyes which from a far it just look like a red brown. After some time maybe a hour or so Alester rejoined the living. ""Howland how long was I out?"" He ran his hand though his hair find it loosen so tired it back again. ""A hour my Lord"" Alester nodded as he picked up WhiteIron and handing it to one of his guards who returned to their Lord's room. 

""Follow Howland"" he commanded as he looked around the lodging his gold paid for it was a very large network of buildings that connected to each other with arches over the walk paths. It seem well maintained by the owners as he was inform this Inn as been around for sometime. The Forrester Guards bowed when they saw their Lord which Alester acknowledged them with a nod, these men were the one who fought along side him during the Battle of Frost all those year ago. He still held dreams of this event in his mind. He had reformed the closer bannermen to him that always accompanied him when he traveled. He had them wear helmets they covered most of their faces and plate armor on their arms, legs, around the neck but kept the Northern standard armor for the body. They had a small shield like badge on their right shoulder with the insignia of House Forrester so someone who is informed enough knew that they are his men. 

King's Landing the Capital for Seven Kingdoms. Alester thought upon for a moment while walking slowly to his own room. ""Always thinking my father used to say"" he said to no none particularly as he changed from his travel clothes to as his sisters said 'More Noble Fitting Clothes' he dressed in the long coat that held the House Forrester insignia on the body of the coat. Putting on a pair of boots and trousers that were colored black and white, the shirt was simple just white to finish he took the Ring of Ironrath which held a family crest of the Forrester House.

6xmm61,8,2017-09-02,How did you learn Exchange?,youhearcrickets,exchangeserver,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchangeserver/comments/6xmm61/how_did_you_learn_exchange/,"So at my most recent internship, I was really surprised by what a 'server' actually is.

So the IT help desk was out sourced, but of course there was an internal IT dept. 

Internal IT manages everything, but so does the help desk, so IT isn't doing tedious crap like password resets and showing people how to set their default browser. 

So upon further training to help out, I was really shocked to see that MS sql server actual has a UI and a bunch of tables too! I was asked to do a simple query on it and the code i drafted gave the sys admin exactly what he wanted (he was just trying to give me practice is all), then exchange server also had a UI, and basic functions don't seem to be complicated at all (on the surface for what I was doing at least, not too familiar with all the capabilities) for some reason I felt like the server was just a block of code. 

So, just wondering, how did you learn Exchange Server? Are certifications really required? Or could I just gain more and more experience to compensate for no certs. I already have done Sharepoint site dev and infopath to workflow basic automation stuff and I strangely enjoyed it. 

Edit: Wow, these replies are great! Thanks! "

I have a Bachelor's in business before I joined the program and only did simple SQL work - self taught - in my last job.  I've obviously done schoolwork in Python and R, but it became apparent when the training wheels came off and I was faced with a blank screen that there was much I didn't know.


What concepts, methods, best practices are fundamental to learn to become proficient in Python/R, or better yet, give me the ability to pick up any language I may need in the future.  

Thanks!"
6xnigd,10,2017-09-02,Supplementing Kayla's BBG with lifting/other suggestions? Need help reaching my fitness goals.,parkourdeer,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/6xnigd/supplementing_kaylas_bbg_with_liftingother/,"Hi everyone! So I think this post might end up a bit long and messy but I'll try to keep it as concise as possible—basically, I'm not sure how to keep up with my fitness goals while I'm at university, so I'm trying to figure out a good routine.

Fitness goals: I want to tone up to look slimmer, build a butt (preferably without bulking up my legs, which I feel kind of shitty/superficial for saying but hopefully y'all don't think I'm terrible or something), and also burn some stubborn fat (although I think this is lowest priority on my list). 

Background: Up until last summer, I basically never exercised. I played water polo for a few years in middle school and also swam in the spring for my high school team, but other than that I refused to move my body almost entirely. I was never overweight but every time I was off season I think my muscle would become loose or unused and felt flabby. Then, I got a pretty good internship at a company with a free gym and felt like I should take advantage of everything, so I started working out there, running on the treadmill every day and doing a class called ""metabolic challenge"" once a week. After I went back to school, I didn't like the thought of working out in the school gym so I started doing the Blogilates monthly calendar. I returned to my internship in the summer and did the metabolic challenge weekly again, tried a beginner's crossfit class (twice a week for four weeks, never lifted more than the training bar), did one personal training session weekly that involved some weights (but I wouldn't say it was heavy lifting? Stuff like dumbell chest presses and kettle bell swings), and then did the treadmill on days where I didn't have any other fitness classes. Other than the examples mentioned here, I've not done very much work with lifting.

Now: I'm really sick of Blogilates (I don't know why) and it doesn't feel like nearly as good of a workout as running on the treadmill (which I hate) or any of the weightlifting I did with my PT. I feel like I got into pretty good shape this summer, and did a good amount of work towards my fitness goals. I'm considering several options, but also really want to be able to do most of my workouts from home, which brought me to BBG. I met a girl at the gym during my internship who did that, supplemented with some lifting. So, I'm thinking of doing BBG 3x a week like she recommends in the first guide, and then lifting 2x/week on the weekdays that I'm not doing BBG. However, I don't really know where to get started with this. I have also considered Strong Curves, but to my knowledge that also needs to be done 3x/week? I could do 6 days/week of working out, but was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions. In general, I still feel like a total beginner at all of this and like I don't really know what I'm doing, so I have no idea where to get started on shifting away from Blogilates (e.g. how to work out in a balanced way, what workouts to do, how much is too much, how do you even do the workout thing, etc).

I really want to start lifting since it's probably the best way to tone up, but also think I need to do more cardio to get rid of some stubborn fat on my tummy (I think most people wouldn't notice it, but I do and it really upsets me), which is why I'm thinking to mix BBG with lifting. I know that a lot of people think BBG isn't worth it for the price, but the girl I met at the gym sent me the guides so I'm not really worried about that!

ANYWAY I guess my main questions would be:

* How should I supplement BBG to best suit my goals?
* Alternatively, what experience do other people have with BBG and how did they supplement it, if at all?
* Do I even need BBG? Should I only be lifting instead? If so, what are some recommended programs/routines for this?
* Any other suggestions (don't have to include BBG at all; I'm really just open to anything)?

Thanks so much, and sorry for the long post/being a total newb!"

I work retail at a very small business; only one employee works at a time so I never have coworkers in the building with me.  I'm 5'2"" F and even though I'm 20, I look way younger.  

I get male customers that make me uncomfortable in here ALL of the time.  Most of the time it's just compliments and flirty comments which isn't the worst but I'm just trying to do my job and in general I don't like it.  Other times it's guys asking me ""what time I get out"" or standing at the counter holding up the line to flirt.  That or they linger at the door and won't leave.  I've had guys be incredibly persistent about getting me alone. 

I've told my manager and my boss (both ladies) about these instances and they basically just tell me to suck it up and try to flirt with them into buying stuff. 

I'm planning on getting a new job as soon as possible but I'm a full time college student with an internship so it's very difficult to find someone who'll take me with my availability. I'm stuck here in the mean time.  

Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated!"
6xom51,27,2017-09-02,1st major scary encounter,[deleted],Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/6xom51/1st_major_scary_encounter/,"I went on a marine biology trip with my high school.  Graduating seniors (myself and some of the others and few partnering area schools to cut cost, the more that went the less it cost) and the class just under us were the only ones allowed to go on the trip.  It was a 10 day field study program that we had to sign up for as freshmen and would make payments for 3 years as it cost a lot of money especially if you got S.U.B.A. certified like I did.  
Around the 2nd night there I was in my cabin (boys were on one side of the common/cafeteria cabin and boys on the other to limit the late night escapades) asleep and was suddenly woke up by what sounded like someone opening up the screen door but I didn’t hear them get in the very squeaky bunks (Salt water breezes and metal springs don’t mix well.  So I wake up and something doesn’t feel right I don’t hear the toilet or a bed and I get this overwhelming sense of fear like I want to pee myself I’m so scared.  It wasn’t sleep paralysis I could move I remember rolling onto my side that faced the wall were I saw the largest roach that I had ever seen in my life.  I was wide wake, senses heightened and I could hear the distinct sound of the other 5 guys in my cabin sleeping/snoring etc.  I could make out all five different sounds.  I could just feel that there was something evil behind me with my back turned to it, I could hear very light footsteps on the wooden floor of the cabin.  I could hear it, the room felt heavy like the air got heavy like a spike in humidity but we were right on the beach so there was always a breeze I could hear the waves outside about 20 meters from our door.  
I stayed like that wide awake for what seemed like hours I watched the sun start to come into the room against the wall then just as before I heard the door open again and close.  The feeling of evil was gone, the air was light and somewhat cooler all of a sudden.  I rolled over and got out of bed and sure as shit all of the guys I was bunked with were asleep in their bunks.  I turned to the door to see if maybe the wind had caused it to bang open and that my imagination didn’t mess with me.  That is when I knew that something was in this area that we were in.  The screen door was latched shut even thought I know I heard it open and shut just a few minutes earlier.  

I went outside and one of the teachers on the trip was out in the sand doing some pushups he was also one of my football coaches and I asked him how long he had been out here he said about 20 minutes that he watched the sunrise and was getting in a light work out before the day started he asked be why and I asked him is any of the guys in my bunk was just out here like five minutes ago.  He said that the only person he had saw was the guy in charge of the whole trip but he when jogging toward the entrance of the camping area like he does every morning.  

About an hour later everyone else starts to get up to go on the daily morning dive for the suba divers.  Someone asked me if slept last night and I told them not very well.  I asked all the guys in my bunk as they were getting ready for the dive if they got up last night (divers were grouped together so we didn’t wake other up as we got up about sunrise each day).  They all said no and one guy “jay” asked me if had gone out in the middle of the night because he heard the door open but went back to sleep after that.  One of the girls came up to me and asked me if I had saw anything last night.  I told her no but I could feel something that it felt evil and that it came in our cabin around 3-4am.  She told me that last night she woke up in the middle of the night and saw a guy in the corner of her cabin and told “john” to get out that he shouldn’t be in here and that she was going to tell Mr.” W “(the guy in charge of us students).  She said that it didn’t move then she told me that she felt scared like she had never been scared before like a feeling of pure evil was just pouring out of that corner and she started to scream at it and woke her hole cabin up and one of the counselors came over because she had woke him up and he was about 10 meters away in the counselor cabin.   All the other girls in the cabin were awake and telling “john” to get out so they all said that they saw something but where not as scared as the first girl (john was her boyfriend and was on the trip with us and was known for being a joker).

The next night the counselors and some of the locals that worked there told us of the experiences that they had all had each one had something different.  Some were terrifying and told of one that caused one of the counselors to leave the camp and fail his internship (all the counselors where marine biology grad students and where there to learn just like we were the director of the camp was the main marine biologist and in charge of the grad students).  They said that there is defiantly something that is around here but it only comes around every once and awhile.

6xost1,158,2017-09-02,How getting fired from a grocery store job for failing a pot test led me to my future career.,notcarlton,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/6xost1/how_getting_fired_from_a_grocery_store_job_for/,"As per request from a few ents on a meme form earlier today. 

In February of 2015 I was a broke college student. I spent way too much money on weed. I needed a job so I applied as entry level baker.

I thought fuck it, I'm nice, talking to people is easy and I'll get to bake bread. When applying I online I saw the info about a drug test. I thought it a was a piss test and thought I was fine. One of my best friends was a bodybuilder and he had this stuff he used plenty of times that worked. My other homie had the hookup for fake dicks and fake pee. 

So I'm thinking: ""fuck it, I'm Gucci"".

I get a call for the interview. I go in and get the job. The lady looks at me and says great. ""Well just need a drug test.""

I'm like ""no problem when should I schedule the pee test and when will I take it""

""Oh no we do swab testing here"".

What the fuck. On the spot. In her office, I got swabbed. I had smoked a fuck ton the previous night. She has me sign my starting papers, gives me a date for training, and seems genuinely happy that I'm working there.

About a week later I had my first training. On the way to work I get a phone call from a random number and don't answer it. Check my messages: ""hey this is Ahmed BustedYourAss from Caught Laboratories to inform you your sample came back for a banned substance. Your employer would like us to inform you you've been terminated. Have a pleasant day.""

So I was broke as dick for another too months. I owed my friend some money so I looked up paid internships on Craigslist. Found one that was focused around my major for a start up. Went in, killed the interview. Interviewer ended up being my immediate supervisor who I smoked with on lunch breaks multiple times. 

Fast forward to this march. I go to a company late lunch/movie. One of my bosses brought her dads old friend. Turns out he worked as a regional manager for a international corporation in my hometown which was on the other side of the country. We also cracked a million jokes it was like a game of wit we both silently acknowledged and were continuing.

He tells me to get his number from my boss. She never gives me it and one day about 5-6 weeks later, my boss gets a call goes into a room, and it's the guy who would end up being my mentor.

This slick talking mother fucker man. It's like me in 50 years. We set a date to get better acquainted and so he can talk to me some more about my career. I go to his crib. He has steak, some wine, and fat patio in his back yard.

We start talking and he says what do I want to go into in. I told him commercial real estate and he called his friend right there and set up a lunch. About two months pass and I get a call from him saying he we're doing lunch at this place with [insert broker name] be ready. 

I walk in and he tells me more about it. Within five minutes he's like, ""I saw your resume, you seem like a great fit, [insert mentors name] helped me a long and the fact you want to start doing this with a year left in school is good."" He gives me an internship offering to pay for my classes and let me work for that firm before we even go to lunch.

So now, I still work at the original place. Talking about weed is common place although I never go in blatantly stoned. I have the internship for the firm later in the day after class and I'm loving it. 

All because of a failed swab test from a Grocery store. Lmao. Shoutout to staying lit, but all jokes aside I got Fucking lucky. I stumbled into two opportunities and got a hookup for the third. My moms prayers must be working cause usually that doesn't happen. 

If you have a test coming up, stop or at least get clean pee and a fake dick. Had a I not been a fuckhead I would've applied for the good internships in October prior and stopped smoking because big corporate internships drug test and I went to a start up. If you have to stop, stop. Pots not worth not getting that money. 

Hope the people that asked for this liked this. Be smart fellow trees. "
6xp4kq,27,2017-09-02,Need some advice: I realized I have nothing to live for when I almost died,ghost_Rogue,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/6xp4kq/need_some_advice_i_realized_i_have_nothing_to/,"Hi MGTOW,

I have been depressed for years and try to pull myself out of it every time but this time I just don't know what to do anymore. I literally feel nothing anymore.

This year has been the worst year of my life. First my first gf broke up with me in a horrible way which left me depressed for months. Then I tried to find a new perspective and I got an opportunity to do an internship abroad but I hated it so much I came home early and was depressed again. I managed to pick back up where I left off and caught up with my studies at university and even met a new girl who I fell in love with and dated for 3 months.

Then I got a herniated disc, worst pain of my life, and had to recover at home with morphine for 2 months and the drugs made me severely depressed, I lost 10kg bodyweight and the new girl of course dumped me since I was sick. I fell into depression again, but found MGTOW and decided to focus on myself. I was feeling better and miraculously managed to pass my bachelors degree at the same time, slowly regaining some of my weight. I even got a summer internship afterwards at one of the biggest IT services firms in the world. I would say MGTOW really helped me with getting over my bad experiences with girls and be able to move on without blaming myself for everything.

Finally things were looking up again and I was excited to start my masters degree. Even applied to join some clubs and commitees and introduction activities. But then 4 weeks ago I developed a fever and pain, turns out my appendix burst and my entire stomach was infected with bacteria that didnt respond well to antibiotics. After this I spent 2 weeks fighting for my life at the hospital. I lost another 10kg bodyweight but I'm alive at least. The doctor says 3 months recovery since my stomach and bowels had stopped working for 5 days. 

I'm in constant stomach pain, I look like a shadow of my former self as I lost about 20kg bodyweight, and I was already skinny to begin with. I have to miss all the university introduction activities and I got rejected for the clubs and committees (they hired 4 women and a gay guy instead). My social life was already nonexistant but when I try to build it up something like this happens. On top of that the 2 guys I thought were close friends didn't care I almost died and didn't even respond to my messages or ask if I'm fine.

The scary thing for me was that when I was at the lowest point at the hospital I didn't even feel anything. I have nothing I looked forward to in my life, nothing I am passionate about, even at a point I felt like I might die.

I have rebuilt my life so many times after difficult times but this time I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel any emotions, no sadness, no happiness. Only anger sometimes. I am extremely unmotivated for uni, even though it's a good degree which will definitelt land me a job, I just don't care anymore and I'm even considering dropping out.

I really don't know what to do right now anymore and could use any advice. For some reason I made it out of the hospital alive but I am so unhappy with my life I don't even know why I made it out alive.

Tl;dr: Lost my friends, my health, I don't feel anything anymore and don't know what to do with myself, any help is appreciated"
6xp7fo,11,2017-09-02,Heroes and Villains - Part 1 - Rena’s Titan - Chapter 1-8,polyisextra,writemeat,https://www.reddit.com/r/writemeat/comments/6xp7fo/heroes_and_villains_part_1_renas_titan_chapter_18/,"**Chapter 1 - Aboard a Streetcar - Downtown Titan - Ten Years Ago**


Twelve-year-old Rena Kemp put herself between the old lady and the thugs coming down the aisle.

Where the heck was security, she wondered. They were never on the street car when someone needed them.

“I’m not gonna let you bother this lady,” said Rena.

“Bother her?” asked a sinister voice. “We’re not gonna bother anyone. We’re just gonna make her purse a little lighter and if you don’t get out of the way, Rena, I’ll tear you apart myself.”

Rena was surprised the thugs knew her name, but even more surprising was Rena's half-sister suddenly appeared behind the thugs. Her sister pushed the hood of his sweatshirt off, staring at her with cold, dead, murderous eyes.

“Now get out of here Rena. Final warning,” the thug intoned. 

“Iris,” she whispered to herself. “Please don’t do this.”

Iris stepped forward and with an open hand slapped Rena in the face. Iris was wearing a ring, which split Rena’s cheek open, causing a trickle of blood to fall and mix with the tears falling from the young girl's brilliant green eyes. Rena did not move, though. She stood firm in place and looked at her sister with weak and sad eyes. This only infuriated Iris more. Iris screamed as she threw her hands down onto a nearby streetcar. Iris was a Super and her ability was channeled through her hands.

Everything after that happened too quickly for Rena to remember. The police never caught Iris or the rest of Rena’s attackers and Rena never told them who they were. All the police knew for sure was that whoever it was used their abilities to throw Rena through the doors of the still moving street car  was a powerful Super. Their power threw Rena down onto the street as if she were a rag doll and it left a single leg on the track. The incident left Rena in shock and unconscious. When she woke up in the hospital, she was missing a leg.


**Chapter 2 - A video from youtube**


From the youtube channel: Your world explained

Video Title: Where did Specials come from?


“Super Heroes! A few years ago, this was a title reserved only for characters in comic books, but in recent years, those supers seemed to have left the pages of your favorite comics and entered the real world. Instead of Marvel’s Iron Man, there is now the Iron Champion, who patrols the cities of California. Batman of Gotham has undoubtedly inspired the Dark Avenger who looms in the shadows of New York fighting crime. The list goes on and on. But where did this sudden surge in superheroes and their counter parts, super villains, come from? This video will cover the seven best theories of the Super phenomenon.

First, what do we know for sure about Superism? The first confirmed case was in Mexico: a child born with the ability to turn transparent. Later in Russia, videos of a flying girl became the most viral video on Youtube, getting over a billion hits in less than twenty-four hours. People were convinced that these occurrences were fake until it started happening to people they knew. Eventually, we came to understand that the impossible events that were happening within our society, events that seemed to come out of a comic book like X-Men, were real. An estimated one in five people born today will have some sort of Super trait. And even some who were not super before are developing strange abilities.


**Chapter 3 - West Titan - W. Titan AVE - Current Day**


The monstrous villain most closely resembled a man crossed with a gecko, but with four heads. As it struggled against the stun batons of the police that were trying to arrest it, it seemed to grow. First, it was as large as a bus. Then, it was as large as a one-story building. By the time it reached that size, its massively powerful tail could whip through concrete as if it were made out of butter.

The police, out matched, quickly ran for cover, but a crowd of spectators quickly formed because everyone knew a Special would soon appear to save the day. Dozens of smartphones pointed at the beast as it climbed on top of a building. Everyone was hoping to catch a video or photo of the beast that one of the comic book companies might license or buy for the cover of their next issue.

“Get back,” yelled one of the police officers. “Get back now!”

Debris was falling everywhere, but the spectators looked up, completely oblivious to the danger.
As the gecko man leaped from one building to the next, a massive air conditioner unit became dislodged and fell down onto the crowd. The people below just looked up as if it was all part of a show. They oohed and awed as the Gecko Man ran amuck, looking in every direction with its coal black eyes for a path of escape. Moments before several of them were crushed by the AC unit, a massive claw flew through the air and smashed the falling object into the side of a building before it could hit anyone.

Everyone turned to look where the claw had come from. Cameras focused. Fingers pointed. In the moonlight, a man, who seemed to be a cross between a human and a scorpion, stood with his claws pressed into his hips. The murmurs came first, then the loud talking. Finally, someone shouted the name, “Arachnobite,” and the crowd burst into cheers.

“Arachnobite? Isn’t an arachnid a spider,” asked a man in the crowd to no one in particular.
Standing close to him with her own smartphone pointing upwards, a twenty-two-year-old Rena Kemp answered him without missing a moment of the action.

“Arachnids are a class of joint-legged invertebrate animals including both Spiders and Scorpions.” While she spoke, Arachnobite leaped through the air and landed on top of the gecko villain and began stinging it with his own tail while hanging on to it with its powerful claws. Occasionally, a claw would break off during the struggle and a new one would grow to replace it. “So, while the word arachnid is more commonly associated spiders, it would still be correct to have the name Arachnobite as a scorpion themed superhero. Especially since his finishing move is--”

Just as it seemed the gecko villain was about to free himself from Arachnobite’s hold, the hero opened up its mouth to reveal even more powerful scorpion claws, which extended outwards and landed a series of devastatingly poisonous wounds to the villain. The gecko monster slowly began to shrink in size until it laid on the ground, once again human, his tail and extra heads gone.

The crowd exploded in cheers as Arachnobite climbed down the building and carried the limp body of the villain down to waiting police.

“Don’t worry,” he said to them. “He’s only stunned.”

“Thanks, Arachnobite,” said an officer as he shackled the Villain with ability dampening handcuffs.

After he handed the body over, Arachnobite pulled out a stack of self-titled comic books that he handed out to a few lucky spectators.

“Arachnobite,” called Rena. “Over here. Arachnobite!”

The hero never even got close to Rena who had pulled out her own copy of an Arachnobite comic from a backpack full of hundreds and held it in the air with a silver sharpie.

“Jeez girl,” said the spectator. You’ve got to have like a thousand comics in that backpack. Do you just carry them around hoping to get them signed?

However, Rena never heard him. She just stood on both her real and prosthetic tip toes calling out for Arachnobite’s attention.

“Over here! Please sign my comic. Please! ARACHNOBITE!”


**Chapter 4 - Titan City Hall - Conference room 321**


“I just want everyone to know how pleased I am with this month's numbers. The budget streamlining went very well and we’ve met all of our goals for the quarter. Currently, we are in line to pay off the bonds that were taken for the building of the new Titan One sports arena two years ahead of schedule.”

Everyone in the conference room clapped except Rena Kemp. She was busy oiling her prosthetic leg. The Mayor’s chief of staff who was running the meeting gave Rena a disapproving look and then continued.

“Now what I’d like to talk about is next week's annual city festival. As you know, the mayor has made quite a reputation for himself and the city by becoming a champion for Special rights and he wants to continue that trend by making the theme of this year’s celebration “The Specials in Our Community”. So, I want to take a moment to brainstorm some ideas.”

The chief of staff rolled out an easel with a whiteboard and wrote the word, ‘ideas,’ at the top of it.

“How about the past, present, and future of Specials,” said one of the younger staffers.

“I love it,” said the chief and wrote the idea in red ink at the top of the white board. “Now expand on that,” he said.

“Well, it’s like there have always been legends of super heroes in the world right? I mean, isn’t that the basis of most mythology?” he asked looking around for agreement. “Now, with this new wave of actual superheroes coming out all over the place, what if those legends were true.”

“Right,” said someone else. “Like Hercules. Maybe Hercules was a real guy. Or Moses.”

“Well Moses was real,” said a woman with long brown hair and a golden cross hanging from her neck. “He’s in the bible.”

“Well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” said the young staffer with a smirk.

“What’s that suppose to mean?” said the woman.

“Nothing,” said the staffer smiling. “Nothing at all.”

“Well if Moses was real, who’s to say Zeus wasn't real?” said someone else. “I mean, Thor was a comic book right? Before Specials were around, Thor was in the Avengers.”

“Exactly,” said the woman. “He was a comic book. But Moses was from the bible. You can’t compare--”

“Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Are you trying to say that just because it was in the Bible, it’s automatically real?”

“Exactly,” she said.

“That’s a bunch of crap. By that logic, anything can be real as long as enough people believe in it.”

Rena lowered her prosthetic leg to the ground and popped it back into place. Once connected to her stump, the servos in the leg automatically activated and each ceramic toe flexed one after another in a system test. The leg glowed blue for a moment and adjusted itself to be the proper size for Rena’s body.

“That’s enough,” said the Chief, “We’re way off subject here. We’re talking about the festival, not your own religious beliefs. Now, Rena, I’d like you to reach out to the local Hero clubs and see if any of them would be interested in participating in the festival.”

Rena looked up and nodded.

“Wait a minute. Why does Rena get to go?” asked the young staffer. “I’d like to go. Assign me.”
“That’s fine,” said Rena.

“No, it’s not fine,” said the Chief. “I assigned Rena because of her intimate knowledge of the subject matter. I want her to go.”

“That’s BS. I know just as much as she does about heroes. Just because she spends all her breaks and lunches reading comic books that doesn’t make her a freaking expert.”

“That’s enough,” said the Chief. “Last time I checked this wasn't a high school lunchroom. Let’s try to behave ourselves alright?”

The young staffer folded his hands over his chest and sulked, staring at Rena with deadly contempt. Rena grimaced as she tried her best to ignore him.


**Chapter 5 - Downtown Titan - I ST**


A few miles from City Hall, the Central Bank of Titan exploded into a fireball. From the alarm bells and piles of ashes a monster emerged and then sprinted away carrying huge bags in each of its tentacles. It left a trail of money like grass from an over loaded lawn mower in its wake. The creature had the body of a squid and the face of a squirrel. As it traveled, it crushed cars and knocked down trees. It used its powerful tentacles to grab ahold of the ground and launch itself forward, making it bullet through downtown like an out of control garbage truck. It hit one of the city’s streetcars, knocking it off its tracks and spraying ink all over it as it passed, covering all the passengers who were trying to escape the wreckage.

Since the emergence of the Special, the police have had to become hyper trained in technology and military tactics, using hi-tech equipment to keep up with the super human abilities of their adversaries. Part of this initiative was the implementation of drone clouds. The drone clouds would patrol the city and identify criminal activity, focusing on Specials. After a situation was analyzed by the drone cloud, an operator would be alerted to provide instructions to the cloud. Sometimes minor activity could be handled by the cloud itself, but other times, the cloud would notify local law enforcement. In Special circumstances, the cloud would advise a higher authority: The National Coalition of Super Clubs.

Super Clubs were independent agencies who sponsored the activities of superheroes. They were self-funded by donations and the sales of comic books. These clubs, while regulated by the state and federal governments, acted largely beyond the rule of private law. They worked to enforce it and were given permission to occasionally bend or even break the law. In this new world of super villains, superheroes had the ultimate responsibility to know how to and when to act to preserve the way of life for those who did not have such powerful enhancements.
“Holy crap,” said a man eating a hot dog in front of a vendor’s cart.
The giant squirrel-faced squid flew down the street tearing apart a streetcar station across the street from the hot dog cart and sent those waiting for the next streetcar screaming in terror. This villain had an appetite for speed and destruction and even the most eager of spectators couldn’t be compelled to stay in its path.

“What is that thing?” asked the hot dog vendor.

“It’s a squirrelpus!”

“Nah,” said the vendor. “It’s an octorrel.”

“Whatever it is, it’s about to get torn apart. Do you hear that?”

The vendor stopped to listen, but couldn’t hear anything beyond the chaos caused by the octorrel.

“I don’t hear anything,” he said to his customer.

“Exactly,” said the hot dog eater. “No cops.” He pointed up to where the huge black cloud of drones was hovering high in the sky. “Which means they didn’t call the PD. They called a super.”

Suddenly the sky exploded with a sonic boom and the contrail of a jet engine follow something, but it wasn't a plane.

“It’s the Iron Champion!”


**Chapter 6 - Titan City Hall - Elevator Hallway**


After the meeting, Rena collected her things and made her way to the elevator. She sighed at the sight of the religious woman, Barbara, and the young staffer, Ryan, who were both waiting. Neither of them had liked Rena before, but she suspected that Ryan liked her even less now. Outside of the meeting they hardly ever spoke to her and on rare occasions, they talked about her as if she wasn't even there.

‘Ding’

Each of them got inside the elevator and the two of them started in on Rena immediately. Rena understood why he did it. He was a young intern, hired right out of high school to help manage the mayor's social media accounts. He was still just an immature kid with a school yard mentality, but the woman Rena didn’t understand. She was old enough to know better and was just cruel. The two of them loved to pick on Rena, especially since she never fought back.
“I can’t believe he gave that assignment to the cripple,” said Ryan.
“It’s all about diversity,” said Barbara. “They have to give her opportunities as if she were an ordinary person. You know like they did with the minorities through affirmative action back in the day.”

“Pfft,"" sneered Ryan. “What a joke. I mean, I’m the head of social media. If anyone should be going out to the field to meet with super clubs, it should be me. As representatives of the city, we should be putting our best foot forward. Not plastic leg or whatever she has. And oh my god did you see her cleaning it during the meeting. Disgusting.”
Rena remained silent standing behind the two feeling smaller with each passing word.
“Oh, I know. And the smell. It’s like a mixture of WD-40 and feet. I almost lost my lunch. She should just kill herself.”

“Yeah. I don’t know why she doesn’t just get out of here and go work somewhere with people of her own kind. Utterly useless.”

“You know, I’ve always believed God makes things happen for a reason,” the elevator doors opened, and the two walked out. Just before the door closed, Rena heard her finish her thought. “So being the type of person she is, it’s no wonder she lost her real leg.”

Their laughter echoed in the hallway.

The elevator was empty and while there was light coming from a lamp at the top of the elevator car, Rena was left in infinite darkness.


**Chapter 7 - Mercy Point West Medical Offices - Ten Years Ago**


“Okay Rena,” said the doctor. “This is the highest tech Leg I’ve ever seen. The mayor specially approved this for you after your accident. Why don’t we give it a try, okay?”

Rena just looked away at the blank wall. She wasn't crying. Since the surgery that removed her real leg, she had cried enough. She was all out of tears. Now, all that was left was deep emptiness. The void pulled in all of her emotions like a draining bathtub and she was happy to let it. Feeling nothing was better than accepting reality.

Rena’s mother moved to comfort her, but the doctor motioned for her to stand back and shook his head.

“Ma’am,” said the doctor. “Can you give us a minute.”

Rena’s mom, who was nowhere close to being out of tears, nodded and stepped out of the room. Rena and the doctor were left alone with just the vital signs monitor to break the silence with its sharp and consistent beeps. The doctor sat down on his rolling stool, scooted up to the bed and spoke in a hushed but firm tone.

“This isn’t going to be easy, Rena. I can’t pretend I know what you’re going through personally but I work with people every day just like you. And I know that this is going to be the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Losing a part of yourself is about much more than just your physical body. It takes part of your soul. And no one is going to hand you back exactly what you lost. But sometimes people will try and help. Not always, but sometimes they will offer you an opportunity to make things better. So, when you get that chance to get something that you couldn’t get any other way, you take it, and you make the most out of it because if you don’t, well, you're not only spitting in the face of those who didn’t get the same opportunity, but you're just hurting yourself for no reason other than just trying it make yourself feel better by embracing the misery. Future you deserves better than that. Future you deserves more than misery.

Now you got your leg cut off. Yeah, it sucks. But be grateful that the thing that cut your leg off was a streetcar owned by the city. And be thankful that you had a competent lawyer who scared the city into pulling some strings to get you the highest tech prosthetic leg in the world. I know people with good legs who would take this over the real thing any day. It’s not just a leg. It’s like getting a super power: something kids today are being born with. You weren’t born with superpowers, Rena, but now fate just delivered you a chance to be Special so you’d better make the most of it. Whoever did this to you is hoping you’ll just lay down and die. Don’t give them the satisfaction. Stand up and show everyone what you're made of.”

Rena didn’t move for a long time and the doctor didn’t say another word. He just waited her out. Eventually, Rena turned around and sat up on her hospital bed. The doctor rolled back to give her room. She looked down at her real leg and her prosthetic hanging off the edge of the bed. The prosthesis was made of soft ceramic plates held together by silicone and titanium. It connected to a node at the tip of her stump which transmitted and received data directly to an implant in Rena’s brain wirelessly. The leg had the strength of a body builder and the agility of a ballerina. When Rena allowed her feet to glide down to the floor, she instantly felt control over her body like she’d never felt before. She stood straighter, felt more balanced and could feel strange impulses in her brain.

She took one step with her natural foot, then one step with her prosthetic. The force of the impact cracked the tile floor for twelve inches in every direction. Rena looked up at the doctor who had already rolled over to his computer that was linked to her leg.

“One second,” he said. “Let me lower the sensitivity… Okay, try again.”

Rena took another step. Then another with the prosthetic. No crack. Each of Rina’s toes rolled up and down, almost grabbing hold of the floor as she stood there. The leg pulsed with lines of blue light running throughout it. Rena stopped, waiting to be told what to do. She took another step. Then another. Then another. Soon she was running through the hallway. Each time her prosthetic touched the ground, it pushed her hard through the air in a galloping run. The force with which Rena could propel herself made her run faster than she had ever run before.

“Excuse me, there is no running--”

That’s all Rena had time to hear as she shot past the nurse's station. Upon reaching the edge of the hallway, rather than stopping, Rena did something she couldn't explain later. She launched herself into the air towards the fourth-floor window and with blinding speed kicked the window apart using her prosthetic, shattering a path for her to jump through. The new impulses in her brain kept her calm and collected. She fell towards the concrete below, assured that no harm would come to her and she was right. Her prosthetic leg took the brunt of the impact and absorbed it without damage. Rena continued to run in her hospital gown without breaking stride.
From the shattered window on the fourth floor, Rena’s mother shouted at her to stop, but her voice couldn’t catch Rena. Nothing could.


**Chapter 8 - Titan City Hall - First Floor Lobby - Current Day**


Rena loved to run, but she also loved to eat and while she could out run most anything,she couldn’t outrun her food addiction. If she wasn't a drinking a liter of soda pop, she was drowning her sorrows in a pint of chocolate ice cream, served in a waffle cone bowl, topped with a chocolate shell and whipped cream. Then for dessert, she’d have a hot and ready pizza from little caesars. When Rena topped three hundred pounds, she just stopped counting.
But it didn’t slow Rena down. Even with her obese body, her prosthetic leg could keep her moving with the same speed as it did when she was a paper thin twelve-year-old. The leg cushioned her body from the high impact of running and did most of the work. Unknown to Rena, the leg actually fueled itself through her stores of body fat. She far outpaced the leg, but it always had a massive fuel supply should she need it.

So, when those elevator doors opened. Rena didn’t walk out. She ran. And when security saw her coming on closed circuit video, they pushed the automatic doors open so that she wouldn’t have to slow down as she made her way from the lobby into the street. She did this almost every day. Never bothering to stop and check for traffic. She never had to because her smart leg was advanced enough to pace itself properly to avoid traffic without her even looking. It would only try and stop her if there was something she wouldn’t be able to avoid. And it wanted to stop her now. Rena panicked and turned just in time to see a squirrel faced squid barreling down the street directly at her.

Even for the girl with the fastest leg there was no time to do anything. She saw herself as a twelve-year-old victim all over again.

“Now get out of here Rena. Final warning.”

In the seconds before the squirrel slammed into her, she saw through her mind’s window of memory her half-sister, Iris. After slapping Rena, she touched the ground with her bare hands and caused the streetcar around Rena to shift, bubble and bend in ways that normal things shouldn’t be able to do. She always told herself that Iris was just trying to scare her. Maybe she was, but the bending of the streetcar popped Rena off her two natural feet and sent her flying through the retracting side doors and onto the track below. The streetcar slicing off and cauterizing her leg in one smooth motion.

“Now get out of here Rena. Final warning,” the voice echoed in her brain again. With fractions of a second before the thing ran through her, Rena closed her eyes and accepted her fate.
‘Boom.’

The force of the impact knocked Rena off her feet, but not as badly as she was expecting. When she opened her eyes she saw why. The money carrying squirrelpus that had been charging her with the force of water from a fire hose was now lying flat on its back beneath the Titanium heels of the Iron Champion.

In the moments before impact, the Iron Champion had not only managed to subdue the villain but change its trajectory to narrowly avoid hitting Rena with full force. Rena still got hit, but not nearly as hard and the squirrelpus had been. However, the monster was down, but not out. It quickly regained its composure and let go of the money bags. Instead, it focused all of its attention on the Iron Champion, using several of its tentacles to grab the hero around the throat and slam him in every direction. Rena got up and looked upon the scene with a mixture of panic, fear, excitement, and fandom. She had, of course, heard of the Iron Champion. He was one of the most infamous super heroes in the world. One of the few who maintained a secret identity and therefore was technically illegal, but few questioned his commitment to justice.

The faceplate of his helmet pulsated with a bright blue glow and shot out a solid beam of pure energy. The Iron Champion used this laser to sever the tentacles which held him in place and flipped the Villain over like a trained wrestler. Using his jet-propelled fists, he punished the octorrel into a near puddle of ink and blood, but the octorrel would not relent. It continued to struggle and fight. Just when all seemed lost, a blinding purple light glowed just beyond sight and a second villain emerged from a portal.

“Iron Champion,” it called out and immediately rushed the already embattled hero.
The new threat was a massive beast of a man who also seemed to be wearing an armor suit like the Iron Champion. But while the Iron Champion’s suit was streamlined and closely resembled a metal man, the Villain looked more like an Iron Redwood tree with arms and legs. His enormous strides brought him closer and closer to the Iron Champion who was still occupied with the squirrel faced squid and stood vulnerable with his back to the attacker.

Rena, without a second thought, ran towards the battle, her leg glowing beneath her. And in an almost mirror of previous events, she jumped into the air and landed heel first into the new villain's chest just before he could get a hold of the iron champion. Her leg seemed to pulse and expand during the impact. Both the octorrel and the Iron Champion stood motionless in each other grips, watching as the impact threw this new opponent back further from where he had started and then broke her leg from her body and left her on the ground limp and damaged.

The Redwood Villain was stunned by what had just happened. It was evident that he was not used to being surprised or pushed around. His face framed bright, blood red eyes and he started at Rena with furious anger.

“What’s this Iron Champion? A new pathetic side kick? I didn’t think you would be so low as to need help from such a weakling.”

Rena looked around and realized that the villain was talking about her. “A side kick,” she thought to herself, “me?” She couldn’t help but blush at the accusation, despite the phantom pains that glowed white hot from where her leg used to be.

“I will take pleasure in crushing her before I obliterate you once and for all! After that, no one will stop the great reclamation!”

“No,” said the Iron Champion through a mechanical voice, “She’s just an innocent. Bring your fight to me.”

“No one is innocent anymore, Iron Champion. Especially the weak and pathetic. The strong will no longer be prisoners to the weak and those who defend the expendable will suffer the same fate.”

The Villain brought his gaze to Rena and that’s when the first of the drones began to dive bomb him, overloading their batteries and exploding on impact. The first explosion was followed by countless more, like a string of fireworks popping one after another. The entire drone cloud was descending on the battle. In the distance, sirens blared. Some of the drones gathered around the Iron Champion and Rena attempting to drag them away from the fight.

“No,” commanded the Iron Champion. “Save her. Save the girl!”

There was no hesitation in the drones. They immediately abandoned the Iron Champion and redoubled their efforts around Rena. Slowly they began to gently move her away from the fight. The new Villain growled like a frustrated gorilla and descended upon the Iron champion in a single leap, creating craters in the earth while drones continued to explode all around him. He combined both his hands into a singlefist and brought it down onto the Champions body. The hero blasted him with a sufficiently concentrated burst from his beam, but it was not enough to affect him at all.

As Rena was pulled away from the fight without her prosthetic leg and dragged around a corner, the last thing she saw was the Iron Champion with a single pleading hand held up in his own defense as the Villain beat him through the pavement with huge monstrous fists.

6xpzx6,11,2017-09-02,Subword syntax highlighting with rainbow-identifiers,gottabeme,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6xpzx6/subword_syntax_highlighting_with/,"Having used `rainbow-identifiers-mode` for a while, it occurred to me that it might be useful to apply colors by subword instead of by symbol, because doing it by symbol means that symbols that only differ by one character can have completely different colors, so they don't visually group together.  For example:

* [customize-set-variables](https://i.imgur.com/wV5zBRN.png)
* [code](https://i.imgur.com/s10FqCv.png)

It turns out it was an extremely simple change to do this:

    (defun rainbow-identifiers--matcher (end)
      ""The matcher function to be used by font lock mode.""
      (catch 'rainbow-identifiers--matcher
        (while (re-search-forward (rx word-start (*? any) word-end) end t)
          (let ((beginning (match-beginning 0))
                (end (match-end 0)))
            (when (run-hook-with-args-until-failure 'rainbow-identifiers-filter-functions beginning end)
              (let* ((identifier (buffer-substring-no-properties beginning end))
                     (hash (rainbow-identifiers--hash-function identifier)))
                (setq rainbow-identifiers--face (funcall rainbow-identifiers-choose-face-function hash))
                (throw 'rainbow-identifiers--matcher t)))))
        nil))

The only change is, in the `rx` macro, `symbol-start` and `symbol-end` change to `word-start` and `word-end`.

At the same time, I decided to see if I could improve the colors it uses.  I use the `solarized-dark` theme, and I recently discovered `color.el` (part of Emacs), which has functions to desaturate and lighten colors.  So, using the `solarized-with-color-variables` macro, I rewrote the `rainbow-identifiers--define-faces` macro to this function, making it easy to experiment with colors:

    (cl-defun ap/rainbow-identifiers--define-faces
        (&amp;key (num-faces 16) (desaturations (list 40 50 60)) (lightens (list 0 5 10))
              colors)
      (cl-flet ((modify-color (color desaturate lighten)
                              (--&gt; color
                                   (color-desaturate-name it desaturate)
                                   (color-lighten-name it lighten)))
                (choose (num-faces i choices)
                        (let* ((num-choices (1- (length choices)))
                               (steps (/ num-faces num-choices))
                               (choice (/ i steps)))
                          (nth choice choices))))
        (cl-loop for i from 1 to num-faces
                 for face = (intern (format ""rainbow-identifiers-identifier-%d"" i))
                 for desaturate = (choose num-faces i desaturations)
                 for lighten = (choose num-faces i lightens)
                 unless (internal-lisp-face-p face)
                 do (custom-declare-face face `((t))
                                         (format ""Identifier face #%d"" i))
                 do (set-face-attribute face nil
                                        :foreground (modify-color (nth i colors) desaturate lighten)))
        (setq rainbow-identifiers-face-count num-faces)))

I run it like this, and the existing faces immediately reflect the changes:

    (solarized-with-color-variables 'dark
      (ap/rainbow-identifiers--define-faces :colors (-cycle (list red orange yellow green blue cyan violet magenta))))

* [customize-set-variables](https://i.imgur.com/j1RdYUW.png)
* [code](https://i.imgur.com/MyuBEd7.png)

Now this is admittedly *quite* colorful, and it isn't going to appeal to everyone.  Just look at the list of packages in `package-selected-packages`.  I'm not even sure if I will keep using it like this.  

But one of the benefits is the way related symbols visually group together.  In the first screenshot (of `customize-set-variables`), look at how the `paradox`, `persistent-scratch`, `rainbow-identifiers`, and `recentf` symbols visually group themselves together by color.  In the second screenshot, look at how the `org-find-text-property-in-string` calls are easily picked out by their unique sequence of colors (makes me think of Neapolitan ice cream&amp;#x2026;mmm&amp;#x2026;).

And using the `ap/rainbow-identifiers--define-faces` function, it's easy to experiment with different colors, numbers of colors, steps of desaturation or lightening, etc.  Of course, this function can also be used with the standard per-symbol coloring, without the subword coloring."
6xqcdt,7,2017-09-02,Pursuing other goals / studies while teaching abroad?,scott_af,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/6xqcdt/pursuing_other_goals_studies_while_teaching_abroad/,"**CURRENT DILEMMA**

I recently turned 31 and have been working in the Defense Industry since being an intern in college. I have excelled pretty well in the industry but have HATED my jobs for the last few years. I have thought about teaching abroad (China, Korea, Taiwan or Thailand) for many years, and think now may be as good of time as ever to do so.  I had the opportunity to travel to Asia in my last job and really liked it.
I am looking to change careers to Web Development. Much of the skills can be learned using online resources, including bootcamp programs. My current problem is I currently work long hours so its hard to put in the time needed to learn the trade.
Here are the reasons learning web development while teaching abroad sounds attractive to me: 

* I have always wanted to live and travel abroad 

* I have thought about transitioning to teaching as a second career later in life

* I can start a website about my travels in Asia as a way to practice my craft

* I can have more free time to study than I would working a ""normal"" job in the states

I am curious to know what other teachers think? 

Have you pursued other activities while teaching abroad? 

How much time outside of class do you have?"
6xqe1l,2,2017-09-02,33 [M4F] Whiskey Gingers and Rain,mynameaintkyle,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6xqe1l/33_m4f_whiskey_gingers_and_rain/,"I loosened my collar as I sat at the barn hanging my work bag on the hooks underneath. I signaled the bartender and got a nod. Then I surveyed the bar.

It had been another one of those days. The kind where you work non-stop but when it's time to leave you aren't quite sure what you've done. So instead of trying to understand why you spend time that way you do the next best thing.

You grab a drink.

It gets slightly depressing when everyone knows your name but there is a comfort in the familiar blanket that is spilled booze. Tonight I didn't see any of the regulars. Instead the bar was peppered with young professionals, summer interns, and folks either going to or getting back from some sort of exercise class.

The sky darkened as my whiskey and ginger arrived. A loud crack of thunder and some people settled up and left. They missed the deluge that followed. A few stayed.

You, however, stayed.

Sitting on the stool next to me I glanced over your shoulder at the downpour, inhaling the scent of fresh water drowning out the bar. 

Rather then end this night alone, I took a chance at filling the next few hours with someone like you.

""So, what are you drinking?"""

A bit of background: I'm about to enter my third and final year of undergrad. If I pass C in October, I'll have 4 exams by the time I graduate next June but no internships! Actuarial students at my school typically get internships the summer after their third year, but because I'll be graduating, I'm kinda screwed for that. My choices now are: apply to my school's one year Master's program or seek employment in the upcoming October career fair. 

Here are pros and cons of either choice.

Pros of Master's: 

* only one year

* internship/research project with a actuarial-related company will be assigned for each student

* I can look for internships in the upcoming career fair

* get to make some money as a TA

* enjoy student life a bit more

Cons of Master's: 

* many say it's a waste 

* I'll have one year without being able to pass any exams (not sure SOA or CAS)

* I don't even like academia.  

Pros of seeking employment:

* I have exams and technical skills 

* get a head start

* be independent 

* get to pass more exams without taking an year long break, assuming that I get hired

Cons of seeking employment:

* no internship :(

* maybe I'm rushing life

* perhaps I should gain some more knowledge first


I'm interested to hear what you guys think. "
6xqqxr,1,2017-09-02,"Family friend wants me to take over his small business, don't know where to begin",Whattup,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6xqqxr/family_friend_wants_me_to_take_over_his_small/,"A family friend of mine (Rob) owns a computer maintenance business and has asked me to take over after he retires. I know plenty about computers and have done some maintenance work myself, but am not officially trained or licensed or anything. 

My issue is that the Rob has asked me to write up the deal for how this can financially work for both of us. Rob is is willing to teach me everything I need to know, but he doesn't want to pay me while teaching me (which I think is understandable). Additionally, Rob wants to work with me personally for a while before handing over the reins.

The business owner (Rob) and I discussed the idea of some kind of progressing partnership/employement. Rob plans on being fully detached from the business by April, so I was considering proposing something like working as an unpaid intern for a month, then as an employee for 6 months before taking over the business.


What kind of deal do you believe is fair in this situation? 

If I were to transition from an intern to an employee, how much should I be making (doing computer maintenance calls) when the business owner charges $80/hr?

If I were to take control of running the business with Rob maintaining ownership, what sort of percentage (of $80/hr) should we each be getting?

As I believe that I've got no bargaining chips here, I want to be very cautious with my proposition. 

Please do not hesitate to ask for more information if it'll help. Thanks for any and all responses

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm a 22-year-old part-time cashier and he wants to have me RUN the business while he retires. He will retain ownership and will be making a percentage of the revenue I earn through service calls. The attraction for me to run the business while he sits back and takes a piece is due to his (relatively) large client base and the valuable experience I could acquire working with/for Rob."
6xr297,24,2017-09-02,Your story ideas for the next Spider-Man movie?,Spiderlander,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6xr297/your_story_ideas_for_the_next_spiderman_movie/,"I have two vastly plot outlines in my head for Spider-Man 2 aka Spider-Man: Grounded. One with Kraven &amp; one with Mysterio. Here's my ideas for a Kraven sequel.


- Herman is back, out of jail- Essentially like what we saw in the Homecoming promo art. He's gotten a massive upgrade from the Tinkerer (who is supplying criminals with tech from behind bars). Two gauntlets that shoot shockwaves &amp; a full costume. The movie opens with a fight between Spidey &amp; Shocker. Spidey goes crazy with the jokes &amp; webs Shocker to a lampost.

- Uncle Ben plays a thematic role in this movie

- T'Challa gives Peter a heads-up about Kraven coming to New York (since T'Challa has had run-ins with him in Africa) Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, Falcon &amp; Happy also make appearances. 

- Detective Jean Dewolff is introduced. She is trying to crackdown on the criminal underworld from what's left of Toomes' business &amp; it's affiliates. She name drops Captain Stacy

- Aaron Davis makes a small appearance with the Prowler tech supplied by Tinkerer

- Spidey is becoming known worldwide after the battle in Infinity War. He's more experienced than Homecoming, little bit more mature after what he saw in IW. He's a lot more cocky now, being an honorary member of the Avengers. But Spidey's fame attracts the attention of an unnamed, mysterious man who hires Kraven the Hunter to kill Spider-Man because he's becoming a big problem for the criminal underworld. Kraven has been studying Spider-Man for a period of months so he knows every weakness Spidey has. This is why Spidey will lose &amp; will be once again ""grounded"" by his fight with Kraven. 

- Another plot point- Spidey has also caught the attention of J. Jonah Jameson who wants to expose Spider-Man as a criminal &amp; menace. He spreads countless negative rumors &amp; gossip about Spider-Man. [The Daily Bugle is a modern magazine/internet tabloid like TMZ. Betty Brant gets an internship at the Bugle.]

- At the end of the second act- after a violent battle, Kraven literally buries Spider-Man in a grave just like he did in the comic. For a period of time, everybody thinks he's dead. It's all over the news. As a result of Peter missing for a few days- Michelle is heartbroken, Flash feels bad for all of his bullying. Jonah is gleeful. A sharp contrast to JK Simmons' Jonah

- Ned tries to comfort a devastated May who blows up at him for not telling her Peter was Spider-Man all along. (remember, she knows he's Spidey but never confronted Peter) A really dramatic scene plays out here- Ben is finally brought up in powerful context. We finally get a flashback to Ben narrated by May to Ned

- In the climax- Spidey literally rises from his grave like that iconic scene in the comics &amp; has a final battle with Kraven on top of a construction tower (fight location looks like this: https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/planetoftheapes/images/9/94/Apes_in_construction_tower.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20140626002733 ) Turning the tables on him, using his intelligence to remember Kraven's weaknesses.


- Mid credits: Kraven brought to prison. He is about to commit suicide when he gets a slip by another inmate. Kraven wanting revenge on Spider-Man accepts the invitation.

- Post credits: Oscorp stinger. Tinkerer gets personally hired by Norman Osborn to work for Oscorp- It is revealed that Norman was the one who hired   Kraven. He uses his connections to get him out of prison &amp; we cut to a computer monitor where we see multiple rooms on the screen: Mac Gargan getting outffited with the Scorpion suit, a younger Otto Octavius (I want Otto to be closer to Peter's age) working on an experiment with his tentacles, 5 huge clear piller containers with sand contained inside of them, the label ""Flint Marko"" plastered on them. Alister Smythe with the Spider Slayers. We cut to black.

So yeah, those are some of my ideas for Spider-Man 2. What do you guys think? What are some of your ideas for the second MCU Spider-Man film?

He didn't really love me how could he to leave me so cold to be so cruel he just used me. And yet I keep checking his reddit account to see if he wrote anything about the breakup nothing :/ I guess we never really had the breakup talk never talked about how we felt he never said I don't love you or we are done it just left lingering. that he was fine not talking to me for the 6months he was on his internship and we could maybe start up when he came back that he was happy because he wasn't talking to me but never got the closure the end the reason why he was done with me. guess that s what's really bothering me as I will never know why he did it if he ever really cared what he felt and thought. Just sucks I deserved better I would have done anything for him and he just left me lingering saying he didn't want to breakup but didn't want to talk to me. he left me dangling when I needed him the most for that I will never forget but I can't stop thinking about him everyday every f-ing day whether it's about things we did or what an asshole he was to me or were I went wrong. when will it end 
6xrwfk,12,2017-09-03,"UPDATE--""Took a chance on industry""",throwaway95050,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6xrwfk/updatetook_a_chance_on_industry/,"My original post a few months back:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/67b39l/took_a_chance_on_industry_and_it_failed/

So after moping around for a couple of days and drinking copious amounts of alcohol I needed to pick myself up. I ended up talking to a few mentors of mine and for the most part they all told me to move on and learn from this, any effort trying to get payback would all be for naught and wasted effort when all of that energy could be used to actually finding a job. I did heed their advice, but I also sent an email to the head honcho at my career department. I got a reply back from the career director and they felt very bad about my situation and wanted to help me find something but it was summer and slow season. As for how they are handling the company that fucked me over, they are now under their radar. The city I live in, the ""accounting"" world is very, very intertwined.

I figured I needed to get some positivity back in my world since I had some personal shit going on at the time too. After being done with classes I took a restaurant job and a retail job working from 8am all the way to 11:00pm just so I could stay busy to keep my mind from thinking about my shit situations, while also earning a constant stream of income.

Initially I was getting a good amount of interviews, didn't talk about the re neg at all with any of them. But these were for jobs I wasn't really interested in and very low paying that also required a degree. One outsourced recruiter told me what my salary expectations were and I gave her a figure. She replied with a ""Sorry but this is an entry level position and it pays around 25-30k"". If anyone is reading this I want you guys to listen--Entry level does not mean low pay. Know your self worth.

Well, I did find a job after about 4 months and a few interviews and maybe getting renegged was a blessing in disguise. This new job is in industry in SEC Reporting for a tech company and my starting pay is around the low 60s. But total compensation package puts me right under 80k when taking into account 401K matching/profit sharing/bonus/equity grants/etc. Seriously couldn't ask for a better way to start off my career. And I wasn't expecting this package at all.

Warning--I'm about to get a little preachy but I think this is all going to be good advice.

A few things about me: graduated with a sub-par gpa (under 3.0), involved with campus positions. 3 Internships with one being in SEC Reporting for a whole year (32-50 hours during peak times and some days off to take exams/go to class I think I balanced it well). During my internship, Company went through major business combinations, new pronouncements, non-gaap financials, etc. which led to tons of work and tons of learning opportunities from a reporting perspective.

Some general advice to people: Know your self worth. Don't sell yourself short. And build your personal brand (if you were to list out three of your strongest traits, how would you convey it).

Some advice to students that are looking for their first internship/first full-time job: Find a way to ""stick out"". Everyone is in BAP. Everyone meets the GPA requirement. Everyone has a part-time job. Stick out. Also, your story and your presentation is what ultimately sells you. It sucks but this is accounting and presentation is important.

Students that will/are doing an internship: Learn as much as you can on the job and take on every task you can--but don't overwhelm yourself. Find a good balance. Don't ask questions just for the sake of asking questions. Also, never complain about the actual work. That's why you are getting paid for it. It's one thing to complain about having a ton of work every now and then but its another thing complaining about everything (client provided lunches, audit room, work, co-workers, etc). Having a good, professional work attitude will do wonders for yourself later down the road--it helped me when the company I signed with was doing reference checks.

I also want to thank this sub for all of the advice. I remember being here 5 years ago doing the same thing I hope someone else is doing with this post: Reading up on people's experience and researching on tips on what I should be doing to land a job. Thanks for the encouragement from the last post guys, it helped me a ton. :)

If anyone has a question about something post it here, I'll try to answer them all.

TL;DR--Got renegged on offer. Shitty personal situations made me a mental wreck. Drank a ton. Everything worked out and it's all going to be okay."

Yes I know PoE on a laptop is not recommended, but I really didn't think it would be that bad.

I have a great internet connection, a dedicated GPU, a Samsung SSD, a laptop stand to deal with cooling even though my room is generally quite cold anyway.

Even with potato texture quality just sitting in town with no MTX or particle effects I can barely get above 30 FPS.

For comparitive purposes, I sometimes play League of Legends and when I do, I can play it on the highest settings with smooth 60 FPS.

Is there something I'm doing wrong? I've tried every possible configuration I can think of in the in-game options and it doesn't seem to make a difference...

6xslfw,19,2017-09-03,How To Find A Free Office,alfredohere,EntrepreneurRideAlong,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/6xslfw/how_to_find_a_free_office/,"Sup Reddit,

My name is Alfred and I started my e-commerce business one month ago. Me and my business partner have been working in cafés and at the office where we have had our internships. It has been quite stressful. Cafés always close right when you start to get into a flow state and the wifi never works. As summer is ending, our internships are coming to an end too, which means those offices will be out of reach. 

It also feels like you don’t have a serious business unless you have your own office. Where are you supposed to bring your customers, investors etc. The credibility doesn’t exactly start high if you meet at Starbucks… That’s why I decided to find us an office. 

Since our budget is very limited I decided to get an office very cheaply, and I managed to find one **FOR FREE**.

#PART ONE: Where the hell do I start looking?

As many journeys, this one started with good old google. I simply searched for offices in Stockholm (the capital of Sweden. I tricked you into learning some geography ;) ). That didn’t really help. Stockholm is apparently absurdly expensive, my friend who runs a startup pays 5000 dollars a month for his small office… 

Co-working spaces came up a lot. That’s an office which is shared between a few startups and freelancers. This is great because you can get inspired by other entrepreneurs and it also offers good networking opportunities. Though, this was still out of my budget range. 

Partly through the search I stumbled upon something called **Startup Incubators**. It’s a place for startups that are just starting out. Many of them are sponsored by the government. I guess this is more common in socialistic Sweden, but I think it’s more common that most people think. Entrepreneurs are very important to the economy and many governments are realising this. Every city wants to be the birth place of the next big unicorn, so they sponsor entrepreneur activities.

#PART TWO: Startup Incubators?

I thought Startup Incubators only existed in Silicon Valley. Places like Y-Combinator, where geniuses create billion dollar companies. But apparently they are popping up everywhere. 

Startup Incubators are great for many things.

•	Meet other entrepreneurs

•	Connect with the startup incubator network

•	**Free office space**

It was mostly the last point which stuck to my mind. **FREE OFFICE SPACE.** That would be amazing. Getting a place where meetings can be held and where we can do our all-nighters. But it must be really hard to get such wonderful perks, right?


#PART THREE: APPLY, APPLY, APPLY

To get that dreamy government subsidize office space, you have to be super smart. Hundreds of companies must be applying every week. It has to be almost impossible, when the perks are so great? (spoiler: it’s not impossible and you don’t have to be a genius. If you watch my videos, you’ll understand I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed.)

There are five Startup Incubators in Stockholm. Despite of having massive imposter syndrome, I decided to apply to all of them. In the application form I had a fake it till you make it attitude. Wasn’t necessarily lying, but stretching the truth a bit, hehe (don’t judge). 

What happened? It turns out that all that stands between you and a free office is five boring application forms. **I WAS ACCEPTED**. It felt great to get that massive affirmation on your business idea. If someone likes your idea so much that you get a free office, the idea must be pretty damn good!

However, I didn’t get into all of them. Actually, I was only accepted in one! So my big learning here is twofold.

First, governments have tonnes of help out there. I’m sure a free office is just the beginning of my usage of government subsides. Investment/loan is definitely my next big ask. 

Secondly, apply, apply, and apply. It wasn’t intelligence or talent that got me this office. I write like a rake, as we say in Sweden (it means I write badly, which you can see from this post). I got this office because of one thing: persistence. I believe every business or person has a chance of getting what they want from an application. The chance of getting what you want is never zero, but it’s seldom 100%. Our chance seems to be around 20%, which means we have to apply to five things in order to get one. 

Five startup incubators in one city might be abnormally high. Though if you live in a big city, I’m sure you have at least one startup incubator that you can apply to. So if you want that free office, make sure to **apply, apply, and apply**.

6xsyoj,176,2017-09-03,"Former Coworker, but Hopefully He's Gotten Better..... I really hope...",IAmNeeeeewwwww,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/6xsyoj/former_coworker_but_hopefully_hes_gotten_better_i/,"I've been reading some of these stories and this one doesn't have as much cringe. Still, I feel this is worth telling. By the way, it goes without saying that some details have been altered to protect privacy.

Rewind about five years when I first moved to Seoul, South Korea. I had just graduated from college and I was looking for somewhere to go and something to do while working on some semblance of a five-year plan. Overall, I fucking lived living overseas, more so in East Asia. And after a decent-paying internship, I end up teaching English at private learning center for adults, or a *hagwon* in Korean.

Now, just to preface, TEFL/TESOL in Korea was a cesspool of some of **the worst** personalities five years ago. Some were pretty cool, but shit, most of the people fucking sucked. You get the borderline-alcoholic perpetual complainers. You get the obliviously racist weeaboo-types. You get the neckbeards/legbeards who think East Asia is a discount market for potential ""life partners."" And the neckbeard I have for you is an unfortunate mix of all three.

Anyhow, I end up meeting said neckbeard while working my teaching job. To avoid confusion, let's refer to said neckbeard as ""Drew."" By all appearances, he seemed alright and nothing seemed out of the ordinary aside from being morbidly obese and having a douchey goatee. Still, we had a lot of awesome conversations about film and television in between discussions about music. Of course, there were some early warning signs looking back in hindsight. Things like using every word short of ""normie"" to describe some of my favorite shit like pop-punk and long-boarding. Things like being a raging, pseudo-intellectual, ""militant"" atheist because of *The God Delusion*. Things like loosely throwing out buzzwords such as ""real men"" and ""real women."" Regardless, as I always do, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and tried to get to know him and invite him out.

Now here's where the story in particular really begins. Apologies for the long buildup.

One Halloween night, we had a party for the staff, and any students who wanted to attend, at a pub right down the street from the office. Come to think of it, we were tacitly encouraged to invite students in order to keep enrollment up. While I avoided inviting female students, Drew invited **all** of his female students, particularly the young ones. Now any young male (I was 22, Drew was 25) with half a brain would avoid inviting young female students to any situation involving alcohol, and Drew either looked completely oblivious or low-key creepy. As I said before, I try to give anyone new the benefit of the doubt and elect to go with the less cynical option i.e. completely oblivious.

Moving on.

The night was pretty exciting and I got to know the students on a more personal level in that I learned more about Korean university life and a little bit more of my parents' culture. I would be lying if I said that it was tough ignoring the obvious advances from young, scantily clad, female students who were in my age group, especially the attractive ones. I still recall one uni girl getting a little to handsy with me and having to put another male student my age between us. One night of sex isn't worth potentially losing a job.

It was at that moment that I noticed Drew was trying hard and miserably failing at charming the girls he invited. And when I say that he was trying hard, I mean he was trying really hard and the girls were visibly creeped but politely smiling and forcing laughter since he wad their teacher after all.  Naturally, I try to help steer the conversation to less uncomfortable territory and things seem to get better. But through it all there was one girl who was talking to me, partially out of interest, but mostly to avoid Drew. Unfortunately, Drew starts to push harder for this girl and the girl pulls me closer. Seeing the situation, I don't resist.

Last call comes around and she asks me to stick around and walk her home even with Drew insisting that he do it. Just to placate the man, I proposed that the three of us walk him home first in hopes that she would be able to let him down easy, with him drunkenly stumbling back into his apartment and forgetting about it all the next morning.

Bad decision. The whole time, he's trying to put his arm around her, ignoring the fact that she's been holding onto my arm the whole time. He even proposed inviting her inside to give a ""massage."" Thankfully, he didn't try to kiss her. Thankfully.

We end up dropping him off and as we're walking to the main street to hail a cab, she still holds on to my arm. Almost reflexively I ask what's going on and what exactly happened between her and Drew. It turns out, she wasn't a student and she just happened to meet him at a language exchange for university-age students and they had been in casual contact for a month. Note that she wanted to strictly be friends, but Drew wasn't getting the message. At that moment, she suggested going for another round of drinks to shake off the creepiness of the situation, all while giving the sexiest flirty grin. Huge plot twist. Needless to say, we ended up going home together and she ended up becoming my girlfriend.

Fast forward a few months.

Now for the sake of tact, we kept our relationship *very* low-key, but eventually then-girlfriend had to spill the beans to Drew and let him down for good. Things did not go well after that. Up until that time, I had not met a more viciously vindictive piece of shit in my life. Forget the racist asshole fucks I went to high school with. Forget the douchey frat stars from college. Fuck. This. Dude. Every little thing he could ""catch"" me doing, he reported. No tie? Reported. A minute late? Reported. Giving private lessons for a little side dough? Reported. And for real, fuck that neckbearded piece of shit for that last one since I really needed the money. Did I forget to mention that he would drop snide comments about ""nice guys"" and ""douchebags"" whenever I was around? Talk about a toxic work environment. And when the new boss moved in, you can bet that he did everything to ruin my reputation as soon as he could. But even through all of that, I held my breath because I was moving on to a higher-paying translation job anyways. And honestly, I felt somewhat sorry for him. Being morbidly obese is already a deal-breaker and lacking social skills pretty much destroys your chances. But even then, fuck that dude. Getting rejected isn't any reason to try getting someone fired.

**TL;DR:** I inadvertently became a Chad who ""took"" a neckbeard's Stacy. The asshole subsequently tried to ruin my reputation in retaliation."
6xtdyp,476,2017-09-03,For my birthday I gave myself the greatest gift of all: I beat obesity.,Uhl-zak,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6xtdyp/for_my_birthday_i_gave_myself_the_greatest_gift/,"Hello everybody!

Recently I haven't been as active here as I used to be. Mostly because I am busy as hell due to my internship and other private engagements I need to see to. Today I have returned with good news though! After a nice and unexpected ""whoosh"" I have successfully reached my birthday goal AND according to my BMI I am not obese anymore!

Okay, so what happened and how did I do it?

I have lost a significant amount of weight in the past though that was short lived and I gained all the weight back when I went through a very difficult time in my life and took to stress-eating as a way to seek comfort and to cope with issues. Last year I decided that enough was enough and I started working on my weight again, however, life threw a bunch of curveballs at me again and I repeatedly fell off the wagon and tried again and again.

In January I broke it off with my ex-boyfriend and with a big source of stress gone from my life, I could fully commit to working on my goals again. I started counting my calories and adding a little bit of exercise here and there. Then after I had lost 10kg within not even three months, I gained some confidence and started seeing some differences, so I was even more committed to this thing. I decided that by my birthday at the end of August I want to be at 85kg. At the time I didn't even realize that this was going to put me right on the line between obesity and overweight on the BMI chart.

In June and July I started taking regular walks, both because I really wanted to make use of the nicer summer weather and as a newfound way to cope with stress. I had quickly even become sort of addicted to walking. Then walking wasn't enough anymore and in July I started the C25K program where I managed to make a lot of progress and I could keep up nicely with the pace of the program.

My weightloss started to slow down in that time though. I suspect that it's because of the added exercise and fun stuff like water-retention and whatnot. It was a little frustrating to see the scale not move or only move in very small steps, though I knew about plateaus and I know that if I keep doing what I am doing, the weight will come off. I honestly didn't expect to make it to 85kg in time for my birthday, but I took solace in the fact that I lost 20kg (~44lbs) by that time, which is a great feat already.

Well, a few days before my birthday I stepped on the scale and....I was below my goal weight! A.W.E.S.O.M.E!

This whoosh has continued for a few days now and after checking in with my BMI I am now just baaaaarely outside of the obesity territory.

I am not obese anymore. I never want to be obese anymore. I never will be obese again.

Now I noticed so many changes about my body. I have more endurance, I can actually jog for 20 minutes at a time and it's my willpower and not my body that surrenders before the time is up. I can dress better and I can finally wear the things I have always wanted to wear in the past. My fall/autumn coat from four years ago finally fits me again, just in time for the weather to get colder again. My collarbones are popping out and I love them! My face isn't covered by a layer of fat anymore! My double-chin is gone! I can start feeling my ribs and my hip bones! Life is SO. MUCH. BETTER.

However, I know that I am not done yet. I am only at the halfway point and I know that it will get increasingly more difficult to lose the weight as I continue to get smaller. I am ready for that. My lifestyle truly changed and I am exercising regularly and making a point of following up on my exercise. I consciously schedule it into my days and it's the first thing I do after waking up. Now I will just have to continue sticking to it but I got some amazing support in that regard, so I am pretty hopeful.

My next goal is to lose another 10kg (~20-ish lbs) until New Year's Eve. Ultimately I want to give myself an even better gift for my next birthday: The gift of being at a normal weight.

Here I have some pictures for you guys. I REALLY need to take a new progress pic, I know, but I haven't had the time to do so lately :(

My [progress pic](https://i.imgur.com/zgMIf7i.png), which I posted a few months ago. A [selfie](https://i.imgur.com/ywonIn3.jpg) from when I started my journey and another [selfie](https://i.imgur.com/XCvCj8J.jpg) from four weeks ago."

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

I am studying computer science in India, currently in my 5th semester. I'm starting to apply for some research internships in foreign universities(Europe and US mostly), however I find myself hitting a wall when it comes to networking.

For e.g what or how should I email the professors who don't even know me ? What should I do to break the ice ? or How to start a conversation with them. Especially how should I convince them for me being a potential candidate for the postion in their team ? Many a times, I am afraid that I might ask them questions that may sound too silly or dumb."

I hope this email finds you well and happy. After checking to see if I had any messages on my account the only one that was on there was from you. What you said about finding the truth, or in my case telling the truth, well, it really stabbed my heart. So I'm going to come clean to you. And I'm going to tell you the truth. Actually, it is a long story and I will give you the abbreviated version with as much detail as possible. The only reason that I'm doing this is because the way your admonishment pierced my heart I just feel like I want to tell you the absolute honest truth.  AND ASK YOU TO FORGIVE ME!!!!!
 
Here are the facts. I have never been in the army. I have worked on several Army Post. I have also worked on a couple of navy bases. Little Creek Amphibious Base and Norfolk operational base. I have always been the ultimate patriotic citizen. When I was 27 years old I met a guy at the Naval Operational base in Norfolk Virginia who was NIS Officer.  It was my first time to actually act out sexually with a guy. I had always wanted to ever since I was an early teen but I was always scared. Being raised staunchly Southern Baptist in Alabama I knew that I would burn in hell or so they say. But this guy and I had a three-year relationship even though I was married and he was seeing a girl. It was the best of both worlds. I truly fell in love with him. He taught me so much about love and he taught me so much about sex with a guy. We both kept this totally secret and private. There was no such thing back then as don't ask don't tell. The only thing the Navy would do was boot you out in the flash of a heartbeat.
 
He was eventually promoted and he moved away. This just killed my heart. It would be another three years before I actually met another guy that was in the army. This too, was in Newport News Virginia. This gentleman was stationed at Fort Monroe. He was an officer. And yes, he was much much a gentleman. He was married as well and we had a private relationship for almost 5 years. Due to Desert Storm he moved away and I never saw him again even though we stayed in contact with each other on email as often as we could the first year but then those feelings for each other just begin to wane.
 
I went a very long time without having another boyfriend or anyone close to me as far as a relationship. Yes, I will admit that I had a few one-night stands with people that I had met getting their number off of a bathroom wall at the mall or meeting them at a park. During the nineties cruising was the way that you found someone to have sex with. The internet was relatively new and cell phones were relatively new and there was no such thing as Scruff, Grindr, Craigslist or social medias. I decided in the late 90’s that I would honor my vows to my wife and I would be a dad to my kids. I had always been a good dad and that always been a good husband. I provided very well for my family.  And I’d just overcome these gay feelings. 
 
I moved the family to Arkansas because the company that I was working for decided to start building hotels. I built two hotels in Conway Arkansas. I fell in love with this area out here and we settled in Bentonville Arkansas and made that are home. My daughter and my son were both very intelligent. My son began to get very interested in the United States Army and also the CIA. He was taking Arabic in high school and eventually took Arabic at the University of Arkansas. He filled out a mountain of paperwork, as my memory serves me it was about 30 pages long, as an intern with the CIA. Also, because of social media I began to speak with a couple of people that were Army Associated since my son was very interested in AR me. He fluctuated between Army Special Forces and the CIA.
 
I met a guy online that was actually training for qualifications. I began to ask him questions and I was sincere about the questions I was asking where only for my son's benefit. Nothing sexual about this guy and me. He gave me a ton of information to give my son. After about 6 months of getting to know him he told me that he was actually going to go and would not be able to make any Communications but he had a buddy that he wanted me to talk to and he had talked to this guy and ask him would he give us some direction. This gentleman was already in Special Forces at the time. He was 26 years old. He introduced me to Skype. We got to know each other very well and during this time my son lost interest in Special Forces and on top of that the CIA was very interested in him because of his Arabic skills. We’ve always been a patriotic family.  Sidebar, he eventually decided not to go into the CIA because he felt that he wanted to go to Dallas Theological Seminary and get his master's degree in theology. Thus, he did and he recently graduated and is on his way to Duke University to get his Doctorate. Kinmuan and I became extremely good friends and one thing led to another and before you know it we both were telling each other about our same sex attractions that we had with guys and we both revealed that we had attractions for each other. We had known each other about a year when we started talking sexually. We started acting out on Skype, beating off with each other, talking dirty to each other, making videos to send each other.
 
Long story short we became very intimate. When he came home he would visit his family and then he would fly to Northwest Arkansas and stay at the Embassy Suites and we would have sex 3 to 4 times a day. We went to movies we went to Beaver Lake we went hiking we rode horses we did all kinds of stuff together. I literally gave my heart to Kinmuan. During the time of our relationship he was relocated from the Afghanistan front to Djibouti Africa. He still came home once a year for about 30 days and we would see each other physically but we talked on Skype every chance we got when he was not on some kind of special operation. This is where it gets a little ambiguous and a little complicated.
 
I was building a large-scale development in Russellville Arkansas and I met a guy that I talked to you about named CPT_Crunch_RET.  I hired him as a laborer with our Construction Company. He was an IT student at Arkansas Tech. I was having trouble with my MacBook Pro and I asked him one day would he take a look at it. He did and he fixed it. It was on a Thursday. He and I are staying in an RV along with another gentleman that was a superintendent that worked under me. That guy worked Monday through Thursday and left to go home on Thursday evenings. I would stay until noon on Friday and then go home and take CPT_Crunch_RET and drop him off in Little Rock with his dad. On that Thursday night that he had worked on my computer he asked me who Kinmuan was. I knew then that he had found some files with my computer that would absolutely reveal that Kinmuan and I were lovers. So I told him the truth. He revealed to me that he, too, had same-sex attraction but being 20 years old he had never acted out on it. Long story short, I told Kinmuan that weekend and Kinmuan asked me to have sex with him and video it and send it to him, we not only started doing that but we would even have live sexual contact while Kinmuan watched. He would tell us what to do and we would do it. So now I began to fall in love with another guy while at the same time I was in love with Kinmuan. Crazy I know. Complicated at best.  CPT_Crunch_RET eventually went into the army because Kinmuan influenced him. I went to see him at BCT family day and also to his graduation. I had gone to a MEPS with him.  He scored 96 on his ASVAB and the recruiter’s thought that was sensational. But I'm getting ahead of myself because a year before he went to meps Kinmuan's brother called me from Florida, his name is TFTF, and he told me that Kinmuan had been killed in an accident. In a helicopter. He asked me to respect the fact that his mom and dad had known nothing about Kinmuan being gay. He told me that he had seen videos and correspondence and texts and emails over the years between Kinmuan and me. He had Kinmuan's passwords for all of his accounts. Kinmuan loved his brother very much. He also loved his brother's little boy, his nephew. Anyway when TFTF called me and told me about Kinmuan I immediately called CPT_Crunch_RET and told him. We both cried but I had to internalize it because remember I am married at the time. Kinmuan had been introduced to our family, we had his picture on our Christmas tree, he had sent my son all kinds of army stuff and paraphernalia, and he literally stole the heart of my family. At the same time CPT_Crunch_RET had done the same thing and I had CPT_Crunch_RET over to our house about every other weekend. He would sleep in the guest bedroom but no one knew that we had an affair going on.  My family basically adopted him, took him in and accepted him, but literally had no idea we were lovers.
 
16 months ago, my wife found my journal.  I had planned a trip to go to Texas and spend the week with CPT_Crunch_RET before he went to Kuwait. She knew of all those plans and of course when she found my journal she confronted me and wanted to know the truth and I just came clean with her about Kinmuan and CPT_Crunch_RET. I told her everything from the early days of Travis, the NIS officer in the Navy I told her everything. She obviously wanted me to tell the kids and I did. They've taken it very hard. My wife filed for divorce immediately and went to CPT_Crunch_RET Kuwait. While he was in Kuwait he met an army captain and they had an affair and he told me about it and told me when he got back we met in Conway Arkansas and he told me that he wanted to break up that he was going to date this guy. Of course I was devastated and still wanting to love him I had lost my family then I'd lost my lover.
 
So here in the last few months I wanted to start looking again. I chose to take some of Kinmuan's masculinity that I loved so very much and emulate him. STUPID IDEA!!!!  Thus, by saying that I was in the Army and Special Forces. That literally right now breaks my heart that I chose to do something so stupid. Kinmuan would be totally ashamed of me. I am ashamed of myself. I can promise you this Rustyfingers; I will never ever pretend to be something that I am not again. Your simple admonishment opened up my mind to think what Kinmuan would think and he would be disgusted with me as I am with myself. I just ask this, because you seem to be one of the classiest guys and in several ways you remind me of the type of guy that I really like, so I just ask you would you please forgive me! I am very sorry for being so careless and so stupid. I honestly simply ask you to forgive me from the bottom of my heart. And with that I'll leave it in your hands. I know you don't know me; all in all I'm a hell of a guy. I'm a very compassionate, loving, forgiving, sincere guy. I am embarrassed about this and I just throw myself at your mercy and two things, I promise to never do this again and I ask you to forgive me!

RESPECTFULLY from my heart to yours,

6xviwr,8,2017-09-03,30 days in... feels like just yesterday I started.,hazzinator,pornfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/6xviwr/30_days_in_feels_like_just_yesterday_i_started/,"Finally hit that 30 day milestone everyone talks about! Funny thing is, it doesn't even feel like a milestone for me. I didn't even realise I was up to 30 days until I casually popped in here and noticed.


Some background, I'm 20 years old, have been watching porn since around 14. The first few years were pretty vanilla for me, mostly sticking to softcore porn and music videos with attractive girls in. Soon, as many addicts can profess, my tastes got a little more unconventional. Not to go into details, but around the age of 18-19 I got into some really weird, disgusting stuff that makes me sick to even think about now. I didn't see anything wrong with it at the time, the taboo nature of it felt ecstatic to me. I would masturbate more or less every day, with a tight grip, aiming to finish as quickly as possible before a member of my family managed to walk into my room.


I never really spoke to girls when I was younger, my life revolved around obsessive video gaming. Because girls didn’t play video games back then (in my mind), I had no reason to talk to them. In fact, I saw no reason to interact with girls unless I happened to have the intention of being “more than friends” with them (old me would probably have been a subscriber to /r/incels). They weren’t “human” in my mind, and it was a toxic way of thinking.


I would be unbearable nervous and unable to form coherent conversation when women talked to me. I would resort to firing off never-ending questions to keep a conversation going, because that’s what the internet said girls like. I had no interests, skills or hobbies and I didn’t consider myself an interesting person to talk about. Keep the conversation on the other person, then they won’t ever have to find out how utterly boring my life is, right?


My first year of university was rough. I made many mistakes and burned a lot of bridges. I did well in studies, but I didn’t care about that. I just wanted to have fun, which I wasn’t having. I hardly spoke to girls and kept to myself most days. Many of my friends were pairing off with their second or third girlfriends, while I sat here jerking it 2-3 times a day to all manner of filthy shit. Loneliness and boredom became second nature to me, and I fell into a sea of my own self pity. Suffice to say, I did not enjoy that year.


The next year was a complete flip around however. I found a new set of friends who were amazing and helped me begin my journey into coming out of my shell. I met an amazing woman who actually had an interest in me, which I couldn’t believe! Oh, and she was confident as hell, making almost all the first moves when it came to flirting and interaction, something which I would never have done. I fell head over heels in love with her. However, things were not to be as my mental and sexual state were still in tatters. For everything I did right, I made 20 mistakes. I was unable to get it up in bed, I was overly clingy and I still had no interests or hobbies. The spark didn’t remain long once she had enough of a chance to get to see who I really was. The number of times I was dishonest with her, making things up and hiding my true feelings to make myself seem a more interesting person were countless. Even though I didn’t realise it at the time, I needed her to fill up that gaping loneliness in my heart, because I sure as hell couldn’t do it myself. Textbook definition of neediness right there. When she split things off, I had a lot of time to reflect on what had happened and why it had happened. I started looking to improve my life, soon realising that to be happy with someone else, I first had to be happy with myself. I don't regret the time I spent with her, or the mistakes I made. They were a necessary part of me growing up, I wouldn't be here today writing this if it wasn't for her coming into my life.


I pushed myself for my exams, scoring excellently across the board. I landed an internship job for the next year. I actively went out and socialised. I went to events and nights out with my friends, when before I would politely decline to stay in. I said yes to everything I could. Soon, I started noticing other things. Through all my troubles, porn was always there to provide a soft, dopamine fuelled blanket for my emotions. It wasn’t long before I started to put together pieces of the puzzle in my head. Many of my problems with women stemmed from my addictive behaviour, from video games when I was younger, to porn when I was older. The realisation came in a single, all-encompassing moment of clarity. I then made the quickest decision I have ever made in my life. From that point on, I said I never want to watch porn again. Oddly enough, It’s been plain sailing so far. I haven’t felt urges to watch at at all, I just don’t care about it anymore.


-**Horny as all hell:** Before, I wouldn’t care for real girls. I would only get boners when I was sitting hunched over in my chair watching porn. Now, just the idea of slow, passionate kissing with a partner turns me on like nothing could. I actively have to stop myself from staring at attractive girls on the street when they walk by. This can be seen as a positive or a negative depending on how you’re approaching your abstinence. A NoFapper would consider these thoughts vile and try to block them, while I consider them perfectly natural. If I feel horny when I'm home alone, I'll channel that energy into something productive.

-**Penis sensitivity has gone up:** When I did manage to have sex with the girl I spoke about before, I had to use Viagra. Even when hard, I hardly felt anything downstairs when having sex. That warm, gooey, incredible feeling that a vagina should feel like felt closer to wet cardboard to me. It was definitely wet, so I doubt it was a problem the girl’s arousal, but I was just completely numb to it. I’m almost certain I had death grip syndrome. Now, even a light stroke when hard feels extremely sensitive. My whole body tenses up, and it feels amazing to masturbate with a decent amount of lube and light touches. As an aside, I have been masturbating once a week, and so far I feel it has been the right decision.

-**More relaxed mental state:** It felt like a fog had lifted over my head after the first 2 weeks. I knew what was wrong with me, I knew how to fix it, and I was actively making efforts to improve my life. I felt at peace with myself, something which I hadn’t felt for a long time. There’s a certain satisfaction of handing your phone over to your friend to show him something without having to worry about him viewing something he shouldn’t. It’s understated but a nice feeling!

-**More free time:** What’s that, it’s 9PM on a Saturday and you don’t know what to do? Normally you’d go and have a quick wank, then feel lazy and unmotivated for the rest of the night until you pass out at 3AM. Instead, I get up, do a set of press ups, clean my room, pick up my guitar and work on learning a new song!

-**Feel more confident in talking to women:** Maybe it’s not the fact that quitting porn has made it easier, but the fact that quitting porn was a small part in a massive paradigm shift for me. That shift is what has made talking to women easier. Not much to say here other than make yourself interesting! Get out there and have some experiences, gain some hobbies, live life only for yourself first and foremost. Great conversations come from sharing your own feelings and stories with other people, and to get to that point you need to acquire both of those. So start saying yes to everything and get the fuck out into the real world. The rest will come naturally 😉


I told myself at the start I would reward myself for reaching this point, but now I don’t really care. Porn is out of my life, and milestones no longer exist for me. I didn’t expect to write my own life story here but hey, if it helps someone along the way then it can’t hurt.

To anyone struggling with this addiction, it’s important to remember that porn is probably one of many things that negatively impacted your life. You first have to improve yourself as a whole before you can get rid of porn entirely. If you don’t, at the first sign of trouble or conflict you'll go right back to your old ways rather than dealing with it in a mature, sustainable manner. I highly suggest picking up some self help books, I’ve started reading Models by Mark Manson and it’s been a game changer. I highly recommend it. Good luck to everyone, I know you guys can do it! :)

6xvnzl,69,2017-09-03,I've been researching this Desi doctor who lived in Oklahoma 100 years ago,anirvan,ABCDesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/6xvnzl/ive_been_researching_this_desi_doctor_who_lived/,"I'm a South Asian American history nerd, and love digging up pieces of our shared history through archival research and oral history.

I've been fascinated by the 100-year-old story of a Desi ""Okie from Muskogee."" Here's what I've figured out so far.

---

# 1. Surendra moves from Calcutta to New York

**Surendra Nath Chatterjee** was born into a Hindu Brahmin Bengali family in **Calcutta, India on August 15, 1892**. He was enrolled at [Scottish Church College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Church_College) in Calcutta as of 1905.

Chatterjee **immigrated to the United States in 1913**, when he was about **21 years old**. He **started studying engineering** at [Cooper Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Union) in New York City.

 

# 2. Surendra moves to Oklahoma, tries to gain citizenship

In 1915, Chatterjee attended a speech extolling the medical profession by the President of the University of Oklahoma. A newspaper described Chatterjee as being **so inspired, that he moved to Oklahoma that same year to study medicine**. He started studying medicine at the [University of Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma), most likely at in [Norman, OK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma#Norman_campus).

Chatterjee **applied for citizenship in 1915**. The U.S. entered World War I in 1917. Chatterjee **[registered for the draft](https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GYRB-3D24?cc=1968530)** that year, when he was about 25. In his draft registration, he said he was a junior in Medicine, employed by the state university, had no wife or dependents, and was of medium height, medium weight, with black hair and black eyes.

In his draft registration, Chatterjee wrote that he had **been a head constable in the Bengal Police**, working for the government. (I'm not sure how that works, given that he came to the US at age 21.) Later that month, a local newspaper, the Cleveland County Enterprise, [printed Chatterjee's name](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc108635/m1/5/) among the list of draft registrants who ""answered the nation's call."" He ended up joining the [Student Army Training Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Officers%27_Training_Corps#Student_Army_Training_Corps_.28SATC.29) (like the ROTC).

 

# 3. Surendra gets his M.D., but skips out on Harvard

By 1918, Chatterjee started working as an assistant at the pathology lab, and later, as an intern at the University hospital. He **[received his M.D.](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc107453/m1/3/)** in June 1919, and was **[profiled in a front page story in the _Oklahoma City Times_](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc171142/m1/1/)**. The article described how he was **set to enter Harvard in the fall** to begin a two year degree program in public health, and that he planned to return to Calcutta afterwards, to ""enter the service of his people.""

But Chatterjee **didn't end up at Harvard**, because the [Census shows](http://us-census.mooseroots.com/l/37377936/Surendra-Chatterjee) Chatterjee as still living in Oklahoma as of January 1920.

 

# 4. Surendra marries a White woman from Mississippi

According to the 1920 Census, **Chatterjee was working as a general practice physician**, renting a place **in Muskogee, Oklahoma**.

And he was apparently  **living with his wife [Gladys Chatterjee](http://us-census.mooseroots.com/l/37377933/Gladys-Chatterjee), a 28-year-old White woman** born in Mississippi. Surendra and Gladys presumably got married sometime right after he graduated.

Surendra and Gladys Chatterjee lived in Muskogee for several more years; I see their names in 1921, 1922, and 1925 city directories.

 

# 5. The trail goes cold…

For a long while, that was the last record I could find for them. I scoured death records, city directories, social security indices, census records, and more.

Then I looked at the [American Medical Association's Deceased Physicians File](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/genealogy/amabiopage.html), and found an end to the story.

**Surendra Nath Chatterjee apparently return to Calcutta, India in 1927, when he was ~35 years old. He never practiced medicine in the U.S. again**.

The American Medical Association's staff say that Chatterjee was **""declared deceased as of February 25, 1961""—when he was age 68**. (It's not clear if that was the actual date of death, or just when they lost touch with him.)

 

---

# Open questions, and why this matters

There are so many open questions:

* Did Surendra stay on in Calcutta?
* Did he and Gladys travel to Calcutta together? If so, what were their lives like?
* Did they have kids? Or do they gave other living family?
* What was the deal with Surendra telling the U.S. government that he was previously a head constable in the Bengal police? And was he related to the ""Surendra Nath Chatterjee"" who was apparently the first Indian Commissioner of Police post-independence?

I see Desis continuously ask questions like ""am I Desi or American,"" ""is it OK to switch majors/careers and follow my passions,"" ""will my family hate me if I marry a non-Desi,"" and ""why don't White women like me?""  For me, it's helpful to look at stories from the past, because they shed light on these questions.

South Asians have been living in the US since the 1680s. We have roots here. We've built rich and complex lives here. Our narratives matter. We're not the first to grapple with these issues, and we won't be the last.

6xvxmy,3,2017-09-03,I've been betrayed and abandoned so many times now,zxcverty,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6xvxmy/ive_been_betrayed_and_abandoned_so_many_times_now/,"I'm still not over the ex that I dated almost three years ago. He strung me along even after we broke up and sometimes gave me hope that we could be together in the future. He told me that he had feelings for me but the time wasn't right, that he needed to be on his own, etc. Now he has a new girlfriend, he posts photos of her online, he didn't want to do that with me. He didn't even dare to tell me about her, I had to find out from seeing photos online.

I thought that he would be the one. The one who I would be able to trust, the one who wouldn't abandon me. All of my previous relationships were absolute shit. I really thought he would be the exception.

How the hell am I supposed to ever trust anyone ever again? I feel so abandoned. I really really try every day to feel better. I meditate, I do yoga, I run, I eat well. For most of the day I feel kinda alright and if I start thinking about him I can notice the thought and let it go. But at some point I'll just relax for two seconds and then my thoughts start spiraling and this panicky feeling of abandonment and despair kicks in and I start crying hysterically and it keeps going for hours.

I feel so ashamed that I'm still not over him. And ashamed that I'm still not feeling better after years and years of battling depression. I've been more or less depressed all my life, really, with glimpses of hope here and there that have been extinguished by various men. Everything else in my life is going well - I'm studying something I really love doing and I'm about to start an internship. I am grateful for all of that but there is still this big hole inside me where my heart used to be.

I am trying so hard. I feel sort of better but still so far from good."
6xwx1i,18,2017-09-03,I still resent my sister,dearflynn,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/6xwx1i/i_still_resent_my_sister/,"Hello all, I don't know if this is the right place to post this but : it is going to be a very long post. (TL;DR at the end)

I have always been close to my sister, we were always together and I’ve always thought we had a good relationship. But last year I moved away (for reasons I will explain later), things are different ever since and I began to realize things never really were that good.

First, let me introduce us. I’m 26 and my sister is 28 but people always think I am the big sister, and I have to admit I do feel that way too. 

When I was a kid I remember we were really close but there where times when she would make fun of me endlessly until I had to be violent, that is when she would go to our parents and say I was mean to her. I remember when I was 7 I had an important allergic reaction (I could have died), my whole body and face doubled in volume and it took weeks to go back to normal. During that time, she insistently called me fat, ugly and a « potato head » (which I know sounds stupid, but as a kid, and because of the circumstances, I didn’t like being told I looked like a potato), I think this traumatized me to some extent because I’ve had really unhealthy eating habits since that I am still working on today.
Once, she showed me messages exchanged with a friend of mine (she kind of had a crush on him) and I saw that she said bad things about me (again, that I was « mean »). This made me wonder what else she could have told other friends we had in common. During our teen years we didn’t fight a lot but it was always about the same things : she stole my clothes and I never managed to make her understand I took it as a lack of respect.
Now, I have to say that she and I are completely different. I’m introverted when she is more sociable, I prefer to have a small circle of great friends when she can not stand to be alone, I’m responsible and she can be... forgetful, I always was a good student when she had to repeat a grade (making things so that she ended up being at the same level that I was in high-school). Overall I feel like my parents put more pressure on me because I always had to be the bigger person and was « expected » to succeed/be wise/understanding...etc 
When we were preparing for our A-levels, my mom put us in so much pressure that I cried, later that day she went to my room to apologized and said that she was actually worried my sister wouldn’t get the exam so she was giving both of us a hard time to avoid being hard on my sister only. It made me feel like shit for my sister and even more pressured to get my exam.
After that I went to a different city for studies that actually weren’t good for me and ditched two years later. I went back to my parents for a year and the feeling of failure made me feel really low, I felt very depressed for a year which my parents never understood. Around this time, my sister came back home for a few days, she was living in London and told me to come with her. As I was feeling useless here, I accepted. In London I slowly managed to turn things around, decided to study again and got my Degree there. If living with my sister was fine at first, it got more and more difficult. 

The first year of my studies, I didn’t have a job (new studies, foreign language, I wanted to focus on that) but my parents gave me enough money to survive the month. She would insist I come party with her, saying she’d buy me drinks but she would always bring that up anytime we argued saying she payed for everything and was doing everything. The second year I struggled to find a part-time job and she made me feel like shit for it until I found a stable job.

Overall, I was the one in contact with agencies that rented us the different places we lived in. When signing the contracts, the full responsibility was mine, when it went badly with the realtors I had to take care of it myself as she claimed to « not understand these things ». Same for the bills, providers and broadband. If we had any issue, I automatically was the one who had to call. I managed to take a few things off my shoulders when we rented the last flat we lived together in: I only gave my sister’s contact to the landlady.
She was always late paying her taxes and one time she got a trial because she ignored the warning letters even I told her she needed to take care of that. Guess who had to go to the Council and fix it ?
In spite of all of this, she would sometimes complain that I was a burden and she was taking care of everything, the only one cooking or the only one cleaning... totally not acknowledging what I was doing or that I had work to do too. 
I forgot to tell you: we were sharing a one bedroom flat. Most of the time I would sleep on the couch in the living-room when I wanted more privacy, but there was always a point when I would miss sleeping in a bed. My sister, also always invited people to sleep over at our place. Once, she went out and I stayed at home as I had to go to Uni in the morning. She came back  late with a bunch of people, came in my bedroom with a girl and told her she could sleep in the bed with me and the others would sleep on the couch. I was just shocked and really mad ! That night I told her her behavior was not okay and I didn’t feel respected. I made her promise this would never happen again. But she kept inviting people over, and hosting friends who came from abroad all the time even though we didn’t even each have our own space. She kept doing it and I kept accepting it for a while until I was fed up again but she wouldn’t hear me. We fought more often about this and her overall disrespect. She would often retort I wasn’t easy to live with either and when I asked her to tell me what I was doing wrong so I could change it and make her feel better she would say she doesn’t have an exemple in mind. One time she said she didn’t like the fact I left my empty glass on the table.

Around that time last year, I was sick as hell and as she was gonna go out that day I told her I didn't want to contaminate her and I'd be sleeping on the couch. She rang at the door at 3 in the morning because she forgot her keys (because, yeah, this happened from time to time also...). She had also brought a friend of hers who didn’t want to take the bus home. 
At this point it was really too much (we had different people over for months, she was basically treating me as if I was an appliance in her flat), I was tired of having the same conversation over and over, so the next morning I told her we needed to have rules : we don’t tell people they can stay over until we both have our own room and we try to be considerate to our roommate. She said I was being annoying for always bringing up something that happened one time two years ago (referring to the first incident when she brought a girl in my bed in the middle of the night). 

My sister only ever says sorry [this way] (https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRzJmX5rH5Jbzuo/giphy.gif) when I confront her really hard about being disrespectful to me and this time added she can’t change the way she is anyway. That’s when I realized she really didn’t give a shit about me or my wellbeing.
Following this conversation, she avoided me for days. I was the sickest I had ever been  (didn’t even go to work) and I was staying on the couch all day, when she came back home she would go straight to the bedroom. When I started to feel better, I went to the bedroom while she was at work and found empty snack bags (going to the kitchen would mean she had to see me, so potentially talk to me). When she got back home, I told her this needed to stop, she said I was the one ignoring her. I said it was crazy how she could never admit her wrongs and she didn’t give a shit about me, cause if she did she would have checked on me when I was sick or at least asked how I was feeling. Again she said « well, sorry I’m that way » to which I replied didn’t mean anything if she wasn’t doing anything to make things better. I told her I was tired and afraid I might end up hating her if she kept doing this to me and I really don’t want that. 

A few days before, I had received an offer for an internship back in my hometown, considering the situation I felt like nothing was holding me back in London. I accepted but only announced it to my sister about a week later saying I was out of here by the end of the next month. 
Once when we were out with friends, she said (in front of me this time) that I was mean and I never let her do anything.
It was around that time she also met a guy on Tinder and things got moving pretty fast. One morning, I was falling asleep (I had worked the night shift) when I heard someone come home. I knew it wasn’t my sister because she was at work. I heard footsteps and started to get scared, so I went to the bedroom door and asked who was here. It was her new boyfriend and he had a few boxes with him, it looked like he was moving in. I was puzzled but didn’t say anything as I thought my sister would have told me if a guy I didn’t know was moving in. Anyway, the next time I saw my sister (different working hours) the guy was still home so I took her aside and asked what was going on :

Me: What’s happening, is he living here ?

Her: [I don’t knoooooow... like](https://media.giphy.com/media/6qmOIwxEJnt96/giphy.gif)

Me: Well, I think it’s simple. Either you told him he could move in or he decided he could. Now you need to tell me which is which so I can react accordingly.

Same answer from her: she doesn’t « [knooooow](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT77XM7ww5KWqVKpdm/giphy.gif) ». At this point I just go silent, there’s nothing more to say or do and I know I’m moving out in a week anyway. She came to talk to me a few days later saying she wanted to talk to me. She asked what was wrong because she felt like I didn’t like her boyfriend. I told her the problem was her, not him and we already talked about it but she just ignored it. She basically ignored it every time I tried to ask her to be more considerate.

Since I moved out, I’m so relieved and I feel like a huge burden has been taken off my shoulders. I wasn’t feeling like myself anymore, I think my sister’s behavior forced me to be more serious and responsable, I had to give her attention and support her all the time and fix her mistakes when I felt like I was on my own. Now I feel like I can have more fun and focus on me. 
The only problem is that I still love her, she's my sister and we did have good times but she pushed me to the edge and now I feel resentment to the point that I sometimes want to be mean or belittle her. I know it’s petty, and I know I shouldn’t but something between us broke before my moving out. I don’t want to hate her, I know we are better off apart, that’s for sure, but our family is still very close and I’m scared this whole thing will destroy us. 
It's been a year I moved out and when she visited recently I was surprised that I still feel anger. I don’t know how to make things better or if it’s even possible. Maybe I need therapy.

Thank you for reading and any advice or suggestion is welcome. 

TD;LR: After three years living in a one bedroom flat with my sister, I realized our relationship is  not perfect but toxic. Even though I love her, one year after I moved away in bad terms I still resent her for treating me the way she did. My family is close and I'm scared to destroy us all for something that should be in the past."

*SEPTEMBER 3RD*

It was a crisp September morning when it all began to boil over. Everybody sullenly took their places, knowing that they had no choice but to fall in line with the company’s new tyrannical doctrine. However, /u/Chefjones had yet to arrive for work. An act of rebellion, I suppose? Everyone began to wonder, until any and all theories were swiftly swept aside by an email from Administration.

&gt;**/u/Chefjones IS DEAD. LET THIS BE A MESSAGE TO THOSE WHO REFUSE TO COMPLY.**

Panic swept through the building.

There were some who continued to do as they were told, showing their allegiance to the Solstice Administration and its new regime. The rest, the petitioners, began to assemble their Insurrection to restore the company they remembered. And there were some who tried to leave, namely the Interns, only to find that the building was locked down. They would have no choice but to fight. Though, some showed promise to both sides.

The company had divided. This wasn't a workplace anymore, it was a battleground. 

The war for Solstice Inc. had begun.

6xysw4,2,2017-09-04,Sort of an odd situation. Transferred to a new firm (Grant Thornton) from a fairly large mid tier firm in the south. Need advice on how to ask to be considered for senior,chachawonderboy,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6xysw4/sort_of_an_odd_situation_transferred_to_a_new/,"So basically this is my situation and I am not exactly sure how to go about making my point clear with the firm

In January-April of 2016 I interned with Grant Thornton and declined the offer. Long story but basically i had to get the fuck away from some family who were causing a serious negative in my life.

I declined the offer and accepted a mid-tier state/regional accounting firm and started work January 2017. In October of 2016 my family left the city and I got back into contact with GT and asked if they had any availabilties. They contacted me in December and offered me a starting staff position in September of 2017.

The problem was I had already accepted the job offer with the regional - but the pay at GT was a bit better and honestly after my family left It was exactly where I wanted to be.

So I accepted the offer and started working with the mid-tier firm until about 2 weeks ago when I put in my 2 weeks.

So now I am starting with the same intern class (i interned during my masters) but I have a year of busy season experience ahead of them. Essentially - the pay at this point is for a first year staff, and I agreed to it without issue. The pay isn't my primary focus as I really don't mind making a little less this year.

But i want to be considered for a senior slot after this busy season.

How exactly would you go about doing this?"
6xytlh,1,2017-09-04,"M4f - a tale of opposites, an innocent, professional young lady meets a former male pornstar...",veryyoungveryhung,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6xytlh/m4f_a_tale_of_opposites_an_innocent_professional/,"As the title suggests, both scenes involve a naïve, well behaved or at least very professional young lady suddenly realising that she is meeting a male pornstar.

I love the contrast between the two characters backgrounds, the difference between how they both think and act. Especially though I love the change in thoughts that go through her head, from shock and potentially disgust (or something similar) to eventually intrigue and more...


**Interview with a pornstar**

I roleplay as a fictitious male pornstar now going into more legitimate films. In this rp your character would either be a little shy and possibly nervous about meeting a man with that sort of a background or she would be entirely unaware of my previous employment (I could be going into legitimate acting and you are interviewing me regarding a new movie I am in).

Gradually, as the interview progresses you start asking me about my previous roles and experience, not quite realising what you are getting yourself into!


**Don’t talk to the neighbours!**

We've lived next door to you for a while and for as long as anyone can remember, we've butted heads with your parents. We were too loud, throwing parties two or three nights per week, music blaring, people shouting and likely plenty of drugs. They've called the cops on us a few times, but it seems we're pretty sweet with them too - if only your parents knew how and why! Naturally your parents have told you to stay away from us. You couldn't really figure out why, after all we seem really nice and always wave and say hello. We don't look strange - quite the opposite in fact, we're rather attractive; my wife a pretty and athletic brunette in her early twenties and me a tall, muscular guy in his early thirties. But being a good girl, you did as you were told. Keeping it to just a friendly smile and nod whenever you passed us.

So when your parents start to get really strict (whether it's over your grades/getting a job/your behaviour etc) and you want to get rebellious, there's an obvious place to go. I mean we're only next door, we seem like the kind of people to listen!

I mean, how are you to know that we're pornstars?

**A pornstar in the office!**

The office is generally very boring. People here don't hate Mondays because of the stress their job gives them. They hate Mondays because it's the start of another work week of mind melting monotony. Dull, tedious work that seems to transcend the very concept of time. 

But this week there's something new. Something different. A new starter who seems somewhat mysterious. He's tall, around 6'2 and while he's only averagely attractive with his blonde hair and beard, he's built like someone who would look more happy swinging an axe around on a battlefield somewhere. Broad shoulders, muscular arms and chest fill out his plain work shirt to the point of it stretching. While his plain black trousers must have been specially made to fit round thighs that more resemble tree trunks than legs. 

There's talk going around too, spreading through the air like a virus without a host. 

*'Former prisoner, 'once killed a guy'.*

*'Don't be silly, we don't hire ex cons. No, I reckon he's a failed sports star'*

*'Janine says he was in a couple of films'*

*'I've not seen him in anything! Are you sure?'*

*'That's because he was in porn. Hung like a gifted horse apparently!'*

*'No way! Bullshit!'*

*'why not send in the intern. Find out the truth!'*

The girls snigger before approaching you. You've not worked here long but all the time you've been dying to be brought into the circle of trust. It wasn't hard for them to get you to agree to do his induction...

((So I'm trying to set up a rather awkward interaction between my character, a former male pornstar who has taken to working in an office to try to get a real job. And your character, an innocent, naive intern who has very little sexual experience and would certainly never have watched porn))


**Celeb possibility!**

You're filming a new TV show/movie but you're co star is completely is completely unfamiliar to you.  Which is strange, because he seems to confident in front of the cameras and he says he's been in dozens of films before..

6xyyzx,8,2017-09-04,How do I reject men without them getting mad at me?,vytal2life,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6xyyzx/how_do_i_reject_men_without_them_getting_mad_at_me/,"**REPOSTED WITH A NEW TITLE**

Story time. 

So I match with this guy on Tinder named S and he doesn't message me right away but whatever I don't really care. I switch tinder to girls only (I'm bisexual). After a while he messages me and asks to meet up and drink. I tell him I'm super busy (which is very true), but he keeps saying things like like ""Oh you get out of jiu jitsu at 10? I'll be awake so let's drink!"" and I'm just like ""No I need my sleep"" but trying to stay friendly and not be a ""bitch"" even though he keeps pushing it. 

He keeps asking me when I'm free even though I tell him I have a very busy schedule since I'm taking 6 classes + have an internship + being pledge mom for my sorority + ballet + jiu jitsu + filming. Every time he has a night free he messages me to hang. I call him out and ask why he's so serious about meeting up and he says he just transferred and doesn't have many friends and just wants to drink with someone. Okay, I guess.

I tell him ""I guess I'm free Sunday night after shooting to chill,"" and he's like ""Cool it's a plan."" He texts me this morning being like ""When is the earliest I can come over?"" I don't reply bc I'm on set. He says ""I'll meet you at 5."" The shoot was supposed to go til 11pm. We wrap early due to some complications and I tell him we can meet at 7. He comes over, but I am not really in the mood for being with people; I just don't want to bail. My dog had been acting up because my roommate is fostering kittens, I'm tired from boom operating, and I really just want to sleep. I don't want sex, but he said he just wanted to drink and make friends so it should be okay right?

Well it becomes obvious when he starts asking about my sex life and getting closer/touchier to me that he does not just want to drink and hang out. I have my friend Liz call me with a fake emergency saying she needs me to come over, apologize profusely, and offer to drive him home. On the way to his apartment, he starts asking all these questions about my relationship with Liz (we were roommates), how long we've been acting (we both did theatre even though I'm actually pursuing film), whether or not I've ever bailed on a date (I have not), where Liz lives (creepy/weird), why she was talking so fast on the phone, etc. He obviously doesn't buy that this is an emergency. 

I'm trying to stay nice and not piss him off bc he significantly bigger than me and don't want to get verbally abused. He asks if I'd want to meet up some other time. I say no, I'm super busy and don't really have time. He's visibly upset and I feel guilty for bailing when I didn't even want to do this in the first place but he would not stop bothering me about meeting up. I leave and go to Liz's place like I said I would. Liz and I hang out for several hours. I am never going to see S again (hopefully) and I just feel so relieved.

I wish I just never agreed to meet with him but I didn't know how to tell him his aggressiveness was a HUGE turn off without getting insulted and criticized by him while he defends himself.

It's funny because the night before, a guy I was on set with actually defended a lot of this kind of behavior and guys doing emotionally abusive things in relationships like not letting their girlfriends hang out with their friends, making them choose between the relationship and their career, going through their phones, and just otherwise being overly jealous and possessive. 

Anyway, I've been thinking a lot lately about T.o.x.i.c. M.a.s.c.u.l.i.n.i.t.y.

However they recently had a layoff as the company wasn't doing well and I was one of those to be let go. So now I am in the enviable position of looking for a job post-graduation.

I've noticed a lot of entry level chemE positions have popped up on career sites in the past week, which I assume is for university hiring. There are also quite a few Rotational Development Programs. Will companies hire a grad from the year prior? I assume I will be at a pretty big disadvantage. 

I am open to relocating pretty much anywhere. I had a 9 month internship in college, lab research, projects, I am an OXE member, and was involved in a leadership roles on campus as well. But my GPA was not that great (3.1). I've applied to positions all over the country, but most want 3-5 years experience even for Associate/Engineer I positions. 

So anyways, it looks like the main way to get a job as a recent grad is through these Rotational Development programs or through jobs targeting college seniors. Has anyone had experience with applying post-graduation? "

If this is not the right subreddit for it, I am very sorry. I will try somewhere else then. I am crossposting it because I don't really have social anxiety in general just in this scenario, and I don't want to disrespect anyone by claiming I have it even though I might be just a mild case. 
I need help to improve my confidence and feeling more comfortable in my own skin. I don't think it applies to every Situation in my life, but in regard to one Situation especially: Meeting my boyfriends friends. 

I feel so uncomfortable and awkward with them I can't deal with it. I feel super tense, unlikeable, ugly, boring and a piece of work when I am with them. Its extremely noticeable and I don't think they like me very much because of it. And I totally understand it, I don't like myself either in these situations. 

I don't know whats wrong with me, and why I can't relax and be myself with them. And the worst thing is I totally feel sorry for him, because he has to be with me. It is so extremely uncomfortable and stressing that I wish we wouldn't be together or break up, so I wouldn't have to do this again. I have to say his friends are not bad people, or rude to me, the problem is 100% me. 

After the first and second time i met them i felt shitty for a week, each time it caused a downward spiral of negative thoughts and self-hate, where I truly wished he would just dump me because i was a piece of shit and didn't deserve him. Its actually causing problems with my relationship to him, because I start to distance myself from him or get kind of mean. And I hate myself for it, because this is not his fault. It's harmful to me, my relationship and for my boyfriend. I feel like i can't talk to him about it but I really want to. The reason i think I can't talk to him is probably because I don't want to be seen by him as this piece of work girlfriend who is too socially awkward to be with his cool friends. I don't want him to think he can't see his friends anymore or that I don't like them, or that he somehow has to chose between me and them. I don't want him to think that I am so weak I have a nervous breakdown every time I meet new people.
 
**I didn't write this text to fuel this self hate, or nurse it, I want to change something by finding out where the problem is. I need help doing that or maybe an explanation as to why I am this way and how to change it. Maybe even the right questions to ask myself could help. A friend perspective of this scenario would also help, so if you had a similar experience as a girlfriend/boyfriend, friend of boyfriend/girlfriend etc. please share with me**
I started a list of things I do and need to change, or problems that are causing this situation. But I think there is a more broken down version of this list that I cannot put together right now. 

* I think I want to be liked, which is extremely normal for human i guess but also pretty annoying. I don't think I have this feeling in every social situation, I don't have to be liked by every person in any other scenario. But those are not just some people, they are special to him. I wish I could get along with them as easily as he does with my friends.  

* My second problem is my self-esteem in general I guess. I have very good friends, with whom I can be myself, don't have to be ashamed of being honest and true to myself. Since I am still studying at 27 and work some student jobs beside it, I often feel like the chances are getting slimmer and slimmer to a job and a career in the field i love and would like to work in. I often feel very worthless and anxious because of this lack of perspective and dread of the future. I guess it depends on the group of people your with, but it can be very uncomfortable to say that I am still studying at 27, that my career choices are difficult, that I have to work beside it so I can afford a living, that no, I can't yet afford to work for free or for very little money as an intern during the university break. Since his friends all seem to care a lot about their career and are all pretty much settled with their job, it is one of those situations where I feel kind of judged. This fear of being judged by others or them seeing that that I am failing nurses my low self-esteem. 

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have such dread of meeting my boyfriends friends again that I wish he would break up with me. Need help on rationalizing this problems, tips from people with similar experiences, maybe questions I could ask myself to find out where this fear is coming from. "

6y0oec,1,2017-09-04,My thoughts on how Apple will implement Siri on the HomePod,the_best_moshe,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6y0oec/my_thoughts_on_how_apple_will_implement_siri_on/,"I believe that the way Apple will position Siri on the HomePod, that it will be an extension of Siri on your other Siri enabled devices. We already saw Apple speaking about the concept of having one Siri across all your devices, syncing through iCloud. 

As of now, you can't install skills on Siri the way you can on Alexa and on Google Assistant. The way to add functionality to Siri is through third party apps. I don't think this is about to change. The only change I believe will happen, is, you will be able to use Siri on one device and it will be able to access an app on another device. As an example, you would be able to tell Siri on the HomePod to order an Uber, and it will fulfill your request on the Uber app on your iPhone. Or using Siri on the Apple TV to send a WhatsApp message, which will be sent through WhatsApp on your iPhone. 

With iOS 11 and MacOS High Sierra, Apple is introducing iMessage sync. This will allow you to send iMessages and SMS, which will originate from your regular phone number, through the HomePod. 

Another feature that would work, is, phone calling, which will work through iCloud, if your carrier supports it. Or, it will work the same way voice calls have always worked on the iPad, which uses FaceTime to call your iPhone, which intern makes an outbound call to the intended phone number. 
Another feature that could be enabled is, if your iPhone is in close proximity of the HomePod, incoming calls can even ring on it. 

If any if this is true, HomePod will be more of an accessory to Apple's main product, which is the iPhone. Since, in order to get the full functionality of the HomePod, you would need an iPhone. "
6y1gse,68,2017-09-04,[MF] My Morning With Cinnamon [Cuckold] [Massive Tits],von-scriptenstein,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6y1gse/mf_my_morning_with_cinnamon_cuckold_massive_tits/,"A few months ago I had an old partner resurface in my life, and the brief time we spent together was remarkably, satisfyingly hot, so I thought I'd commit to to story form. I'm not going to bother getting into my history of this individual, but if folks truly crave the rich backstory and have way too much time on their hands, I spent something like an hour rambling about it nearly a year ago for GoneWildAudio, another sub I frequent. You can review my younger self's sexual escapades with the woman in question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildaudio/comments/3vf2eh/m4a_cinnamon_story_rambling_interracial/) should you so choose.

I'll also preface this with another tidbit - the woman in this story, who I have dubbed ""Cinnamon"" to protect the innocent, spent a lot of time praising the size of my dick. I have a love/hate relationship with recounting stories that in some way revolve around cock size - they are obviously hot and fun to read, but I'm not an idiot so I'm well aware that most folks who read a story written by an author who spends time talking about his monster dong are going to presume that dude is a self-congratulatory liar. So here's the straight dope: I don't have a godzilla cock. I don't, in my opinion, even have a porn cock - at least, not the porn most people want to watch. If you saw my dick in a porn you'd go, ""Eh."" You would think to yourself, ""Well, this is porn, and that is a cock, but this is not a porn cock. This is a slightly above average, okay cock.""

I am maybe making a lot of assumptions about the level of consideration all of you give to the dicks you see in porn. My dick isn't going to make anybody's monacle pop off in alarm, let me just put it that way.

To Cinnamon, however, I had the Cock of Ages. So expect to see a lot of her praise.

Cinnamon surprised me with a visit several months back, but not in the sense of her randomly showing up - she messaged me the day before like a responsible person and asked if I was free because she was in town for some sort of conference. 

Obviously I said I'd love to see her, and we made plans. I was excited for a multitude of reasons, but high on the list was the opportunity to see Cinnamon's tits again, because they have been huge the entire time I've known her, and based on social media, they only grew since she and I had last seen each other. So if nothing else, I was expecting to see some very satisfying cleavage while we caught up.

We go to dinner and she had the girls on full display. They were beyond impressive. I don't know what sort of witchcraft she has deployed over the years, but she somehow managed to get the vast majority of her gained weight to settle directly in her tits. She was big back when we used to hook up. She's massive today - at one point she admitted that she has to special order her bras and they cost a small fortune. She's wearing a dress that can barely contain her body and I am fighting not to start squirming right there in the restaurant.

So when she gets in touch with me, and we make our plans to catch up, I am honestly not expecting anything sexual to happen. And the reason I'm not expecting anything is because Cinnamon is married, and has been for years. She and I never worked out because she is very religious, and I am anything but. She found a man who matched her values, and I never begrudged her for that.

I'll call her husband Chris. It's not his real name, obviously. She joins me at the dinner table and immediately says, ""Chris and I are separated."" I'm more than a little surprised. I have no issue with Chris. I've met him maybe once or twice and he seemed like a really okay guy. Good, solid god-fearing church-going man which was exactly what she always wanted. Worked hard, prayed hard. I found him very boring, but only in the way a very dependable, marriage material man can be sort of boring. In other words, a good catch.

Apparently I misread Chris a bit. All the stuff I just wrote is true, but what I didn't know is Chris also likes to drink. A little too much. I didn't gather from our conversation that he was ever physically abusive (I'd kill him), but as somebody who has been around alcoholics in the past, I'm well acquainted with the emotional and mental turmoil that comes from trying to live with that.

Cinnamon didn't want to dwell on the reasoning behind the separation and I knew better than to get up in her business about it, so instead I just concentrated on having a nice evening and catching up on her and her family, aside from anything negative that may be going on. And it was during this conversation that it became very obvious that Cinnamon had designs on fucking me. Her conversation wanted to steer into reminiscing about our hook-ups, the subject of how large her tits had become, and how good I had made her feel in the past.

Suffice to say, she knew all the appropriate buttons to push on me, and I most certainly wanted what she was offering - sweet god, did I ever want it - but this ain't Ross and Rachel playing around in New York City. There's no ""We were on a break"" down here. This is the South, and separated ain't divorced. So as bad as I wanted to pull that tight dress off Cinnamon, I couldn't help but stress over how she'd feel later if maybe she decided that she could make things work with Chris - get him some help, fix the marriage. It was not beyond the pale; making the marriage work regardless of how shitty it becomes is ingrained in the DNA of her family culture and I knew that.

But then, here's where I'm pretty horrible. Knowing that, I knew that literally all I had to say to shut the whole thing down was, ""Cinnamon, you're not divorced right now, I don't want to do something that might hurt you."" And that would be it. Instead, I let her slide into the booth to sit right next to me and put her hand on my thigh in a position where her fingers rested right on the head of my cock as it pointed down my pant leg. And I let those fingers slowly tickle my cock head through my pants until I became fully and painfully hard, whereupon an approximation of this low, hushed conversation occurred -

Me: I'm not sure that this is a good idea.  
Cinnamon: Are you really not sure?  
Me: (still feeling her fingers on me) I'm...mostly not sure.  
Cinnamon: Can I tell you a secret?  
Me: I'm sort of afraid to say yes.  
Cinnamon: (leaning in close to my ear, whispering) You're much, much bigger than Chris.  
Me: You're killing me. You're actually trying to murder me right now.  

Basically, I did not say the combination of words that would guarantee she stop touching my cock, specifically because I did not want her to stop touching my cock. All I wanted was to pull her dress down and latch onto one of her incredibly thick nipples and just let the evening take me where it was keen to go.

However, I had one specific out that I knew I needed to employ. I told Cinnamon I needed to get home because my babysitter was an unpaid volunteer intern and she would not be okay with my impromptu date going into overtime. It's a kushy gig, ""watching"" my daughter while she's asleep - stocked fridge, lots of Netflix and Amazon Prime on the TV, shiatsu massage chair - but nobody signed on to stay in that environment until past midnight when there's work the next day.

Yes, I have a child. That always seems to surprise folks, but I am a single dad and pretty focused on taking care of my kid, hence why the majority of my stories are past tense and this is a rarity. A welcome rarity, though. I am definitely down to spend an evening with a young woman who doesn't want to talk about Paw Patrol. That's the stuff dreams are made of.

Cinnamon was disappointed, but understanding. She'd already suggested that I come check out her hotel room. She'd even hinted that if I did come to her hotel room, my angry and straining cock would get an opportunity to test drive her much larger breasts. Cinnamon has grown and changed over the years into a very, very good seductress. She's confident in what she wants and she clearly knows the shortcuts to get it. When she asked again if I was sure I didn't want to check out her hotel, winking at me and slowly pushing two fingers into her own cleavage with a good natured laugh, I actually felt my cock throb bigger down my pant leg. I had to adjust myself as soon as her back was turned, but I'm still pretty positive she saw me do it, because me adjusting is not so different from me just outright wrestling my own dick into submission from most people's perspective.

I'm bad at subtlety.

I admit I couldn't resist giving Cinnamon a kiss when I walked her to her car. She was unlocking her door and I snuck in behind her to give her a quick peck on the cheek, but as soon as she saw what I was doing she pushed back against me so that her ass would rest right against my groin, and out of sheer habit my hands gripped her hips. And I definitely stayed in that position longer than I should have, kissing her neck in a parking lot under the night sky like a horny college kid.

I did break through my reverie and my perpetual libido enough to finally say goodnight. Begrudingly. Groaningly. It's hard to remember much more of the goodbye dance because I couldn't hear anything over my own penis screaming at me.

That was an intensely difficult night. Part of me was hoping that she'd mull things over, decide what she wanted and why she wanted it, and then follow through in a responsible manner. Another part of me hoped that she would just shoot me a text and ask me to come to her hotel immediately for an all I can eat pussy buffet.

Instead we had the [following text exchange](https://imgur.com/a/zYddu) the next morning.

(A note on the text message images - I know they are timestamped May, that is closer to when this actually happened and I was telling a friend about the event who had asked and is curious about my sexual exploits - I did not give her details that reveal the identity of Cinnamon at that time and will not do so now, just to head off any requests at the pass.)

So, let's fast forward to the morning in question.

I had a message into work almost immediately that morning informing them I'd be in late. I have a ridiculous amount of paid leave at my disposal because I rarely take time off and everyone I work with knows I'm pretty private so they take it at face value if I have something going on and don't tend to pry very much. I dropped my daughter off at daycare and went straight to Cinnamon's hotel.

There was definitely a part of me that still thought maybe once I got there and the reality of my presence settled in that she might slow way down and re-evaluate. And truthfully I was still having second thoughts myself, primarily wondering if, after we had *all the sex*, she might reconcile with Chris and allow her guilt to distance herself from me forever. Not a pleasant idea and probably not what should have been on my mind given that the first text I received from Cinnamon that morning was literally ""your cock my mouth get over here.""

I had designs on talking for a little bit to feel out the situation when I arrived at Cinnamon's room, but she wasted absolutely zero time making out with me the moment I stepped across the threshold, and in less than five minutes she was on her knees and undoing my belt. The view was stupendous as she was dressed for work, with a short tight skirt and a blouse unbuttoned enough for those miles of cleavage to come shining through as I looked down at her.

My cock touched the air for maybe a second before she moaned out, ""It's so *big*,"" and dove onto me, her mouth open as wide as it would go in an effort to immediately take me as deep as she possibly could. I think I've mentioned before that the number of women I've been with who could legitimately deepthroat me is actually very small, and I'd be lying if I said Cinnamon was included in that figure, but she certainly did everything in her power to join that club. I have never heard a woman gag so much on my cock. I actually stopped her several times because I didn't want her to get sick. I am definitely not the kind of guy who gets off on a woman vomiting around my cock.

She was good. Much better than she was when we were first hooking up. I'm not sure Chris will ever realize what he missed out on through his behavior, because Cinnamon had clearly gotten quite a fair amount of practice over the years, and he's the only guy who would have been the test dummy for those procedures. 

I didn't want to mention Chris while any of this was going on, but Cinnamon sure did. She had me halfway to exploding at one point when she popped off and once again reminded me, ""You're bigger than him.""

I groaned involuntarily, mostly from the fact that she had stopped sucking me to talk. ""Is that what you like?"" I asked her.

She nodded and then mumbled, ""I used to think about you when I was fucking him.""

Okay, so elements of cuckold fantasy coming into play. It's not my first rodeo on that sort of thing but I was a bit surprised to have it coming from Cinnamon. As is usual for me, I pushed a little to test the waters. ""You like sucking on a real man's cock?""

This question made Cinnamon squeal and gag on me for about the umpteenth time, forcing me to pull back a bit. I could see her knees pushing together and her thick thighs trying to rub which was all the response I needed. She was breathing heavy when she said, ""You can take whatever you want, it's all for you.""

I gripped the back of her neck gently and fed her my cock, thrusting between her lips while her hand stroked me. She started unbuttoning her blouse with her other hand and I straight up marveled at the engineers that must have designed her bra from a series of unseen pulleys and levers. She told me after all was said and done that she wears an N cup and not to ask how much her bra cost.

Needless to say, I found a way to transition into a titfuck. There was simply no way I was going to pass up the opportunity to put myself between the largest breasts I've ever personally seen. Sitting on the edge of the bed with Cinnamon on her knees between my legs, she was able to rest her breasts in my lap while also continuing to suck me, which is a definite 10/10 experience that I will never recreate as long as I live.

""I can't do this with him,"" Cinnamon said, lifting up. ""He's not big enough.""

""This is my new favorite,"" I said honestly, stroking her cheek as her head bobbed up and down.

""God I love how big you are,"" Cinnamon moaned, pulling off to nuzzle my cock and give the head slow, suckling kisses. ""I need this dick in my life.""

""You're about to have it everywhere else, so why not?"" I said.

She licked and kissed around me while a wall of titflesh pressed into me from both sides. To say I was content would be an understatement, and she could tell, because she smiled up at me and said, ""You like these boobs on you?""

""You know I do,"" I replied.

She licked around my head again and said, ""They're still growing, baby.""

""Jesus,"" I managed to get out. It was the best I could do.

Cinnamon went back to blowing me for a few minutes before popping off again and fluffing her breasts up against me. ""Chris doesn't like-""

""Chris is an idiot,"" I growled, and my tone surprised even me. I gripped the back of Cinnamon's head and guided her back to my throbbing cock. ""Show me what he's missing.""

""Mmm-hmm"" she moaned around me as my hips thrust up against her, my cock sliding between her tits and into her waiting mouth again and again. She grunted each time I pushed between her lips. ""Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.""

I was in heaven and I knew I wasn't going to last much longer, but Cinnamon didn't move one inch when I told her I was going to cum. She just continued grunting with each solid thrust up into her mouth, a beautiful symphony for me to finish to.

She swallowed every drop, which is not something I asked her to do, but she seemed very happy with the process as she smiled after finally popping off and exclaimed, ""Fuck, your big cock cums so much!""

A note on that: I do not agree that I cum in anything excess of the average amount for human men. To be honest, I don't even find the *concept* of massive amounts of cum to be all that entrancing or sexy. I don't begrudge folks who are into it, but it just seems like a lot to clean up and deal with during the post-orgasm time. I already have a child so I wouldn't even feel slighted if I could have the orgasm sensation without the ensuing mess. ""Why didn't you cum anything?"" my partner will ask. ""You're welcome,"" I'll reply.

Cinnamon does *not* swear, so hearing her drop an F-bomb had me hard again almost instantaneously. I wasted no time getting her skirt off. I wanted to simply pull it up around her hips but it was just too tight - it had to go.

I knelt down to begin eating her out but she stopped me and looked embarrassed. ""Can we not do that?"" she asked sheepishly. I realized that I'd maybe only eaten out Cinnamon once or twice and I couldn't recall if she'd liked it or not. Her demeanor seemed to suggest she wasn't into it so I backed off. ""Are you sure?"" I asked, and she nodded. I won't pretend to understand women that don't want me to eat pussy, but I'm not about to push anyone to do something that makes them uncomfortable.

Eager to get the mood back, I began kissing her neck. Her hand dipped down between us and began stroking me as she whispered, ""I'm really wet, baby. I'm dripping""

She wasn't kidding. My fingers reached out to touch her thighs and I could feel her juices running down them. I growled in her ear, ""Bend over the bed. Now.""

She complied.

I took in the sight of Cinnamon's big ass for a moment, wondering what amazing thing I did in another life, when she suddenly turned back to look at me and asked, in the same sheepish tone of voice she'd used when asking me not to lick her, ""Do you want my ass?""

I blinked. That was the absolute last thing I expected. I'm honestly not a big fan of anal sex but there was something about the exceedingly submissive way she asked, coupled with the volume *of* ass on display, that made me begin to seriously consider it.

I think she sensed my internal debate, because she put a hand on one of her cheeks and spread it apart so I could take a look at what she had on offer. ""You can have it if you want it,"" she said, then quickly added, ""But go slow, only Chris has been in there and you're bigger.""

If she had not mentioned all the spaces Chris had been, I'm pretty sure I would have broken my ""no anal"" rule and seen just how much of me she could accomodate, but as much as I'm willing to entertain fetishes and kinks of the cuck variety, I was getting a little tired of ""outdoing"" her ex husband in the sex department and wanted her to just focus on being with me.

Still, her ass was a goddamn delight, so I settled myself between her cheeks and fucked against them for several strokes, making her laugh. ""You're so weird.""

""Don't tell me I'm weird because I found a fun way to enjoy this ass,"" I responded.

""I *thought* you were going to put it in,"" she snarked at me.

""I don't think you can handle it,"" I teased, slapping my cock down against each of her ass cheeks.

I saw her bite her lip. ""Maybe not,"" she said. ""I think you might be too big.""

I smiled at her. ""Is the ass still growing too?""

She laughed. ""You wish. I mean, it kind of is just because I gained weight, but no. Not like my boobs.""

""Mmm-hmmm,"" I said, teasing myself up and down her slit. ""Tell me more.""

She squirmed against me, her hands clenching the sheets of her hotel bed tightly. ""My boobs just keep getting bigger,"" she said in a shaky voice, her ass shifting to try and push herself back into my cock. I continued to tease her.

""That sounds rough,"" I said, in a tone of voice that suggested I did not think there was anything rough about it.

""I kind of wish they'd stop,"" Cinnamon said with a sigh. She lifted up slightly and gathered her tits underneath her before pressing down, allowing them to flatten out in a spectacular way. ""But I also kind of don't want them to stop. Does that make sense?""

I finally pressed inside Cinnamon slowly, causing her to gasp and moan. She was ridiculously, amazingly tight. So tight that I had to move at a glacial pace or risk hurting her. About halfway inside her I saw her leg start to tap a bit, as though she'd suddenly contracted restless leg syndrome. ""I think I can relate to that feeling,"" I whispered, leaning over her from behind.

""Mmmm,"" Cinnamon moaned into the mattress. ""You want 'em bigger, boo?""

""I wouldn't complain,"" I said, slipping even further inside her.

""Chris don't like 'em,"" she said quickly. ""He wanted me to get a reduction because people are always looking.""

""Let 'em look.""

I pushed in more and she sighed at the feeling of being stretched slowly. I was working my way in little by little. ""I never told him that I like them like this. They feel good. Do you want them to get bigger?""

I was sweating. There was a lot to focus on at once. I breathed heavily as I continued my slow trek to bottoming out inside Cinnamon, but still responded honestly. ""You should be able to decide what you want about your own body. If you like them, you should keep them the way they are, but if they bother you, don't let somebody tell you it's wrong to try and fix it if you can.""

Cinnamon sighed as she felt me *finally* hit bottom. My hands had a white knuckle grip on her hips and it was taking all of my willpower to keep from suddenly fucking her as hard as I could. 

""I'm gonna keep 'em, boo,"" she said with a smile back at me. ""Even if they get bigger.""

""More to love,"" I said.

""More to fuck, is what you meant,"" she said, laughing, and then put a hand over her mouth to stop the swear she just emitted, which was the absolute cutest.

I continued a slow thrust inside her, pulling back until just the head remained inside, and then pressing forward until I once again hit the end of her tunnel. In just a few long strokes I felt her entire pussy clamp down on me at once and saw her body shudder. She hadn't made a peep but I knew she'd just cum.

""You're big,"" she muttered into the sheets. ""So big.""

""You love it,"" I said confidently, pausing as deep as I could go so she could feel how full she was.

She looked back at me and her face was full of a mix of lust and something else. ""You're in so much deeper than him,"" she said. ""You got me stretched out more than he ever could. You're the biggest, boo. Biggest I ever had.""

I groaned in spite of myself. She was pushing my buttons and it was working exceedingly well. I felt my cock throb inside her.

She felt it as well, ""God*damn*, boy, I forgot you get bigger."" Throbbing isn't the same as getting bigger, but who am I to argue semantics? She began bouncing her ass back against me at her own pace. ""Boy, take me. Show me what that big dick do. Gimme what I *need*.""

I'm nothing if not compliant when given a direct order, and even though I knew Cinnamon was dealing with some emotions, I can also recognize when the immediate cure is fucking, so I officially went to town. I raised my hand up high and brought it down against her ass cheek like a crack of thunder, causing her to yelp and groan, moving her hips harder as I picked up my own pace. I'm not going to lie - I fucked her *hard*, possibly harder than I have ever fucked another woman. I fucked her with very little regard for how deep I was going, and as a result I'm sure I smashed against her cervix a few times, but at no point did she slow down or give me any indication that I should slow down either. I felt her pussy *spasming* on my dick. I have no idea how many times she came. Her arm was underneath her, rapidly stroking her own clit almost the entire time.

I finally began to pass the point of no return, giving her the sign that I was going to cum. She scrambled off of me and settled down on her knees, lifting her tits up as high as she could. She didn't say a word. Just sat there with her tits on display, silently asking me to cum on them.

I obliged, stroking out my exceptionally average orgasm onto her breasts like some sort of porn star. She leaned forward when I was done and kissed the tip of my cock lovingly.

We took a shower together that wound up lasting quite a while because she once again decided to start sucking my cock. Three orgasms in one session? Sure, I like a good hat trick. I wasn't able to cum in the shower but did finally get there when she continued sucking me on her hotel bed afterwards, lazily working me in and out of her mouth while staring up at me. She nuzzled my cockhead against her cheek and said, ""If your dick was any bigger you wouldn't be able to fit in my mouth.""

Like I said, she knows my buttons. I reached out to the back of her head and pulled her back onto me. I started fucking her mouth nice and slow after that, and she swallowed every drop of my cum like a good girl, even going so far as to lick her lips and clean the head of my cock to a polish. As always, I ended a tryst with Cinnamon fully satisfied.

From there I was just delaying the inevitable goodbye. I curled up next to her and sucked her nipples as long as she would let me, which I suspect would have been forever, but she needed to get on with her day so she could catch her flight and I needed to get to work. It was a sad goodbye. I told her to keep in touch. And from there, straight to work.

So what's happened, months later? Not a lot, I'll be honest. I've talked to her a bit on social media but I've been given no indication that she plans on divorcing her husband, which is sad but somewhat expected. I'm just happy she hasn't ghosted on me, to be perfectly honest, as that was one of my fears from the very beginning. I don't know what the future holds for Cinnamon, but I can say with certainty if she ever decides to wander through my neck of the woods again I am *very* open for a repeat of that particular adventure."

For the people that are interested in this type of thing I plan on posting weekly updates on how the league is going. 

We drafted about two weeks ago, and I'd like to introduce everyone to the teams, and the rosters! 

- First off, we have [Andy Dalton Wilcox](http://imgur.com/a/xDdx6) Who with his first round pick he chose Antonio Brown from the Steelers. Betrayal to the Bengals picking a steelers player, tisk tisk. 

- Next we have [Beaucoup Dolores](http://imgur.com/a/agg3y) Who has a great RB tandem, and wisely chose Demarco Murrays backup as well 

- Next up is me [Classic Jarles Landry](http://imgur.com/a/Hnv2C) Who didn't pay attention to the Kareem Hunt hype and drafted Spencer Ware days before he was injured and out for the season.... Oops. Also got robbed on TE's so there's a good chance I'll be making a trade. (Take note everyone) 

- Next up we got [Intern Geno Smith](http://imgur.com/a/feo0r) Who is rolling with the immortal yet reliable Frank Gore (my fantasy hero for years past) 

- [Kurt Werner Herzog](http://imgur.com/a/4IepH) Chose David Johnson with the first overall pick, and I was *really* hoping he'd take Le'veon Bell, because DJ is just unreal

- [Mmm Yes Points](http://imgur.com/a/Ex1jR) Chose my boy Jarvis Landry, and even though he has the best kicker in the league decided he wanted to roll with 2 in the season. 

- [TEAM 5](http://imgur.com/a/oWykB) Is the only person in the league that autodrafted and as far as I can tell hasn't been active in the league. It is short notice, but if you would like to claim his roster I will happily add you to the league. The roster is actually pretty decent, just a little weak at RB, but you win FF through the waiver wire and not the draft anyway. Hit me up if you're interested.

- [Team Price](http://imgur.com/a/A4KuF) Did not autodraft, and will be a part of the league, but come on bro where's your name-game at? 

- Next we got [The Jackles](http://imgur.com/a/y0efy) Who decided to take the gamble on Ty Montgomery, and Todd Gurley. Risky RB duo, but could be lethal 

- [The Lombardo Trophy](http://imgur.com/a/rCOK6) Which is now officially the name of the award we'll give to the 1st place winner of the league, because that name is genius -- also he chose Tom Brady. Fuck you The Lombardo Trophy (Also chose Zeke Elliott which means he may have won a serious gamble here. We'll find out in a couple days) 

- [Vic Takk Poe](http://imgur.com/a/9ob88) Sniped my boy Hunter Henry (fantasy savior last year) from me, and decided to draft two more TE's. Also placing faith in Atlanta's D which I think is smart. They're gonna make a big jump this year. 

- Lastly we got [Wiger Hates Brees](http://imgur.com/a/8yoFG) Which I love his picture in regards to his name. Got the Jay Train, therefore he'll clearly be the winner of the league. We may as well pack it all up. Also sniped Winston from me, so fuck you too buddy. 

ANYWAY! That's all everyone. The /r/Earwolf Fantasy league is ready for action this week, tune in next week for the next update, and feel free to criticize our rosters, and place your bets on the winner. 

The winner of the League will win a T-Shirt of their choice on Podswag -- We decided that in the draft room. So if you want your chance to win one, claim Team 5's roster now. Til next week! "

I'm principally interested in cyber security, and I'm confident that I can get into most of the UC's (besides Berkeley) because of my GPA and extracurriculars.

What are the possible options for the Navy to utilize my education as soon as possible after I graduate? Internships, etc? I assume that UC San Diego is probably a good place to be since it's right near NBPL"

He's ~2 years into a PhD (with ~3 years left) and I'm working in the city where he goes to school. He's from South America and I'm from the US.  

While we haven't had serious sit down discussions to plan for things like marriage, kids, finances, moving around vs living in one place, pets, travel, etc. We HAVE casually talked about our views on these things and so far we seem to be on the same page! We do not live together. We also agreed that if in the foreseeable future we absolutely HAD to do long-distance that we would be committed to putting in time and effort with it, and even had a trial run of this for a month or two while we were both traveling. So we are exclusive and committed and happy!

We've met and hung out with many of each other's friends, and we've met each other's families. He gets along well with my family and we've even celebrated holidays with them. (And have upcoming plans to see them for another holiday!) I like his parents and they seem to like me but I have only met with them a couple of times because of the travel required (they live in South America). I'm the first girl he's introduced to his parents and vise versa.

We have our problems--as every relationship does--but we work on them by talking about them and by both taking action to adjust. So far there hasn't been anything major. 

I am his first serious, ""long-term"" relationship, mostly because he travelled all over for his degrees (he has several) and internships. His more ""serious"" exes are only exes because he had to move, so no bad blood as far as I know.
He has told me that he has never told anyone he (romantically) loves them before. 

With all that in mind, we are pretty great together. The sex is great, the humor is shared, we find ourselves voicing each other's thoughts, we play, we laugh, we cook together, we love traveling together. I could go on, and on but I don't want to get too mushy! I'm definitely the more classically ""romantic"" of the two of us.

I love him. I could see a long-term future with him. But I haven't pushed this subject past ""causal"" statements that are more like ""love ya!"" Than ""I love you."" If that distinction makes sense. 
Ex: I would say to him, or any friend or family ""love ya, drive safe, call me when you get there ok!""
So I know in all fairness that while he hasn't said it, I haven't stepped up to say it either. Obviously I'm worried that maybe he doesn't want to say it back! 

So Reddit, I'd love your insight. Maybe there's a cultural difference I'm not aware of? Is it good to take it slow? How slow is too slow? Is this a ""red flag""? How do I tackle something I'm a little nervous about approaching? Thanks everyone!

tldr: My boyfriend of 1.5 years hasn't told me he loves me yet. We're committed, happy, and have minimal ""problems."" I love him but I'm a little worried if this is a long time to not have yet exchanged ""I love you""s.

6y2smi,3,2017-09-04,Middle of the night insomnia out of now where?,KingShindo,insomnia,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/6y2smi/middle_of_the_night_insomnia_out_of_now_where/,"These past few days I've been waking up around 4:00am after falling asleep at ~10:30-11:00 or so and stay up for at least an hour or even two. Last winter I had a horrible bout of insomnia that actually led my psychiatrist discovering that I have OCD, and with zoloft and trazadone I was able to sleep great and feel wonderful for a good 9 months. Suddenly when school started I started working at a paid internship and since I'm eyeing for a 4.0 to transfer I suddenly found myself undergoing extreme stress (I'm 19 and a friend spotted a gray hair, although I'm not sure if stress actually affects graying) that I'm pretty sure those first nights I woke up cause of anxiety. In order to not let what happened in winter happen again to me I started combating stress this past year through yoga and meditation. So after my first two sleepless nights I went back to my routines and feel pretty stress free now honestly, but still I was having major trouble maintaining my sleep schedule. 

I tried putting in study times when I wake up at 4:00, But I'm so tired that I can barely function. I just lie down and try meditating. The first few nights were okay, but after 5 days of getting no more than 6 hours of sleep it's been taking a toll on me--20 minute power naps always felt great but after taking one today I still felt exhausted. I try not to think about sleep affecting school performance, but I can say that without a doubt I'm not functioning well cognitively, even simple problems are becoming major challenges to dissect and solve. 

Of note, I was a daily weed smoker but stopped when I thought it could be affecting my sleep. It didn't help but could that have anything to do with it?

I just don't know why I keep waking up at 4:00 not feeling rested in the slightest, while being a zombie until I fall back asleep for a short hour nap before I need to start my day. Any techniques or remedies you guys know of that can help?"
6y2un4,10,2017-09-04,Class 1-A power levels,Jason3b93,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/6y2un4/class_1a_power_levels/,"So, guys, I tried to make this for fun and ended up being much more work than I thought.

So basically, how would you guys divide class 1-A based on Power Levels? Sort like Smogon with Pokémons, I tried to make my own.

**Top Tiers**: Midoriya, Todoroki and Bakugou.

- I think it's easy to put those three above the rest. Granted, Bakugou is objectively above Midoriya, since he won the last fight. Actually, I would say Midoriya is slightly behind those two, but I don't think it's a great difference. So, I put those three together instead of leaving Midoriya alone.

**Second tier**: Iida.

- I think Iida should be alone on this tier. During the camping arc, he was the one with better reaction time besides the Top Tier trio. He had experience on the Stain fight, even though he was pretty much useless during big part of the fight. But then, I think he learned his lesson. So, I sense he is above the resto of the class, but below those three.

**Third tier**: Kirishima, Tsuyu, Ochako and Tokoyami.

- Those first three because they are doing the internship and were able to even start to make the news. Even though we had way more screentime with Kirishima's development, we can't ignore that Ochako and Tsuyu are with a top 10 hero. Also, I think that besides Midoriya, Ochako was the one who most evolved during the Field Training with Gunhead. Tsuyu is always calm and composed and the two were able to hold their own against Himiko Toga - Aizawa and LockRock got way more difficulties. Now, Tokoyami is hard. From the Torunament arc, he was clearly ahead those other three. But then, he didn't do much of his own. He was captured over and over during the Camp Training arc and he was one of the last students to pass on the first phase of Provisional License Exam. So, I ended up downgrading he a little.

**Fourth tier**: Momo, Kaminari, Ashido, Jirou, Shouji, Ojirou and Sero.

- Momo had confidence issues, but she's over it now. She's smart, she were on the Rescue Squad and she was easily the best prepared on the rescue portion of the Provisional License Exam. Though, I still feel she needs to ""prove herself"" against a major treat. Kaminari is probably the second one of those with more screentime. He was an important member of Todoroki's cavalry race team and he were able to beat the Meat Potato guy (!), while Bakugou and Kirishima were captured. As for the rest, I think that Shouji showed more power: he was able to save Midoriya from the dark shadow attack. Then, he saved Midoriya from Himiko during the Camp Training arc and he rescued Tokoyami, while Todoroki and Midoriya failed to rescue Bakugou. As of Ashido, Horikoshi himself says she is pretty strong, and she was the best girl of 1-A during the tournament arc. Sero was utterly defeated by Todoroki, granted, but he helped Midoriya during the License Exam and he is probably the most agile of the class after Bakugou. And Ojirou were able to hold his own alone during the USJ attack. And with his weak quirk, he is strong because he knows how to fight.
I was tempted to put Momo and Kaminari alone and fuse the rest with the next tier, but ended up putting this way.

**Fifth tier**: Mineta.

- He was helpful during the USJ attack, even though Midoriya and Tsuyu basically dragged him to help. But he has a powerful quirk, he's just coward ~~and an awful character~~. He also showed a little of his supposed high intelligence against Midnight, so I guess that counts. He surely has done way more than the rest and he has potential, I have to admit.

**Who-knows tier**: Hagakure, Kouda and Sato.

- Sato, Kouda and Hagakure didn't have screentime to do anything, so who knows where they are.

**Bottom tier**: Ayoama.

- When he first showed up, I thought he was very strong. Then, we realized he was more of an comic relief character. He's more coward than Mineta. Mineta actual did something during the USJ, while Ayoama was probably hiding somewhere. Mineta wanted to fight and help his friends during the Camp training invasion, while Ayoama also hide. Granted, he did pull it off in the end, but I'm of the opinion of too little, too late. I also think that he's aware of the gap between him and the rest, as his mini-arc during the Provisional License arc seems to hint.

So, of course this is opinionated, but that's the best I could do to divide them objectively. What do you guys think?"

They are rank amateurs representing themselves as capable of penetrating the highly-closed, effectively oligopolized and vertically-integrated live events business.

Aventus, who, with its over-engineered website and inscrutable ""White Paper"" (which reads more like a doctoral thesis in cryptoasset theory than a practical solution for disrupting ticketing) comports itself *poorly* to anyone who understands the true political nuances of the live events industry like *this* writer.

The recently-minted academics (perhaps love-birds from their ""Series Eight"" days) - who represent that they can lead the entity - have a collective *zero* in concert or sports event production.

The critical ""experts"" they conscripted as advisors for their Rube Goldberg approach to live event economics consists principally of (a) Diane Bowers a person wholly unknown by anyone of any gravity in the entertainment business.  Her hallmark experience as an impressario seems to be her Delray Beach Florida business entity called ""Blue Horizon Entertainment"" formed less than a year ago.  Google that and judge the results for yourself.  Think she can get Irving Azoff on the phone??

A marginal improvement occurs with (b) ""Advisor"" Bernie Dillon.  Bernie's claim to fame (from his rather thin LI profile) is arranging shows for Native American-owned Casino showrooms.  Hardly the arenas that Taylor Swift cares about.  But, the Aventus ICO is in itself a kind of casino isn't it??

Bernie's showbiz career trajectory propelled him from booking shows for these Wall Street-managed, Indian Tribe casinos to now booking acts for Carnival Cruise ships. Meaning now he books C-List, long-in-the-tooth acts playing small venues.  The extent of his brief at Carnival?  Unclear.  Entertainment Weight necessary to tackle what Aventus is after? = lighter than helium.  But we are sure he is a lovely chap.

So why do these millennial, ICO-barkers command any serious consideration?  In this analyst's view - they don't.  

Their convoluted conception will never work in the realpolitiks of the entertainment business.  

Because nothing is easier than fools parted with their money.  A lesson that co-founder Ms Monari surely learned well as an ""intern"" at the masters of that game ... GoldmanSachs.

Blockchain will penetrate the ticketing sphere but not under the auspices of business toddlers facing off with adults of the stature of Michael Rapino of Live Nation or a Philip Anschutz of AEG.  And do you seriously think any major tour would entrust their money to a group which has already had their own ICO hacked??

A careful analysis of Eventchain.io reads even more dismally.  This is a true embarrassment to the potential of ICO financing.

.....................................................................................................

So starts the misinformed, politically-naive attempted gold rush to turn out Ticketmaster - who is OWNED by the biggest tour promoter on Earth and further has long-term, *exclusive* contracts with the venues naive entrepreneurs in the blockchain tickets space need to outsmart.

Expertise in Ruby on Rails or even being a Quant for a Hedge Fund that eats and spits out employees like fishbones does not qualify one to take on the USD$36B concert and sports industry.

Your ETH will be the lunch that this unqualified group uses for their lunches at *L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon – Covent Garden*.  Or rather, pay for the Dolce &amp; Gabbana bags that Ms Monari wishes to fills her closet with.

Wait for the old pros from the entertainment business who really know where the bodies are buried.   It will take a long time and far more connected people than this crew to crack live events.

6y3uym,0,2017-09-04,"Title: My [26 M] girlfriend [30 F] broke up but were discussing maybe getting back together when I slept with a friend [24 F] of mine. I want to get back together with my gf but she is insisting that I cut the friend out of my life completely, and I don’t want to be a jerk to the friend",mapa101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6y3uym/title_my_26_m_girlfriend_30_f_broke_up_but_were/,"I [26M] have been in an on and off relationship for the past 4.5 years with a woman [30F] who I’ll refer to as K. For the vast majority of the time that K and I have been together, it was a long distance relationship (4 hour drive apart). 


For the most part, the relationship has been great. We had excellent communication, felt totally comfortable opening up to each other about our deepest insecurities, had similar values and beliefs, great chemistry, many interests in common, could talk for hours on the phone, made each other laugh, loved spending time together, and our sex life was still passionate and vibrant after 4.5 years. We have been each other’s best friend and most important emotional support system through some difficult times. At one point we had the opportunity to live together for 4 months, and things were just as good while we were living together as they were while we were long distance. 


The reason why we have kept breaking up and then getting back together is because both of us have always felt like there was something intangible missing in our relationship, although we were never quite able to identify what it was. Despite being together for so long and being so close, we’ve never felt able to say “I love you”- and it’s not because either one of us has a problem being open with our emotions. So the relationship has been pretty happy for the most part, but it has never progressed towards a deeper level of commitment. 


There are a certain things that have always bothered me about K; among other things, she has a tendency to hold onto grudges and to be vindictive and spiteful towards people who have wronged her. I honestly don’t know whether the things that bother me about K are in fact the reason why I have never felt like I was really in love/willing to commit to her, but it is possible.


Some relevant background to the current issue: A couple years ago, K and I broke up, then a few months later started talking again and discussing the idea of getting back together. While we were discussing this, K started hooking up with another guy (and was open with me about this- so it wasn’t behind my back), but then despite telling me that he was not a threat to me, she eventually decided to date him exclusively, leading me on for a while before she pushed me aside. I felt extremely hurt and betrayed, but when she broke up with him several months later, and we ended up getting back together, I forgave her and no longer felt angry, and I didn’t have a problem with her staying friends with him if she wanted to. 


In addition, last year (while we were together), K developed a crush on a friend of hers who she had previously slept with while we were broken up. She told me about this crush, and even though I felt somewhat insecure about it, I allowed her to stay friends with him and go visit him where he was living overseas. She eventually decided to stop talking to him in order to help herself get over the crush, but I never asked her to do this. 


Finally, in a separate incident while K and I were together, she wanted to try an open relationship for a couple weeks, and although I strongly resisted at first, she kept pushing until I eventually gave in. During that short period of time, I did not have sex with anyone (mostly because I never met anyone who showed any interest in me), while she had sex with at least three different people.


I am a graduate student, and as part of my degree program, I need to spend half of each year on the opposite side of the country, doing research at a remote biological reserve with a small, tightly knit group of people. This year, K and I broke up (again) shortly before I left for the reserve in January. She dated someone else for a month or two after we broke up and it didn’t go well. This helped her realize that her priorities had changed in terms of what she wanted in a relationship (among other things, she no longer felt the need to have an open relationship), which made her think that maybe it could work out with me after all. By March, we were talking about up the idea of getting back together. We agreed that if we did get back together, we should give it a few months to see if things were different this time around, but that this would be our final attempt to make things work.


Around the same time in March, a new intern, who I will call D [24F], started working at the biological reserve where I work, and I really clicked with her. We started hanging out, and were both attracted to each other. I told K that I was attracted to D, although I stressed (truthfully) that I still found K much more attractive, and that I wasn’t interested in a long-term relationship with D. I asked K what I should do if I ended up getting the opportunity to hook up with D. K said “I won’t hook up with anyone else while you and I are still discussing whether or not to get back together”. I asked her if she wanted me to follow that same rule or not. She said “Do what you think is right,” which I interpreted as her telling me to make my own call. I ended up having sex with D, and explained to D that I was talking with my ex about the possibility of getting back together, so I didn’t know if we’d be able to keep having sex, but I promised D that at the very least I would stay friends with her. D seemed to be totally fine with this.


I told K that I had had sex with D, thinking that this wouldn’t be a huge deal, since I had already asked for permission. However, she got way more upset than I expected, and it turned out that she was not at all okay with me sleeping with D. I immediately agreed to not have sex with D anymore, but I balked when K asked me to stop hanging out with D altogether. I did not think it was fair of K to ask this of me, given that she had the opportunity to ask me not to have sex with D ahead of time, and given that I had never asked her to stop hanging out with guys that she had had sex with in the past. In addition, I felt that it would be unfair to D to go back on my word about staying friends with her.


To make a long story short, ever since March K and I have been fighting about whether or not I could hang out with D as a friend. I stopped hanging out with D for two months because K was so upset, even though I felt really bad about breaking my promise to D to stay friends, and really missed hanging out with her as a friend. Eventually I convinced K to let me hang out with D again, but K insisted that I only do so with other people present, and when I told D about this rule she said that she didn’t want a friendship that was being monitored and she’d rather not hang out at all. Eventually K reluctantly agreed to let me hang out with D as a friend without any restrictions, and I told D that we could now hang out with no restrictions, and that my relationship with K would not affect our friendship anymore. D and I started hanging out again and became closer friends. However, it turned out that K was not really ok with this arrangement, and she wanted to re-impose the rule that I could only hang out with D in a group setting. I was extremely reluctant to do this, because I was concerned that going back on my word to D yet again would cause me to lose the friendship for good. 


At some point during this whole mess, I realized that I was developing a crush on D, beyond simply thinking she was physically attractive. However, I knew that I would never even consider cheating on K, nor did I want to leave K in order to be with D. Since I knew that if I told K about my crush on D she would probably insist that I not hang out with D at all, which I really didn’t want to do, I decided to keep the crush to myself and just ignore it until it went away.


K and I kept fighting about whether I could hang out with D without other people present, and eventually I decided to ask D how she would feel if I were to impose this boundary. To my surprise, D got extremely upset that I would even ask this as a hypothetical, and said that she didn’t want to be friends with me anymore. 


Around the same time, K guessed that I had a crush on D, and when she confronted me about it I told her the truth (that I did have a crush on D, but that I never had any intention of acting on it). K felt really hurt and betrayed, and said that since I had hidden this crush from her, the only way she would be okay with staying together with me would be if I told D “I don’t want to be friends with you, please don’t contact me”. I really didn’t want to do this, because I was still hoping to be able to repair my friendship with D. 


After a couple weeks of deliberation and talking to a therapist, I decided to break up with K, mostly because I felt that if we hadn’t been in love after so much time together, a few more months was very unlikely to change anything. This was a few weeks ago. I told D that I had broken up with K, and asked her if it was still possible for us to be friends. At first she said no, but since then has steadily started warming up to me. We are not quite back to where we were before and we may never be for all I know, but we are at least on friendly terms and enjoying hanging out together in a group setting, and our relationship seems to be improving. I should mention that at this point D is dating somebody else, and she is only going to be at the biological reserve for a few more weeks, after which her internship will end and she will leave.


Recently, my therapist pointed out that it is possible that the reason K and I never “fell in love” (i.e. why our relationship never progressed beyond a certain stage) may be that we were never together continuously for a sufficient period of time, and that the on again, off again dynamic stunted the normal growth of our relationship. After realizing this, I thought that maybe there was a chance after all for things to work out with K, and I wanted to try getting back together with her. I thought that maybe the fact that D is dating someone else now and will only be on the reserve for another few weeks would be enough to help K feel secure about me being friends with D. However, K is still adamant that in order to be with her, I need to cut D out of my life completely. K has told me not to contact her again unless I do this first.


So here is my dilemma: do I cut D out of my life in order to have a chance to make things work with K? Or do I let K go, and stay friends with D (to the extent that D wants to be friends with me)? 


I realize that I have really hurt K’s feelings and that this is the only way that I can regain her trust. I hate the way that our relationship ended on such bad terms when we used to be so close, and I would like to have the chance to try again if it is possible for the relationship to work out. Also, I do value K’s friendship more than D’s, because I have known K for longer and we have been through more together. In a certain sense it seems foolish to give up the chance to be with K just for the sake of my friendship with D, when D will be leaving in a few weeks’ time. 


On the other hand, it seems really cruel to go back on my word to D yet again, especially after spending the last few weeks trying to rebuild our friendship. Also, since it is far from certain that my relationship with K would work out anyway, I am not sure that I am willing to do this to D for the sake of being able to try one more time with K.


Would it be wrong to tell D all of a sudden that I can’t be friends with her after spending the last several weeks trying to rebuild our friendship? On a separate note, is it a red flag that K is unwilling to bend on this issue? I feel that she is holding me to a double standard by insisting that I not be friends with D, when I have always been much more forgiving in similar situations where our roles were reversed, and have never asked her to cut a friend out of her life. But I do know that I have not acted in a very trustworthy manner over the last several months, and she has never asked anything like this of me before.


I should stress that I am NOT trying to have sex with D again- I just want to be friends, or at the very least not hurt her yet again by going back on my word and telling her that I can't be in contact with her. The problem is that K no longer trusts me, and the only way I can regain her trust is to cut D out of my life completely.


What would you do in my situation?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**:
My girlfriend and I had broken up but were discussing the idea of getting back together, when I slept with a friend of mine thinking that my (ex)gf had given me permission to do so. Turned out she wasn’t ok with it after all, which kicked off several months of fighting about whether I could hang out platonically with this friend, during which time I ended up jerking my friend around and almost destroying the friendship. As things stand now I want to get back with my gf, but she is only willing to do that if I cut my friend off completely, and my friend is only just starting to trust me again. I don’t want to lose my gf, but also don’t want to hurt my friend anymore."
6y4pyy,1,2017-09-04,Need advise spending scholarship,DarcySmarcy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6y4pyy/need_advise_spending_scholarship/,"I am at the end of my college career. Graduation is soon and I am due to start repayments at the beginning of next year. I have revived a $10,000 scholarship from the company I intern for and want to make sure I am using it wisely. I have also revived a surprise grant from financial aid for almost $5,000. So that's about $15,000 towards paying off my debt.

I have two private loans adding to $50,000 and multiple federal loans for 18,000. This includes interest, my full loan break down is [here](https://m.imgur.com/a/eAzzu) . 

How should I spend this do get the most out of my money. Is it better to pay it towards the high interest private loans, playing off the current interest. Or would it be smarted to pay off almost all of the federal loans? The bank won't tell me, but I am guessing that if I pay off a good chunk of my private loans before the grace period has ended the monthly payments may go down. Is this true? 

Extra information: I make roughly $350 a month on work study for living expenses right now. After graduation I have a job offer that pays about $900 a week before taxes. So should be able to make the high payments, but there's no room left for saving and school has drained my bank account so I would really love to save again. "

I've always been overweight, but after I started drinking(more) when I became legal age, I went from 120 kilos to almost 140 (310 ish Lb) in a little over a year. Obviously, I decided it's time I start working on that. Instead of eating 1 or 2 large meals per day followed by over 3 duzens of beers per week, I started eating 6 or 7 small vegan meals per day. I lost about 6 kilos in a bit more than a month. But if I keep going at this rate, it will take me almost a year to get into shape, especially with winter coming when I generally do less physical activities. I went on a few hikes, I found it boring of seeing the exact same path on the exact same hill day after day. I tried running, but I can't keep my heart rate under 150 bpm. I do love skiing, but, obviously cqn do it only in the winter. Plus ski resort tickets are to expensive for an eastern european pleb like me to do daily or even weekly. Then I found my old bike burried under a mountain of hay in our barn. Decided to try if I my fat ass would handle the nearly 100 kilometer ride through mountains from my mom's house I was visitting to my grandmother's house who I'm living with because she doest live in the booneys (easyer to live when you dont have to spend hours commuting daily to a shittly paid intership). So I decided to test If I could by riding it arround the valley, up and down hills about 40km in total. It was easyer than I thought. It was the perfect activity. Took me just over 2 hours, but it was great because unlike walking, you actually move, and the downhill sped makes it enjoyable, and I was nearly not tired at all after takingba rest. Next day I packed a bag and got on my way. Spent 3 and a half hours getting over the mountains into the next big valley over, taking the shortest but most mountanous roads. Thing is, I used google maps as navigation, and for some reason I couldnt get it to navigate when I switched to bike mode. I didnt wannana chose the car navigation, because it wont show    the shorter and more fun forest paths. So I chose walk mode. Which at one point led me over a barely 20 centimeter rocky path on the final descent to the big valley basin. From there on, largest elevation differences would be 30 meters with only 23 more kilometers till im home. Then I hit a bigass root, squished the metal wheel thingey sideways till it looks like an egg, slashing the tyre and since the root made the wheel turn to the left, I pulled to the right and unscrewed the handlebar so now it just hangs there limply. It was probably just as old as me so I just left it there while I make the 5 kilometer walk till I get out of the woods and onto a road so my grandfather can pick me up. No way in hell Im walking for 4 more hours. Plus it was 7 pm. I am writting this ""stranded"" in the woods ""waiting for rescue"". Will post this as soon as I make it to civilization and get wi-fi. As long as I don't forget to press post and close reddit and end up having to re-type it.

This is where I stop rambling and actually ask the question. I live in Slovenia (its near Italy), so I probably cant get top quality mtb's that can carry a small horse from america. Shipping is out of the question since internship pays me 300 euros a month. Definatly cant afford getting a customlymade one. So, does anyone know any models that can handle a fatty like me that can be bought in europe? I dont plan on ridding it on rough mountain paths, as long as it can handle some grass, dirt, mud and gravel paths. It doesnt have to be light. The heavyer the better, actually more calories burnt. Thing is, I cant afford much over 200 euros, 300 dollars. Will a bike that cheap be able to handle my weight without collqpsing into itself on the first hard object i run over?"
6y4xm4,1,2017-09-04,[34M4F] The Greeks only asked one thing when a man died: Did he have passion?,Willpower4848,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6y4xm4/34m4f_the_greeks_only_asked_one_thing_when_a_man/,"My biggest kink is passion. I realize that sounds pretty vanilla ... and is probably not actually a kink at all. But god help me nothing turns me on more than that hungry-eyed, lip-biting look. That desperation. That need. Plenty of kinks come from that. Cheating is thrilling, especially when there's the danger of getting caught. Public sex really gets my motor running, and not semi-public, I want an audience. But it's got to have that I-fucking-want-you-right-now quality to it. I want that primal, urgent, unstoppable lust.

As you may have guessed, these are the rantings of a married man. Everyone wants what they can't have, and for me right now that's passion. So instead I fantasize about meeting the intern in that dark hallway behind the break room, or hate-fucking the bitchy supervisor who loves to show off her tight little body. There comes a point where that's not enough anymore, though.

What I'm looking for: An online friend with benefits. I want to talk about every dirty little thing under the sun. I want to tease you until you can't help but sneak away to the bathroom. I want to swap dirty pictures and audio and video (if you're game for that). But you can't have the benefits without the friend. Bitch about your boss and then we can fantasize about what it would be like to fuck in his office and make a mess of the place. I'll complain about my lack of sleep and you can tell me how you would make me look forward to waking up in the morning.
This is maybe starting to sound more like an online relationship, but that's not really it. I'm just hoping for something casual and fun to take our minds off reality.

Who I'm looking for: If any of this sounds good, then it's probably you. Being married as well gets you bonus points (all the better to commiserate with). Being over 22 would be nice, but exceptions can be made. I don't care about race or body type, as long as you have that passion. Also, please understand that I may disappear for a day or two because of personal and professional responsibilities, and I'll extend you the same courtesy.

So hit me up and let's get to know each other. I'm good with reddit or google or kik, whichever you prefer. Thanks for reading!"

*I've got another superhero story for you all!*


---

Sometimes, your friends can surprise you.

Actually, that's a bad way to say it. That sounds like they snuck up behind you and shouted ""Boo!"", or threw a party for you and didn't tell you until you walked in the door to find your house filled with people and streamers.

Sometimes, your friends can *shock* you.

Elizabeth was one of these friends.

She was short. You could say that was her most defining feature, but first you'd have to ignore everything else about her. Thick glasses, long hair, unusually bright outfits... and that was just how she *looked.* Once you got to know her a bit, finding a 'defining feature' turned into a challenge because she had so many.

Of course, she always told me that's how *everyone* was, and that assuming people only had one thing that stuck out about them was shallow and flat. But you can't believe her when she gets like that. She's special.

Still, if I *had* to pick one thing you'd notice about her first... it's that you wouldn't notice her. Quiet-type. Always sitting in the back with a sketchbook. I, of course, saw this and decided she needed a friend. Can't have someone sitting alone the whole school year. I did that for *two days* and it was the worst third of a week of my whole life.

So I picked a spot next to her, and did my absolute best to start up a conversation. Hellos, what’re you doings, hows your day been, what’s your name, what’s your favorite color? All her answers were one word, *maybe* two, and after a little bit I started getting frustrated. It felt like she didn’t *want* to talk. What kind of person doesn’t want to talk? Of course, she explained it all to me later, how some people just like to be quiet and junk, but I just didn’t get it, at least not then.

Until I finally struck gold, and asked her what she was drawing. At first she was hesitant, and only showed me a few sketches. But they were *good.* I almost thought I was looking at the real thing when she flipped to a drawing of an apple. Except it was black and white, of course.

She didn’t quite seem to get how fantastic they were, though, and it took a few tries before she finally started to believe me and open up a bit. The more I asked, the wider she smiled, even if she tried to hide it, and we got deeper and deeper into the sketchbook. Frogs, dogs, logs and more, all sketched with almost scary detail.


On the last page was something unfinished, a pencil drawing of a person. It was her, except taller, without the glasses, and… she was wearing a cape. That was all I really got before she slammed the book shut. And before I could ask about it, the bell rang and the teacher spun around to stare at me like she already knew that I was planning on talking in class.

Because, I mean, I *was.* But maybe not anymore. She looked ready to hand detention out like a volunteer at a soup kitchen. A grumpy soup kitchen.

Class passed (quietly), and as it turns out, I had almost every other class with her! Lucky for Beth, because I think I was her only friend for a long time. It took until lunchtime before I could ask her about the drawing, though. Elizabeth was sitting in the corner again, far away from everyone else, so I grabbed my own tray of… whatever it was, and made my way over to take a seat.

“Hey!” I dropped my tray to the table. Nothing splattered of course, because it was all like concrete anyway. “So you didn’t get a chance to tell me about the last drawing there before class started.”

She gave me a look. That’s the only way I know how to describe it, really. Like a deer in the headlight. “Why… It’s nothing. Just another sketch.” 

“Nuh-uh.” I knew that was a lie. “It was the best one in there. Looked like one of the Heroes. Sorta like the Spinster, maybe. You want to be a Hero as soon as you get out of school?”

She poked at her food with a fork, instead of eating it. I didn’t blame her. Her voice reminded me of a mouse when she spoke, kind of a squeak. “...sort of. But it’s never gonna happen.”

“Well, why not?” I debated putting some of the food into my own mouth, then decided I’d wait and see just how desperate I really was. “You just don’t have the powers? You could always work with a scientist or something, they’re always building powers. Machines and stuff to make you as strong as a superhero.”

She pushed her own tray away. “No, I’ve… that’s not it. It’s just a silly daydream, really. I’m going to be a nurse when I graduate.”

“Oh! So you *do* have a power!” That didn’t actually surprise me much, lots of people had them. Everyone one in a hundred, or something like that. I wasn’t paying much attention when the number was mentioned in class. “What is it? Come on, show me!”

Instead of jumping up onto the lunch table and shooting sparks over my head, Elizabeth shrunk back into her seat. “No, it’s fine.”

Of course it wasn’t *fine,* she hadn’t gotten to show off anything yet. “I don’t mind if you singe me a little! Give me your best shot!” I held up the spoon I’d never used, ready to toss it underhand at her. 

Before I could even let go, she squeaked again and held up a hand. When I lobbed the spoon, I found that somehow I’d left it behind in midair. Or, rather, she’d done that.

The plastic utensil was encased in a small sphere of shimmering white energy. It flickered, even as I watched, so I reached up to poke it. Under the tip of my finger, it felt as cold and solid as glass.

Then it vanished, and the spoon dropped into my lap. I snatched it up with a laugh, holding it up like Excalibur. “Force fields! You can make forcefields! How in the world could that *not* work for a Hero?”

“That’s all I can do.” She sighed sadly, voice quiet enough that I had to pay careful attention to hear her. “It’s too hard to keep up. I’d rather be a nurse anyway.”

She was lying. I can alway tell.

So right there, I decided to make it my job and turn her into a Hero. It couldn’t be that hard, right?

---

It was really, really hard. Like, I had no idea how much work went into this business. Just a quick search online and I almost gave up.

I’d never been a quitter, though. Except for that one game of basketball I played, that was *awful.* It doesn’t count.


So what do I do when confronted with a mass of paperwork and signing up for different websites and working her way up from internships and getting licences?

Throw it all out the window, of course. We’d do our *own* training.

I don’t think she expected me to show up at her house the next day. Or at least, neither of her parents did. They were *very* nice, polite people. It was almost sickening how many times they apologized and practically ran from room to room to make me more comfortable. It was like she’d never had someone over before.

I… uh, found out later that she hadn’t. Which was just *terrible,* even worse than sitting alone at school. I still don’t understand how she survived without someone to talk to over the summer.

We couldn’t dwell on that for long, though. First we had to put her powers to the test. And that’s exactly what I did, once her parents stopped bugging us long enough to set up my projects. She was reluctant, at first. Maybe she really did think being a nurse was easier. But if I’d learned anything from my math test, it was that sometimes the hardest path gets you the A. And also means you don’t fail and get held back a grade.

Using the most complicated system of spoon-rubber-band catapults, wadded balls of paper, and snacks, I started her training. Maybe that made me sort of her mentor. I hope not, because the mentor always dies in the movies.

Of course, over the next month we didn’t just build up her skills. You’ve gotta make some time for fun when working. Liz would show me more of her sketches, tell me about where she got the ideas for them. I brought her to my house once and we played Mario Kart. When school projects came up, we worked on them together. I was always the one to read the speeches aloud, but I’ll admit they sounded a lot more impressive when *she* wrote them up first.

But despite the fact that we practiced with her forcefields for at least an hour every day, she didn’t seem to be making any progress.

Her sketch followed the same trend. I always saw her working on the Hero drawing, but it was never quite finished. She erased some lines, drew them back, somehow never satisfied.

And eventually, I decided that enough was enough. We would see if she had the stuff to be a hero, once and for all.


And I knew the perfect place for it.

---

“Hurry, this way!” I was wearing a felt mask, and had a bath towel tied around my neck. It probably looked absolutely ridiculous, but I wasn’t trying to win a beauty contest here. 

No, we were here to stop a villain.

Well… more like a petty criminal. Or a thief. Maybe a pickpocket. Whoever happened to be in the building when we got there, I wasn’t worrying about it too much.

She splashed behind me along the street, wearing a much prettier plastic mask and a blanket for a cape. She’d even thought to bring gloves, which was how I knew she was smart. “Wait, wait up! Where are we even *going?”*

In answer, I turned the corner and spread my arms, gesturing toward the tall, rickety apartment building that always seemed to have *something* going on in it’s front lobby. I’d always known I had a good sense of dramatic timing. The clattering from inside the building told me that there *was,* in fact, a suspicious persons wandering around inside, just like I’d thought. “Here we are! Our first step toward becoming *actual* heroes, like you wanted!” I made sure to keep my voice a whisper, but still encouraging. 

Beth, on the other hand, did not look ready at *all.* “Are you… sure about this? It was just a sketch, I didn’t actually mean we had to… come *out* here and fight someone!”

“Relax, Liz. We won’t be fighting anyone, you’ll just hit them from left *field* and I call the cops.” I could feel the grin from my clever pun threatening to break through, but I swallowed it down. Better for her to get it on her own.

Maybe later, like one of those shower thoughts, she’d get it and laugh. Right now though, her face was creased with worry. “I’m not sure about this…”

I grabbed her elbow. “Come *on!”* Pushing forward to the door, I flung it open to slam against the other wall, revealing a shadowy form within. “Halt, evildoer! Your reign of terror is *over&amp;mdash;”

It was Skatter. The man from the television, with his signature backpack in his arms and crouching over, fastening *something* to the floor. It looked almost like a satellite cone.

“Go away.” He stood up, putting his free hand on his hip as he looked down at his work. And I realized something. Skatter was the villain of the century. He was dangerous, and powerful, and terrifying.

He was also really short.

“We’re heroes, here to stop you!” I took a step forward, flinging my cape out as dramatically as I could. “So put the pack down before we have to get serious!”

""Heroes?"" He didn't even look at us, simply rummaging around in that jam-packed backpack of his to find something. ""What made you think you were the heroes? You're just a couple of *children.""*

And when he pulled his hand out, the object pointed at me was quite clearly a gun.

""I deal with *real* heroes.""

When the shot came, I was still frozen on the spot. I could practically see the miniscule orb of death as it flew through the air toward me, shimmering in the dim streetlamp light.

And then I realized I could see it.. And it wasn't moving, anymore. Inches away from my face, shimmering... because it was encased in a tiny forcefield.

Elizabeth gasped from behind me, and the shield dropped, along with the bullet. It clinked harmlessly to the ground.

The short villain scowled, and shot again. The bullet was stopped near the muzzle of the gun this time, dropping down a moment later. Throwing a glance back over my shoulder, I was greeted with the sight of Beth concentrating, not even breathing. Slowly, she took a single step forward.

Skatter took a step back. ""You don't want to do this. I have *much* worse things."" The gun clattered to the ground next to the bullet, as he quickly rummaged through his backpack again.

She let out her breath with a huff. ""No... I... I think I *do* want to stop you from hurting my friend."" And in an instant, Skatter himself was encased in a round, glittering orb. Holding her hands out, Elizabeth took a few steps forward and splayed her fingers on the outside, where it seemed to get just a little bit stronger from her touch.

I was still frozen on the spot, running through how I’d almost just *died.* Not that I told that to anyone else later, they didn’t need to know that. I played it off as letting Beth speak her mind for once.

Because that’s exactly what she did. Breathing slowly, but steadily, keeping the field up longer and stronger than I’d ever seen before. Maybe she’d been practicing on the sly. Maybe she was better than she’d thought.

Maybe she just had a reason to try, now.

“You only deal with… *real* heroes?” She questioned him quietly through the transparent barrier. “You asked me a question. ‘What makes us think we’re the heroes’. And you know what? *We did.”* We made us think we were heroes.”

Skatter pounded on the wall uselessly with his fists, but Elizabeth didn’t even flinch, still talking in little more than a whisper. “People decide who they are. You decided, long ago, to be a villain. Today… today, I decided to be a hero.”

He had nothing to say to that, slumping backward in the sphere.

It was about this point that I finally got my mind back and my phone out to call the police. All I had to say was “Skatter,” and they were already on their way, even before I finished telling them what street we were on. And all the while that I paced back and forth, telling them what they needed to know, Elizabeth watched the captured villain, hands on her forcefield. I couldn’t tell what she was thinking, or even if she was thinking about anything other than keeping the field from collapsing.

The cop cars arrived only minutes later, all flashing lights and wailing sirens and screeching tires like in an action movie, and when they burst from inside they were wielding guns and handcuffs, looking ready for the fight of their lives.

Instead, they found Skatter caught and caged like an animal. His greatest strength had always been getting away before someone could get their hands on him, leaving wreckage behind. But now he could do none of that. He didn’t even attempt to resist when the police dog-piled him as soon as Beth dropped the shield.

And soon enough, the city’s greatest, most feared villain was being dragged away in handcuffs.


I sort of… woke up, I guess you could say, back at Elizabeth’s place. Her parents were talking with the police, something about the media and keeping it quiet for a while. I found myself sitting on the couch. It was still running through my head, the fact that I’d almost died, but a faint scratching noise, very familiar, dragged me out of it.

She was sitting at the table, sketchbook open, to what I could see was the last page. Pencil in hand, she drew in long, quick strokes, eyes focused on the lines on the paper.

After a minute of just watching, I stood up. “I… thanks. Thanks, Beth. Really.” It felt like the words were sandpaper, tearing up my throat. “You, uh… saved my life. Twice. After I dragged you into the mess.”

She simply glanced up at me with a smile, eyes bright behind her glasses, then resumed drawing. “That’s okay. Everything ended up all right in the end.”

“It coulda been bad, though.” Reaching up to scratch the back of my head, I leaned over her shoulder to look at the sketch. “So thanks.”

It was the unfinished hero. Except now, her cape was drawn in with thick, confident lines, and she had her face, eyes and nose. Her expression was determined, even if not quite without fear. Elizabeth tapped out a few more spots, then leaned back to give it one last look. “I should be thanking you. I *can* do it. I *can* be a hero.”

She grinned up at me like it was the best day of her life, despite the cold night, the wet puddles, the fact that we’d been *shot* at. “I just have to keep trying.” With one final stroke, she finished the sketch. 

A small smile, shining from the paper.

And in that moment, I think that bright and happy smile was her most defining feature.

6y5um4,8,2017-09-05,[Rant/Vent] Possible NMom,pixelys,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6y5um4/rantvent_possible_nmom/,"Before I start I'm just going to preface this with: I am very anxious about posting this... I've been a long-time lurker of this sub and I have noticed very very similar parallels to my own mother and the nmoms on this sub. My girlfriend has too, and she's encouraged me to make this big post summing up my experiences with my possible Nmom. I've read a lot about nparents and I even went through the characteristics of them listed [here](http://parrishmiller.com/narcissists.html) and my mom seems to fit to a T. 
I feel like my abuse isn't as bad as the abuse that most people on this sub suffer. There are people on this sub that go through hell every day and I feel like my abuse is just a series of minor-ish incidents that just culminate into a festering wound. As stated earlier, my girlfriend suggested that I list out as many as these incidents as I can remember(I have repressed a lot of them) and see if the good folk on RBN can offer me advice. 

**Golden Child Sister**

My younger sister has always been the golden child. It's very obvious that my mom favors her in every way possible. It was even noticeable when I was younger. I personally do not remember this, but I was told by a family friend that when we were all younger, her mom noticed that my nmom had an obvious preference for my younger sister, so she stopped talking to my mom entirely. When referring to my sister in Spanish(we are Latino), my parents call her ""la chiquita"", which translates to an affectionate way of saying ""the little one"". When referring to me, they call me ""la otra"", translating to: ""the other one"". My mom talks to my sister and hangs out with her very often, and lets her get away with things that I would be screamed at for mercilessly. Whenever I bring it up to my mom that she favors my sister, she goes into hysterics and cries, saying that I'm hurting her by saying that. I remember once she said: ""What do I need to do to prove to you that I love you as much as I love your sister? Do I need to cut myself open and bleed out for you to understand that?"" Both of my parents(my dad is slightly an enabler) will point out that it's *my* fault that I'm not as close to my mom as my sister is, because I'm always locked away in my room(for reasons you will come to understand the more this post develops.) My edad also says that my mom doesn't favor my sister, it's only my perception of the situation(gaslighting?) 
There was also the situation of the car. My sister and I used to share an old, rinky dink 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer that is a pile of junk, but it still runs. I am in community college and I have to commute every day, along with having to commute for various internships across the state of North Carolina that I am required to have to stay in the college program I'm in. My sister is a senior in high school. Recently, my parents purchased a new car. Sweet! Now I have a car to myself, finally, right? Wrong. My mom insists that I have to share the car with my sister because ""its unfair to her"" that I would have the new car and she would be ""stuck with the old car"" even though it works just fine. I tried to communicate to my mom that I have to drive 30 minutes to school every day, along with internships that could be up to 2 hours away. My sister drives a total of 10 minutes to her high school. My mom refused to listen and maintained her stance that I don't ""deserve"" the car, and we will both be sharing the new car whether I liked it or not. I guess that's not really a serious issue but it still really grinded my gears, especially after I got my dad to admit that the car *was* originally for me, but my mom *insisted* that me and my golden-child sister share it. 

**Holding Things Over My Head**

My mom will use things she's done for me as proof to show that she ""really loves me."" For example, last year, I attended a private university in Pennsylvania in which my parents took out a 20,000 dollar loan for. While I was there, I had a severe mental breakdown and had to be admitted to the mental hospital(which they did not visit me at.) Eventually, during my second semester, they let me drop out and come home, as I was hopelessly suicidal and failing my classes. 
When I confronted my mom about the car-issue, I brought up the fact that she favors my GC sister. She sarcastically came back with: ""Yeah, I love your sister more than I love you, and that's why I took out a 20-thousand dollar loan for her last year!"" 
She'll hold these things that are absolutely irrelevant over my head? She does so in the next example:

**Making my mental illness all about her**

She does this quite often, but I can most clearly exemplify this with one story. My family(GC sister, nmom, edad, supportive brother, and sister-in-law) all went on a trip to Paris. It was around 12:30 am and we were around the Eiffel Tower, watching it glimmer as it does at nighttime. We rounded a corner to see a bunch of girls screaming and running the opposite way. My dad then spots a man with a gun, and yells ""GUN"" and tells us to run. We go bolting down the street. Eventually we get away and the man disappeared with no shots fired. However, I was having a silent panic attack. While I have panic attacks, I get very aggressive and snappy. My nmom asked me if I was okay, to which I snapped back ""No!"". She immediately smacked me. I began to walk away. I was wearing a hoodie, and she yanked me back towards her by my hood, choking me. I exploded on her and told her that she always treated me like garbage when I have anxiety attacks. She said nothing to me for the rest of the night when we were in Paris. When we finally got back to the hotel, my sister-in-law began to pour us drinks. ""We need it after tonight!"" My sister-in-law said. My mom sighed, and my brother asked if the shooter-incident had stressed her out. My mom said ""That didn't stress me out as much as *this one,*"" She pointed to me. 
She then proceeded to go onto the porch with my brother and sister-in-law and talk shit about how my anxiety and depression is ""so hard for her"", right where I can hear. I remember her saying things like, ""They've tried everything!"" (They haven't) (I've only had like 2 therapists) ""They give her homework and exercises and skills but nothing works for her!"" Eventually I began to break down, and ran into the bathroom where I was sobbing. My mom came in and asked why I was so upset. I said something along the lines of, ""Everyone hates me and would be so much better off if I were dead."" To which she replied, ""Nice."" and left the bathroom. Not even 20 seconds later, she came back, as if to get the last word in, and said something like: ""If I hated you and would be better off with you dead then I wouldn't have let you drop out of college when you were depressed!"" Again, going back to holding things over my head when they're not relevant. 

Another story that I actually just remembered about my mental illness being ""so hard"" for her: One time, in about 8th-9th grade, I had cut myself. My nmom saw the marks on my arm and proceeded to freak out. Instead of asking me if I was okay and getting me help, she locked herself in her room and began packing a bag, saying over and over again that she was going to leave. She went into full blown hysterics and I begged her not to leave. She was sobbing and said ""I want to be with my mom"", my grandmother, who was dead. My gc sister was furious at me for almost making our mom leave and my edad wouldn't even talk to me.

**Attention Seeking?**

This is kind of a smaller bullet point but she does a lot of things for attention. For example, a few days ago my (golden-child) sister got into an accident during cheer practice. Nmom then proceeded to post [this](http://i.imgur.com/gKvkHhv.png) on Facebook. I was absolutely floored. I mean, I guess I should have expected it, but like.... It was obvious it was just for sympathy and pity. It was just unbelievable. 

**Body-Shaming Comments**

I don't have an attractive body. I'm misshapen and I have very (TMI?) flabby, saggy breasts. My nmom often makes fun of them and calls them ""udders"", and will make a point to grab them and ""milk"" me like I'm a cow. She's even got my gc sister doing it, too, even though I've told them repeatedly that I don't like that and it hurts my feelings.
Also, my hair. All throughout high school, I had long hair that I wanted to cut short. My mom would not allow me to, and would constantly tell me that I would look ugly with short hair. Finally, when I moved out to go to college for half a year, I cut it. She instantly told me that I looked terrible and she wished I had kept it long. Whenever she can, she'll always make a point to tell me how beautiful I *used* to be, and how she wishes my hair were long again. Example [here](http://i.imgur.com/eiodbmm.png)


Anyways, that's my spiel. Sorry it's really long and kind of unorganized and I left out a lot because I had a panic attack mid-writing this post, but these are the points that came to my mind. Welcome to my life. "
6y5xzj,1,2017-09-05,"Internship in Tokyo, Japan pays 100,000 yen/month. Is this enough?",Dom_Flannel_Guy,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/6y5xzj/internship_in_tokyo_japan_pays_100000_yenmonth_is/,"Hello everyone! I need your advice and input.


I recently got the opportunity to interview with a software company who, if all goes well, may wish to offer me an internship position in Tokyo, Japan for 2 semesters. This is what the company offers:


   - 100,000 yen/month


   - Free housing


   - Free city transportation card


My question is, will this be enough money to live comfortably? I understand that 100,000 equates to just a little over $900, which for a full time position in software, is almost a joke. But I would hope the experience as a whole may come to be more of a benefit to me in the end.


What do you all think? Will this be enough money? I appreciate any input and advice!"

6y779z,4,2017-09-05,I'm worried about my future career prospects.,Maverick3350,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6y779z/im_worried_about_my_future_career_prospects/,"I am 23 years old, about to enter my final year of my bachelor's degree at university. I'm studying Computer and Information Security. My grades are really good and I'm doing well on my course. I'm loving it.

However, I currently have no work experience. I did do volunteering for a year though, which I found to be very enriching for me. It helped me to gain teamwork skills as well as build up my confidence.

Due to some serious mental health difficulties, I was unable to pursue an internship, although I did try. Because of my circumstances, it's easier for me to simply do my final year and then seek a graduate job.

The thing is, I'm terrified I won't get a job. I did score a couple of interviews whilst looking for an internship and my CV is good. However, some employers want me to do some online tests and so far, I've done this twice. I failed both times. I feel so useless and angry when I have to jump through these fucking stupid hoops, just to get a fucking interview.

I understand that an employer wants to test an applicant, to ensure that they are as skilled as they claim. But I think some of these tests are absolutely fucking ridiculous. I had to do a stupid logic test and I honestly don't understand how to fucking answer them. It just seems like total bullshit to me. Why can't I be given a more useful task like writing a mock report or something? That is a useful task and I am actually a very good writer.

I'm just scared of applying for graduate jobs and I'm starting to feel hopeless about my prospects."

6y8m67,17,2017-09-05,Runebook challenges and rewards,JuWee,QuakeChampions,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuakeChampions/comments/6y8m67/runebook_challenges_and_rewards/,"Let me open by stating that I like the idea of the Runebook. While some challenges are unfit to be included (i.e. 50 kamikaze kills) and I hope will be removed/tweaked, most of them actually encourage players to explore what the game has to offer to its fullest extend. For example winning X matches of type Y. This will move people out of their favourite modes to try a different mode. Weapon X god will encourage players to try different weapons instead of only the holy three and, not unimportant, memorise ammo locations instead of just cycling weapons.

I recently completed a challenge where I had to use Visor's ability 100 times. Visor is a pretty weak champion but I've always liked his new design (he was my old forcemodel) and, even though its limited in its practical application, his new ability. Chasing this challenge was quite fun, had me using a ""weaker"" class, had me search out all the little hour glasses on the different maps and not unimportant get really familiar with Visor's ability. I'd say thats a pretty good effect from a progression system apart from the extra time I spend playing your game.

I also feel its a fun extra method to earn favor, boxes/chests and even shards on top of the usual levelling and xp structure. While I am not neccesarily a fan of progression in games if it has to be in there I think this is quite well done even taking some of the quake ""lore"" into account.

-=+=-

Now the first line of reward for the runebook is that each completed elder god circle gets you a color. I feel this is a fitting reward since you are already rewarded for each seperate challenge you complete anyway. I can imagine its a nice little extra motivator while trying to complete a full page of rune challenges.

The final reward though is.. hold your breath.. a color, an icon and a nameplate. This is extremely underwhelming and imho, not fitting for the amount of work required. To me it appears that, and I could be wrong, the Runebook is the long term progression system. You get **a color, an icon and a nameplate** as a reward after, what I guess would be months of playtime?

Now lets look at the lore system. This is easy to complete even if you do not exploit the game and ruin it for other players. I'd say im at 40% or thereabouts by just playing the game. I can see myself completing them in maybe a week or two/three without trying too hard. Even if your not into cosmetics its clear to see the reward for completing these is extremely high; **full unique costumes for each champion**. This reward is currently unmatched in the game!

Unlike shaders where, apart from the originals, most of them look like poor, uninspired recolors that were done by an intern, these costumes actually took time and skill to create. A concept had to be drawn, it had to be sculpted/modelled, unwrapped and properly textured. And most of them are actually quite beautiful! Its obvious they cut corners with BJ (don't tell me its related to lore) but other then that most of them look gorgeous. And you can earn them relatively easy!

-=+=-

This leaves me absolutely baffled. I would understand if finding all the lore items for a champion would give you a color and an icon or nameplate. That would fit with the amount of effort it requires. But a whole unique costume? That is something I'd expect after completing the page for a champion in the Runebook!

What a fitting reward that would be! After having collected all the runes for a champion and completing all the rune challenges you get something really unique! Something everybody can see and understand the ""value"" of. It would also signify you are a force to be reckoned with when playing that champion. It makes perfect sense to me.

Right now having a ""lore costume"" signals nothing more except the fact that the player ran into lots and lots of pots. Most likely it means the player in question has been exploting the game and ruining various duels just to aquire them. I feel a chance has been wasted here.

While I realize they cannot revert this current reward scheme and take away the rewards people have ""earned"" I really do hope they consider creating unique ""Rune costumes"" for all the champions as the ultimate reward after completing the runebook for that champion. The current rewards feel extremely underwhelming.

-=+=-

While most players realise perfectly well there is no true value to digital rewards in games, chasing a digital reward can be fun especially if it challenges you in an appropriate fashion. I feel the Runebook, with some notable exceptions, does a good job of that. 

I really hope they make the progression loop worthwhile with a reward that feels like it matches the required effort. I think it would really elevate the Runebook to a different level.

What do you guys and girls think?

*Also my English sucks. Sorry about that too. This post will be full of errors^(I have dictionary on another tab right now lel)*

---
So yeah this is something happened to me. This even might not be something significant for a normal person but for me this is a big thing. One of the biggest proofs that show that AVPD will actually fork me life up.  Or idk. I already hate myself and i wanna die so my words shouldn't be trusted

After delaying my internship thingy (necessary to graduate) for 2 years, i did it this summer. My family had to get involved to find a me a place to do it. They found someone who is kind of our relatives. (not so close-but they acted like they were, probably even more) 

---
Btw it is a coding job. I am studying Computer Science. It isn't a proper legit one thought. It is a nice school but it is just too easy and was free. Teachers are literally doing whatever they can do just to graduate the students. It was easier than high school for sure. I didnt do any of the group projects, assignments cuz of avpd but i still passed those classes. They let you past that easy.

---
So yeah these relatives/software company (with 20+ employees) want me to work with them, turn into a proper employee that will  specialize in some topics. They are okay with it taking time, they are okay with me not talking (as long as job is getting done), they were even okay with if stuff dont get done at first because of my shyness. They would give me more time till i get,u know, get loose and start talking (which would never happen)

---
I stayed there more then 2 months. They paid me actual money. (+30% more then the minimum wage in my country + transportation + money for lunch)**[basically and amazing opportunity for a junior like me]**. For those 2+ months i didnt help them at all. I just learned stuff from internet. That's it. (they said it is normal. apparently one of their current employees didn't get involved in any actual project for 6 months) So to my 
(broken and worthless) understanding they are aiming for a long term worker thingy.(i dont know how to say it in English but i hope you understand. They are aiming to have me as an employee for a long time)

---

From i leave the house till i get back to it, i would just melt. It was way too hard for me. (it still is) I would not even say hi when i enter the office. I couldnt talk about any of my issues related to the work(or in general). (for example i need the password of my ""boss"" to install some driver etc. I would simply not do it and wait till they ask if anything wrong.[which would rarely happen cuz they were usually busy af and they were expecting me to talk about my issues like a normal person ]). Close to end of the internship i kinda started to get involved on an actually project and my ""mentor"" gave me and task which dint even have any coding part in it. I were needed to simply test a part of the software and tell him if it works or not.(which would probably take less then 15 mins if i wasnt a piece of poop.) .But I came across to an issue that needed talking (like getting the admin password for stuff etc) so i simply didnt return with a response. After like 2+ week that task still wasn't completed.

---
###This post turning into a mess. I'll try to keep it simple
I left. 

damn. even just leaving the job was a nightmare. It took more then a week just to manage to make a request. I couldnt even talk face to face so i had to call them after work. Day after that i talked with them face to face (of course they offered it. I cant even even leave my desk because of myself. I am an actual loser).

I told them I wanted to leave because i:

1. sucked at work

2. couldnt talk

I was(and am) dead serious with both of these. They didnt agree with number one (they werent fully convinced about numba2 too). They said they were okay with me being not talkative. But as i laid more emphasis on 2. issue. They kinda understood this being something more then just being shy. But this time they wanted me to press this issue instead of running away from it (like u know, leaving the job)

---
---
So they were really nice people in general and this was an unequal-able opportunity for a normal person. But i left because i have so self-confidence or hope for myself. I just ruin everything and everyone i am close too. I feel sorry just because i am me/alive etc.

**Ugh sorry i both wanna write more (just because i feel like i need it) and stop (because i am a piece of sheet and i should be killed and i should be dead) at the same time.**  

tl;dr: I suck. I dont even know what was the point of this post. Sorry for everything. i hate myself.

6y9q0z,98,2017-09-05,That time I was tricked into seeing a Mormon reprogrammer,sacredxsecret,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/6y9q0z/that_time_i_was_tricked_into_seeing_a_mormon/,"Or at least, that's what my parents eventually admitted to me. I'll try and keep this short, but I'm wondering how many other people, if any, had this happen?

When I was 16 my parents *finally* agreed to let me see a psychiatrist. I'd been asking since I was 13 and had a name to put to what I'd been experiencing since 2nd grade, and that was OCD. So when finally my parents see enough of a problem with me, they let me go. And sure enough, quick diagnosis, write me a prescription, send me on my way. But my mom didn't notice enough of a change in me, so she took me back and convinced the doctor to add an anti-depressant(I was not depressed. I was exhausted. 5:45am seminary, a heavy academic school load, a part-time job, and an internship, along with all the church activities). But, I got more meds. 

When that didn't fix me, my mom went to the bishop. I wouldn't find out this course of events for quite some time. So when I was 17, all of a sudden I was being told to take the metro to a therapist twice a week. So I went. In my mind, this was a great opportunity to talk to someone about my transition away from my parents' rigid beliefs and upbringing as I was in my senior year and planning to get the hell out. I was no danger to myself or others, so I presumed I had confidentiality. 

I was wrong. It came to light after about a month of sessions when I had dogged on TSCC repeatedly. I had lost my faith years before and was just biding my time until I turned 18. But she started gently plugging TSCC. And at some point she admitted she was a member. But then it all fell apart. It really all fell apart one day because I came out of my session and saw another girl(an especially troubled one) from my ward in the waiting room with her father(a state senator, I might add) and mother. 

Then I knew something was up. This person was not a licensed social worker. She was a Mormon ""reprogrammer,"" or so I was told after it all came to light. Everything I had told her in confidence, she turned around and told my parents. So this was all sorts of fun information about my sex life, drinking, planning to leave home and so on. She said because she had not taken an oath, she did not have to abide by confidentiality because I was a minor and my parents had hired her. She wanted me to keep coming to sessions. My mom, of course, wanted me to, as well. How else would she know what was going on with me? My dad was silently raging in the background of all of this. And that's when you know it's bad..... when he's quiet. 

This really shook my belief in psychotherapy for a long time. I stopped taking all the medication. I really never was depressed. The OCD is real, but I have long since come up with my own coping mechanisms and I get along without problem. My ex-husband really wanted me to sue everyone I possibly could, but it didn't seem worth it except if maybe it meant it wouldn't happen to someone else. 

Just curious if anyone else has had this happen? I have to imagine it's a thing. I don't live in Utah, so if these people exist here, they must exist elsewhere. "
6y9sit,1,2017-09-05,Me [21 M] contemplating my relationship with my girlfriend [19 F] of almost two years.,mikepencesmailman,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6y9sit/me_21_m_contemplating_my_relationship_with_my/,"Here it goes. I've been dating my girlfriend for a couple months shy of two years. We met online (not on a dating website but on a social media one). We met four years ago on the site and have been really close ever since. She is from a whole other region of the country than I am so we were just flying back and forth to visit each other for a little until I moved to her state.

When I moved to her state last year, it was the first time I had ever lived away from my friends and family ever. It was very different for me because her family and friends became the new people I had to rely on. This was very different for me and I didn't like it at all from the beginning. I always just felt kind of out of place. Another thing that bothered me about living their was our constant fighting. It was never over anything big. I eventually had to move back home for schooling purposes and I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off of my shoulders.

We stayed together after this because despite the fighting, I loved her a lot. We went back and for visiting each other up until December 2016. She decided to move in with me and my family to my home. This is where things started to go worse. The first few weeks of her living with us wasn't bad. I was really excited to be able to see both my girlfriend and the people at home whenever I wanted. This slowly went bad when she started to get homesick. We started getting into little arguments again and I could tell that every time we fought she would fall into a deep depression. It brought my mood down too. She admitted that she would become depressed because whenever we fought she had no one to vent to because her family was so far away. I understood this.

The fighting got a little bit better as time went on, she started to work more, and the weather got nicer. During the spring I was actively looking for an internship in my home state. Then the idea was brought up that I look for one in her home state. At the time it didn't seem like a bad idea. We were doing pretty good and I knew I'd miss her if I didn't go back to her state with her because she had to go back in the summer for her schooling.

I got an internship in her state and we moved back there. This brings us to present day. I started the internship in May. Things started off really good. I really liked the internship and she got a nice full time summer job. Then as it always seems to go, it lost its luster. We started to fight a lot again.

Now, I've been very vague with everything that happened in the past but I'm going to be descriptive for the events of this past week. She started school three weeks ago. At first I was very excited for her but homework quickly began to consume her time. I start work at 9 and get off at 5 Monday-Friday. She goes to school around 10 and gets home about 4. When she gets home she does hours of homework. I completely understand this but where we are living with each other and I don't know anyone here, this leads to me sitting around the house for the whole time that I'm home. This is driving me crazy. It's making me miss home hardcore.

The fighting has also picked up. This started last week when I told her I was thinking about going home soon due to the fact I asked her if we'd be able to spend some time together that night and she said we'll see. She was really pissed about me saying this and it led to hostility for the next few days (loaded with tiny and insignificant arguments). Then we went out to a restaurant this past weekend. We had been arguing before because I told her that I don't like shopping at that I didn't want to do any more that day. We had done about an hour of it and we were in another city doing some sightseeing. We were still arguing about it at the restaurant. I eventually told her to stop and let everyone else enjoy their dinner. She got pissed and just walked away from the table. It was half an hour before she came back. I apologized just to have a good rest of the night and things were fine. 

The next day we go to the mall and get into another huge argument over me not wanting to go to more of her stores because we spent a good amount of time the day before shopping. This led to her storming out of the mall and her telling me she wasn't giving me a ride home. Thankfully her door was unlocked and I got in the car before she did. The ride home was filled with argument and she told me she wanted to break up. She told me that she wanted me to go home and complained about my friends and family.

Yesterday she said that she wants me to stay as long as I can. It's getting to be too much for a relationship that's forcing me to be away from my friends and family.

I've been wondering about what it would be like to be with another girl for a while now. I have a strong feeling just to break up with her and go experience what I've been missing. I don't know if I should break up with her though because I really do love her deep down and I don't want to be lonely. She cares deeply for me but her moodswings and the fact I'm so far away from everyone else I care about is draining me emotionally and mentally.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Met a girl online. I move halfway across country to be with her. We argue all the time. Then she moves in with me. Argue all the time again. Very mentally draining. Wondering about what else is out there for me.

6y9v5o,2,2017-09-05,Me (22m) and GF (21f) are monogamous but recently she was pushing for an open relationship,probablybadeverywher,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/6y9v5o/me_22m_and_gf_21f_are_monogamous_but_recently_she/,"We both wrote this and are reading replies, although its from my point of view since I use reddit. Kinda irrelevant throwaway name from a different issue (hopefully).

My junior year of HS, I met my current girlfriend Amy at a summer retreat. We became good friends, and I could tell she had a huge crush on me. I was attracted to her, but I was awkward and not really ready to date, so we remained friends. We ended up at the same college, and as I got closer to her I fell in love, and asked her out.

We quickly were heading towards a serious relationship, and before we made it official I warned her that I couldn't do anything casual or open. I knew that she had a history of being both poly and monogamous, and that she had a deep urge for love. She thought it over for a week, and then she told me that she cared about me enough to commit to a closed relationship with me, despite her fear of commitment/being hurt. Her last monogamous relationship messed her up quite a bit. After that everything was perfect. We grew together, we bickered, we loved, we adventured, and we grew a deep love that we both saw as soulmate love, as cheesy as that is. She would even get a little jealous whenever I made friends with girls, and told me she was worried about me getting curious what being with other people was like. She never tried to restrict me though (tell me who i can or can’t talk to) as she has told me one of her own fears is to be in a relationship where a partner is controlling. I don’t restrict her in any way as well and I trust her. 

At our 2.5 year mark, we were at a point of being inseparable. With a lack of space and stress from finals came fighting. At that point, I was set to leave for a summer internship far away, and she was set to take a summer class and then travel. We both appreciated the distance for a while, and kept loose-ish contact. She got really into this mmo game, and she started playing in a group with a guy that was into her. I knew about him, but what I didn't know was that she developed feelings for him, and they told each other this to talk it out (with some light flirting). I understand that it’s normal for people to develop crushes on others even when in a relationship. She called me the next day (after they confessed to each other) sobbing, saying what happened. I tried calming her down, and telling her that everything is ok. For a couple days it was, but then all of a sudden I couldn't stop thinking about it, and brought it up. We talked, and she mentioned thinking about an open relationship, which destroyed me. In the fights I was insecure and asked if I was at least more attractive, and she said that although we were each attractive in different ways, he had a better body objectively, after I was being stubborn about wanting an answer. With me being in such a low place with my self esteem, this destroyed me further as I was a little insecure about my body. We fought a lot after that, almost broke up, and stopped talking for a few weeks. She really, really does not like being shut out during conflicts. She likes to talk things out and she’s always honest about her thoughts and feelings. But during my lowest times I like to run away and keep distance to protect myself. It's a bad habit that I developed after getting hurt in the past, but it's something I've been trying to improve on. All that was going through my head was that the love of my life let herself fall in love with this guy and now wants to open our relationship for him.  

The summer was over, and we both got back to our college town and talked in person. She explained that me leaving her alone was horrible and that while I wanted reassurance from her about our relationship, I didn’t do the same for her. Nonetheless, she has said that she wants to be with me, and that although she sees me as a life partner she thinks that we maybe met too early in life. She sees love as a beautiful human nature, and if she loves someone she would always regret not exploring it and expressing it with that person (whether it is familial, friendship or romantic). Her intense desire to express her love stems from her loss of friends and family. Some natural, some suicide. She asks multiple times and tries to convince me to be open to the idea of being poly, but deep down I know that I will be miserable if I let her. I’ve had my crushes on others while in this relationship but, I'm not the type of person who loves more than one at a time, and when I love someone it is deep and uncontrollable. 
I tell her that there's a very real chance that I could fall in love with someone else in the same way I love her now during the open relationship and that might diminish/ruin the relationship we have. We looked into taking a break, but again I don't want to sit and hold off on exploring relationships while she does her thing. I tell her that if we take a break, that since we're both leaving to different cities after school she might never see me again, and I might find love with someone else. Right now we're deciding to stay together and ride it out, but without any direction to the future. I would do anything to keep her, and as much as I want to try poly, I just know that I would be absolutely miserable in one. 

TLDR: Start as monogamous, GF who was previously polyamorous develops first crush outside of relationship, she wants to try open relationship and as much as I would like to try, I have a horrible dread about it. Should I try it anyways? Take a break? Anything? "

Option 2: Go straight into my field and go the business route.

Option 3: Apply to be a Air Force pilot, or apply for the CIA, etc, some exciting government route.

Option 4: Go for MBA

Any advice is great, thanks"
6yaakx,6,2017-09-05,My family not letting me (22) leave to the UK to my girlfriend (23),Can-UK_ldr,LDR,https://www.reddit.com/r/LDR/comments/6yaakx/my_family_not_letting_me_22_leave_to_the_uk_to_my/,"My girlfriend (Portuguese) and I (Chinese) have been in a long distance relationship for 1 year and 3 months now. She’s in the UK and I’m in Canada, she came for a week long visit recently. During the week I mentioned to my parents that I would like to move to the UK to be with her after receiving my degree from university which is just about 2 years.

Being from a Chinese family, I don’t normally open up to my parents about dating etc… My plans of course shocked my parents even though I've been mentioning that maybe I could take several internships in the UK. However my parents and brother see it as me not wanting to be a part of the family anymore and think that I’m sacrificing their happiness for mine and calling me selfish as they do not want me to leave.

In private with me, my mother voices her reasonable concerns about finance, commitments to our relationship, and what would happen if things go wrong for me while I’m there and I’d be left with no help. I've also never had the opportunity to live on my own which may be the largest factor as to why she is so afraid to let me go.

My girlfriend was in tears when she spoke to my mother one-on-one about how she wants me to be with her while she finished her university degree. Instead she made a deal with my girlfriend that in 4 years she would be the one who needs to move to Canada after she completed university. After these 4 years I would be 26 and she would be 27. The idea of me leaving the continent sits so poorly with them they’d rather inconvenience my girlfriend even though they understand that she too has a family and other personal issues to attend to. Due to me not being able to leave the continent my girlfriend is the one who needs to visit me once a year.

Is there any advice anyone could offer?

Thanks for reading.

p.s. Please don’t bash on my family too hard I do understand why they’re so upset and might think I’m even stupid but perhaps people on this forum could help out from our perspective."
6yabkq,207,2017-09-05,She broke up with me 3 months ago. We still work together. I can't turn the corner.,strugglingbigtime,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6yabkq/she_broke_up_with_me_3_months_ago_we_still_work/,"Title is as succinct as I can tell the story. Below is how I'll always remember it.

We met when I was 23. She was a summer intern and I was entry level. I felt it even back then--but she had a long term boyfriend back at school. When she graduated, she took an entry level job at my company, but still had the boyfriend. We became close, we worked directly with one another and had a deep mutual respect. 

She broke up with her boyfriend, which I never saw coming, but I still didn't know if I had a chance--after all, she was so buttoned up, she wouldn't date a co-worker. Then one night after drinks with our team, we fell asleep intertwined on a close co-workers couch. We didn't talk about it the next day, I knew if I broke the silence I'd make it weird, make it uncomfortable, risk losing a close friendship, not to mention any chance of making it something more... which now seemed possible. A week later, *she* made the move, and it was pure bliss. I remember leaving her apartment in the morning and telling the uber driver that it was the greatest night of my entire life--and I meant it. I could truly feel the future unfolding for me--the dream girl wanted me.

We took it slow, we couldn't let work know, and she wasn't sure if she was ready for something serious yet, which I was respectful of. But it was too real, and she fell in love with me like I had with her, and we decided to give it a go. We continued working together, but eventually she moved to a different team and we could finally make it public--we loved eachother, we were together, it was real. 

We wouldn't fight, but I guess we weren't perfectly fitting puzzle pieces--she's introverted, closed off, a little bit cold--I'm outgoing, social, I wear my heart on my sleeve. But those opposite aspects were things I cherished in her, and felt like should be special to her as well. She could keep me level-headed, give me an excuse to not go out and just be with someone alone, relaxed. And I could challenge her to find the limits of her comfort zone, and carefully try to expand them, knowing I'd be there to catch her. It was like this for nearly 2 years.

She broke up with me at the start of the summer. She said she loved me, but she wasn't sure what the future held (she was considering a new job, or more school), and she felt she couldn't make the best decision for herself because she was influenced by being with me. She said she knows its selfish, but she had to take off the rose-tinted glasses that I had become for her. She felt there was pressure from the fact that some of my friends were getting married. She simply needs to be single and free to make sure she's doing what's best for her own future happiness outside of a relationship.

I was lost, and I think I still am. I understand her reasoning, and I respect it. I can't say I love someone unconditionally, then turn around and say she has to love me back, or that I don't want her to do what she feels she needs to do. But what we had seemed so special, and I felt like together, we could take on anything that lay on the road ahead--even if we couldn't see around every bend before us. But that's not what she wants.

We still work together. There was once a constant stream of sharing between us, but in one afternoon she closed the tap completely, and now all that's left is the strange silence between us when we're forced to be in the same room, or when we pass one another. We've had curt business-like discussions when work has forced us to. I got a chance to get my thoughts off my chest (after all, I had been blindsided and had no real coherent thoughts to share when she broke it off) and seek more closure, but besides that there's been nothing. It's killing me.

I've used this summer to try and better myself. I scored in the 94th percentile on the GMAT and am applying to top business schools. I can't quit my job just yet, it's too good of a position to let go of even if it's torture to be here, in the place where I fell in love, and lived in a dream for almost 2 years. But I have to make a positive change for myself and maybe school is that. I guess I was wearing rose-tinted glasses too. But it all feels so empty, I feel so lost. I can't seem to get past everything I feel I've lost, and the fact that this is something she *wants*. I worry she'll just get into another relationship, that it *was* something wrong with me, unlike her explanation.

It's been 3 months and I still find myself fighting back tears. I still find myself dying to talk to someone about it, to one of our mutual friends to find out what she's thinking, or saying, or doing. I want to scream, cry, tear down the walls. I want to be alone, and I want to be surrounded by my friends to forget the emptiness consuming me. I want to get into a top MBA program across the country, and I want to stay put and have everything go back to how it was.

That's it, I guess. Part of me just needed to type it out, I think. If you read it all... Thanks.

1. Lower Wiegraf's Attack.  
2. Lower Wiegraf's Defense.  

**Notes:**

* Wiegraf is 100% physical - in addition, at random points throughout the fight, Weigraf will retreat to the back row, making him immune to all melee ranged attack.  
* Note he has a small chance to counter black or white magic with a ST attack that has a small chance to silence.

**Notes:**

* Belias is joined by three (3) Archaeodaemons - you only need to defeat Belias to end the battle.  
* You'll face a mixed offense here, and Belias likes to use attacks which can inflict silence, petrify, and confuse.  
* Honestly, bring a Orlandeau OSB, use one charge on the first fight to one-shot Wiegraf, and use the 2nd to one-shot Belias :)

**Note(s):**   

* You'll face three waves here: Monk/Archer/Thief, Knight/Time Mage/White Mage, and Black Mage/Summoner/Summoner.  
* This is a fairly easy fight, and with their low HP totals, you are encouraged to go the AoE route. Bringing along a AoE BSB will also help immensely.  
* There is one target score in each wave - don't forget to complete them.

**Target Scores:**    

1. Lower Meliadoul's Attack.  
2. Lower an Archer's Attack.  
3. Lower a Summoner's Magic.  

**Note(s):**    

* I'm...... not sure what DeNA was thinking here - Meliadoul actually has less HP in this fight than in the (++) battle. This is literally the easiest U++ in the history of FFRK.  
* Bring along Full Break, summon Orlandeau OSB, and the fight is over.  
* **CID MISSION: Complete Sworn by Steel (Ultimate++) in a party of FFT heroes only!** No 5* dancer here, so bring along Rapha with the 4* attack dance, Ramza with Full Break on the summoner, and summon Orlandeau OSB for the win.

**Knight**|??|None|All

**Target Scores:**    

1. Lower Zalmour's Defense.  
2. Lower a Monk's Attack.  
3. Lower a Knight's Attack.  

**Notes:**    

* Zalmour is accompanied by a Monk and a Knight - however, you only need to defeat Zalmour to end the battle.  
* Everything here is 100% physical based, so you can leave Shellga/MBD at home. Zalmour can raise the adds if they are defeated with 100% HP, so I would just focus fire Zalmour.  
* It looks like the interns at DeNA were responsible for this event... 252K HP is Ultimate level, not A+. Especially after the magicite dungeons, this is literally a walk in the park. 

******

### Deterrence of Proof (Apocalypse +) **JUMP START**
(1 STAM)

Boss|HP|Status Vuln.|Break Resist|
:--|:--:|:--|:--|
**Zalmour**|303,000|None|All
**Monk**|??|None|All
**Knight**|??|None|All

**Target Scores:**    

1. Lower Zalmour's Defense.  
2. Lower a Monk's Attack.  
3. Lower a Knight's Attack.  

**Notes:**    

* We are entering the era of where the Jump Start will have higher stats than the A+ battle, so I will split them out going forward.  
* Other than the slight HP/stats bump, the fight is exactly the same. Again, 303K HP is a joke, just spam your SB's and the fight will be over before you know it.

**Target Scores:**    

1. Defeat Isilud with at least 4 or more heroes not KO'ed.  
2. Lower Isilud's Attack.  
3. Lower Isilud's Magic.  

**Notes:**    

* You'll face off against Isilud along with a Knight and a Summoner - if you defeat the Knight, another will replace it, while an Archer will replace the Summoner. However, you only need to defeat Isilud here, so I would just focus on him.  
* Everything here is 100% physical based except for the Summoner's attacks. Since he uses mostly AoE's, I would devote some breaks to him to keep the damage down on your party.  
* Isilud has a couple of AoE attacks as well as an attack that reduces a party member's defense. However, his most dangerous attack is Ultimate Jump, which reduces your character to 1 HP, leaving him/her ripe for the picking. Last Stand coupled with instant cast Curagas will keep the party members relatively safe.  
* No weaknesses/resist, so feel free to use whoever you want this week!

I'm a software developer student at Seneca and I was wondering what options to consider in the search for an internship in the game development industry for the Winter 2018 term.

6ybf8z,0,2017-09-05,[25/m] I ruined my four year relationship with my girlfriend [24/f],buckeyeguyy,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6ybf8z/25m_i_ruined_my_four_year_relationship_with_my/,"So my ex (let's call her Alexa) and I have been broken up for about three months. I'll start from the beginning with everything. 

In the beginning, our relationship was amazing. We had an amazing bond that I've never shared with anyone. However, about 2 1/2 years into our relationship, the sex started dying down. It wasn't that we weren't attracted to each other any more, but we were both extremely busy (being in college and working full time) and I was dealing with a lot of severe social anxiety issues that made it hard for me to perform. Even though the sexual drive started to fade, the bond we shared emotionally never went anywhere. 

Here is how the relationship ended. Even though I loved her, I never lost feelings for my previous ex girlfriend (let's call her Leah), who I was with on and off for six years before Alexa. I feel like those feelings for Leah, along with the social anxiety, were holding me back from working on my relationship with Alexa. Alexa left the country for a wedding for three months, and right before she left, Leah had contacted me telling me she misses me and still loves me. I ended up hanging out with Leah after Alexa left, and I felt the same connection I felt with her years ago. While I did hang out with Leah a few times, I never once cheated on Alexa. Then, Alexa and I had a fight about something else and ended up breaking up, while she was still out of the country. It did not feel like a real break up. More of like a ""let's take a break"" breakup. Alexa told me after we had the fight that she loves me more than anything in the world. Then, Alexa noticed on Facebook that Leah had broken up with her boyfriend and she got really worried and suspicious. I lied to her about everything, saying she never contacted me, I never saw her, etc. I ended up having sex with Leah twice, and lied about that as well. After hanging out with Leah for a couple weeks, I realized there was nothing there anymore. I realized that I truly did love Alexa and I wanted to work on our relationship. When Alexa came back to the states, she eventually found out that we hung out, so I told her everything. When we talked about it, she started crying her heart out to me, I realized what a horrible and disgusting mistake I had made. Ever since that moment I have felt like the worst human being on Earth. Alexa was literally perfect to me in every possible way and I threw all that away for nothing. I never tried to work on our relationship, because I had my own problems and issues that were holding me back. I wish I would have talked to her about how I felt. I wish I could just go back and do this over again. I truly believe that now, our relationship would be better than ever before. My social anxiety issues are way better than before and I have no other thoughts about anyone else now.

Here is where we are at now. At first, she hated me. She never wanted to look at me or talk to me again. Then, she eventually said that we can try to be friends. So we did. And I pulled out about every trick in the book that any relationship advice will tell you not to do. I got mad at her. I poured my heart out to her. I cried to her. I begged her to give me another chance. I couldn't help it. I was going crazy knowing that we may never be together again. However she still kept me in her life, as a friend no matter how much I poured my heart out. When I calmed down a bit, we didn't talk about it for a couple weeks. But, we have had a few talks since. She has said that she doesn't think she loves me anymore. She doesn't think she's ever going to want to be with me again. She's sorry but all she wants is a friendship. But she has also said things like, maybe when she gets back from South America, we can try again. I don't know what the future holds, I really don't know what I'm going to want in a few months. But she also said that she only said those things because she doesn't want to hurt me. So I am beyond confused on what to do at this point. 

She just left for South America for an internship and will be gone for three months. We kept in touch the first couple of days, and texted pretty much all day everyday. But my mind was still going insane. I don't know what to do. Two days ago I told her that if she is 100 percent sure that she won't ever want to give this relationship another try, then I have to move on. She told me that she feels selfish because she know how I feel and yet she really wants me in her life as a friend, but nothing more. And that she really and truly does not see herself being with anybody at this point in her life. So, we have not spoke since then. 

I would like some advice on what to do. I truly love this woman from the bottom of my heart. And I do not want to move on. I know signs have been pointing that it's over, but I still feel like I can't give up hope. As horrible as it sounds, I feel like our relationship needed something like this to happen to make it 100x better. I feel terrible because it took something like this to make me realize how much I really do love her, and how I want to work on myself and our relationship to give her everything she deserves. I know for a fact I will be a better boyfriend than I ever was before. She has made it clear that she does not want to be with anyone, not just me, at this point. So I don't know what to do.

(*Hi Mike*)

A little over a year ago, Aron Fischer from the Colony project introduced the world to partial-lock commit/reveal (PLCR) voting [in a blog post](https://blog.colony.io/towards-better-ethereum-voting-protocols-7e54cb5a0119). [Elena Dimitrova](https://blog.colony.io/@elena_di) followed up on that introduction with a talk at Devcon in Shanghai and a series of articles describing PLCR voting in great detail. PLCR is an innovative and highly efficient token voting system that maximizes the token liquidity of its users. I read those blog posts with great interest when they were originally published.

Back in May, [the adChain whitepaper](https://adchain-white-paper.docsend.com/view/qnce6gy) stated that the adChain Registry would use PLCR voting in the core of its cryptosystem. As far as we and the team at MetaX had been able to tell, however, Colony had not actually published a complete implementation of PLCR voting in spite of having described it in great detail.

So, back in June, before the adToken launch had even taken place, a cohort of ConsenSys interns were given a secret mission: using the Colony project's blog posts as their Rosetta stone, to implement PLCR voting in Solidity.

I'm happy to share with the community now the result of their excellent work: [a completely generic, Apache-2 licensed implementation of PLCR voting in Solidity](https://github.com/ConsenSys/PLCRVoting), compatible with any ERC-20 token.

The code itself is very interesting. A doubly-linked list in Solidity is like no other doubly-linked list you have ever seen. Mappings are used to address memory directly, somewhat like pointers in C, and in a Solidity doubly-linked list data is stored separately from the list nodes themselves (""What? How is that even useful?"" I can hear you saying).

I've written a walkthrough of this fascinating bit of software engineering, and I hope it will be enlightening to you. Enjoy!

6ybq90,1,2017-09-05,m4f Fun with Dad AND Mom,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6ybq90/m4f_fun_with_dad_and_mom/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.


2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.


3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.


4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.


5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters.


I'm happy to substitute step-siblings or parents if your prefer to play that way.

I signaled the bartender and got a nod. Then I surveyed the bar.

It had been another one of those days. The kind where you work non-stop but when it's time to leave you aren't quite sure what you've done. So instead of trying to understand why you spend time that way you do the next best thing.

You grab a drink.

It gets slightly depressing when everyone knows your name but there is a comfort in the familiar blanket that is spilled booze. Tonight I didn't see any of the regulars. Instead the bar was peppered with young professionals, summer interns, and folks either going to or getting back from some sort of exercise class.

The sky darkened as my whiskey and ginger arrived. A loud crack of thunder and some people settled up and left. They missed the deluge that followed. A few stayed.

You, however, stayed.

Sitting on the stool next to me I glanced over your shoulder at the downpour, inhaling the scent of fresh water drowning out the bar. 

Rather then end this night alone, I took a chance at filling the next few hours with someone like you.

I'm okay with access, and I have a very basic grasp on SQL...

Anyways I've accepted a position as an entry level demand planner, and although I've learned a lot about the supply chain in school it's kinda nerve-racking to actually apply what I learned with REAL LIFE consequences. I never had an internship in supply chain management, I just worked at a custody bank in college doing data entry. I am confident I got a great education, but how much can I really learn from slides, the books and case studies? I'm excited but also nervous to be starting this job, I don't wanna go in there all confident then realizing I may not know shit lol. Do you guys have any advice? Some things I should keep in mind, and some things I probably just didn't learn in school? I'm so excited for this job believe me, but also kinda nervous. I wish I had some experience in an internship, but I know the people that hired me (the corporate office for a major retailer) knows I'm entry level right out of college...They know I didn't get an internship so maybe they'll know I can't just pick up everything right away.

Also, any web sites that give a good breakdown of demand planning when it comes to a manufacturer/retailer? Any web site I found on google gave a basic breakdown."
6yd2n2,3,2017-09-05,Anxiety about moving out.,throwawaymyanxietybs,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/6yd2n2/anxiety_about_moving_out/,"So, for a bit of background information, I'm 26 and I've had anxiety/depression since early high school. When I was around 22, I moved out for the first time with no worries (aside of a week or two of homesickness and slight anxiety at night). I lived in an apartment for about a year before moving to another country with my boyfriend at the time. It was my first time living in a city that wasn't my hometown, a language I didn't speak, an internship that, as grateful as I was, just wasn't what I had hoped it would be due to the other workers, and the strain that all of the above was causing on our relationship. After not being able to take it anymore, I decided to come home with the plan of him moving here with me. TLDR; he got cold feet and sadly, we had a nasty breakup a few months later. 


So now, I'm living at home with my parents with the reason of saving up money, since I had used up most of it while I was in Canada. Well, I have more than enough money to move to a place of my own, a stable job &amp; income, and very supportive boyfriend. My house now is super old. Nothing works, very dated decor.. hell, doesn't even have a shower. My dad is rather hard to be around sometimes because he's an old-fashioned, conservative man in his 60's. The lack of privacy is also annoying, putting it nicely. Needless to say, I have plenty of reasons to move out. However... no matter now many times I try to move out, I just can't bring myself to do it. There have been 3 attempts of moving out of this house. 


Attempt #1 (Around January): Found an apartment that's close to home, old but clean, and fairly affordable. It was familiar to me because my grandmother had lived there for years, so a good chunk of my childhood years was spent there. After handing her the deposit, and the night before signing the lease, I had a panic attack. I started crying, feeling nauseous, threw up a few times, hyperventilating, and just had an overall meltdown. I ended up asking for my deposit back (which luckily, she was nice enough to give it to me) and forgetting the idea.


Attempt #2 (Late February): Found a really nice apartment that was close to work. Budget was going to be tight for a bit, but I would be able to make it worth if I cut back on the trips to Starbucks. Even managed to get her to cut the bill down $50 from the original price. It was perfect. I was so excited when I was looking at it. Said I would give the deposit and sign the lease (online) once I got back to work. I was feeling so good about it, I was for sure I wouldn't have a panic attack. I look at the lease, aaaand it happened again. Absolute panic. Same symptoms as before, but worse. I ignore it and told myself to get through it. That night I have yet another panic attack, worse than the one earlier that day. The next day, I ended up coming up with a lie to tell the landlady that I got another opportunity to put in an offer on my dream house, and she was more than understanding. I felt so bad for lying, but I had no idea what else to do at this point. I was mentally and physically exhausted from the whole ordeal. I just wanted it done and off my plate.


Attempt #3(June/July): Decided to give it one more try. Told myself that I wouldn't let this anxiety win. That no matter what, I would beat this shit. I found the perfect apartment. They're running a special for $100 off per month for the first lease term. Close to a cafe, some restaurants, in a really nice area, and was newly updated. It was perfect! I had started new medication for my anxiety too, so I was super hopeful. Too hopeful. Guess what happened... again..? Yep. Panic attacks. And this was the worst one yet. I called the poor landlady back and forth at least 4-5 times saying I would/wouldn't take the apartment. She probably thought I was crazy. Hell, I thought I was crazy. The anxiety was driving me insane. Heat flashes, throwing up, and other stomach details that I'll spare you from. But I told myself ""No. I'm going to do this. Even if it drives me insane for a while, I got this. 6 months. I can do this. I got this."" So that morning, I drive myself to the leasing office to sign the lease and hand her the checks. I get to the front door of the office and I freeze. My legs won't move and I feel the panic rushing my body. Blood boiling, nausea kicking in, knees shaking. I was petrified. I sat there for probably 10 minutes. It's a wonder no one saw me and wondered what the hell I was doing. I couldn't move. I couldn't talk. In the end, I panic and run away. I cried myself the whole drive home. Ignoring all the phone calls from the leasing office. Cute apartments that I'll probably have to forget about, since I doubt they'll even rent to me now. The whole ordeal ended up making me sick and I had to call in sick from work for two days after that. Major depression kicked in. I couldn't eat, laugh, talk, focus, or anything. I didn't want to do anything. I didn't even want to exist. 


This whole thing has me so... defeated. It haunts me daily. Anytime I go shopping and see cute home decor, I get excited about it, then depressed. ""Why look at it? Not like I have a place to put it,"" Pinterest is my worst nightmare. Talking to friends/coworkers my own age is also a battle. I do anything I can to avoid the topic of where I live, because I dread having to tell them that I still live with my parents, especially since I have no college debt, because my anxiety stopped me from going to college. 


I have tried everything to fix this. Medication, therapy, talking about it... nothing has worked. And now I'm afraid to even try again. It makes me give up on all of my hopes and dreams because I think to myself ""What's the point? What's it all for?   What's the point of wanting success? Why work so hard to earn money? Not like you have a place to spend money on. Why talk about moving out of this shitty town to better city when you can't even move five minutes away from home?"" I'm at my wits end with this. I have no idea what to do at this point and I'm afraid to try again. Is this some form of PTSD? I've been told it is from my family doctor, but I'm just not sure what to believe anymore. Is there anything that can be done about this? I just want to move on with my life. At this rate, I don't even see the point in trying to live my life.. or just trying to live. I'm beyond desperate at this point and I am willing to take any help and advice I can get. Sorry for the long wall of text. If you managed to read all of this, I'm thankful just for your time. Thank you, guys. 


--------------


TLDR; Anxiety is preventing me from moving out and moving on in life. After 3 failed attempts, in the span of 9 months, of moving out due to severe panic attacks, I'mat my wits end. I have no idea what to do or how to overcome it. Any advice is appreciated. "

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

Boomers were born with a silver spoon in their mouths, were gifted the best economy and the highest living standard the whole world has *ever* seen, grew up in a society where people could comfortably spent 10 years in college only smoking pot and fucking hippies and still get a job that paid so well that you could immediately buy a house and two cars. 

And what have they done with these most excellent starting conditions? They've ruined everything, ruined the economy, ruined the environment and gave us fucking FEMINISM. 

Admittedly, the only thing worse than boomers are boomer immigrants who ""made it"" - like my parents. When my father came to the Western world he immediately found a good and stable job, bought a house and two cars, married my mother, had children, the end. Now he's *paranoid* about Trump and Putin and Co. ruining his Western utopia despite the fact that the Western world he and my mother had emigrated to does not even exist anymore. 

Furthermore, especially Western Europe was spoiled and pampered because it was needed during the Cold War, and meant to be the ""Window to the West"" - because people in the East were supposed to look over and NOT see only poverty and misery and feminism and Islamic fanatics etc. But NOW this window to the West is not needed anymorer and hence the living standard is going down and down and down.

The last wish Boomers now have is a war against what remained of Russia. They will stand at the train station again and wave flags when young men are forced to fight against Russia to bring them fucking FEMINISM. Boomers installed feminism in education sector and then in politics. 

This fucking hippie / ex-hippie-then-reaganomics generation were born with silver spoons in their mouth and yet they whine about how hard they had it. Bullshit, today is the age of unpaid internships, ridiculously high rents, ridiculously low wages (if you find a job at all) and yet these spoiled hippie / neo-con brats whine about how hard THEY had it.

Boomers are teh fucking worst generation ever and they deserve misery.

Unfortunately, during my education statistics has not really been a widely covered subject (T-test, ANOVA, Chi-test, and least squares  method for linear regression), which seem to me to be unsuitable for my current assignment.
Regarding my assignment I will be able to analyse 7 types of products which are all produced using different parameters as each of the 7 products is produced to have a different particle size. Furthermore, I will be able to collect the accompanying production parameters regarding each of these products.

My initial plan is to gather a large data set of both the particle sizes (by daily analyzing samples taken from each product over the next few months), and gather the used production parameters for each of the samples (which might vary a bit even between the same product).

So ultimately I'll have a list of the measured particle sizes of the samples taken of each product, and for each sample the accompanying production parameters.

From this, how do I determine the influence of each of the parameters on the particle size of the end-product? Can this be done by a statistical test, of so by why which? And where can I find additional information regarding this test so that I can learn how to use the test.

If there are any questions, please feel free to ask.

Thanks in advance!"

Here is the deal. I am a senior graduating college in early December with a bachelor's in Computer Science. I currently live in Georgia (the state) and plan to move to Birmingham, Alabama for personal reasons as soon as possible. I have never lived outside of my parent's home; I was lucky enough to stay with them all through college. I have about $5,000 dollars in savings and $5,500 in student loans. My only source of credit is a credit card that I use to buy gas and groceries and pay off monthly. I own my car outright and don't have any other debt besides my student loans. I have an internship in my field right now, but I will have to quit my position once I move as they don't really do work from home or telecommuting.  

What I am unsure about is how I go about moving from my current location to that of another state. 

1. What kind of hidden costs do I need to look out for?   
2. Do I apply for jobs and then move, or move and then apply for jobs?
3. Will my credit be alright to get an apartment?
4. What hidden legal obligations,etc will I need to get out in front of once I move? (I'm thinking things like updating car insurance, etc.)

Thanks for all the advice!"

I am in the last year of my four year study and I just need to graduate. I started my graduation internship this week and I have to do a lot of research and design a solution.
It is giving me so much anxiety and I have barely even started yet. It's only wednesday and I started on monday and I already have been crying all day and I have hardly written a single thing yet.
I have been given a lot of freedom from the company, so I am free to spend my time however I wish. This has backfired and I have spent the last 2 days at home panicking instead of working.

I already tried a graduation last year but I quit very early because of the stress. Now I went in with a good spirit but I am already breaking down after 2 days. I want to do nothing more than quit but I will gain a €10,000 debt if I don't graduate.

I am stuck in a bad place. I just want to be happy and live my life but if I quit I will have a huge debt and no diploma and have wasted 4 years. However I feel like I can't get through with this. It is too difficult for me and my graduation subject is so tough and I have to do this all by myself. I am having trouble breathing, my muscles are tense, I have headaches and I feel socially and especially creatively blocked.

I am not usually like this and it scares me. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
6yg1a6,35,2017-09-06,I [18/F] have issues coming to terms with my breakup with my Ex [17/M] and the possibility of a budding friendship/relationship between him and a close(?) friend [18F],guiltyheartbroken,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6yg1a6/i_18f_have_issues_coming_to_terms_with_my_breakup/,"I dated ""Adam"" for about 8 months and we had a tumultuous relationship which was mostly my fault. Adam and I went to boarding school together and got very close very soon and practically lived together for 5 months up until I graduated. I cheated on him about a month into our relationship but we soon reconciled. I know that this post is probably going to be very biased and I'll focused unrelentingly on the bad parts of our relationship but we'd never felt that kind of connection with anyone else before. Our conversations would never end and we went on hikes and cooked and argued about politics and pop culture - I also was going through personal issues with my parents divorce during which he was a huge source of comfort and support. We continued to date long distance over the summer after I graduated.

We left school set on a long distance relationship. I'm taking a year off after high school to work and prepare to apply to college while he returns to school for his final year of high school. Over the course of our relationship we have broken up and made up enough times that I've lost count, with the break ups and reconciliation always initiated by him. We tried to address his issues together during which he liked to be in the know about when I met my male friends and veto some interactions (which I know is supposed to be a red flag but I did cheat on him so I really didn't mind anything that gave him peace of mind). We also agreed (at my suggestion) that him dating while back at school and keeping our relationship private was a good idea. I really didn't mind him dating and I was too busy with my internships and college applications to be looking at other guys. Moreover he'd lost a lot of friends over getting back together with me and we both wanted him to make the most of his last year at school.

Our relationship is one I look back on filled with guilt and sadness. I admit that I wasn't the best girlfriend I could have been, constantly prioritizing my friends over him and not realizing the extent of the effect my infidelity and priorities had on him. 

After 2 weeks back at school Adam finally broke up with me for good. He cited long term insecurity issues and how even though he knows that our time together was the first time either of us had felt what we think is love, he doesn't love me anymore and that being back at school without me is the happiest he's felt in a long time. We agreed to no contact until college decisions are out in December. We stayed friends on social media.

It's been about 3 weeks since the break up and I'm still reeling from having the rug pulled out as suddenly as it was; just a week earlier we were talking about applying to schools in and around NY so we could be hours away from each other and how in love we were and how crazy it was to feel something like this for the first time. My sadness over the breakup however is massively overshadowed by the immense guilt I feel over the effect our relationship had on him. I keep flipping between sadness over losing my best friend and guilt over the reasons why he dumped me. 

A weird addition to the mix is my friend ""Lisa"" asking me at the start of the term if I'd be comfortable with her hitting on Adam. Our school is small and isolated and they're in the same year. This was when Adam and I's lopsided private open relationship was in effect so she was very apologetic about asking about what she assumed was an ex boyfriend. I really honestly didn't mind and gave her the go ahead. (This led to some conflict with my best friend ""Jen"" and Lisa, with my Jen being outraged that she would even ask such a thing, coupled with residual discontent from past instances where Lisa prioritized dicks over friends). 

Lisa and Jen were the two people I heavily relied on for support during the break up. I see images of Jen and Adam being very close on social media but I'm hesitant to ask her about it because I said I was cool with whatever before and I also don't want to hinder Adam's relationships with any friends he's made after the fall out I'd caused last year. They're both wonderful people so I'm hesitant about ruining a friendship.

Jen's at college. She hates Adam and never really liked our relationship. She calls him an entitled prick and said his poetry was trash and that the turmoil and guilt I felt was unwarranted. I guess I'm writing this post not just to vent but also ask for advice from an unbiased source that isn't as fiercely loyal as my best friend.

 I know high school romances are fleeting and unimportant but this feels very real to me and I'd really like help with not only cope with this break up but cope with what seems to be him moving on with my close friend. 

I'm sorry for the long and probably confusing post, this is the shortest I could get it.

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend broke up with me after a messy relationship citing long term issues with insecurity after I cheated on him and we reconciled. I need help coping with the break up and coming to terms with his and a close friend's budding friendship/relationship.

EDIT: I just skyped Lisa and Jen (they're friends too) and Lisa told me that she might have feelings for Adam and that he told her he has feelings for her too. She insists that its nothing but a crush on both ends and she knows we'd been dating up until 3 weeks ago. She asked if I'd like her to let go of her and Adam's friendship but I'd never come in the way of that. I did however veto a relationship. Adam and I had been together for 8 months which is an insane amount of time for us and I cheated on him when we weren't necessarily exclusive. I spent the rest of the relationship trying to juggle the last few months of school and time with my friends and my relationship with him while constantly trying to make up for my mistakes. I'm coping with the break up the best I can but I don't want to give my blessings to a relationship with him and my closest friend still at school less than a month after we've broken up.

EDIT 2: I just point blank asked her if they hooked up and they did. I dont even know dude thats just messed up you don't get with your close friend's ex 3 weeks after comforting the blubbering mess she was. I'm going to focus on college and likely going to end my friendship with Lisa; this isn't the first time she's placed hook ups over long term friendships. Thanks y'all."

6ygaih,23,2017-09-06,Between 16-23 yr/olds Give This A Read,iamgavin11,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/6ygaih/between_1623_yrolds_give_this_a_read/,"Hello,

My name is Gavin and I like to play video games. I know none of you have ever hear that because it use to me my YouTube intro. LuL. So here is my story, and I hope it helps some others mostly geared towards college/high school kids.

So, about 23 days ago to be exact I uninstalled all my games on my computer. I have to say that was the more drastic thing I have ever done. I have been an avid gamer for my entire life, like most of the people on this sub reddit, but I needed a change. I wasn't happy anymore, I had dreams an aspirations that were not going to happen when I would play for 8+ hours a day of a video game. But the first 18 days or so of no video games was honestly not even bad! 

I ended up writing every other day in a word document about what I was thinking in terms of my Habit Loop. For those who don't know, the habit loop is made up of three events in a habit. You have the trigger, the habit itself, and the reward. Why is this important? Well identifying this loop allows you to understand more as to why you are playing video games. This will in turn help you decide what hobby / task to replace the emptiness that gaming left you. If you would like to understand more i HIGHLY recommend ""The Habit Loop"" By: Charles Dunhigg.

I was on the most productive road in my life! I was building website, reading for over 30 minutes a day, running every other day, and even getting AHEAD in homework for my classes. I was feeling great, doing great, and had a purpose with goals to accomplish. What happened?

Well I once read that you are the average of the five people you hangout with the most. This is so true. I am not going to blame my friends completely, or at all, cause in the end I, and I alone, decided to re-install League. That day.... That day (9-4-17) is when the streak ended. I told myself that once I made it to 30 days I would re-install and play once a day. However, after what has happen to me earlier this week I know that will not be able to able to do that anymore. I regret my decision and uninstalled League again this morning and getting back on the horse with writing this post, but here is my advise for the lurkers on this site, cause I use to be one.

LURKERS: I'm talking to the ones who have heard about this sub reddit visited the pages, and said ""Oh I'm not addicted"" or ""I can stop whenever"" or those things true? You don't have to be an addict in order to change your life. I know that gaming WAS something I enjoyed, but now I do not believe that is true and that is all because I took a chance and tried. I give you the challenge to quite completely gaming for 30 days. You don't have to sell your consoles, or throw your computer out. But you cannot play a single game for those 30 days? No mobile, console or computer. NONE AT ALL! And write about it, write why you came to this reddit but did nothing at all. Write why the thought of quitting entered your mind. It'll make all the difference. So do that, what do you have to lose? I few levels in CoD? A new rank in league? Are those the things you want to tell a future employer? Let me tell you. The internships I am going for don't give a rats ass about me being Plat. in league or having dark matter camo in Black Ops. 

So thats my story, I know I didn't dive deep into my personal life, and will probably be writing again about it, but I say give it a chance. Also the hardest thing people have when quitting is finding something to do. So here i will write some actual hobbies to try! These are simple and the things I enjoyed.

HOBBIES: Reading, Web Site Design, Running, Writing, Walking my Dog, Daily Exercise, Studying, Talking with Friends IN PERSON, etc...
Just find things that look interesting and do them, you will hit a brick wall at the beginning because you are not good at it yet. You've spent a lot of your time gaming which is why you are good at it. So give it time, and don't give in to temptation!

6yh0od,21,2017-09-06,"[Manga Spoilers] Mirio Togata, one in Lemillion",adamrmcf,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/6yh0od/manga_spoilers_mirio_togata_one_in_lemillion/,"##**Introduction**
Written during the period between the of chapter 151.

Since his formal introduction in chapter 123, Mirio has been an interesting addition to the Boku no Hero Academia cast, from his basic design (Vault Boy/Tin Tin etc) to his amazing usage of quirk. From phasing his face through the wall, to destroying the entire 1-A class and now versus Overhaul. Throughout his current 28 chapters, he has garnered up quite a few death flags which has instilled a fear that the prospective number one hero will not survive his fight with Overhaul, Chronostasis and Nemoto. 

The purpose of this is to look at the story and how it will be impacted from both sides, one that he lives, the other that he dies and how some characters or even the story itself could be impacted from such, does the overwhelming nature of his power mean he can’t last? Are the Yakuza going to be around until the end? How would the characters react?

There is also something at the end to throw in some food for thought, even if it’s not a true theory but an idea that something is not all that can be taken as truth.

I’m sure I’ve messed up people’s names, using first names, last names and hero names with no consistency between characters, I’m sorry for that, I just went with what I thought was the more recognisable option and I’m also sure I’ve repeated myself a lot, I haven’t written anything in a long time and it’s not coming back to me easily, if you want to leave any feedback, it would be welcome and thank you for reading. 

















##**If Mirio Lives**
With the retirement of All Might due to the last of One for All (OfA) running out, the symbol of peace mantle is gone and in his stead, the number two hero, Endeavour has rose to number one. Except he doesn’t believe he deserves it because he didn’t earn it, and the public are not fully behind him. His main demographic is primarily men aged 20-40, while All Might was well loved all around the board. No matter what he does or what he achieves, Endeavour will never be the symbol of peace. 
Mirio Togata on the other hand has been likened to All Might in more ways than one. He is said to be goofy, energetic and always smiling along with some of his more exuberant actions being reminiscent of the Symbol of Peace. As Aizawa said, he is currently the closest thing to being the number one hero, the only thing seemingly keeping him from this is that he’s currently still enrolled in school and yet to graduate. 


His strength, while being dealt not the strongest quirk, came from his willingness to admit that he’s not the strongest, he’s not the best, that he’s weak. From that weakness he trained a difficult quirk in to one of the most impressive. His introduction as a plain face in a wall sums up his personality pretty well, he’s goofy and happy, and that hid his true potential. It took one ‘fight’ against class 1-A to see why he’s going to be the new number one. The class that’s been through it all such as fighting against villains in real stakes and suffering serious injuries taking down a hero killer and in 6 seconds (or 6 minutes, it’s hard to tell but I feel like it’s 6 seconds) he takes down every single class member without so much as breaking a sweat. 


More recently, while faced with the villain Overhaul, his strength and understanding of being a hero was shown as he both protected Eri and managed to put down Overhaul at the same time. 
Overhaul, as interesting a villain as he is doesn’t seem like an end game boss. It doesn’t look like he’ll be around at the end when Shigaraki and Midoriya eventually have their All for One v All Might final clash in the series. During that fight, even though he lost, All for One left a feeling that no matter what, this wasn’t his last foray in to proceedings. Overhaul and the Yakuza haven’t been portrayed as characters that will last, like when All Might vs AfO, Midoriya didn’t come out and merk AfO, throughout that whole proceeding, AfO retained his level of ‘badass’, whereas Overhaul was easily defeated. 


 The Yakuza are on their last legs, the boss is ill and Chisaki is the last embers of that once mighty flame, but even the Yakuza are sceptical over how his morals are. Everything points to them not lasting with Toga remarking about how weak they are and that they were lame. Trading off of the League of Villains name instead of their own is another sign that they won’t be sticking around for much longer. 


Which leads to, why would this character, this organisation, get the first kill of a hero character, and not just any hero, the potential next number one. Overhaul’s power was shown in his first meeting with the League of Villains as he kills Magne without effort and destroys Mr Compress’ arm. So it can’t be as a show of force to build him up more, he’s already reached a point where his power is to be awed at and killing Mirio, especially now after he was thoroughly beaten and admitted defeat [to Mirio], it doesn’t make much sense. 


Just from this, to me, it seems like Mirio will survive this encounter with Overhaul and live to fight another day, but he may not get out of the situation in the same way that he entered it.
As the killer bullet flies through the air, the intended target unclear, the feel of the chapter changed. As has been shown throughout both this chapter (151) and the last (150), bullets have no effect on Mirio, so what was the purpose in the shot? 



Nemoto knows his quirk, he also knows that Mirio has sworn to never let anyone hurt Eri again, whether he knows that Mirio can’t phase Eri is another thing, but for the purpose we’ll assume that he does know. 



The purpose of the bullet is to hit Eri, or force Mirio to take the bullet instead of her, permanently erasing his quirk. 



The only other time someone lost their quirk by force was Ragdoll, and personally, the panels where she was comatose after being rescued and crying surrounded by family at her forced early retirement were some of the most impactful scenes. So to make a decision like that to either sacrifice himself or allow her to take the bullet is not one to be taken lightly, even if he stops the bullet, he’s now powerless versus one of the strongest villains currently in the series which wouldn’t bode well for him, but if Eri dies, and stays dead, the Yakuza’s plans end permanently. Mirio is a true hero, the one that should replace All Might as the new number one, especially in Sir Nighteye’s point of view, and he’ll likely show that when he does take the bullet for Eri, while not dying, it will render him quirkless. With the likely return of Midoriya and Aizawa happening just as that happens, forcing Overhaul and co to flee, the day may be saved, but the cost of such was too much. 


Overall, he’s just the full package and it means as a pawn in this game, he’s too big of a catch for the Villains to win by killing him, but can cause progress by losing his quirk, it’s too soon for someone to rise to the top, it dampens the unstable nature of heroes and their culture that was left in the wake of All Might’s retirement, especially as the League of Villains are supposed to be gaining traction. 



Personal note: There is a chance that Midoriya passes OfA to Mirio anyway, as early on in the series it’s pushed a bit that you don’t need to have a quirk to be a hero, as All Might said, which might be something that happens, maybe not this early, but later on in the series.



















##**If Mirio Dies**
The same reason we’re all slowly falling in love with Mirio’s character is the same reason that he may not be able to exist within the series. His skill is unmatched and his power is too good for the current arcs villain, and perhaps every current member of the League of Villains. The series can only have tension if there’s a believability that at any time someone can die, or that people will get hurt. So far in the series we’ve had one named character’s death, which was Magne, a villain and one injury, which was the original Ingenium (I haven’t read the manga for the earlier chapters as I seen the anime first), but he had very little exposure. 


 There was nothing that showed how he was, if he was a good hero or anything, only whatever Iida said about him in the aftermath and during the fight with Stain. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it gave absolutely no reason for us to really care about him, we had no real connection to the character. There’s been nothing for us to really fear for a hero’s safety at all, oh, there’s a big fight? Minor injuries for most involved. (Not that I have anything against that, it just subverts the danger of the situation). For the series to gain that real tension, someone will have to die. 


We all know All Might will perish at some point, it’s his decided fate, even he’s resigned to it, but would his death have the same type of impact? He’s older, powerless, quirkless too, plus we’re all expecting him to die. That doesn’t bring tension, it doesn’t bring fear or worry, killing the next big thing, the one on the rise, the one that’s just smacked Overhaul around, that brings true ramifications. 


Everything is pointing towards a Mirio death, it stands as a benchmark for all to come. George RR Martin (author of A Song of Ice and Fire series [Game of Thrones]), said that when main characters get in to dangerous situations, you never really have to worry about if they’ll survive or not, a Deus Ex Machina (“a person or thing (as in fiction or drama) that appears or is introduced suddenly and unexpectedly and provides a contrived solution to an apparently insoluble difficulty”) will come and help them out of the situation, so whenever these situations arose in the books, the heroes didn’t always survive, people died when they were expected to escape. It leads to a more interesting way to read, that just because a character is important to the story that they’re ‘invincible’ in terms of not getting taken out, when you should always worry about if a character will survive or not. 


It’s something that the story could be doing with, the current part with Mirio is the first time everyone is kind of in agreement that he really could die. It’s a tension that’s been sorely lacking and in my opinion a welcome addition. It’s really all that’s been talked about, every time he does something more badass we begin to worry more. 


Can BnHA still create this tension and fear if he escapes this scenario? 
Well, the short answer is yes, but using this as a launch pad for a darker tone could be a good move, there’s only so many times that fake teasing will work before there’s no believability and you know that whatever danger is coming, it’s never going to be enough to hurt any heroes. 



The only other thing that we know is that at the end Midoriya is the greatest hero that ever lived, with the legend of All Might, that surely is a difficult thing to achieve, especially since right at this moment we have Mirio who is close to being All Might in every way. How can Midoriya become the top hero when there’s someone out there who’s more powerful and has everything it takes to be the best? Quite simple, he has to die. With him out of the way, the path is clear, it’s obvious Endeavor will never be the true number one, the story currently has no-one else to stand in Midoriya’s way, except for Suneater or Najire, but we’ll go in to that later. 


Since the Yakuza decided to use the League of Villains name, anything that happens that is impressive or important in the grand scheme, all credit goes to the League of Villains, if everyone finds out that they took down the next big thing, there’s only going to be more and more people wanting to join them, making the sky the limit.

















































##**Impact on Characters**



###**Sir Nighteye**
The first and most obvious person that would be impacted by the death of Mirio is Sir Nighteye. Mirio because of his failure to do anything regarding Eri last time that they encountered, will not give up or fail again. As much as dedication to being a hero is lauded, it could be seen as an omen of him doing whatever it takes. The most plausible way that he dies is from sacrificing himself to save Eri, either using his quirk or getting her to one of the other heroes, like Midoriya or Aizawa. 


This ultimate act of sacrifice, in Nighteye’s point of view at least, would prove beyond doubt that Mirio was the one who should’ve been gifted One for All. Mirio has the skill, he has the motivation and the last thing that not even All Might could deny, the heart. His relationships with both All Might and Midoriya would likely change drastically, he either accepts that Midoriya is touted as the next Symbol of Peace or then blames him for being given the ability over Mirio. 


If he accepts All Might’s decision and gives Midoriya the same mentoring as he gave Mirio, well, we seen how much that Mirio improved within a year when he trained under Sir Nighteye, and that type of progression with OfA would be insane. 


If he doesn’t accept and sticks true on his opinion that Mirio was the one true heir, it would only serve to hurt him personally again, he watched his best friend All Might suffer (and die, via vision) and watched his protégée follow the same path, it’s a lot for one man to take.   



###**Midoriya**
This could also be mirrored with Nighteye, but both will assume that if Mirio had One for All, maybe he could have survived. They know about Overhaul’s quirk, but Midoriya will feel complete guilt that he was given OfA. Everyone has seen what Mirio can do and how much he dedicated himself to mastery of his quirk, probably to a level that only a handful of people could be part of such club, All Might, AfO and Endeavor, from what we know. [If there is more or I’m completely wrong here, my bad, I’m not super versed in the manga] 


So someone with this focus in control of OfA would be without a doubt the number one hero, and perhaps the strongest hero to ever live. This of course, would play over in Midoriya’s head, which with the way he is, wouldn’t push him to a rage transformation like what would happen in Dragon Ball Z, but more towards despair. It wouldn’t be the thing that forces him to his next % threshold because it doesn’t make sense for the character or series, it’s just not who he is. It will tear him apart on the inside, he’s shown his feelings throughout and judging from that it will just make him more depressed and more like he doesn’t deserve this power. 


If Nighteye accepts him fully as an intern, it will however make his training go to the next level, he can’t allow or to be specific, won’t allow any of his friends or heroes to be killed again, it serves as the ultimate lesson. It could even lead to dual training with All Might and Nighteye, All Might isn’t the best teacher on his own, but someone who was his sidekick and friend for years could easily unlock the secrets that he may not have seen himself. 












###**Tamaki Amajiki (Suneater)**
There are a lot of people in the world that suffer from depression and/or anxiety, maybe that even means you too, those types of people can relate to Suneater and the way he acts, which makes him a dear character. 


His social awkwardness and low self-worth regarding himself and his quirk only seems to be combatted by Mirio’s faith in him, it gives him strength in those difficult times, like early on in the raid chapter when he recounted Mirio’s words and it forced him to a new level, despite being injured, managing to win a 3 v 1. 


If Mirio had to die, it could end Amajiki’s hero career before it even begins, how could he draw strength from those words when in his eyes, he’ll feel like it was his fault (This is a common factor with anxiety, depression, social anxiety etc). His relationship to Nejire Hado doesn’t seem anywhere near as close, and who else is there that could help him? 


Nejire hasn’t had any real screen time, and from what I can tell from people’s reaction to her, it’s that she’s a token third party, and will job when she finally gets her chance. So with the death of Mirio, the entire Big 3 of U.A could be wiped out in one simple move. 


















##**Food for Thought**
###**Regarding Nighteye’s quirk**
A trope in TV shows is that someone who’s never been beaten, never been wrong, never been x etc. will at some point in that show’s run lose that “streak”, in this case we’re going to look at Sir Nighteye’s quirk, which is after he touches someone and looks in to their eyes he gains the ability to see the person’s future for an hour, but he only see’s the target from ‘third person’ or from other different angles. It is said that the future he sees is 100% accurate, but we don’t know who the quirk has been used on to determine how precise that is, the only ones we know so far that it’s been used on has been people with quirks.


The way that he views the targets future is interesting, is it not? Why is it in the third person and not from their point of view? Maybe he sees the power connected to the person rather than the person themselves. 


In this case, maybe he seen One for All if it had been passed over to Mirio and that it was his demise that he foresaw at the hands of the villain instead of All Might. All Might’s battle with All for One wasn’t a gruesome demise in the sense of death, or even of character it was more of an embarrassing reveal of his true form. Whereas Nighteye’s vision seems to have been when All Might still had his full power, hence why Nighteye was insistent that he pass on OfA (this is speculation due to the details that we know of the fight between the two without there being anything 100% confirmed as factual to back it up, this is just a spit ball). 


The current arc would be different as Mirio would have OfA and therefore the way he uses his quirks would be vastly different, we don’t know if he would favour OfA or his own, or how much one would affect the other but what if the death he foresaw was actually Mirio’s if he had been given OfA instead of Midoriya. 


Given that the meeting of All Might and Midoriya was somewhat lucky and the progression of their relationship to the point where he decided Midoriya was the next host, this could’ve been the twist of fate that gave Nighteye’s vision its first wrong prediction and saved the life of Mirio at the same time. 


Again just to mention, this isn’t a serious theory, just an idea to get you to think of how some things are portrayed and what else could be taken from statements, or accepted at face value. 









##**Summary**
 In summary, Overhaul and the Yakuza haven’t really been positioned in a way that they feel like they’re going to last, so having them kill Mirio doesn’t seem to make sense especially with their power already shown and an example not needing to be made. However, Mirio losing his quirk is a neat in-between that means Mirio lives, but the villains also get a win, no matter how small.


If he should die, which I think makes the most sense with all of the death flags, it makes everything go from 0-100 real quick, you never know who could die, who could get hurt or what is coming. A welcome addition to the story, some real tense moments can turn any scene in to an incredible scene, as we seen when Mirio phase kicked through Eri to his one of the Yakuza henchmen, just an incredible scene. 

##**Conclusion**
Not introducing a hero that we know and care about being injured or killed may hurt the story in the longevity, but Horikoshi has went from strength to strength, every new character introduced has been great, as has the storylines. There is no doubt that he has a clear vision of everything and where he wants to take it, so even if he doesn’t do what makes the most sense (unfortunately, poor Mirio), there’s absolutely no doubt that he knows what he’s doing with the story and I look forward to seeing where everything goes.

Please help.",MozeSays,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/6yh66i/i_need_help_with_private_loans_i_did_my_2_years/,"I know, I know, I know
I wanted to go out of state for school, but I learned that was financial suicide, so I did what they say youre supposed to do.  First, my question, then my story.

My Question:
Who should I go to for private student loans?  I will need to borrow $10-15k privately in a worst case scenario.  In addition to 16k in federal loans.  Please read my story before you judge me.

My Story:
I wanted to go to an out of state school of my choice and eventually work in real estate or construction, probably as an architect.  I learned that was stupid and Id be saddling myself with a lifetime of debt and possibly no means to pay it off.

I went to a community college for my 2 year degree.  FAFSA covered my school, and I worked full time to cover my life expenses.

I waited a year to establish residency in the state I wanted to go to school.  I tried to find a school in FL that I was happy about, but thought I had better educational and career opportunities elsewhere.  I did my research and found a good program, at an affordable school, in a city with GREAT job opportunities, internships, and scholarship money.

I changed my major.  I learned construction management was better than architecture in both finding a job and potential earnings.


NOW:
Im at a school with tuition and books totaling about 13k a year.  Fafsa covers 6k,  I get 3k in subsidized federal loans, and 5k in unsubsidized loans.

So I have about 1k, left over from there.
I make pretty good money as a server, and live very frugally.  However Im commited to not letting work effect my grades as it did in years past.  Id like to stay working less than 30 hours a week, and am going to have to borrow some money.  

So
I think in these last 2 years of school Ill need to borrow a total of about 10-15k in private loans.  Which is in addition to the roughly 16k in federal loans.  I know $31k is more than anybody here would say is good.  But Ive positioned myself well to start making at least $40k right out of school, with BLS statistics saying median income of $89k.  Meaning I think I could pay my loans off quickly.

Reddit helped me find a school, get a 2 year degree, and be debt free this far.  In the final stretch now. Thanks! "

6yhom1,6,2017-09-06,Simple visitor sign-in software. $10/month. Worth it?,rightturnclyde34,edtech,https://www.reddit.com/r/edtech/comments/6yhom1/simple_visitor_signin_software_10month_worth_it/,"A few schools in our district were using a software program that visitors/volunteers would use to sign-in when entering the school. This software was free but recently decided to start charging money and our schools don't want to pay. So after researching other options, most of which were way too expensive and offered features we didn't need, I created one. So far it's been well received which made me wonder if others would be interested.  

**Features**

* Sign in/out for volunteers, visitors, district employees, interns. Any of these can be turned on/off if you do not want to use them.

* Auto printing badges when used with Dymo LabelWriter printers. Again, this can be turned on/off for each visitor type.

* Install on as many computers as you want. Most other options limit the number of computers you can install on. Runs on Windows or Mac. 

* Logs are kept in an online database (so a network connection is required by the sign-in computer). 

* All admin functions (viewing logs, running reports, enabling/disabling features, etc) is done through a web browser. So you only have to install software on the computer visitors will use.

* Since the logs are stored online and accessed via a web browser, you can access your data from any device (computer, phone, etc) with an internet connection. This is helpful if you need to evacuate a school and need to see who may still be inside, or are otherwise off site and want to view who has been in the building.

* Run reports on visitor and/or volunteer hours. 

**What's Not Available**

* Some programs integrate with FBI databases, offer drivers license scanning, etc in an effort to alert for criminals/predators. This is nice, but also drives the price way up.

Your thoughts? Any interest in something like this? Any other ideas to make it more useful? Thanks.

6yhpgv,118,2017-09-06,"AMA: We've Launched our First Game ChromaGun (""Like Portal with Colors"") on Consoles 2 Weeks Ago - Ask us Anything!",BLochmann,Games,https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/6yhpgv/ama_weve_launched_our_first_game_chromagun_like/,"Hey gamers and gamerettes!


My name is Ben, I'm CEO of the Pixel Maniacs, a small dev studio from Nuremberg, Germany.
We've launched our first console title ever 2 weeks ago on PS4 and Xbox.
My team and I are going to answer questions in this thread the next couple of hours :)

**About us**

We started developing tons of apps for Android and iOS back in 2011 and built around 150 rather small casual games and tools.
2015 we participated in our first gamejam (""Ludum Dare 32"") and built a very ugly prototype of the basic concept of ChromaGun.

We launched it on mobile first which was a bad idea. The concept doesn't work on a mobile device. A few months later we launched the game on Steam where it got some nice reviews and player feedback.
Since that launch we're totally hooked on building games for PC and consoles and haven't launched any new mobile apps since then. We haven't launched a profitable game on PC &amp; consoles yet, but it's getting better :)

We're happy that we've managed to bring ChromaGun to the PS4 and Xbox One about 2 weeks ago. The PS4 version has 76 points on metacritic so far which we're quite proud of.

We had no huge financial success with our PC and console games yet and are therefore still financed through the apps we built in the years before switching to PC/consoles plus through a funding we got from the Bavarian state a few weeks ago.

**About ChromaGun**

ChromaGun is a first person puzzle game. People often descibe it with ""like portal with colors"". You can use your ChromaGun to colorize droids and walls. Droids are attracted by walls of the same color, and by cleverly utilizing this mechanic, you'll try to solve all sorts of puzzles to make it to the exit. The ChromaGun can only shoot red, yellow, and blue. You can shoot a previously colored wall or droid, to mix colors into orange, purple, and green.

The game is available on 3 platforms:

* Steam version: http://store.steampowered.com/app/408650/ChromaGun/
* PS4: https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/chromagun-ps4/
* XB1: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/chromagun/c2khcmpgrzl7

**About our Team**

Our team consists of:

* Steve u/stevecrse: Makes everything pretty
* Joe u/dgow: Makes everything functionally working
* Andi, u/somaweb: Programmer, was also heavily working on the porting
* Valerij u/valerijme: Shader-master
* Chris: Built an awesome level editor in the PC version of the game
* Markus u/mindvolution: Formally intern, now supporting us with his awesome graphics
* Kiwi: Intern, helped us with graphics needed for the console versions
* Mani: Support &amp; Social Media
* Ben u/BLochmann: Marketing, Finance, Excel-Stuff

**Our Plans for the Future**

We're currently working on a PSVR port with AIM support as we got tons of requests for that from members of the /r/PSVR subreddit.
After that we're planning to bring our second game Can't Drive This (""One player drives, the other one builds the track"") out of Early Access and to port it to PS4, Xbox and Switch. We're also developing a third game called Escape the Loop where you are stuck in a time loop like in the film ""Groundhog Day"".

Ask us anything, ChromaGun, porting to consoles, game development in general, or anything else. We're looking forward to your questions! :)

**PHASE FOUR**

*SEPTEMBER 5TH*

The clouds that had gathered above the monolithic headquarters of Solstice Inc. began to dispense a torrent of rain on those trapped inside. The world outside grew darker still.

Inexplicably, /u/rizer8 was shot from a cannon that disappeared as quickly as it had materialized. Nobody noticed.

What was noticed, however, was the severed head of the second Head of Internal Affairs, /u/theDUQofFrat, which had been brutally separated from his naked body. HR would have a field day with this, if HR still existed.

The rain poured down, the Administrators continued to build upon their plot, realizing that they now had a significant advantage.

The Insurrection was vulnerable, but the fight was far from over.

The rain pelted the skylights, as lighting began to illuminate the blackened sky.

This was unnatural. This was more than just a storm, more than corporate greed or a power struggle. This was a part of something bigger...

*All text is for flavor only.*

/u/theDUQofFRAT has been killed by the lynch. Their role was HEAD OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

* bspez: #Because they blatantly lynched a known doctor I will be voting to lynch u/qngff you can disregard the rat of this post 

~~Disregard, after debate w/ K9 I would rather lynch someone who voted Duq~~

~~This phase I will be voting u/K9MoonMoon, mostly for the same reasons cited by Duq. I honestly think the admins rallied to save K9 and get Duq. However, I am still willing to debate so give me your worst :)~~


* k9moonmoon: Who rallied to save me? There wasn't anything but a half-assed accusation by Duq against me that no one really followed up on. 

There was more effort to try and save /r/mrrrrh than to save me, even tho I'm the only one that had a quality power point to back her accusations up. 

* bspez: There were 8 votes against Duq but going through the comments I don't see 8 active people. Seeing as I have actual suspicions of you but not anyone else it makes sense for me to vote you. 

Addition: He wanted to lynch you, then the tables turned and he got lynched (despite a doctor claim), I think you and the people that voted him are admins. 

* k9moonmoon: Well his argument against me was that I was simply shit posting and not strategizing. When I was using my public vote logs for my strategizing instead, as he incorrectly ignored. So his original accusation for thinking I'm guilty are unfounded. 

* bspez: Yeah I'm going through and honestly u/LoneWolfOfTheCalla looks more guilty 

* frolicking_elephants: Why? 

* bspez: They were so adamant on lynching Duq despite his doctor claim

* LoneWolfOfTheCalla: LOL I was adamant on lynching duq? Did anyone notice that I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hogwartswerewolvesA/comments/6y4zai/solstice_phase_three_rising_storm/dmlr4t5/)

&gt; I don't think that we should lynch theDUQ yet because imo it's a 1/4 chance that it's the CEO.

Also I don't know why my vote didn't go through, I sent a message to the moderators and they haven't responded to me yet.

* frolicking_elephants: Who'd you vote for? 

* LoneWolfOfTheCalla: I'm also getting clarification that this is like not a Dave thing where no votes can be cast against someone.

* frolicking_elephants: That... doesn't answer my question. I wasn't looking for a Dave. 

* LoneWolfOfTheCalla: It was postulated that votes for Dave might show up as #N/A, so I obviously don't want to out that role just in case. I'm just waiting for /u/SOLSTICE_PHX to answer my mail.

* frolicking_elephants: Ohhhhhh. Okay, gotcha. NVM then. 

* LoneWolfOfTheCalla: It was confirmed I didn't vote. I swore I put my vote in, but anyways it was for /u/theprofessor886

* jilliefish: Oh weird. Why did you vote that way?

* causeWhyNotMate: cause why not, mate?

6yi3yz,3,2017-09-06,"I was in a secret relationship for two years, and cheated on for the final five months.",jrogers94,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6yi3yz/i_was_in_a_secret_relationship_for_two_years_and/,"This is the last post I'll make under this username since my ex has used this account to get to me before. I hope he sees this. No one's name in this is real.

I met my ex David in the summer of 2014. He was in a somewhat authoritative position in a professional manner, but it was more like he was responsible for me and three others and we were under his ""guardianship"" for a brief time. I'm going to call this a Work Event because he had a lot of these and it plays into what happens in the future.

He and I quickly fell in love, and a couple weeks after the ""guardianship"" was over, we were officially dating. We kept our relationship secret because he feared he would lose his job based on the circumstances we met. We were a long distance couple for 75% of the relationship. He would fly to visit me, I would fly to visit him. We would fall asleep on Google Hangouts and FaceTime, talk on the phone often, and text all the time. We spent Valentine's Day 2014 at an Airbnb the next state over and it was perfect. 
In the beginning of 2015, he had my old laptop because it was broken and he was trying to get all of my stuff off of it for me. On the computer he had found a photo of a guy I wasn't romantically involved with since he lived in a different country, but we were sexually involved when I got lonely. He asked me about this guy and if anything ever went on between us. I lied and said nothing did. He asked me again the next morning and I lied again. My reasons why I lied don't really matter so I won't mention them. He said he found explicit photos of me online. I was mortified. I never cried so hard, I begged for him not to leave me. I entered therapy (for the first time in my life) to prove how much I cared about him. I was working hard to earn his trust back. 

In the summer of 2015, he and I drove my car across the country and I spent the summer with him while I was in the process of transferring colleges. During that summer I interned at his place of work. Since our relationship was secret, I couldn't tell any of our coworkers where or with who I was living. I lied to everyone there telling them I lived on This Street, with my Aunt Whatever and Uncle Who. It was painful to lie to these good people. During my summer internship, only one person found out we were dating. Fall came around and I drove to the PNW with David to move into my new college dorm. It was a beautiful drive and a wonderful trip.

He went back to his home and I started classes. We continued to visit back and forth and our relationship was easier since we were in the same time zone, and only a 2 hour flight apart. We saw each other a lot. We spent New Year's together and it was fun and perfect; the same can be said about our Valentine's Day in 2016. We made homemade sushi and it was messy, and ridiculous, and our rolls did not come out very pretty but they were delicious. 

In the spring, he did a road trip up the coast with his friends and surprised me at school and stayed the night with me. I was in one of the worst depressive episodes I've ever had and I was happy to see him I cried. It was the best visit I'd ever had with him. We stayed up whispering and laughing, kissing and just being together. It was perfect.  

When classes ended for me in June 2016, my best friend Alyssa flew out to visit me and we drove down from the PNW to Southern CA. It was so fun, but since I did most of the driving I wasn't able to check in with David a lot. When I did check in it was rapid and along the lines of ""Hey! We're in this city, I drove for this long today, we saw This Landmark or That Landmark, I miss you and I hope the preparation for your next Work Event is going well!"" 

I raced to Southern CA so I could see him before he left for his next Work Event. I saw him one night and of course wasn't able to act like his girlfriend since we were at a large group function. I was just thankful to see him and be in his presence. There was a girl (Jessica) there who was going to be on this Work Event with him, and I told my best friend I had a bad feeling about the way she interacted with him. She told me to trust David and not let jealousy interfere. So I didn't. 

He returned from the Work Event about 4 weeks later. I was staying in his apartment and I had everything beautiful and clean and romantically lit, and I remember his reaction was just deflated, unimpressed. He didn't seem happy to see me the way I was happy to see him. He said it was because he was tired from the flight, and of course I believed him. 

That summer was rough. We fought a lot. I didn't have a physical job and I was depressed a lot of the time, and I wasn't cleaning the apartment while he was at work like he wanted. There was one night in particular, it was maybe the middle of the week, that we had gotten in a fight. I was laying in bed next to him crying, and he was on his phone texting or Instagram or Reddit or whatever. I decided I needed a little space so I calmly and quietly got up and made up the couch for me to sleep (and cry) there, alone. He came into the living room and was so angry. He was basically yelling, calling me dramatic and immature, and told me he wanted me to pack my car and leave to go back to school by the weekend. I don't remember what I did after we fought some more, but I think I went back and laid in bed with him and tried to be close with him. 

Eventually the end of summer came around and he said he would do the drive with me back to the PNW for school. This drive is where the relationship began to topple over. We fought the whole way. We had to pull over a few times because we were so worked up and angry. I was getting his mailbox key off of my keyring while he was taking a walk and when he got back in the car, he told me to take the house key off too. I cried as I started driving again. 

Somehow by the time we got to my college town, things were starting to calm down a little. I went to a friend's house to pick up my new cellphone that had came in the mail and accidentally stayed for an hour. David was at a nearby coffee shop working on his website, and was angry I spent so long. I understand, I told him I would only be 15 or so minutes. We fought, and he wanted me to drive him straight to the airport (his flight wasn't for a few days) but I got him to want to stay with me a little longer. We went to a drive-in movie and kissed and even had a good time. We stayed in a hotel in a nearby city while we passed time until it was time for his flight back home. He cried hard and laid in bed, curled in a ball. I held him and cried too. We stayed up talking about how to handle the future of our relationship and settled on ""One day at a time. We love each other, so let's just do this one day at a time."" We slept at a rest stop the night before his flight left, and because of a small, stupid argument right before he got out of my car, tension was there again. 

I admit I was glad to be back at school. I was happy to be with my friends and be independent again. Our relationship wasn't the same since we had parted ways. We fought a lot and I consistently felt guilty for spending time with my friends. I went with my roommates to our friends' apartment to study, and I wasn't back at my apartment by the time I had wanted to FaceTime David, so I excused myself and went upstairs to call him. He ignored my calls twice. He was angry I wasn't home when I said I'd be, and I apologized and said I wasn't the one who drove and couldn't just ask my roommate to drive me back home. That was inconvenient and rude, in my opinion. He didn't think so, and we fought. We fought a lot over the next couple months. We didn't have any visits planned so we didn't have a Light at the End of the Tunnel, as we always called it. 
He accused me of cheating a lot, and I didn't even have any guy friends. I couldn't have cheated if I wanted to. I was constantly denying his accusations. 

He broke up with me in November 2016, shortly after my birthday. My original holiday plans were to spend Christmas with him, but since we broke up I spent it alone. All my friends had gone home for the holidays. I spent the next few months being sad and lonely. My friends tried to get me to date but I wasn't ready. I thought I had failed in my last relationship, and I couldn't fail someone again. 

Now it's September, and I feel better about myself now than I have in ages. I get a message on Instagram from Jessica, asking if I had ever dated David. I told her everything. Jessica's relationship started with David in June 2016 on his Work Event. She had been dating him for a year and some change. 

I find out by talking on the phone with Jessica that our relationships overlapped by 5 months. 
""Remember when he went to that Work Event in Arizona? I was there with him."" I was back at his apartment while he was in Arizona. 
""Remember that concert you went to together? He was texting me the whole night telling me he wished I was there."" I was standing next to him, trying to sneak to hold his hand because we were with one of his friends from work who wasn't allowed to know about our relationship.
""Remember that overnight movie showing you went to? He was telling me how much he missed me and wished I was there."" I was sleeping next to him, and he had just told a different work friend that we had only been dating a few months, not almost two years. 

I was crushed. Even after he dumped me I always told myself and everyone else that he wasn't a bad person, just a bad partner. Up until Jessica messaged me, I was convinced he had a good heart and good intentions, and that one day we could be friends again. To have all that shattered and realized that ~five months were a total lie. He would go out of town and be with her, then come back and crawl into bed with me. 

I had never been cheated on before so I didn't see the signs. Looking back I can't help but feel so stupid, and wonder what I did to deserve it. 

I know I'm a good person. I'm proud of the decisions I make and the optimism I still have with me. I know that his cheating is no reflection on me (or Jessica) and that we were just unlucky girls. 

Jessica was staying in his apartment when she messaged me and I told her everything. She didn't really know anyone in the area, and didn't have a car so she couldn't leave. I arranged to have someone to get her, and she took my box of personal items as well. 

I called him and told him I was angry and disappointed and embarrassed. That I wish he would have just told me he fell for someone else so I could have driven back to the PNW, and he should've just been honest. But I think he wanted people to love him and make him feel loved and appreciated. I wasn't enough, and I'll never know why. No question I could ever ask him would give me an answer I'm satisfied with.

I don't know if Jessica is still talking to him now, but I know he was continuing to lie to her as she walked out the door. 

I've been moving from anger to sadness a lot since I found out, but I'm getting better. I only wish I would've known sooner. "

My college is forcing us to become unpaid interns (slaves) for a company to receive our Management Information Systems degree. Unbelievable right? Anyway, this company happens to handle HIPPA sensitive files. But all of their files are scattered EVERYWHERE with NO ORGANIZATION...something like a virtual Linus warehouse, except things aren't broken. 

Here's what they asked us to do:
1. Create a web single sign on. (different users have different permissions for various files)
2. Organize their files to be easily accessible to the RIGHT people.
3. They mentioned moving to the cloud via dropbox or sharepoint.

Does anyone have a clue how reorganize sensitive files on an local server? Their current system is naming the files (date)(patientname)(patientID)(filename)(etc...)...Problem is, all the employees have a different system for naming the files. I'm thinking about an SQL based solutions with appropriate files are attached... does anyone know how to do this? Or maybe know some online resources I could look at? or... does anyone have a better idea? Thanks dudes &amp; dudettes. Yall da best.

Best,

6yiljl,1,2017-09-06,Full time job vs Studying full time,Kriegershusband,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6yiljl/full_time_job_vs_studying_full_time/,"Hey guys, I could really use other peoples input.

I recently graduated from college with a BBA in Accounting and have been applying to jobs, and I recently got a job offer as a full time Accountant for a governmental agency. However, I am unsure if I should take it for a couple of reasons.

I plan on starting my MACC, which I plan on doing for the CPA hour requirements, in January and do not know if I can juggle both being a full time student and a full time employee, when the time comes around. On top of that I also plan on studying and taking the CPA exam. I am not the smartest student in the world, my undergraduate GPA was 3.26 in my accounting classes, however I am a hard worker, meaning I put in a lot of hours to earn that GPA. By also taking this job, I will be limiting the number of GRA/GA/TA position I can get to essentially zero as they are full time commitments. I really want one of these position because the come with at least a 50% tuition waivers, some with 100% waivers.

Secondly the pay isn't that good, $42k non-negotiable, as opposed to market rate of $55k. And in the hierarchy of accounting positions governmental jobs aren't the best. Don't get me wrong, I'll learn some great skills that I can transfer over when I apply for full-time roles at the Big 4, which starting my masters in January will allow me another recruiting to get these jobs.

Lastly I'm currently networking with professional to try to get a summer internship in 2018, which they only offer if you're at least one year from gradation at the time of the internship, which works cause my master program is a one year program.


Essentially if I take this job I have to juggle being a full time student and employee while also obtaining my CPA license, which will be essential when I apply for and network for full time roles while in my masters program. I'm not sure if the steady job will be worth all of the opportunity cost ie: tuition waivers and possibly not completing my CPA when I complete my Masters.

Let me know your advice."
6yjbgq,1,2017-09-06,[OK] Common law marriage,qto5566,FamilyLaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyLaw/comments/6yjbgq/ok_common_law_marriage/,"So me and my girlfriend are both 21, going to a university, and are financially independent and live together. We are wanting to become common law married, in order to get the benefits of marriage on our FAFSA, as our parents do not support us at all, yet we have to fill it out as if they are, yet if we are common law married, we can claim marriage and our chances for Pell Grants goes up tremendously. We receive no grants now. I work FT in summer internships, and she works PT year round during school(for now) and nearly FT in summer. We have to use loans to cover the rest of our expenses for school and leftover housing working/savings doesn't cover.

We have lived together in total for 3.5 years. 2 years at my parents house, 1.5 years completely on our own. We have a joint bank account and plan to get married after college.

My issue is I cannot find anything on how to apply? to become common law married, from what I can see it may require an attorney and going to court? In which case, it would make more sense to go get married at the court house for real, and do a proposal and ceremony later on, after college when we have more money to pay for a wedding ceremony.

I am basically looking for advice on how to go about becoming common law married, or if it is in our best interest to do the court house marriage now.

We 100% plan on getting married, just not while in college. 

I have 3 semesters left after this Fall 2017 semester, and she has At least 4 Semesters left, maybe more depending on her acceptance to her program. My tuition+fees currently cost $13k a year, and hers are going to be about $6k a year. We are already going to school in state and both receive a few small scholarships.

Thank you for any help

6yjc2p,3,2017-09-06,Soon-to-be new grad here with a few concerns/questions regarding career paths,LurkaDurkaDoWorka,physicaltherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/6yjc2p/soontobe_new_grad_here_with_a_few/,"I am on my final rotation of PT school in an acute care setting.  The rotation has been going great so far; in fact, I'm beginning to give serious consideration to working in acute care to start off my career. 

So here's my dilemma... My professional interests have always been outpatient oriented which stems from my own rehab experiences in outpatient settings (stop me now if you've heard that one before...) and I always thought that I was for sure going to wind up in an OP sports medicine clinic of some sort after school.  I haven't lost any interest in working in OP, but this rotation has really made a big impact on me to the point where I am strongly entertaining the idea of working in acute care after graduation.  Another thing to consider is that this last internship is *six months* long and I will already be fully in the swing of working in an acute care setting once it's over.

I have given thought to potentially starting off my career in acute and then returning to OP at some point down the road, but I don't know what the implications of that decision might be.

Have any of you had similar experiences where you were conflicted about what setting to start off in?  If so, how did you ultimately decide on which setting?

Assuming I stay in acute care, can anyone give me an idea of what potential challenges I might face if I decide to change to OP a few years down the road?

What are some things that I should take into consideration when making this decision?

Thanks in advance to all of you for your advice and guidance."
6yjtut,7,2017-09-06,Project Phoenix,MrRight1196,SecretSubreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretSubreddit/comments/6yjtut/project_phoenix/,"Day 1: “Audio log #1. Work on Project Phoenix has officially begun, though I am currently the only one that knows of its existence. For anyone that joins the project from this point and onwards this log will be the introductory crash course to Project Phoenix, so without further ado, Welcome to Project Phoenix. The goal of this project is to nullify the effects of recent death to attempt to save lives. While I cannot guarantee it will be a success, I can guarantee that it will be at least help advance medicine in some way, even if it is minor. So for the first day I was able to get various people around the facility get me some recently deceased corpses.” *she sighs and laughs slightly* ""How I'm going to explain *this* to the higher ups, I have no idea."" *she laughs again* 

Day 5: “Audio log #2. The first strides of the project have been made. I have been able to successfully cease minor decay in a detached hand that I had been able to procure from a recently dismembered intern. I currently do not know if I will be able to successfully attach the hand to a willing test subject but I sure as hell can try, come to think of it I believe there are a few amputees awaiting replacement parts. Perhaps one of them would be willing to volunteer.”

Day 8: Audio log #3. Dr. Emani has become a member of Project Phoenix, after getting Mr. Emani to agree to the attachment of a revived hand I felt somewhat obligated to let her know what exactly I was doing. Dr Emani is in charge of monitoring her husband’s hand and letting me know if anything goes wrong or if it’s all okay.

Day 11: “Audio log #4. The hand is a...partial success, however the success is so minorly partial that it might as well be a failure at this point. Decay on the hand does begin to set in unless it is stimulated on a daily basis. At this point for Mr. Emani I would recommend removal of the hand and replacement with a cybernetic one for now until the project advances further, it would be quite unfortunate should the necrosis spread further than his hand and up his arm.”

Day 20: “Audio log #5. As I managed to cut my finger today, I had a thought, what if instead of trying to only just revive dead tissue I attempted to increase platelet production as well? This could possibly assist in returning the recently deceased to the land of the living, repairing any trauma that occurred to them before or after death. I’ll have to see if I can work on a mixture that might be of assistance.”

Day 21: “Audio log #6. Dr. Emani and I have created a mixture that I believe will work has been created. I still need to do some initial testing on it though.”

Day 22: “Audio log #7. I had attempted to see if I could speed up this platelet production on myself in an independent experiment. I took a scalpel and cut a shallow one inch incision into my left arm. Upon application of the mixture, production sped up rapidly. In under a minute the blood began to clot and scab over, in under two minutes the wound had completely healed leaving no trace that it was ever there. Initial signs are looking very good. I’m going to need to test this with inorganic matter as well, seeing if it removes it or leaves it within the wound.”

Day 23: “Audio log #8. Trial with inorganic material is a failure. I once more I cut a shallow, inch long wound into my arm, however this time I stuck a needle into it and left it there before applying the mixture. The wound around the needle healed however I still needed to remove the needle itself from my arm. Tests on increased platelet production and increased healing factors will resume at a later date, until then I will resume the main research of Project Phoenix.”

Day 30: “Audio log # 9. I have turned my attention back to the hand, attempting once more to make revive it and make it stable for attachment. Maybe if I up the intensity of the stimulation it might help.”

Day 35: “Audio log #10. I had decided to go with my theory that upping the intensity of the stimulation would essentially reduce if not completely remove the need for additional stimulation had been proven correct at time of recording. After applying the stimulation the hand had been left out on a table in a room temperature room for five days without any outside disturbance and there were absolutely no signs of decay, aside from the usual dead skin cells that we produce daily. Tomorrow I will be attaching the hand to Mr. Emani and seeing if there is any difference from last time.”

Day 41: “Audio log #11. Before I begin I feel I should add that Dr. Duff has joined the team for Project Phoenix, he’s been with the infirmary for quite some time and his work in the genetics department might be of use to us. Anyway, some more progress has been made and after the initial application of the hand to Mr. Emani, we have not noticed any degradation. We need to press further to see if this is simply temporary due to the increased dosage or if these effects are here to stay.”

Day 45: “Audio log #12. It seems as if these effects are somewhat mixed, the hand has once again showed some degradation though this time it was significantly slowed. I am unsure at the moment if this is because of the increased dosage or if this is because of repeated doseages. We’ll have to remove the arm and try again.”

Day 52: “Audio log #13. Dr. Romano has joined the the Project Phoenix team, her more magic oriented work could open up some new doors for us and I’m very much looking forward to what she has to offer. Uh, aside from that not much else has occurred with the project, though we’re still working on it.”

Day 60: “Audio log #14. It has been two months since the launch of Project Phoenix and I’d just like to say that I am exceptionally proud of the progress we had made in our work. We have made it so much further in two months than I had expected us to get in two years. Everyone on the team should be pleased with the work they’d done here.”

Day 65: “Audio log #15. We’ve finally managed to somewhat streamline the process. Rather than the typical injection method, we have managed to make the application process into a beam structure, but only thanks to crystal sample GG-3883 being used for the construction of a collimating and expanding lens. Thanks again Sector 9 geology department. Unfortunately the construction of these lenses used up almost all of the entire sample so we can only get smaller one.”

Day 66: “Audio log #16. We decided to try applying the beam to the hand and gauge the results from it, I’ll post after 5 days and see if this had proven to be more or less successful than the standard injection.”

Day 71: “Audio log #17. The beam has proven to be far more effective than the old application process. Five days after the initial application the hand has shown next to no signs of decay, even with that would be considered on the level of the first application. Once more, attachment to Mr. Emani is planned for later today and we’re going to see if it is as successful as it seems like it’s going to be.”

Day 76: “Audio log #17. Once more the hand has begun to rot after attachment **again**.” *There is a sound of something getting knocked over in the background and shattering on the ground* “Back to the fucking drawing board.” *Seemingly having forgotten to turn off the recording device, several hours of background noise can be heard, including muttering, conversing with others, and the sound of marker on whiteboard. This goes on for a while before you hear a “Shit, I left this thing on” and it suddenly ends*

Day 80: “Audio log #18. We had somewhat upgraded the beam to allow it to give off the healing properties of the other side serum I had created. While it isn’t a massive overwhelming feat, it certainly does help give it some versatility. I’ll have to see if the beam would get rid of any inorganic matter or not though perhaps that’s a test for another day.”

Day 82: “Audio log #19. A Small update but the beam is still incapable of removing inorganic matter at this point. Slightly disappointing.”

Day 90: “Audio log #20. Today I was visiting a stall Sofia set up to sell her various magic items and I had a thought. If she can enchant various crystals with certain properties I wonder if she’d be able to enchant the lens with either something that’s going to work in tandem with the beam or something that enhances the beam’s inherent capabilities, I’ll have to speak with her about it tomorrow.”

Day 91: “Audio log #21. I got around to speaking with Sofia about enchanting the crystal lenses that are currently in place on the beam and she was willing to do it. She let me know that she needed some time to get some research in about how to do this whole thing properly and I’m more than willing to let her have that time. Her taking longer to get this done the right way is better than her rushing it and destroying the lenses, we can’t afford to construct a new one if this goes wrong.”

Day 106: “Audio log #22. Sofia came into work today with a knapsack full of various implements, I decided not to bother her about it and just let her work on the lenses. So until she’s done the lab is off limits. If this whole thing works out I’m definitely giving her some paid time off. Though if it breaks well...she better just hope it doesn’t break.”

Day 107: “Audio log #23. From what I can tell the enhancement of the lenses have been a success. I’ve given Sofia a couple of paid days off and we shall resume research whenever she returns.”

Day 110: “Audio log #24. With Sofia back we have decided to resume research. Once more, we are attempting the reattachment of the hand to Mr. Emani. Hopefully all goes well.”

Day 111: “Audio log #25. Again, Mr. Emani’s hand has been reattached. Thankfully the lenses didn’t shatter during the application process, so that’s definitely a good thing. Not much else to say during this one really, hopefully this all goes well.”

Day 116: “Audio log #26. A bit of a short entry but I felt it was necessary, as of this entry the hand shows no signs of decay and the attachment seems to have gone well. That’s all I really just have to say. Entry over. *Once more she forgot to turn the recorder off and the audio records and plays out for a few hours, recording some background conversations and a few phone calls. After a while it cuts out, she either noticed it was still on or the battery finally died.”

Day 121: “Audio log #27. The hand we’ve attached to Mr. Emani has shown next no signs of decay at all. At this point in time I can call this mark in the experiment a success! Now we can finally move on to something larger, like a leg or an arm.”

*127 days after the start of the experiment Izzy strides into the infirmary earlier than usual, clipboard and Audio recorder in hand. She walks into the cafeteria, grabs a bagel and a cup of coffee before making her way to the lab and setting her stuff down onto a table, freeing her hands so she can get to work on the project*"

6yk7ff,48,2017-09-06,I am a student attending a top university who battled mental health. I reached out to them for help — now I regret it.,ispeakforMI,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6yk7ff/i_am_a_student_attending_a_top_university_who/,"Let me start by saying that I’m a student at a top private university in the US. Although I'm choosing not to call them out by name, it's a very well known and selective school. Like many other people in the world, I’m also someone who has been battling mental illness. In addition, I’m someone who believes the system for addressing mental health is still not handled humanely. 

For the sake of anonymity and to protect individuals that are involved, I won’t be disclosing any names, ages, genders, etc.

I first approached the counseling services at my university for help in September 2016. I remember feeling reluctant to go in for help at first, as I heard the reputation of the university’s health services were well below subpar. Yet, I had more positive and productive experiences seeking help in the past, so, with a bit of faith, I went in to consult them for help about my condition. From the moment I stepped into the office, I was met with extreme intimidation: their tone, their demeanor, made me feel as if I was being interrogated rather than listened to. I went in to ask for help. I was instead met with inhumane treatment. Fifteen minutes into the conversation, the counselor chose to break confidentiality and forcibly escort me to the hospital with the police.

“You can choose to cooperate or we will take you by force,” they said.

I didn’t understand. I did not want to hurt myself. I did not want to hurt anyone. I was well aware of the terms of confidentiality, and to my understanding, there was little to no justification in breaking it.

They wouldn’t answer any of my questions either.

“Do I have to pay for this? How am I supposed to pay for this? How long will this take?” I asked.

Their response was essentially “not my problem.”

“Do I have any say in this matter?” I asked.

“No.”

I remember walking down the hall of the counseling center, escorted by a police officer. I remember feeling like absolute shit. I remember being put in the back of the squad car. I remember the stiffness of the reinforced seats. I remember driving past my peers on the way to the hospital, seeing their smiling faces as I was stuck in the back of a police car. I remember feeling like a criminal. At this very moment, I felt one thing and one thing only: fear incarnate.  

I remember the officer saying “I got another one” as they brought me before the nurse, as if I was some kind of convict or animal. 

“So, let me get this straight, I have to pay for this psychiatric evaluation even though it’s against my will? And I have no say in the matter?” 

“Yes,” was their curt reply. 

I remember being escorted to a white room. I remember being told to strip and wear a hospital gown. I remember feeling humiliated. I remember security officers searching through my belongings, documenting everything I had. I remember waiting for over six hours with guards posted at the door. Every time the guards would shift positions, I was nervous they would come in and handcuff me. I was surprised they never did. I remember asking for a phone to call my girlfriend or my family, who were extremely worried at the time. I never got the opportunity. After what felt like an eternity, a social worker came in to speak with me. After another fifteen minute conversation, the social worker consulted the psychiatrist and said I was good to leave. 

There was no reason why I should have been there. 
And yet I was.

Before that moment, I had never had a stigma against mental illness. I never had a problem with seeking help and was willing and able to do so. Yet, after this traumatic episode, I only began to fear myself and my condition, as well as mental health professionals in general. The very stigma that they were claiming to combat, they created with their extremely cruel and unprofessional behavior. I refused to see or speak with any mental health professionals after that moment, in fear that they would “take me away” at any given moment.

I remember crying to my girlfriend and friends the next day.

I remember crying in front of the Dean of Students.

I never was one to cry a lot.

I didn’t see a professional for about six months, until I noticed how strongly it began to affect my day to day functioning. After my girlfriend and I broke up in March, I decided to confront my mental illness more directly. I didn’t want it to define my life anymore. So, reluctantly, I decided to willingly and voluntarily return to the counseling services at the university to request a medical leave of absence. I was never forced out of the school. It was my choice. They told me I was making the “right choice” and that many students who have gone on leave come back feeling more refreshed. 

Bullshit.

Although it was definitely challenging, I approached my treatment during my leave with high hopes. I regularly saw my psychiatrist and counselor. I wanted to be able to leave the past behind, to just learn from it, and grow maturely. Although the first few months were relatively dull because I was the only college student back at home that early, things got better in May. I started socializing with the friends I had once cut off due to my condition. I started to pursue my personal aspirations that I had always dreamed of pursuing, such as music production and singing. My summer days were divided between work, music, studying, volunteering, working out, playing sports, or just spending quality time with my friends. I’m thankful to my friends for giving me some of the best times during such a difficult period of my life: the times we would go on a spree of bowling every single day or just finding the quiet time to sit at a park and enjoy some Popeyes fried chicken. 

I was finally happy again. 

I was finally optimistic again.

I was finally motivated to go to school, study, and live a normal life again. And, most importantly, my condition no longer impacted my day to day functioning anymore. 

Little did I know that when it came to me applying for reinstatement, the counseling services would direct whatever malicious aura there was residing in their soul towards me. It all started with the first interview.

I first consulted the Director of Clinical Services, whom I will refer to as “Dr. A,” to set up an interview. Unfortunately, Dr. A was unavailable during the time, so Dr. A set me up to be interviewed with someone named B. We set up a date and time for the interview by phone, and until then, I continued with my relatively positive life, eagerly talking to my friends about all of the opportunities I would pursue in school that I couldn’t before. I wanted to participate in IM soccer with my friends. I wanted to join the youth group at school. I wanted to volunteer more and join more clubs.

Then came the interview.

I received a call from the counseling services. But it wasn’t B on the phone. Rather, it was a counselor named C. I was a bit wary of the more or less unprofessional practice, switching up my interviewer with no formal notice, but I didn’t question it much at the time. Then came the interrogating that I was so used to before. I was a bit nervous, but I had thought the interview had gone rather well. I described to them the great number of passions and professional opportunities I took on over the summer. In the time of just a few months, I had:

-Started up my passion for singing and rapping, and received thousands of listens on my content that I publicly posted
-Been working on an official debut album to sell digitally and physically
-Founded a startup officially recognized by the IRS as well as other local and federal agencies
-Networked with several developers and organizations to gather research in order to establish a nonprofit service to cater to the homeless in my area (a more long term plan, admittedly)
-Volunteered for a number of organizations covering a variety of social issues, including mental health and homeless
-Completed the Spartan Super, despite my relatively poor physical endurance for long distance running
-And much more

I received a follow up call at around 9 am a few days after the interview. I received no prior notice that I would receive a call. At the time, I couldn’t answer the phone. I later learned that, specifically because of that incident, the counseling services included in their summary that I was “apathetic and uncooperative towards my return.” 

Because I didn’t answer the phone once.

Even though I returned their call later that day.

But what could I do? I was a powerless student at the mercy of the administration.

Then came the actual follow up call. The counseling services said they would reject my request. Their justification?

“You basically told us you went volunteering a few times and went to the mall.”

They chose to completely dismiss how I chose to spend my time, creating my own foundation, happiness, and independence with myself. They “wanted to see more than mere pursuits of passion.” 

“Also you didn’t go to counseling every week.”

First, I was only four sessions short of attending weekly psychotherapy during the extended period of time. Furthermore, that does not account for the fact that on some weeks, I attended more than once AND during some weeks, MY PROVIDERS were not available. Finally, the scheduling was also set up in order to cater to the fact that I was extremely mistrusting of mental health professionals at the time, no thanks to the university.

The fact that they judged my well being on a completely arbitrary system of measurements reveals that this university does not see those who are mentally ill as “people.” They see them as a broad statistic.

My happiness, my emotional and mental well being were just “mere pursuits of passion”? I was appalled that anyone could be so dismissive, so ignorant, and forgive me for saying this, so inept. Did they expect me to cure cancer, find an internship at Google, fund Space X, and solve conflict in the Middle East? Their expectations were unrealistic at best. I was better, I was functioning well, and most importantly, I was willing and more than able to return to school. I was the one who believed it was good for me to take a break from school in March. As an autonomous human being, I assumed it would be my right to be able to return once I felt better and ready.

Apparently not.

I approached the counseling services eager to return and show the progress and maturity I redeveloped.

Instead, they chose to nitpick on issues, going so far as to completely distort and misrepresent them to my counselor, claiming that I was “withholding information from my providers,” when I simply did not feel comfortable talking about them. And that’s no justification to say that I’m not functioning properly. 

Instead, the counseling services disregarded my responses for their initial concerns, and effectively locked me out of setting my life back on track. 

Instead, I’m now met with the risk of losing my health insurance, which is what I currently rely on to see my healthcare professionals, because I no longer qualify as a dependent due to my loss of my “full time student” status. 

Instead, I’m met with the risk of depression, which my therapist is also concerned about, due to the difficulty of the situation I will face until I can reapply, in addition to the isolation I will experience by nature of all of my peers departing to school while I fall another term behind on my academic career. 

I chose to appeal the school’s decision and proceeded to write an extremely detailed letter, with a number of professionals, friends, and students of the university writing letters of recommendation backing me up on my readiness to return. These were people who spent nearly every day with me, people who knew my circumstance, and saw my growth first hand.

Just recently, I received the same repetitive reply that failed to take into consideration or read any of the responses I had sent to directly address their concerns. It was as if they had not read a single word of my letter. It literally seemed to be a copy-paste reply.

I don’t necessarily regret too many decisions in my life, as I’m someone who chooses to look forward. But I can most definitely say that if I ended up regretting making the choice to seek help, not once, but twice, the system is definitely fucked up. I only wanted to be able to move on from my mental illness; my school is preventing me from doing so and is choosing to keep me locked in this perpetual cycle.

I could keep quiet and just apply for another quarter, but I don’t want people to be abused by this malicious system as I once was. I also no longer have any faith in the competence or prestige of my seemingly “good” school. I’ve also read many similar cases about students-- both from my school and from other schools-- being effectively locked out after taking medical leave.

So, what do I do now?"
6yk7l9,2,2017-09-06,My family not letting me [M/22] leave to the UK to my girlfriend [F/23],Can-UK_ldr,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/6yk7l9/my_family_not_letting_me_m22_leave_to_the_uk_to/,"My girlfriend (Portuguese) and I (Chinese) have been in a long distance relationship for 1 year and 3 months now. She’s in the UK and I’m in Canada, she came for a week long visit recently. During the week I mentioned to my parents that I would like to move to the UK to be with her after receiving my degree from university which is just about 2 years.

Being from a Chinese family, I don’t normally open up to my parents about dating etc… My plans of course shocked my parents even though I've been mentioning that maybe I could take several internships in the UK. However my parents and brother see it as me not wanting to be a part of the family anymore and think that I’m sacrificing their happiness for mine and calling me selfish as they do not want me to leave.

In private with me, my mother voices her reasonable concerns about finance, commitments to our relationship, and what would happen if things go wrong for me while I’m there and I’d be left with no help. I've also never had the opportunity to live on my own which may be the largest factor as to why she is so afraid to let me go.

My girlfriend was in tears when she spoke to my mother one-on-one about how she wants me to be with her while she finished her university degree. Instead she made a deal with my girlfriend that in 4 years she would be the one who needs to move to Canada after she completed university. After these 4 years I would be 26 and she would be 27. The idea of me leaving the continent sits so poorly with them they’d rather inconvenience my girlfriend even though they understand that she too has a family and other personal issues to attend to. Due to me not being able to leave the continent my girlfriend is the one who needs to visit me once a year.

Is there any advice anyone could offer?

Thanks for reading.
p.s. Please don’t bash on my family too hard I do understand why they’re so upset and might think I’m even stupid but perhaps people on this forum could help out from our perspective."
6ykvt1,4,2017-09-07,"I did her so wrongly, feeling incredible guilt, pain, anguish.",newflame97,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/6ykvt1/i_did_her_so_wrongly_feeling_incredible_guilt/,"This is a long post, but I didn't want to leave much detail out, I appreciate your patience.

Four months ago, I met a girl through my summer internship. She was unusually nice in disposition. So much so that I thought it was an act. I soon found out that not only was it completely genuine, but that she was a follower of Jesus, and had sacrificed her life and much of her worldly motivations to become closer to God. Without giving away too many details, she gave up her passion and life for God. Just hearing that itself gave me pause. 

I was not a religious person, and hadn't been for quite some time. Well, one random Sunday, I was bored, so I spontaneously decided to start driving. It was super hot, and my AC randomly stopped working so I decided to pull over in the nearest lot. It turns out this lot that I pulled into was a GIGANTIC church. I had personally never been inside of a church, so I was extremely nervous. I decided that it was too hot to stay outside, so I went in. I walk in, amazed at the sheer size of the building and was soon led into the auditorium by a staff member, and nervously sit down. The sermon was absolutely beautiful, and I found myself shaking involuntarily during the worship.

Then suddenly the preacher says ""I don't know if you're new here or if you've been here for 20 years, but if you would like to make the decision to follow Jesus, please raise your hand now"". Again, without a thought, my hand raised into the air involuntarily. I was in shock, but wonder at the same time. I was set to leave because the sermon was over but then somebody next to me said ""Hey we're doing Baptisms now!"". I was like ""oh okay sure"". 

So then, I see the Christian girl from my volunteering show up on the stage among 15-20 others. And her little brother was getting baptized apparently. There were singers, and the whole atmosphere was so incredible, I felt apart of something so much bigger than myself even though it was my first time. I left thinking that this ideology is something that I need to learn more about, and I made the decision that I would return the next week. 

While I'm leaving, I take a quick Snap of the stage, and send it to the girl, let's call her Abby. So Abby immediately Snaps back, saying ""omg you go to my church, that's so awesome!"" I responded telling her that this was totally by chance and that that was my first day ever in Church.

Anyways, that week we ended up hanging out a few times outside of our internship hours. The more time I spent with Abby, the more I heard her speak about her relationship with Jesus, the more I experienced her genuine compassion, I started to crush on her a little bit. Important to note that I had a serious girlfriend at the time(this becomes relevant later).

We end up hanging out more and more and getting close and establishing a friendship. She was simply inspiring and something about her vibe made me thirst for the knowledge I knew she had.

So a few weeks later I get some bad news about a childhood friends health situation. I went into a tailspin, and my only thought was to go see my friend and to go back to church so I could pray. I text Abby and ask her about the church hours, and accidentally tell her about what's happened. She was incredibly compassionate, when she didn't have to be. She offered to meet up and talk about it. But I declined because I was in such sorrow and I didn't want to see anyone. 

I drove off in the middle of the night to a city hours away where my girlfriend lived and where much of my family is buried. I met with my girlfriend, had dinner and the next morning we went to the cemetery together the next morning. Upon my arrival back home, I texted Abby and we met the next day (Sunday) for church. We ended up sitting around for hours before/after service just hanging out and talking about what had happened. I was so happy to have her there because she was genuinely one of the nicest people I've ever met in my lifetime. 

The authenticity and sincerity of her faith and prayer for me during that time made my heart melt. We had our hands interlocked and I could not stop thinking ""there is no way anybody is this good of a person"". But she was and she proved it over and over again. And this is where I first failed her. 

During that conversation, I was telling her about my trip I had taken. And without thinking, I referred to my girlfriend as my ""ex girlfriend"". For the next 30 minutes we were sitting there, I was in shock thinking why I said that. And it hit me as I left: I absolutely adore Abbys soul. She had found something spiritually that I longed for so badly for myself. The strength of her faith, and compassion was simply orderly, and experiencing a godly woman like that was so different than what I'm used to. I decided that I really like her and this put me in a bind.

Abby is also a virgin, which is another area where I failed her. The next week, fellow interns were joking amongst each other that I was spending so much time with Abby that we had to be dating. I played it off cool, I thought until I was given an opportunity to brag, and I hate myself every day for this, but I took it. Someone said ""bro she's so hot, have you hit it yet?"". And I not only bragged, but I lied. There were 4-5 guys standing there, and I basically said ""yeah"". 

The reality is that we had not had complete sexual intercourse. Other lesser things yes but that's irrelevant. I lied on her name and then I lied to her about my girlfriend. The pain that I felt was so strong and exists even more now. 

The summer is over and she returned to school far away. I get the feeling that someone told her about what I had said, and even if they didn't, that doesn't change the fact that I still said those things. I can't look at myself in the mirror knowing what a terrible person I am. Every once and a while I shot her a Snapchat and her energy has changed.

I really thought that meeting her and trying to instill these strong Christian values would make me a better person. But I've done bad things and those terrible thoughts stay with me sometimes. She did nothing wrong to me ever, and I betrayed her. She literally inspires me every single day to be a better Christian, and a better man because of meeting her and seeing the example of spiritual fitness that she set. I'm so thankful to have met her, but those feelings of pain and suffering flow through me every day thinking about what I did. I did wrong, and had a chance to back off what I said, and instead I doubled down. I'm the scum of the earth.

I tried to push her away by blocking her on all social media. But this only makes me feel worse. She may or may not know what I did, but that doesn't change the fact that I did it. Today she's still blocked and may not even understand why. I could use some advice on this situation. My regret is deep and I can't help but think about her and how much change she inspired in me this summer.

She has had many successful internships at the top tech companies, she consistently gets amazing grades (Mostly A's and A+'s) in a hard computer science degree at a difficult University, and often gets random job offers from recruiters who have found her.  

She also unfortunately had anxiety issues, and it really affects her stress levels dangerously whenever she gets really tough homework assignments. In these cases, she automatically and undeniably assumes that the homework is actually an extremely easy, fast peice of cake; but she's ""too dumb and stupid to figure it out"" (the PG version of what she herself says - even though I absolutely know that is not even close to the truth) She gets EXTREMELY frustrated (dangerously so, I'd say) and it is nearly impossible to help her. 

For example, if I say ""this is just a really hard homework! It'll take some time to figure it all out!"" (After even noticing her classmates mentioning how hard and long the assignment is) She will completely explode on me crying and yelling about how easy it is but she's just ""too dumb"". Anything else I could say also results in a similar explosion.

Any time I try to talk about it she gets frustrated and anxious and won't let me finish any of my thoughts - I feel like I'm drowning! I hate how low of an opinion she has of herself, even though she always excels over almost everyone else. I love her with all my heart and want to help her more than anything, but I don't know how. How do I help her Reddit?"
6yllhl,5,2017-09-07,My (29F) boyfriend (31M) is upset because I don't have the money to go on a trip with him,gfwithnomoney,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6yllhl/my_29f_boyfriend_31m_is_upset_because_i_dont_have/,"Hi! I have a money and boyfriend problem, which is mainly that my goofy, kind, handsome boyfriend and I do not see money the same way. I admit, I am frugal to a fault sometimes, probably as a result of my parents having very little money when I was younger and my mother roping me into her money anxiety. My parents are doing very well for themselves now, and have been very generous with me as I went back to school for the last couple years, so maybe my anxiety about money is unwarranted.


Here’s the problem: I feel anxious and out of control if I spend without having a budget or knowing exactly how much I’m spending. I've spent the summer spending money without really tracking how much I have left to spend, and it's left me with a pit of dread in my stomach every time I think about it. My boyfriend is almost actively offended at the thought of saying no to doing fun things because we don’t have the money. As an example, When I was in school and making $700 per month at my internship (and using my savings to cover the rest of my living expenses), he was really upset when I was hesitant to spend the money on a flight to visit him for his birthday in a month where I was already stretched thin. I’d already been doing most of the travel to see him, but he was offended at the thought that I would prioritize money over our relationship. 


Here’s the current issue: I’ve just had a lot of unexpected expenses over a visa issue (to finally live for good in my boyfriend’s country). I had some very generous help from my parents, but after this, living as a student for two years, and moving countries, and a summer spending money the way my boyfriend spends money, my savings account is basically shattered. Because of this, I told my boyfriend that I didn’t think I could swing the long weekend trip that we had talked about and would need to save up for a few months before booking it, and this really upset him. He refuses to talk about it, doesn’t want to sit down and look at how much it will cost to go and when I could realistically afford to do it, and I’m afraid we need to hash out how we handle money. 


I knew when I moved in with him that we saw money very differently, but I didn't realize how much I would feel obligated to spend so that he feels like we're living a full life. His version of budgeting seems to be to spend what he wants and check later to see if he's within his monthly income. He never checks prices before buying something or spending money (this includes restaurants, even when the prices are literally in front of him on the menu-- he still gets sticker shock), and he doesn't seem to like the idea of figuring out what a trip will cost before starting to book it. 


This weekend trip has really upset him; we had a big fight the other night, because he was angry that I had ""made the decision already"" without him that I couldn't go before the end of the year, and that was unfair of me. In my mind, it's my money and my budget, and I have every right to say that I can't swing it right now. He thinks that I'm too focused on money and is worried that it's always going to be like this (ie that I'll fret about spending any money at all). He's barely spoken to me in the last couple days. 


I really feel like I need to build an emergency fund before going on any trips; I feel so incredibly anxious at the thought of my savings account being any lower than it is right now. In my mind, it's unacceptable for me to have a balance that could be entirely wiped out by one big expense (say, if there was a family emergency, and I had to fly home). I'm also trying to save up to go home to see my family next summer. I barely have enough to do that now (would almost decimate my savings), and I won't be able to if I can't find a way to save a little money every month. 


For the record, he makes less than I do, but has much more in savings. I make enough that I can live fairly comfortably, but definitely still need to budget, and wouldn’t be able to pay for a weekend trip without cutting back somewhere, and definitely wouldn’t be able to do it and put money in savings that month. 


Update: We talked last night, and it turns out that he wasn't angry about spending the money or not, but he was upset that we wouldn't be able to go this year. He thought I should have apologized for getting his hopes up and not checking into my finances before we started planning. I'm still not sure I agree with that, but I do see where he's coming from. We're going to sit down and price out the trip and budget and figure out when we can go. 

The silent treatment is kind of something we did to each other; we were both working most of the days we didn't talk, and I was working on my thesis defense in the evening, and we just...didn't really cross paths even thought we were in the same apartment. In an ideal world, we would have either set it aside or hashed it out right away, but I think that's something we'll need to work on. 


I know we'll have to keep negotiating the way we do money, but it seems like he understands why I feel the way I do, so I think that's a good sign.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend is angry that I'd rather spend a few months saving and sorting out my finances than go on a weekend trip with him. He doesn't like to figure out what things will cost, so I don't think he realizes exactly how much this trip will take."

6ymowu,22,2017-09-07,Let's talk about Big 4/Mid-Tier/ and regional firms,PeterGearty,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6ymowu/lets_talk_about_big_4midtier_and_regional_firms/,"This sub, like many major colleges, enjoys fetishizing BIG 4 work for essentially the sole purpose of placing it on your resume. To be fair, many individuals complain and you can see the rampant hatred flowing through many comments on this sub. I want to make a point here because it is very odd to see some college students unsure about what to do.

When I went to college all I could think about was Big 4 and I landed an audit internship during January of my Senior year. The pay was fantastic and I have zero regrets following through - but holy hell I absolutely despised the workload. I'm a pretty sociable guy and my teams were fine - but the hours were pure hell and I found myself picking up a beer for the drive home because the only time I was actually relaxing was when I was driving. 

The common statement to somebody complaining about the work-load is to ""tough it out"". Sounds great. Lose your early-late 20's killing yourself for a future reward.

I want to make one point clear before I move on. Big 4 experience will likely get you better opportunities in the future if you intend on staying in accounting. 

I chose to work at a smaller( but still fairly large) """"regional"""" firm  for my first busy season of audit after I declined the job at EY. What I noticed is that I surprisngly was forced to learn a hell of alot more about smaller private companies in a much shorter period of time. In big 4 I was on a client for nearly 2 months. At regional I was switching roughly every week to week and a half. 

I actually enjoyed the work. I have always seen myself as a bit of a risk taker and part of the reason I chose accounting was for the initial cash flow and ideally the ability to learn skills which would translate to running my own business/investments. Even if it was a ""simple"" concept like rental real estate I figured I needed the cash to even get to that point. This regional firm gave me an in depth look at various businesses and I felt as if I was actually learning everyday I went to work.

I stayed there for a year and moved to where I live now. I work with GT in a major US city. The hours here are substantially better than my 6 months at Big 4, but the workload can still be somewhat tough and it is absolutely possible to get stuck on a client for months. 

From what I can tell - many of the Seniors/Managers that left after this busy season ended up with jobs very similar if not better than my friends who have escaped Big 4.

In the regional firm, however, this has obviously not been exactly the case. Many of them had issues getting a great job in industry, although some have pulled some pretty nice ones.


This sub has a strong tendency to point Big 4 as the only way to go. This is simply wrong - and I am confident you can end up in a very similar position if you start in mid tier. Even if you decided half way through that you want to go Big4... Guess who big4 hires from? Mid-Tier.

Just try to get your head out of the cult following for a few minutes and actually look at whats out there. 

For me - It just simply was not worth giving up some of the best years of my life for hope that I would ""make it"" a few years earlier.

For those of you in Big 4/Mid Tier/Regional - Do you have any regrets?"

I'll start this post of with a little bit of background information about myselve.
I recently graduated from university where I studied technical computing.

During my study I started working at a small startup as a scriptdeveloper.
They hired 4 students ( including myselve ) , but after about 3 months there wasn't enough work for all of us, and they decided to fire the other 3 students and keep me.
They had pretty amazing plans with me. They said they saw a lot of potential and wanted me to lead a group of new developers after I finished my university.
Thus I decided to do my internship at that place, explicitly stating that I only wanted to do my internship there if I was actually able to get the job I wanted after I was done with my internship.
""No problem"", they said.

2 days after I finished my internship, and thus my study, they asked me to come in for a meeting. 
The meeting took 2 minutes, in which only a few words were said: ""We don't have the money to offer you the job right now"". The rest of the 2 minutes were silent, since I came into the meeting thinking we were about to talk about the job that I would get.
After this meeting I talked to the owners of the company and said they screwed me over. One of them felt really bad, the other just said: ""You should have had it on paper"". I guess  he was right.

At this point I was thinking about my options. With the study I finished I can easily manage to get a job. Although I still need to figure out what road I am going to take.
Right now I have all the freedom to do whatever I want. I have enough money to survive for a while since I am still living with my parents ( I was planning on getting something when I got the contract they promised me ). 
Since I am really interested in Blockchain technology, and mainly Ethereum and Solidity, I figured that this was the chance to do some selfstudy, since there aren't any particular studies I can do at any universities here that explicitly focus on these subjects. Hopefully I can someday find myselve a job in one of these topics, but for now my knowledge is too small.
And thus I am going to start doing some selfstudy for a while starting the 11th of September ( next monday ). I have already bougth some books, and will get a lot of information of the internet.

I used to play a lot of poker, and in there I used to be part of some study groups. These groups really helped out a lot, and thus I am planning on starting a group like this on either Skype or discord. Through this post I hope that I can find some people in either the same situation as me who are learning, or people with some more knowledge that like to help out the ones that are just starting.

If there is any interest, please send me a DM with your skype name and i'll add you as soon as possible. If you'd rather be in a discord group, let me know as well.

""I had secured a full time position in *November* of 2016 only to have the position rescinded on May 3rd, 2017. Every single entry level and internship position was eliminated last year with almost no notice. I got lucky and was able to get another opportunity on equally short notice, but it was a terrible, stressful, and highly uncertain situation that I would never wish upon my worst enemy.

Stay away from Tallan. If nothing else, show them that companies can't take actions like that against people without facing consequences.""

Tallan has apparently secured a spot at the Fall Career Fair on the 22nd.

I've struggled anxiety, depression, and (PTSD in college) the majority of my life. I've struggled with issues before college but the past seven years since high school have been a downward spiral. I lost all my self confidence and chopped off my hair. 

I've been happy, fake happy when I graduated college. Fake happy when I got my internship. I still cry daily.

I went through severe agoraphobia and depression last year where I would rarely leave the house after getting rejected from multiple jobs. I had severe anxiety and panic attacks which prompted me to see mental health professionals because I cut off my hair. 

Even though things aren't the best (I'm 25 years old, underemployed, and single) I feel like things are finally looking up. I remember my ex boyfriend compared great things are like a lotus flower, they have to go through all this mud and ugliness until the emerge with their beauty.

I look at my peers on social media and they go through struggles ex: being a single mother, divorce, etc but they seem happier because they brag about their job promotions, etc.

I'll always have my mental illness especially my GAD and PTSD.

I'm still not completely happy but I feel like I'm in a better state compared to the past seven years.

6ynwqr,3,2017-09-07,I have a good job that I am completely bored with. Advice?,Jessiray,entp,https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/6ynwqr/i_have_a_good_job_that_i_am_completely_bored_with/,"Hello all, female entp here. I thought I'd try and reach out to some like-minded people for some advice.

I graduated with a degree in Information Systems in December hoping to do some sort of data analytics work or systems administration. Unfortunately, I found that although I had some academic and internship experiences in these fields, it was very difficult to find a job fresh out of college. So I ended up in a tech support/web development combo gig.

By all accounts, it's a fine gig. I get paid decently (not fantastically, but it's a salary and it's enough to be comfortable), I have my own office, I like my co-workers and get good benefits. This is more than a lot of my classmates can say. The only issue is that I am bored senseless. All day I do simple HTML/CSS/CF/Database tasks and tell people who call not to click the big blue button or how to navigate the technology. Without giving too much away, I work for an academic institution and a lot of the people who need support are older people going back to school. For the most part, I am patient with them, but it can be frustrating to have to explain the same 3-5 simple things over and over and over...

As for the more technical component, it's fine I guess, but it's nothing I couldn't have done fresh out of high school, aside from some of the ColdFusion stuff (which I'm learning on the job anyway). It's a lot of repetitive tasks. My part time in undergrad as a net tech was more challenging and exciting and tbh I miss it dearly. I felt really needed and like I was contributing at my student job, here I feel like there are days where I could just not show up and no one would notice. 

I decided my solution to this was to try and go to grad school and pick up some certs in things like Linux or maybe Cloudera. I'd also entertain project management, but that would probably have to wait until after grad school. But switching jobs is going to be tricky for the next year and a half unless I can find something else at this academic institution - they're paying for my degree so I have put myself in a corner. I have tried kind of broaching the subject with my boss and her solution has been to send me multi media things, which I don't really wanna do either. Unfortunately, there's not a great need for what I want to do with my career in this department. 

Should I just try and sit tight and be content?  What are some ways I can learn to like and be fulfilled in my work? How do I deal with being bored af 8.5 hours a day? Anyone else in a similar situation? "
6yo0x8,7,2017-09-07,Emotionally abusive girlfriend will not let me leave her,a_bit_difficult,abusiverelationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/6yo0x8/emotionally_abusive_girlfriend_will_not_let_me/,"This is going to be a long one, apologies in advance. I just need to get all of this out, because I'm at a point where I don't really know how to go on anymore. I'll include a tl;dr at the bottom.

I started a new relationship this March. While it started out nice, it quickly got extremely toxic.

I think there were indicators of how bad it was going to be before we got together, but for some reason I just ignored them all and just kept on going, I guess I was in love. I don't blame the rockiness of our relationship solely on her; it could perhaps be due to incompatible personalities. Although I don't think I've even had a serious fight with any of my previous girlfriends.

Nevertheless, about a month into our relationship I realised it had to stop, so I tried breaking up with her. The first times I told her she would heavily imply that she would either not do her exams, or just drop out of university if I left her. I shouldn't have let it, but this weighed too heavily on my conscience, so I stayed with her. Meanwhile, the cycle of daily fights and reconciliation would continue. These fights would carry on for hours, sometimes for whole days. I felt completely trapped, I could hardly eat or sleep. Somehow I managed to carry on with my studies and all my other commitments.

This relationship dominated my life in every single way. Sometimes I felt like she was addicted to the relief of reconciling after a fight. My resentment towards her would grow every day, but she would also make it impossible for me to show any signs of it. One horrible aspect of our relationship was that if I did show my dissatisfaction, this would just prompt further fights.

I tried to break up with her one or two more times after the first time. I knew she was being manipulative, but somehow I just couldn't let her ruin her own life over a break-up. But the third time I tried I was at a breaking-point, I simply couldn't go on any longer. This time she pulled out the big guns. When she realised that it wasn't enough to threaten to quit university, she started threatening to attack me directly. She was going to report me to the police, saying that I've sexually abused her. She was going to lie about me to my friends and family. She was going to dedicate herself to ruin my life. Up until this point I don't think I quite understood the extent of her capacity for abuse. I feel like one aspect of the psyche of an abuser is the ability to project and displace culpability entirely on the abused. (*Just to be clear, I have never sexually abused her. After she had calmed down, she actually apologized for saying that.*)

I felt completely incapacitated and robbed of agency when she threatened to do those things. Before this relationship I took rational dialogue for granted, but with her facts carried no weight. When I started pointing out that I felt that she was abusing me emotionally, she started to accuse me of the same in return. This made me extremely confused and at times I wondered whether I somehow was going crazy, and whether I really was the abuser by wanting to leave her.

After the failed third attempt, the cycle continued as normal. This continued throughout exams. I can't begin to describe how utterly stressful this period of my life was. She would pick fights daily. If she felt even the slightest that I was stressed or couldn't pay enough attention to her she would punish me. One way she would control me was by not letting me end a fight. If I tried to stop talking to her, she would keep on calling me. If I persisted in not picking up, she would call my friends and make excuses for them to call me.

Somehow I made it through, and I even managed to do really well in exams.

After the horror of the exam period, I was completely determined to end the relationship. This is when it got even worse. Now she started threatening to commit suicide if I left her. This was always a fear that lingered in the back of my head, and now it had finally come true. Up until this point, I think I've managed to keep myself together fairly well, but after this I broke down completely. Enduring this for months on end had taken such a toll on me, and now after this I started to descend into something really bad.

I was accepted into quite a few internships this summer. I picked to go to one that was on the other side of the world (instead of going to my first choice), just in the hope that her hold on me would not follow me there. It didn't really work. I guess it was silly of me to think that it would solve anything.

If I was a callous asshole, I would have been able to dump her. The worst part of all of this is that she uses my decency to control me. 

I grew up in an abusive home, and I would say I had a very unhappy childhood. Going to university, and thriving in that environment, was a really positive change for me. During the first two years here I think I grew into a very capable and independent person. This wall of strength that I had built around me was starting to break down, and during the summer I've developed the depression that I thought I had overcome a long time ago.

I don't think I quite understand how I've managed to let it come this far. I think about taking my own life every single day now. I know it's not rational. Logically, it doesn't make sense at all. Obviously it's not a solution to anything whatsoever. This relationship has dragged out every single dark thing from my past, and I just feel so worthless and helpless now that I don't really know how to go on anymore. She's seen her own actions step-by-step cause this change in me, and yet she somehow still manages to rationalize her own behavior. Although, I no longer think it's accurate to say that I'm the rational one, and she's the irrational one. We're both out of our minds now.

Just to clarify, I'm not saying that I was a perfect boyfriend in ever way, and that the reason why we fought every day was completely her fault. *Beware, the rest of this paragraph is highly skippable:* I think there's quite a few factors that made our relationship so rocky in the beginning. I'm an extremely ambitious person, the consequence being that I'm quite busy. I think she wanted someone who could pay more attention to her, whilst I think I prefer a girl who's more independent. So I don't necessarily blame her for the rockiness of our relationship. Previously I mentioned that I didn't think she was rational or factual, she would often counter that I wasn't emotional enough. I can imagine that a different kind of person could have dealt with and avoided the fights we had. That's all fair enough. This whole thing has dragged on for so long that I can't say that I've acted in the best way possible all the time. *The real and truly horrible thing that she has done to me is rob me of the possibility to end something that had such a negative effect on both of us.*

One mistake that I made in all of this is to hide every single part of the abuse from any of my friends. I pretended everything was fine, only ever managing to reveal the subtlest hints here and there. I'm quite used to living a double life from my childhood, so it wasn't too difficult to do this.

I keep on trying to retrace my steps towards this moment in my life and see what I could've done differently. I'm not sure how my experiences during childhood has factored into how I dealt with all of this. I get the feeling that this could happen to anyone (which is the truly scary thing), but I also think that my past has also affected how I dealt with this.

I'm just so, so unhappy. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm asking for advice, or for sympathy, although I'll accept either I guess. It feels a bit better to have this all in writing.

tl;dr: I have an abusive girlfriend, who used various threats to force me to stay with her. Eventually she threatened to take her own life if I broke up with her. The sheer intensity and duration of the abuse has left me in a poor mental state, and I'm now struggling with suicidal thoughts of my own."

(Plat 5),huskytimezz,summonerschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/6yoyqw/trying_to_improve_after_a_vacation_help_me_get/,"Hi there, I havent used reddit much, so Please let me know if anything in my post is unclear!
I am Huskytimezz, and this is also my first season in league. I started by climbing to gold 2 playing jungle, and switched to top lane and made plat 5 (top lane swain).
I used to play around 10 games a day during my climb, but now am only playing around 5 due to an internship ( I am in college).
I also recently went on a 2 week vacation. 
Since My vacation the patches and meta have shifted to tanks, and since I used to one trick (graves jungle/ swain top) I feel like my picks have fallen off, as well as I have become rusty. 
I am now playing on a smurf (Gold 5) until I am back in it. 
I am playing 3 champions currently:

-Renekton
-Jarvan IV
-Swain

I feel that I always get a lead in my lane, but then struggle to not DIE. I go from being 3-0 to 3-7,3-5 etc. I have decent macro, so often I am able to still close out games. 

I have a feeling that this shift may be from my switch from ranged to melee champs ( increase in deaths: graves/swain-&gt; J4/Renekton). Or I am playing too aggressively.

Should I continue to stomp my lane when I am winning it?

Should I back off and try to roam more?

Any input helps. If you have any further questions please ask. 

Also I am confused about my builds- Should I build full tank in this meta? or more bruiserish?

Thank you in advance.

6ypd1a,14,2017-09-07,No idea what I'm supposed to do.,sharkbaitherman,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6ypd1a/no_idea_what_im_supposed_to_do/,"Really been struggling lately. I'm 23 M, college graduate still working on finding steady employment in my field.

I've started working 15 hour days between a part time job and a paid internship. The work is not very hard but I just feel constantly overwhelmed and have gotten considerably more anxious and depressed. 

I just feel stuck. I don't really know what to do. There's so many things I want to improve on, like working out and reading more, but it doesn't seem possible when my typical work day is from 7am to 10pm. I have a feeling that the anxiety and depression are mostly due to stress and lack of a decent sleep schedule, but it just seems like when I'm stressed, everything starts going bad. 

Like the girl who i went on a date with last week, who seemed interested and even reached out later that day saying we should hang out when she's back in town, just kind of stopped talking to me the last couple days. And now that I'm recognizing that I'm not in a good place, and try to talk to my friends about it, they blow me off. Like my one friend texted asking if i was still feeling sick (had mentioned I had a sore throat), and when I responded that I was but that also explained how I've been feeling depressed, she didn't respond until after I asked how she was doing, not acknowleding any of what I said (She had read receipts on and there was five minutes between my last text and asking how she was).

I guess I'm mostly just needing to vent. I know that I overthink a lot of things, but it just always seems like when I'm in a bad place I realize I don't have very good friends. But then I just assume that I'm annoying them with trying to talk to someone about my feelings; and I also don't really know how or have much time to go and make new friends. I also have never been in a relationship and have trying to meet someone, but again, with my work schedule, it seems the only way to do that is through things like Tinder and Bumble.

I just don't know what to do to get out of this slump when I won't really have time to focus on myself for the foreseeable future.

Sorry for the rant"
6ypsn4,2,2017-09-07,what's helped me,Monster2the913,Lyme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/6ypsn4/whats_helped_me/,"So it's infuriatingly hard to find stories of people who actually vastly improved/got over their Lyme disease because said people tend to charge you for their story. And then try to sell you stuff. In the interest of combating this, I'll tell you what has worked/is working for me. Feel free to comment with your own experience of what has worked for you, to keep this chain going.

Background: Positive for 1 strand on Western blot, both IgG and IgM. MTHFR 677T homozygous. Positive for high antibodies to both RMSF and Bartonella. Hypothyroid, currently on levothyroxine and liothyronine in ratio of 11 to 1, respectively. Which was a headache and a half to get... but it works well. Main symptoms full-body pain, mental problems. Before doxycycline and minocycline I had maculopapular rash, intermittent fever, nausea, muscle cramps, and no appetite.

1 month doxycycline, 6 months minocycline. Neurological and physical symptoms vastly lowered afterwards, but felt like I was going to die while I was on it. Later all symptoms returned and I had to quit my job.

#1 factor: Found a lyme-literate MD who relies on research, not hearsay or general consensus.
2 months clindamycin, 1 month tindamax - this was helpful.
Recently found an acupuncture/TCM specialist whom I trust, but results will take a while to show up. Thankfully it's at an acupuncture school so the interns have reason to do their best. I am guinea pigging some other stuff on myself right now, will add an update to this post if anything works out.

Herbal regimen:
No gluten because stomach problems. Many delicious cooked green vegetables. Force self to eat 3 square meals a day. TCM doc recommended I eat more congee, so I make white rice congee with a little quinoa for breakfast sometimes.
My fiance found a scientific paper indicating choline is great for Lyme patients, and that egg yolks contain it. I do feel better when I have egg yolk, so yay.
Caprylic acid, NOW brand, as desired for pain. I found out this works about as well as children's chewable tylenol for me, although on bad days I go back to my old method of combining 1/4-1/2 chewable tylenol and 1 Jarrow brand NAC pill, and repeating it once a day.
Whenever I can, I eat pho with tendon and tripe. It helps with pain, oddly enough.
Gelatin snacks. Don't notice a huge difference, but according to my research it's important. Vital Proteins makes gelatin powder that has no huge off-flavor. I like this recipe for them. https://www.mommypotamus.com/homemade-gummy-snacks/
Seriously, lime juice and extra-virgin coconut oil do wonders for how I feel. I like taking 1-2 of these things morning and evening.
https://www.mommypotamus.com/constipation-candy/
L-methylfolate pills, methyl b-complex pills, methyl b-12 pills - in dosage for my body size. Zembrin (sceletium tortuosum) pills for my depression - I take 4 in the morning and 4 in the evening.
Homemade strong soy yogurt helps me a lot, but I haven't figured out how to churn it out consistently and my last 4 batches failed goddammit. Fully intending to make more fermented foods ASAP, like sauerkraut, lacto-fermented dill pickles, kombucha, water kefir, whatever.
Garlic is always a good thing to add, however too much raw and you get stomach ulcers. I therefore add as much as I can to my cooked food, and if I have some raw, I restrict myself to 3 grated cloves daily, maybe in some tomato juice.

I developed a couple of foods to mimic the nutrients in intravenous Myer's Cocktail.
Salad
1/2 c. raspberries
2 kiwis
Juice of 1-2 lemons
1/2 chopped cucumber
1 chopped green bell pepper
1/2 c. chopped cilantro
1/2 c. chopped bok choi
1/2 chopped mango

Soup
Simmer together:
5 c. Chicken stock
5 dried shiitake mushrooms, reconstituted
1 spoon brown rice
1 portion of wild-caught fish
Handful chopped bok choi
Handful chopped leek
Simmer for 50 minutes, add ripped-up nori and a beaten egg, stir and serve

I'll keep this short but wanted to mention that I'm extremely passionate about public transportation and planning. Everything relating to it appeals to me and I often find myself reading a lot about transportation or just looking up maps and seeing how cities move with their given resources.

So my question is, how can I turn this into a career in the city? I'd love to intern for TTC, Metrolinx or the city but don't think I'm well enough qualified for that.


Currently, I'm in school (UofT) for stat/econ. I don't think the path I'm on right now will lead me to it, so I'm wondering if anyone here could give me some advice. I know this is the wrong subreddit but might as well try.

I am currently working on my masters degree to get licensed I am doing a 4+2 plan while also working 30+ a week at my current firm doing work way above my level and pay grade as an intern architect and I love it. I love the role I play in millions of dollars of construction and the intensity of a large office 3 days a week. While on the other hand I am building chip board models until the wee hours of the night for studio surrounded by 2nd year MArch III students with a non architecture undergrad degree who want to bitch and nitpick at my models when they don't know the difference between a demising wall and a shear wall. (Sorry if that sounded snarky.)

In undergrad it was fun and exciting working on a cool concept and rotating my render every which way to Sunday to fill my boards with life and now it just feels like a chore. I was one of the best in my undergrad program in terms of grades/ graphic design/ and overall skill set if you will but now I do not see the point in it. My work experience got me my first job out of college and I feel like my experience and license will get me the next after this, not how many models I laser cut or how many hours I spent on a render. 

I actually enjoy my environmental class and structural class more than studio because I am actually learning/refreshing the tools I use everyday.  

Sorry if that was huge rant and sounded whiny but I can't be the only one to ever experience this. What do I do? Read more? Spend more time on design? Make more models? Sketch every day?

6yr173,1,2017-09-07,Need an advice on improving communication skills,uQwerks,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6yr173/need_an_advice_on_improving_communication_skills/,"I've been becoming manic over the start of my software development internship this week due to my inability to communicate clearly and am looking for advices.

I feel like anything I say to my tech team comes out as jumbled garbage, and this feeling is validated when they always seem to misinterpret my intention behind the stuff I say and as they talk less frequently and distantly to me.

For backgrounds, I moved from Korea 10 years ago as a kid and I feel this is the most prominent cause of my frustration. I'm thinking that my inability to communicate properly is because of the fact that English is my second language, but my Korean sounds just as incoherent as my English is so I'm not too sure.

Another thing I'm thinking is because of my inability to speak coherently in my daily life when I moved over, my ability to communicate wasn't developed properly while I was growing up, and I'm guessing this is why I'm struggling with talking about anything.

I get near perfect grades and have been able to get by ok, but I'm unable to make friends (because I don't make sense when I talk to people), lost most of the friends that I've had, and my mental condition's been getting worse and worse as time goes by because of the anxiety, self-hatred, and loneliness.

I'd like to vent more, but I thought it'd be more productive if I could get some advices or observations. At the least, I'd like someone to tell me whether this post made coherent sense so that I could know whether my thinking process is messed up as well.

Thanks."

I should have an internship this winter. I received 5000 from my university as a grant that is supposed to last for two semesters. I also qualify for a 5000 subsidized student loan. I have no debt thanks to a college fund set up by my uncle but it has run out. Tuition for this semester was about 3500 for me. I have 1500 left from the grant and can take out the 5000 loan. I also only have one semester left after this one where I will then have my computer science Bachelor's. 

As for my living situation I had to move back in with my Mom and Step Dad after ending a long-term relationship. My home life right now is terrible. I am constantly criticized for small meaningless things. I also never know when I will be cussed out for something incredibly minor. I have no freedom and its making me horribly depressed. Sometimes I wonder if my step dad will kick me out randomly. I am really only home to sleep as I've been working all my free hours to try to move out but I have a curfew of 930. I also miss my dog who is still with my ex since I'm not allowed to have him here.  

My plan was to buy a nice trailer to live in. I am able to put it on a fenced in private piece of land with power and water while only having to pay the difference in power. It would also put me a lot closer to my University.  I want to pull out 3000 to bump up my budget for a trailer to 9000 about and get a newer one that is more likely to not have issues. Is this an okay plan? Am I even able to get a loan? Due to my ex my credit score dropped from 720 to 640(slowly rising back up)  Would I be able to get approved for anything? I feel like if I buy a cheaper older trailer there would be issues and I wouldn't be able to afford repairs. Is there a certain kind of loan I should be looking for?

Thank you for any advice."

Minnie is usually slow and it isn't unusual for her to be in a confused daze. She can also be lazy, but can be easily motivated with free food, particularly milk tea. If it doesn't interest her, she doesn't particularly mind anything. Though for things such as work, she is able to look and act focused and competent. 

 **Bio**:


Originally from Cali, Minnie is currently attending NYU as a business undergraduate. She interns at Ono, a company that specializes in VR hardware. She has two sister. The elder is ten years older while the younger is only two years apart. She was never close to either unfortunately, but still looks up to the eldest. 

Minnie joined Elysium because it was a popular trend in the early days. Chatting and making friends was fun, but what really drew her in was the avatar dress system. Not having much money, she’d enter many contests and giveaways in order to accumulate some clothes, which she would then sell to others in the user market. Once she accumulated a meager sum of money, she’d include buying items marked up cheap or even haggle lower prices to sell for more later. Of course, she’d occasionally keep or even buy some things for herself. But for the most part, it was all about buying low, selling high. Over months and years, she’d accumulate a large amount of costumes, clothes, limited edition items, and funds. Minnie particularly enjoys collecting rare or silly costumes and will often go out of her way at the news of new releases to get her hands on one. Her favorite is a giant pickle costume which was popular during the Pickle Raids. 

Minnie may or may not have side accounts where she ran her side business and as extra storage space. Though because of school and work, she may or may not rarely go onto these side accounts anymore and now hosts her own giveaways and contests in order to clear up the sheer surplus. Lately, she’s been mostly using Elysium for work and chatting. If she ever did want anything new nowadays, she could easily just sell something of hers and buy it or just use her own money. 

It was fair season, and Minnie was especially excited for this one. The tenth anniversary usually meant there’d probably be some exclusives. She did sign up for the lottery, but didn’t need to in the end. The company she worked at had many new lines to showcase at the fair and were particularly close to the Olympus Corporation. They had many, many invitations available that even a low intern like Minnie could get one. 

 **Additional Notes**:

Most of her personal collection is worthless. "

*SEPTEMBER 7TH*

##PART ONE

...What they found when they stepped through the door was not just a fulcrum upon which the battle could be won or lost, it was a shocking revelation that Solstice Inc. was a lie.

The team of Insurrectionists gazed in awe into the massive chamber into which they had stepped. The room was massive, but that was the least shocking detail about it. Lining the walls were stacks upon stacks of missiles and other ballistic weaponry. They began to look around the room, and were alarmed when they noticed a familiar symbol on the casings.

What they had discovered was a stockpile of nuclear weaponry. They took out their phones and began to snap pictures of what they had found, but were unable to send them to anyone due to the lack of reception. Who knew how far underground they were? They knew that they were never meant to find this, but it provided them with more questions than answers. Regardless, it became clear that Solstice Inc. was not just a tech company. It was a front for something much, much bigger than that. They finished their sweep of the room and made their way back to the door. It was locked. Suddenly, a voice rang out, reverberating through the gigantic room.

“I’m afraid I can’t let you leave…”

##PART TWO

Meanwhile, the fighting continued back in the main portion of the building, without any idea of what had just been discovered down below. Trust was wearing thin amongst everyone. Unfortunately, the  Employee of the Month campaign that had started before the conflict broke out went horrifically wrong, and as a result /u/Mathy16 met his end. His body was found duct taped to a wall and covered in staples. Whether this had anything to do with the conflict, or simply overly competitive candidates for the coveted title remained to be seen. In a separate incident, /u/ReptileGaming joined those who were shot out of a cannon.

Even with these casualties, nobody seemed to bat an eye. The employees had become desensitized to death. Their souls grew more and more calloused with every passing moment, and every drop of blood that was shed.

*All text is for flavor only.*

/u/Mathy16 has been killed by the lynch. Their role was INTERN.

#IMPORTANT META

The phases from September 6th - September 9th will end ONE HOUR EARLY. They will close at 9pm ~~EDT~~ Toronto Time. The new phases will be up within two hours of the posts locking, as promised in the rules post, but hopefully much sooner. The countdown clocks have been adjusted to reflect this. We are sorry for any inconvenience.

___

#ADDITIONAL META

It has been brought to our attention that some people did not understand our edit yesterday. Typically we have only been revealing the role of a person, not the role subset, therefore yesterday’s deaths had several people who should have been listed as simply “intern.” This mistake was not caught until the phase had been posted publicly and, knowing that someone would have likely already seen it, we did not want to change it as that would give whomever had already saw it more information than everyone else. We do not intend to reveal what type of intern someone is when they die in the future.

They stated that they require UNIX experience.  

I have experience with Linux but have not used Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.

I doubt that Facebook uses any UNIX system other than Linux and FreeBSD.  Moreover the recruiter gave no indication that actual high level expertise working on Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc. is required, and I suspect that if they did require such experience they would ask for experience with a specific UNIX system rather than with UNIX.  

Is it a lie to say that I have experience with UNIX (rather than ""Linux"" or ""Unix-like systems"") given that the term UNIX is trademarked and no Linux or BSD operating systems have the right to use it?  "

I just can't carve out time to practice Leetcode/CTCI because schoolwork is giving me enough trouble as is and I'm just not doing well from a mental health perspective.  I'm going to all my classes and getting all my work in school done and completed a 40 hr./week internship this past summer with good reviews (sadly don't have a return offer though) despite my issues, but I'm just too drained to do anything else outside of that.

(Bonus points if you don't have to know anything about web development.  I have a single internship in computer vision, but the vast majority of employers really don't seem to care, they only seem to care about my knowledge of web technologies.)

I was under the impression that Fidelity was one such company not requiring technical interviews, although this impression may be wrong.  And besides, there may be others...Thanks!"
6ysgol,2,2017-09-08,Which College in the GTA (including Kitchener/Waterloo) is good for Computer Programming?,douglasbryan94,ontario,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/6ysgol/which_college_in_the_gta_including/,"Hey guys,

I'm a graduate from Conestoga College in Kitchener, where I studied IT Support.

I'm looking at going back to College for Computer Programming, then transferring to University to get the Computer Science degree.

I'm unsure of what College(s) are well known/respected in the Computer Programming field.

I currently live in Guelph, and I don't mind doing a bit of driving or taking the Train.

At first Conestoga was forefront in my mind due to the fact it's a 30 minute drive from home and I would get all the workplace preparation courses written off due to the fact I have taken them already (I am 23 years old and have had 3 student internships, my professional experience should outway most things when it comes to workplace prep courses).

I was very interested in going to Seneca College because of the city and because I figured the opportunities in Toronto would be more obvious and available then in Kitchener, but I noticed that most of the entire first semestrr is filled with college prep and workplace prep courses. I got in contact with the school and applied for a transfer credit for one of them – to which they replied granting me a credit for a course that isn't even listed in the curriculum.

Are there any College's that are well known for their quality of education in the Computer Programming field?"

I didn't confront my dad because he didn't respond to the original email (below) and I also didn't want to deal with him. Prior to this happening, I sent them this over Facebook to their individual Facebook pages since they don't use email: 

""I have to tell you the truth. I have still been dating the guy that you didn’t approve of, (Name), for nearly 1.5 years. I want you to know that he asked me to marry him a few times during the 1.5 years of dating but I always said no because I told him that you wouldn’t like him because he isn’t Turkish. So after I shared about him with you last year and you didn’t want to listen to me talk about him I told him about it. I kept thinking about it, you guys and him, and I wanted to let you know that he asked me to marry him again. He came down this past Thursday and asked me to marry him. This time I said Yes! When I return from the internship with a good job hopefully, I will be moving in with him, after I return in three weeks. If you want to meet us then you can but if you don’t want to meet him then that is up to you but I have made up my mind. I hope to still have a relationship with my family and I hope you do too. 

I am your daughter and I love you but I have grown up and found someone that I trust. He might not be someone you expected but he is a good man. He has many great qualities. He has many qualities that remind of both you, mom and dad. I hope you will accept us. I know this isn’t the best way to tell you but I don’t want to argue. I want us to speak peacefully. 

I hope to see you guys soon. I hope you introduce you to my fiancé.""

Clarification:
-I didn't attend an internship at Google. It was the cover I used to leave my parent's home to move in with my boyfriend.
-My boyfriend isn't my fiance even though he did ask me to marry him casually many times. Neither one of us is ready for that yet. Instead, I used this as a cover because I thought that if my parents ever wanted to connect with us down the road that maybe telling them we are engaged would make things easier for everyone. I say this because my parents come from a traditional background so I didn't want to alienate them.

Continuation...

Going back to that parking lot I confronted my mother by stepping out of my boyfriend's car which we parked right next to her car. She started crying, she told me that she loves and that she missed me. However, she looked a bit aggressive, her hand was next to her face. I think it took a lot for her not to strike me or something like that. She has never really been abusive but she looked infuriated. She then calmed down but she was distant. She didn't return my hugs and she didn't try to reach out to me.

the most significant things she said after translation...
-You ruined everything

-You will regret this (decision)

-You know that I cried last night 

-I want you home

-I don't want to talk to you or your father

-I told her that my father sent this creepy image with zombie like parents with a daughter including captions over a facebook message from a new account that my father started which she knew nothing about. 

It read:""no one will ever think about your well being more than your father and no one will love you like your mother.
Which my mom replied with, ""He is right. There isn't anything wrong with what it said. Don't you think so?""

Currently, neither one of them has contacted me. The last time I sent a message over Facebook, it wasn't read until a day or two later, one of them (mother or father) replied Never. The question I asked was when do you want to meet up, Saturday or Sunday? I asked this before I went to see my mom after work because I was hoping they would both show up. Also, my younger brother also blocked me on Facebook even though we weren't even friends on Facebook.

How do I feel?

I feel numb. I am starting to see my mom for what she is. She is settled and doesn't intend to change things with herself or her husband. She would rather protect him than protect her own child. They cut me out of their lives and I have to accept it. I used to think that she was a victim, the enabler, or something. Now, I see that she might have been a covert narcissist all this time or something.

An aside...

It is sad but I was watching a new series on investigation discovery while I was typing this. The show: Kiss of Death Season 1 Episode 3. Watching this episode was like watching someone who was living my life. Also, my father is a functioning alcoholic. You wouldn't think he was an alcoholic until you lived with him. Also, my father doesn't use a belt, he uses his own fists/hands to cause abuse or a broomstick. I hope the same thing happens to my parents."
6yspnc,4,2017-09-08,Confused Crush on Closeted Friend,NeedAdviceForACrush,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6yspnc/confused_crush_on_closeted_friend/,"Here is a little background, I have a friend that I've known since High School, let's call him A. So A and I have always hung out in the same social circle but have never hung out one on one, only in groups. In High School, A dated plenty of girls but they always ended quite quickly. People always questioned if he was bi or gay due to his mannerisms, but he was quick to dismiss these accusations. I had the biggest crush on A in High School, and this fucking sucked because I thought he was straight. A grew up in a family that is wealthy, privileged, and full of high expectations. 

Fast forward 3 years and I have barley talked to A. We attend the same college but are studying different majors so we never see each-other. We only see each-other at the occasional high school re-union party. My feelings for A have subsided and are almost completely gone.

As I am on my internship outside of our city, I receive a text out of the blue. It is from A telling me that he misses me and would like to know if I am going to a mutual friends birthday back home. I tell him that I am and we continue to text. At the mutual friends birthday, I see him and we get very drunk. A eventually tells me that he is bi, but is scared to come out due to his parents and friends. As the night continues, he grabs my ass and holds my hand. Obviously my feelings for A come back in full fucking force because of what I have just learned. I actually had a chance to be with my ""straight"" high school crush. He texts me the next morning that ""he was so glad to see me last night"" (with red emoji hearts). 

We continue to text and eventually discover that we will see each-other again at another party. I get excited as I'm hoping he will kiss me at this party. But all that fucking happens is him kissing me on the cheek and telling me that ""it's funny that no one knows"". What the fuck does that even mean? Knows about us? Or knows about him? Again, later that night he texts me that ""he was happy to see me"".

Now we have both returned to school and we still text and snapchat daily but it's become so dry. I asked him to get lunch but he stated that he was busy so I waited for him to re-schedule but he never did. I just feel like an opportunity is slipping right through my hands. 

I'm so confused about as if he even likes me or not. And even if he did, would he ever even make a big move on me? Or would he be too scared because he is still deep in the closet and not coming out anytime soon? Or maybe he is afraid to ruin our friendship? Honestly, I am so hurt from this roller-coaster ride of emotions. At this point, I don't know how to move what we have into the next stage (if we even have anything?). A and I have made it so far from what we were in High School and I really want this to work. But I feel like this is just a sinking ship.

Any advice?"

I finally finished up my junior summer internship which is the last job where I plan on presenting male (although I started wearing some subtle women's tops by the end and had painted nails throughout most of it).

At the moment my plan for the future is to push forward with socially transitioning this year (grow out my hair, finish flipping my closet to all female clothing, etc.) and by the time I graduate and start interviewing in May to present femme and begin HRT as soon as I start working and am off my parents healthcare plan/am financially independent (still not sure if I'm going to come out to them before starting HRT).

Do any of you have experience transitioning at the beginning of your career? Any advice? Am I making a mistake? Should I hold off for a couple years until I'm more established? This whole timeline seems super easy in my head but I'm also aware that I may just be overly optimistic. Planning on working as a computer scientist/software engineer if that matters."

6yu2ki,2,2017-09-08,"Me [26 M] with my Girlfriend [23 F] of 3 Years, She moved away/travelling but says she still loves me",game_review,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6yu2ki/me_26_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_3_years_she/,"Hello people,

I have read many posts of people in similar situations, but I feel I need more eyes on mine. To give some perspective, it is now September and this originated back in April.

My GF (now ex) and I were together for nearly 3 years, I am 26 and she is 23, our relationship was so strong and she was the absolute apple of my eye. In April she decided she wanted to do a 2 month internship in China, I accepted this as she always hinted that she wanted to work abroad/travel and it was only 8-10 weeks which I could stand without her.

When she left, it was as if we were still together, we spoke often if not everyday and we were talking about plans after she returned. A month in, she was offered a full-time job and said she going to take it, as she didn't want to regret any decision she would make, at this time in her life.

This completely broke me... I was furious and emotionally unstable and after a very long-winded conversation on the phone I just concluded with ""why didn't you just break up with me before you left"" to which she replied ""well lets just break up then"". It seemed her decision was made so I stopped contacting her.

A few months passed and I found out (through social media) that she decided not to take the job, and was travelling around Asia. I had received a few messages over this time along the lines of ""I always thought I would be here with you"" and ""I miss you very much after all these months"" - all of which I was so pleased to receive, but I responded with a message saying she knows how I feel about her (I'm still so in love with her) but stated that I had respected her decision and needed space to move on.

It was her birthday the other day so I messaged saying Happy Birthday to which I got a response that opened up a short dialogue and phone conversation where she said that she still loved me more than she ever loved anyone, that I was the biggest love of her life and she was so sorry for everything and being selfish and going travelling. She also said that she had not slept with anyone else, which I found hard to believe but she seemed very sincere. To me, that was everything I wanted to hear - and it sparked emotions that I had spent so long trying to remove and get over, and it gave me some sort of false hope that she would want to come back to me.

A few days later I then received a message saying she was in Sydney and was going to stay in Australia for at least another year.

I am now back where I started - upset, angry, alone. I have not responded and I am thinking of just blocking her off everything and completely shutting her out of my life. Because any communication I've had with her since she left has only led to me breaking down.

Was it selfish of her to say all of the things she did (about how much she loves me) to then turn around and say that she's staying away?

Why would she even say that if she doesn't want to come home and be with me?

Although it has been 6 months since I saw her face, I am finding it so hard to let go of her and now that she's in Australia indefinitely, she is most likely going to move on and meet someone else - which I just cannot handle.

My head is all over the fucking place and although the idea of being single is not the worst thing in the world, I'm struggling to move on. We never really broke up properly (just over the phone) and I have not had any explanation as to what was wrong with our relationship - though I have been told it may not have been anything and it's just a time in her life that she needs to travel/see the world.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation that has any advice?
Any help is greatly appreciated (sorry for the essay).

I should have nothing to complain about. But I feel like I'm running circles my whole life. And it's my fault because I resort to avoidance and procrastination.

I'm doing well in university but I don't do more than necesserary. I'm not even sure I want to do something with IT. I once wanted to become a game dev but not even sure about that anymore. I just don't feel that passion.

I'm kind of scared of real life. I'm somewhat social anxious. I tend to withdraw. I'm anxious about the future. My parents are very nice, but maybe were a little too caring. 
I life in Berlin but barely go out. I life here for years in the same 1-room-apartement. I visit my parents often. 

I cope my anxiety with playing games and porn. 

I had a girlfriend once, the last couple of years, she was nice and sweet, but it ended, mostly because I didnt know what I wanted. 
I wasn't sure about my feelings, I wasn't sure if I find sexually attractive (I often thought I'm just fucked up by porn).  I felt and feel often terrible for being a superficial asshole.
I'm kind of relieved it's over, because the on-and-off we had was stressful, but I also feel alone. 
And I cope with that with my typical avoidance mechanisms.

Somehow I finally want to start with life. Doing an internship, a job or something. But I don't really know where to start or what I really want. The possibilities are endless, that makes me anxiuos. I like being free, but can't handle it. 

I visiting a therapist. I says I should start doing something instead of overthinking. He wants me to look for job or interships, but where to start when I don't really know what I want?

Life seems too much for me. One the hand I just want to withdraw and hide , and the other hand I don't want to miss something.

My head is dizzy, I have moments where I just want to cry and time goes on mercilessly."

6yvgd6,4,2017-09-08,University for computer science or not?,Markplsk,digitalnomad,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/6yvgd6/university_for_computer_science_or_not/,"Hey guys,


I want to get into the digital nomad lifestyle eventually in the IT field. Im in my last year of highschool and im working on the side on developing apps.


Now from what ive read, getting a degree in computer science/software eng is actually not the most efficient or even smartest way to get into the IT field, and you can also do coding bootcamps and get working way quicker than if you would get a degree.


I was wondering if this is still the case if university will be almost debt free (i live in Europe and in my country uni is free if you speak the language) and most companies that are based here still value degrees a lot, of course combined with good internships and maybe some personal projects. 

So if I ever do want to stay in a place somewhere around here my degree would be very helpful, even though the main goal is to live independent of location. 


I still have a year of highschool to decide and im 100 percent sure that IT is what i want to do in the future, im just not 100 percent sure how to go about it.

Any feedback is much appreciated!"
6yvq55,94,2017-09-08,How can I learn to enjoy socializing?,NEET_Here,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/6yvq55/how_can_i_learn_to_enjoy_socializing/,"I had a pretty shitty childhood/teenage years and spent a lot of my time alone and isolated. Dropped out of college right after high school and got addicted to video games. In my early 20s started to focus on self improvement and my main goal since then has been to get my degree, get shredded and strong, and get laid consistently. 

So far I've gotten my A.S. in computer science, and also in math. I'm graduating with my B.S. in Computer Science &amp; Engineering next May. I've got a good GPA, 2 internships under my belt with a job lined up, a solid network of connections, and am financially independent (minus the govt for student loans). My career is basically set up, I just need to continue grinding and studying. 

Lost 140 lbs so far as well, and am pretty fit (squat: 275x10, deadlift:495x3, bench:225x8, 15 pull ups, ~7 min mile) at about 14-15% bodyfat. Been consistently tracking my macros and maintaining strength, and am on course to 10% BF within 2-3 months. I've got this down and have made it a habit. I want to be 10% by the time I graduate and maintain it. 

Basically, since I've decided to focus on self improvement I kind of stayed isolated and put socializing on the back burner with the excuse that I'm an introvert and I prefer being alone. I've been feeling really anxious lately and it's coming from the fact that I want to start enjoying socializing and talking to people. At the moment it takes me a lot of effort to even try and while I do have a sense of humour, I consistently hear people complain a lot and it irks me because in my head I want to say something. I don't know how to turn off the disciplined side of me to enjoy have a good time since I've rarely done that. My life is consumed by eat, sleep, study, train, repeat. 

I honestly want to be able to go out and enjoy dancing, talking and be able to make people laugh and laugh with them. I want to be able to meet beautiful women and have sex with them. I want to be able to have a good group of bros that I can have a good time with. I want to be able to enjoy a drink and have good conversation at a bar. 

Like anything else, I know getting good and enjoying anything just takes time, exposure and consistency. Basically build the habits that will enable me to do it. So I want to start now before I graduate. I've tried socializing with the college students at my school, but the mentality most students have is so different from mine that I just can't relate. I rarely get a chance to spend time with people my age, so I think I have to go out and find people. 

Thanks!"
6yvty4,2,2017-09-08,"[Support/Advice] Leaving home - German RBN experiences would be great, others also welcome to help",rbnthrowawaygermany,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6yvty4/supportadvice_leaving_home_german_rbn_experiences/,"Hello, this is a throwaway because I don't want all these details on my main account, but I feel like I need to include the details to get proper help. 

**I will maybe ask some other subreddits some parts of questions (especially legaladvice), but I really wanted RBN to be the first address because of getting experiences and recommendations from people that know the context of abuse.
**

I've looked through the wiki and other helpful links, I've searched the subreddit with keywords, and already found a lot of helpful stuff. Now I'm curious about some perspectives, opinions and advice of people who know about leaving home in an abusive situation in Germany or even did it themselves, and others. Much of the internet and here is very US centric, and it would be great to hear about alternatives I may not have yet thought about or heard of, also from other people not necessarily familiar with Germany.

The problem is, I'm a 21 year old student at a university, with a sidejob that is tied to me being a student (Werksstudent). The degree was more an attempt to create more time to find an alternative, something I really wanted, and getting out. University itself is pretty triggering and bad for me, so I'm looking to stop, but that would also stop my sidejob - which is means for money to move out. But at least contuinuing the degree itself is not a priority.

I have attempted getting student aid similar to FAFSA (BaföG), but both my parents have earned 'too much' in the past (even when one of them doesn't anymore and doesn't even live with me and my mother; they count back to 3 years, and don't care that maybe your parents don't wanna give you some of their money.. and they already decide you already earn too much when you're almost too poor, lmao) that it came back with me getting no money. Certainly also because I live at home atm, but I'm looking to move out now, and I can't imagine getting more than 70 Euro out of BaFög, which isn't enough help to get me out. 

The sidejob is on an hourly basis and often enough, there isn't enough work coming in for me to work, so they call me and tell me to come the next day instead. That results in a monthly income of only 280-350 Euro usually. I also have to stay under 450 Euro for now, because earning over that would result in punishment from the health insurance from my mum I'm still on, because they prohibit earning 450+ monthly, I'd have to get my own for that.

I could try living support (Wohngeld), but I can't get that as long as I would be eligible for BaFöG - even when it amounts to 0 money from BaFöG, the only way I will get denied from it is for special rules that don't apply to me. 
I'm currently looking into a social housing certificate (Wohnberechtigungsschein) to get access to cheaper, state funded flats.
I have about 2k in savings, but also a dog to take care of, which makes shared flats (Wohngemeinschaften) difficult.

I don't really know how to escape, or what to do, or in which order. 
Uni enables me to have a job, but only offers BaFöG and they are far too focused on what the parents make to really accomodate someone who has to flee their parents, or doesn't have access to the parents' money. My parents don't want to help me, at all. I'm NC with my dad, and the rest of the family because they're also N's or enablers and flying monkeys. My mother has researched and presented me that she won't give a cent to me moving out because she legally doesn't have to - because she's living in Uni distance, and she'd only have to pay if I was forced to move out due to being near my education. She's my main abuser my entire life, and the person I'm dependent on, and it's getting worse and worse.

If I quit Uni, it will be hell here at home. She already told me what a loser I am and how horrible everything will be, and my plan to have a job to move out before I watch out for other things really brought out the horrible monster in her that wanted to bring me down and discourage me. I also don't know if it's that great to have an unfinished uni degree on my CV. I'll also lose my job, and my health insurance, and we'll lose child support and all that and won't be able to pay rent anymore. Then there's the question of what will happen with the dog. But I could do a proper job, earn enough for a shared flat (but this would mean to leave the dog behind and she abuses him and I don't want him to go back to the shelter) and be eligible for Wohngeld.

I can't try to find internships anymore since they usually start around this time of the year, so I'd have to wait another year here and try to find something for next year Sept/Oct. and I just can't do this.
Should I get a different job, quit uni, move out, use the certificate (Wohnberechtigungsschein) and possibly living support (Wohngeld) I would then get because I'm not a student anymore?
Any other ideas? I'm also very open to living alternatives, shelters, initiatives like students living with old people and helping them in return. Anything to get me out and let me get a clear head to figure out what to do next - for what it helps, I am working on 3D modeling since 2 years, am currently working myself into 3D Printing and would love to do something with designing parts to be 3D printed as a job, basically a company that offers design and print of a part to customers
. 

So, aside from all that info in general: Any germans here, what did you do to get out and what services did you use? 

Also, for moving out itself, I've already read up about post forwarding, about telling the registration office to not give out my information, etc. But I'm wondering about what other precautions are good to take in Germany. For example, does anyone here have experience in what you can do to avoid getting asked to pay for elderly care in a home for the NParent you had NC with for years? Or what if they rack up debts and die, how can I protect myself not to have to pay them off? Any legal protections that would be important to have, in your experience?  

This is so much, I'm so sorry, I'll try to clarify things if anything isn't clear.
I'm just trying to find a path out, and it's confusing and difficult and I can't believe its just easier to stay and die because of your abusers than to get out in a proper way that isn't super anxiety inducing and full of certificates and applications and luck. "
6ywh94,2,2017-09-08,So....Hi there!,StellaRose5335,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6ywh94/sohi_there/,"Just a quick note to introduce myself.  I'm one of those people who could eat anything I wanted and not gain weight.  That all ended when I turned 25.  I don't know if it was the natural slowing of my metabolism or the fact that I had all but quit playing the sports that I had loved up until then.  It wasn't the greatest time in my life.  Things got a little better after I divorced my first husband.  I moved home, and while I found it very difficult to lose weight living at my parents' house, I lost 30ish pounds while doing an internship and living on my own the next summer.  After the internship ended, I came home and started dating my current husband.  I slowly gained the weight back.  You know how it goes.  Going to the gym suddenly seems less important than hanging out watching movies and eating good, but calorie-rich, food.  Or going out for drinks.  That went on for a few years and then I got pregnant and used it as an excuse to EAT ALL THE THINGS.  I gained waaaaay too much weight while I was pregnant.  And I was one of those unlucky women for whom nursing wasn't the magic cure for pregnancy weight.  For the first 6 months, I was scared that if I ate less then my milk production would suffer (which was crap, if anything I had an oversupply).  Finally, when the kidlet was two, I decided to get back in shape.  I lost 65-70 lbs in 9 months.  I was at my happy weight, the weight I'd been in college, for about 5 minutes.  Then I got lazy.  I started running and thought that meant I could quit counting calories.  In the last year and a half I've put back on about 50 of the pounds I lost.  I know what I need to do, I've just had a motivation problem.  But it really hit home with me when I tried to apply for life insurance last week.  Losing just 20 lbs would put me into a bracket that would pay $20 a month less for the next 20-30 years.  Plus, I have a trip to Honduras booked for next year, and I really need to be able to fit into my wetsuit for it.  And that's not happening right now.  "

The ambitious one, the one who fights for what he wants, the one who comes out on top (no pun intended). I was top of my class in high school. I was the student body president in college. After I graduated, I immediately got an internship at a Fortune 500 company. Since then, I've been doing whatever I can to stay in the eye of the higher-ups. Imagine my surprise when I heard of the position that just opened up; an executive's assistant. That meant a nice office, a company car, and nearly six figures. Imagine how much more surprised I was when my boss told me I was being considered. All that before I was 24 years old. The only thing I had to do was nail that interview. Or so I thought. Mr. Jenkins sprung something on me at the last minute.
""I want you to take my daughter out."" He said.
""I'm sorry sir?"" I asked.
""You remember my daughter, right?""
Of course I did; loud, fat, rude and obnoxious. She had come to the Christmas party earlier that year and had spent the night trying to flirt with me. She must've mentioned me to her dad.
""Of course I do sir.""
""Well,"" he sighed ""she's just so lonely. She's such a sensitive girl, you know. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, I just want you to help get her confidence up. Just take her out, just for one night.""
Mr. Jenkins was a nice guy. I seriously believe that he has the best of intentions, but I can't say the same about his daughter.
He spoke up again. ""I'd consider it a favor, and favors go a long way in this business.""
My dream job flashed before my eyes. Fine, if that's what it takes, one date couldn't be that bad, right?
So that's how I ended up here, knocking on her door, waiting for my boss' daughter to come out so I can show her a good time. I hope this is worth it.
_______________________________________________________

Hello Dirtypenpals! This one is pretty simple; I'm looking for a partner to roleplay with me. I will be playing a young, ambitious businessman trying to get ahead, whose boss has talked him into dating his daughter (you). The only problem is, his daughter is the worst. She's fat, ugly, loud and rude, but unfortunately she's taken a liking to me, and has figured out a way to manipulate her father to get to me. That's where the real fun begins. You realize how much power you have, and you try to push it as far as you can. How much can you control me with the threat of not getting this promotion looming over my head? What'll happen if I don't show you a good time? I'm really into being manipulated and forced into sex, so let's see how far you can get! Limits are gore, blood, toilet stuff and pegging type situations.

The roleplay starts with me picking you up for our date. We can either get to know each other a little first, or feel free to just start!"
6yxf0a,52,2017-09-08,Death by Being Undocumented,USofDACA,DACA,https://www.reddit.com/r/DACA/comments/6yxf0a/death_by_being_undocumented/,"I have a friend who committed suicide, rejected by a country he loved, in fear of deportation to a place he never really knew. No one is “illegal.” They are “undocumented.” You can’t be against abortion, yet deny someone their right to exist.



I am a DACA recipient. I am in my 20s, have a college education, and work in an international financial services firm. I donate both my time and money to the benefit of the community. I do not live in a sheltered one-race community and never have.
I am an American. English is my main language. I’m sure you and I could go and a crack a cold one with the boys. Like you, I pay taxes. So very much in taxes, that it makes me cry a little when I see my paystub. Yet, I have never called the police, the fire department, or emergency medical services. I have never applied for welfare, financial aid, unemployment, or social security. I have paid much more in taxes than any of my friends my age, possibly even combined. I have never cheated on my taxes like some who work service positions and hide their tips (and sometimes, these are the very same people who complain about welfare recipients or “illegal” immigrants supposedly dodging taxes). Yet, I am fine with paying taxes because every cent of tax I pay tells me that I have been fortunate enough to make multiple cents and that despite highly publicized cases of welfare fraud and the like, that some of my taxes are going to help those in need, which in turn helps the economy (welfare has one of the highest ROI for government programs, ~1.60 per dollar spent).



My parents came to the US seeking better opportunity, escaping a country of political instability. Our family was decently well-off and wanted for nothing there, but the future was in the U.S., promising better educational opportunities for their offspring. Also they paid taxes… through a TAX ID number (this is not an SSN)- roughly ~$11 billion dollars annually is paid by the undocumented. Please stop using this argument because undocumented immigrants are paying much more into the government than they could ever hope to draw out.



I came to the US at a very young age. Through great effort, natural talent, and a hefty dose of luck, I applied myself and met with success. But my legal status would follow me. I would get nominated for awards and be unable to accept. I’d decline special recommendations that would leave teachers scratching their heads. I’d pass county, city, state, and national exams, just to step back into shadows when I was to represent the US internationally. I’d get accepted into all my dream schools, but have to decline with an empty FAFSA. When I tried to serve my country, I was once again turned away. Throughout my entire time in college, I faced rejection over and over from internships because I could neither mark US citizen nor green card holder. At last, I still graduated with high marks. Where do I go from here with no work experience and limited job opportunity? I put my dreams of higher education, another delaying tactic, aside because you cannot be accepted to the bar association when undocumented.



So I worked. For low wages, busting my butt, always feeling grateful throughout my entire life that someone would take a chance on me. Holding onto my work authorization, but worried that at any moment I could lose it all. Keeping a façade and hiding an aspect of myself from everyone I knew. Keeping it a dirty secret. When I was unemployed, I relied on my savings and never turned to welfare or unemployment. (Through more hard work and luck, I later secured a much better paying job.)



Then ~~the fire nation attacked~~ Trump came. There were so many stories of hate and people who I thought were friends or even acquaintances, people who I didn’t think were capable of such vitriol were chiming in left and right. Some viewed my very presence as a crime. 



I am an American. I speak and write English. I’ve seen Battlestar Galactica with Captain Picard at the helm piloting the Millenium Falcon through the gates of Mordor in less than twelve parsecs. I’ve read and felt the suspense when Daenarys sentenced Harry and Ron to death by dragon’s breath, but were prevented by Gandalf casting MirrorForce, banishing Superman into the Shadow Realm. I had teary eyes when Ash Ketchum’s Pikachu fought WarGreymon because Mewtwo had enough resources after using his Black Lotus. I know of our history when John Henry, the steel driving man, raced against an Apple Computer to put two lanterns to signal the writing of the Star Spangled Banner after negotiating a prisoner release. I can say “read” and “read” and “deed” and “dead.”



I’ve taught Reading, Writing, and U.S. History to American citizens. I’ve pledged my time and money to U.S. nonprofits. I’ve invested in American Entrepreneurs and the dreams with money, time, and expertise. I’ve tried to join the US military. I pay a crapload of taxes. The only thing I haven’t done was be born at a certain time and place. I’m not sure how I can apologize for that. But I won’t apologize for being an American."

1. How long does it usually take to hear back anything. Like I have had one or two jobs that I applied for already get taken down, I am assuming they reached their quota and are going to review them now. But others I applied for have been up for longer and still have not come down yet.

2. Again I applied to multiple internships to keep my options open, some are marketing, some are management, ect. I assume each one is different in how they review so there is a possibility to have multiple interviews for the multiple jobs. Just not sure if it'd be like that or you get only one of the ones you applied for, pending the select you of course.

3. If you get an interview what is the process like and how long does it last. I know the DCP once you eventually get passed applied goes pretty fast from what I have heard (also applied for DCP but want internship cause I'm a Senior). 

4. Does trying to connect with recruiters on LinkedIn work or does that just make them mad.

I'd appreciate any help on this if anyone has gone through this. I am trying my best to be patient and know its only been 2 weeks since all these started popping up. Just kind of want some answers especially since I am coming close to graduation and planning for Spring classes and getting this would be a big deal. Thanks!"

6yzcii,84,2017-09-08,"Hibiclens, a $6 surgical antiseptic, completely healed my acne [Acne]",bluebunnybuns,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/6yzcii/hibiclens_a_6_surgical_antiseptic_completely/,"[Before/After shots.](https://m.imgur.com/a/LA8uV)

Hi SCA! I've struggled with acne ever since I was a very young teen. My acne's been managed well at some points in my life and terrible at others. I'd always find one thing that worked and then it would just stop working for different reasons. The solution I've found now has worked well for me for a couple months now, so I figured I'd share it to help others who may not have heard about this product or are unsure about it. I came across this product in a super random way but it's been the most effective product I've ever used (and no purge!). Maybe my experience can benefit others as well :) 

For the past several years, I used topical clindamycin and it worked wonders for my skin. I seriously had no pimples for maybe 3 years. All of a sudden, however, seemingly out of nowhere, it stopped working and my acne came back in full force. It kept getting more and more severe over the course of about 6 months, completely robbing me of my self confidence. I cried a lot. I felt horrible about myself and changed plans to avoid seeing people. It was a really awful time in my life. The active pimples were one thing, but the texture of my skin was just so.. rough. There were tiny bumps EVERYWHERE all over my forehead. It seemed to cover every inch of the surface. It's hard to see in photos, but it was really bad up close. I hated looking in the mirror. I tried a ton of new products, desperately seeking a fix. I started retin-a without knowing about the purge and boy, did I purge. It took my already low self confidence to brand new lows. It was around this time that I started a new internship.

At my internship, I spearheaded a research initiative regarding chlorhexidine gluconate. I worked tirelessly for several months researching the absolute shit out of this substance and trying to prepare a well-backed proposal to implement a policy its usage on patients with MRSA infections in the hospital setting. While researching it, I found countless articles supporting its powerful antiseptic qualities and others yet that made the substance appear safe on skin and highly unlikely to cause resistant strains of bacteria. I had suspected that resistant bacteria was the reason why clindamycin had stopped working for me some time ago so this piqued my interest. Since antibiotics had cleared my acne before, it seemed that my acne was caused by bacteria and chlorhexidine gluconate was effective for just that. I had easy access to this substance in the hospital, so I took about a week's worth home with me and tried it out. The results were instant. I went to Walmart and purchased a small bottle of hibiclens (main ingredient is chlorhexidine gluconate).

Slowly over the course of 2-3 weeks, my acne resolved almost completely. I wear it like a mask. Once every evening, I wet my forehead slightly with water, put a pea-sized about of hibiclens in my hand, and just rub it on. It's quite watery and hard to manage so I just kind of slap it on there as quick as possible and rub it around. I then let it chill there for a couple minutes while I brush and floss and other nighttime things. I wash it off after a couple minutes when I'm ready for bed. This has been really effective for me in clearing my acne. Not only are the raised, cystic pimples gone, but the texture of my skin is infinitely better. I still have some scarring, but I know that will heal with time. I have continued retin-a to help with the scarring. 

 The first two pictures in my album are barefaced/with make up now. When I wear make up, my skin is completely smooth and the scars are not noticeable. The other 3 pictures are at different points of the purge before I started hibiclens, over the course of several months. The purge never got better for me, not even after 4 months of continued use. The only thing that made it better in any way was the hibiclens. I still do get pimples, but they're never cystic and they're so infrequent that I don't mind at all. 

I hope this helps other people going through similar struggles :) acne is such a horrible bitch. If anyone has any questions about hibiclens, I'd be more than happy to help if I can :) "
6yzf1n,3,2017-09-08,Shamanism and the Power of God,FloresLac,Mark519,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mark519/comments/6yzf1n/shamanism_and_the_power_of_god/,"Hey guys! Big text, but I hope you can read it!


I grew up in a good family. My parents were always there for me and they made sure my brother and I never lacked anything. My grandmother, a true Christian from her young years, is a woman I admired all my life for being always cheerful and smiling no matter what. I could never understand how a woman that went through a world war, injustice of Soviet times, hunger, and arranged marriage, raising a family of four kids, could still be full of energy and joy. She would always tell us, “It’s God who provides me with strength.”

This is how I got to know about God. As a child I believed there was the Father of all creation who watched over people and determined the course of human lives. I prayed “Our father in heaven” and trusted I could sometimes ask God to help me with whatever child life difficulties I had. And whenever I received a solution, I would truly believe it was His reply. Yet I never read the Bible, and I had a very scarce idea of whom I was praying to.

The older I grew, the more distant from God I became. As my life was developing, I seemed to have everything a young girl could think of. I received a good education, had a good job and was relatively successful with the opposite gender. But my heart was not in peace. I always felt there was something missing. I changed jobs, engaged myself in different activities and tried extreme sports and travelling. But whatever I did, wherever I went, the feeling of incompleteness followed me everywhere.

At the age of 25, very spontaneously, I moved out from my county to study abroad. I thought it was my chance to this something “extra” I was missing so much. But already in a year and a half I was totally worn out from studies, internships, constant moves and the permanent need to deal with the residency permit matters. Moreover, the feeling of being alone in a foreign country was like a stone on my heart. I felt even more lost than when I left my home country.

After my graduation I made a very outrageous decision, something very untypical for a person as pragmatic and rational as I am. I decided I would go travelling to an absolutely unknown part of the world, with a person I barely knew and without any reassurance on what I would do when I come back. And it is during this voyage that I had my first personal encounter with God, an event that changed my life.

My travel companion and I were seating on a sandy beach, breathing in warm and humid air, enjoying the sunset. I was excited but also a little bit anxious about the trip. Growing up in a country with a very poor travel culture, I could never imagine going to countries so remote. As the sun was already down and the colourful bulbs were lightning the evening, my travel mate told me a story. Once as an assignment for his ethnological study he decided to write about shamanism, a practice that assumes delivering people from their mental problems by reaching out to their sub-consciousness. He was convinced he could not write a good paper without trying the power of shamanism himself. So my travel mate let a shaman “enter” his sub-consciousness and lead him through a long forgotten episode in life, provoking changes which made the memory of the episode and its consequences less painful.

“It felt as if a stone has fallen off my chest,” said my friend as I listened to his story with great enthusiasm. “Shamans act as a bridge between your consciousness and your sub-consciousness,” he added. “But one must believe in their power to deliver, otherwise it would not work.”

A long pause followed the conversation as I was replaying the story in my head. Suddenly I uttered out loud, “I need a deliverance like that, but shamanism will not work with me, because the only power I believe in is the power of God.”

This was the first time in years I proclaimed the name of God. I said it so confidently and with so much reassurance that it was surprising even to myself. What I said felt so right. Even though figuring out my real mental burden and getting rid of its weight is exactly what I wanted more than anything in the world, I was still sure that healers like shamans could only solve some of one’s problems but they could never cure a soul. I wanted to leave this task to God. I wanted Him to be the bridge between my consciousness and sub-consciousness.

Later that night my travel companion and I had a discussion about relationships in our lives. I was already falling asleep when I remembered a person who hurt me emotionally a long time ago and I kept being angry at him for more than ten years. All of a sudden a thought hit me like a lightning bolt! Why should I keep being angry at this person? It is so emotionally exhausting! Why keep the weight of the offence for all these years? Why be angry at anybody at all?

Believe me, being a very easily offended person I had quite a long list of people I was angry at for years! Most of the times the reasons were ridiculous. But in my mind they were enough to make me aggrieved. Somewhere deep inside me there was this conviction that people wanted to offend me on purpose — and it was so strongly engraved in my heart.

I did not have the slightest clue that this had been eating me from inside. And this was exactly what made the bitterness dwell in me for ages. In this one single second I understood it all. It was the resentment and anger that were my mental burdens, the weight I had been carrying within me for so long. It was not the problems I had in my relationships, it was not the yoke of studying, working hard or trying to integrate into a foreign country. None of these, so easily acceptable as conscious-level excuses, were the explanations of my own struggle with myself. It was something hidden so much deeper, something so difficult to reach that one had to dig on a sub-conscious level. People having burdens like these would need numerous hours of discussions with psychologists to get it out and realize what really bothers them. But there I was, lying on a wooden bungalow bed somewhere in the middle of nowhere, suddenly realizing one of the main problem of my life, the reason for the permanent weight making my heart so heavy.

The realization became an enormous enlightenment for me. As I was coming to grips with the fact that I may have just found the bridge between my consciousness and sub-consciousness, I felt a strong wind blowing inside my head. With every millisecond it was getting stronger and stronger turning into a whirlwind — a tornado. And from my head it moved quickly down through my throat to my chest. Сircling around it sucked in the immense weight of offence and anger that was stored there and the next thing I knew it was all out.

The hurricane of emotions overwhelmed me. Tears were running from my eyes. I felt so much lighter. I felt a different person. I knew my life would never be the same again. But what is it that just happened to me? Sub-consciousness, consciousness, the bridge, hidden burdens? Isn’t it what we discussed with my travel mate at the beach? Did not I say that I believe only God could help me out? Did I not proclaim His power, and only His power over all known and unknown methods to reach the inner peace? I did not doubt for a second that the revelation I received was spiritual and that it came from Him. I could not even dream that the response would come so fast. Amazing! Truly, God’s ways are not our ways.

The enlightenment was the beginning of a new stage in my life. I started looking at the world with different eyes. I started enjoying people and the world around me. Moreover, I found a way to get in touch with almost all the people I had bitter feelings for, and we sorted things out. It took some time but it was totally worth it. After a while I noticed something important about myself; I am not getting so easily resentful anymore and it has become much easier for me to forgive.

However, it was just the first step in my spiritual transformation. I still felt confused about many things. The bliss that filled my wailing soul was slowly vanishing and I was lacking a knowledge of how to restore it again. We rarely talked about faith in my family and I knew no one in my close circle with whom I could share my spiritual strain. Without proper guidance my focus was back to the world, of which God was not a part. Following the main streams of modern society soon brought me to disappointments and pain along with the sense of self-destruction and immense lonesomeness. My heart felt heavy again. But unlike years ago when I thought I would find internal peace by moving to a different county or by travelling, this time I knew exactly where to go.

Why did it take me so long to realize how much better God’s world is? Why was the solitude and bitterness so hard to bear, the only reasons for me to go to church? It may sound ironic, but God was allowing negative experiences in my life so that I could find my refuge in His house. The more I attended church, the more I wanted to discover this new spiritual realm.

I finally started reading the Bible. It was something I could not have done for years as the book seemed to be so boring to me. But after I prayed for God to reveal His Word to me, I actually found myself enjoying reading the Bible. So much wisdom has opened up to me through it. But the most important thing I learned was the story of Jesus Christ. God for me was no longer just someone from above there who created humanity and determines the destinies of people’s lives. In addition to being the Father of all creation, he is also the Son, who came to this world as a human and willingly died on the cross so that my sins and the sins of all people on Earth can be forgiven, and the Holy Spirit, who dwells in our souls to guide us spiritually.

After acknowledging this I got baptized by immersion in water and became a member of the church. Today, it is my personal relationship with Jesus that has become my focus of life and remedy against the heartache. It is solely by the power of prayer, a desperate call for His help, that I got rescued from the feelings of loneliness which bothered me for those last years. I learned to be able to enjoy time on my own, admiring nature, travelling around, valuing simple things of life or spending time in spiritual meditation. I felt the presence of Jesus wherever I was, either alone or not. And as I was able to comprehend it, the load of solitude was gone for good. Inner peace and balance entered my body and mind.

Shamans and “healers” alike can help solve one’s problems but they can never cure a soul. I remain with a strong conviction that only God can do it. He has redeemed me from three major burdens of my life — anger, resentment and solitude -– and filled in the emptiness in my heart. He has opened a new perspective in life for me and showed me its purpose. Since my first encounter with God’s Holy Spirit in that remote county more than five years have passed and I never regretted that moment. Despite challenges and trials which I face on my spiritual development path, I never give up trusting in God’s good plan for my life. And my trust has always been justified. After I had opened my soul to God, enlightenments and divine interventions, one after another, have been happening in my life. I so much wish that you can experience the same or even greater things in your own life. God disregards nobody; everyone is special to Him. One just has to make the decision to start trusting Him by proclaiming His mighty power over anything else in the world. In our post-modernist culture, people tend to over-complicate things when searching for answers to the questions about humanity, the creation of the world, the meaning of life, the destiny of people’s lives and what happens to us after death. It is much simpler than one thinks. All the answers are in the nature of Jesus Christ, who is the way the truth and the life (John 14:16). If you are lost, just ask Him sincerely to show you the way out. And believe me, it will not take long until you hear from Him."

It was late at the office and Geo was ready to head home. She came with bart to work today and knew he went home early. With everyone gone at the office she knew she had to call bart. As she was about to the new jk intern walked into the office saying he forgot his phone here. Geo knew he was a good kid that's why bart hired him. The intern asked if she wanted a ride home. Geo had no choice so she said yes.

On they way home the traffic started to get worse and worse, to the point they just stopped. Geo msg bart that she would be late because of traffic. This was also a good time for Geo to get to know the new intern. He was fairly young around 18 years old. They both started to talk about work and Geo said he should be fine as its easy work and could become stressful at times and then Geo went on to saying he has It easy since he's new as for her it's stressful. He asked what was making her stress and Geo said it's all the deadlines she has to meet and it became for stress as her and bart didn't get to have sex because of this.

Geo knew she was horny and wanted sex but knew her busy schedule she wouldn't get any for awhile. Looking over at the intern he was just wearing basketball shorts and could see the outline of his pretty big cock. Geo was getting turned on even though she knew it was wrong she could stop peeking it at once in awhile when he looked away. Geo couldn't resist anymore as everytime she talks to him she just wants to look at his pants so she asked the intern if he would do something for her and in return he could easily get a raise. The intern replied with a yes saying he would like to help out with whatever she needed. With that answer Geo slowly moved her hand onto his leg and grabbed his cock, It was bigger than she thought. The intern was shocked but he knew he couldnt resist Geo as she was amazingly hot and wearing tight pants he couldnt stop staring at her round ass around the office.

Geo told him not to tell anyone and he quickly nodded. Geo slowly pulled his pants down and started sucking his cock instantly, she was hungry. Geo swirled her tounge around the cock and taking it on as deep as her throat would let her. As she was sucking him off he moved one hand down her shirt and grabbed her tits and squeezed hard. Geo getting even more turned on she started sucking faster, slurping all his precum down her throat.

The traffic started to move now and the intern had to focus on driving again. Geo told him to exit the highway and find somewhere to park. They came upon a empty parking lot and Geo told him to go to the back seat with her. As they go to the back seat they both started kissing non stop, Geo wanted more of his cock and kept on grabbing it. Geo told him to sit back and relax as Geo moved in front of him and took his cock out, she turned around and started rubbing her ass against his cock through her tight yoga pants. Geo then slowly pulled down her pants and showed him her dripping wet pussy. She held his cock and sat on it. It felt amazing! Geo started thrusting her ass against his cock making them both moan loud. The interns view was amazing, seeing Geo's ass bob up and down on his cock, with every thrust the sound of her ass slapping against him was making them both crazy. Geo then turned around and face him. She started to ride him meeting his thrust with her ass. His balls slapping against her ass drove her crazy. The intern started sucking on Geo's tits then moved his hands down and grabbed her ass cheeks. He slapped them as they bounce against his cock. Watching her tits bounce and feeling her ass hit his cock with amazing thrusts he couldn't hold it in anymore. He told Geo he was cumming and then started to cum inside Geo's pussy. Geo feeling her orgasim made her legs tremble, she hugged him and felt his cum shoot up her pussy. They both tired out. Geo still sitting on him and letting his cum flow into her. Geo then said my stress is gone let's get home and I'll make sure you'll get a raise.

6z070q,2,2017-09-09,Dad makes me feel like nothing,Librocubic,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6z070q/dad_makes_me_feel_like_nothing/,"[Advice Request/Rant]

Disclaimer : This is by all accounts NOT THAT BAD. I needed a way to vent the negative feeling so here they are. I know that there are worse out there and I'm not suggesting that I'm worse off. 

I'm a sophomore. I've been working my ass off all week preparing and studying for tests, getting all my homework done. I've had an average of 5 1/2 hours sleep per day (tame, all things considered). I've had a grand total of three Bs in my past. Three. And I'm on a good track this year, starting off strong. I make up for it with a lack of free time, fatigue. My mind is so fuzzy all the time and when depression hits. it hits hard. Suddenly I'm so tired that I can't think of anything beyond what's in front of me and I have absolutely no willpower to do anything. There's a pile of homework sitting right there, homework I know I have to get to alone with getting in art and piano and taking care of my pets... and I can't do any of it. 

My dad saw me playing with my dog today. And he accused me of wasting time ""playing with the stupid dog"", not ""reading and studying"", and ""you have to catch up because of those three Bs."" 
Who is this coming from? A man who couldn't give three asses about my school life. He doesn't help me with homework because it's a waste of his time. Never checks up on me, encourages me, or even lets me ask questions. All he ever does is come in and accuse me of NOT doing it. Or ask me what my grade is as if he cares. 

And here he is in my ten fucking minutes of free time telling me I'm not doing enough. He doesn't know jack about what I've been doing. I exploded at him. Not full-on yelling, but just snarling. ""How dare you come out here and say things like that like you know what I've been doing? You never even help me with my homework. What right do you have to tell me I can't spend ten minutes playing with my dog?"" 
He kept up the charade. You need to make up for those Bs he said. You need to catch up he said. You need to get all As. You're not. You need to spend all your time catching up.
I've paid through my ass to make up for those Bs. I took two summer classes and a 90 hour internship over the summer and I've been doing nothing but studying this year. And he has the nerve. 
Then he laughs. He points at my face and laughs, saying wow so serious, so angry, looks like shes getting mad again, oh boy. Hahaha so funny, look at that face. Okay then. You're better than me, I get it. 

I said nothing of the sort. I didn't feel like crying or anything. There was just a sinking feeling in my stomach like ""oh, this again. I fell for it again."" I looked him straight in the eye until he left. 

Just to nail in his hypocrisy, an hour later while doing homework. he asked if I had played the game he gave me. And then if I had walked the dog. The exact same dog.
And then I laughed and said ""oh, now he's asking if I played the game I gave him, wasn't I supposed to be doing homework? Hm.."" And he gets annoyed and says wow listen to all these words coming out of her mouth, blah blah blah blah, no need to listen to those words. Annoying. Useless.
I'm mad and frustrated but I'm mostly just tired. I knew this wasn't normal but I didn't know it was THAT not normal, you know what I mean? I've been devalued and dismissed all my life by this man. Who knows what it's done to my self image and outlook on life. Bad things, probably. 

But what can you do? Actually, what should I do the next time he starts acting like that? Coming in and making all these accusations. Anger doesn't help. Ignoring him, he acts as if I'm trying to make a point or make him feel bad. No, I just don't need to hear his bullshit. Any suggestions? He acts as if he's just making a joke, or it's all in good fun but it's not funny. And I'm pretty sure he's actually being serious at first before defaulting to this stupid defense mechanism.

It's funny, he will never be as hard on me as I am on myself."
6z0a9k,6,2017-09-09,Where and how to apply for a job after university,kalolparty,linuxadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/6z0a9k/where_and_how_to_apply_for_a_job_after_university/,"**ABOUT ME:** 

I'm in my final year Computer Science undergrad course and would like to become a linux admin.

I'm well versed with distros, VMs, shell scripting, python, monitoring logs, basic Apache configs, dealing with drivers and services and ports.

I've done an internship so far but that was as an Android app developer.

I manage the web infrastructure for an NGO (the website, DNS, CDN, mailing system, server to be precise) and respond to their requests on a regular basis.

**QUESTIONS**: 

Keep in mind I'm in India

1. Which companies (or what kind) can I apply to for a 6 month internship (which may lead to job later)?

2. What else should I keep in mind? Any other skill that would be beneficial?

3. What can I do if I'm unable to find any openings for an internship? I can't really find internships for devops or sysadmin.

4. There are some openings for SRE, DevOps but not system/linux administration specifically? They're under SRE or DevOps.

Thanks for your help!"
6z0bqp,0,2017-09-09,(Spoilers Season Four) Did anyone else notice...,clothy,BoJackHorseman,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoJackHorseman/comments/6z0bqp/spoilers_season_four_did_anyone_else_notice/,"Did anyone else notice how feminist Season Four was? I don't mean modern third wave feminism, which the show makes fun of regularly. I mean real feminism like it was back in the forties.

The first example is how Joseph Sugarman had a lobotomy performed on his wife because he couldn't be bothered dealing with her ""womanly"" emotions. She had just lost her son and needed support but he opted for a quick fix because it was convenient for him. Back when lobotomies where being performed the majority were performed on women because the men in their lives wanted them submissive. John F. Kennedy's sister even had one performed on her because she wasn't as high an achiever as her siblings. It was horrible.

My next example is from the gun episode. It basically implied that men would rather give up their guns than let women stand on equal footing. As I'm not an American I don't know much about gun laws or how you all feel about them but I do see the point that the writers were making. Even Diane was surprised that they hated women more than they liked guns.

The next example is how Bojack has to deal with how much he has mistreated women. It happens because he thinks he has a daughter and is forced to take a hard look at himself. It really shows by how disgusted Hollyhock is when they go and visit all of the women that Bojack slept with in 1999. But Bojack does learn. We see this in the episode where Hollyhock dates the intern. Bojack is so sure that the kid (I've forgotten his name) doesn't respect women because he himself doesn't respect women. Then when Bojack finds out the truth that the kid doesn't respect women Bojack is upset because he wanted to be wrong for the sake of his ""daughter."" 

At the end of the season Bojack shows real respect for a woman who he has mistreated throughout the entire show. Princess Carolyn. It's almost like he finally acknowledges her as someone who doesn't soley exist for his amusement.

Looking back I can see that the show has always had a fairly strong feminist message but it took me until season four to notice. It's good though because it deals with real issues rather than the superficial stuff that modern feminists worry about.

6z0wzo,2,2017-09-09,Story of how I cucked these losers while I got my white girl - who I'd just met earlier that night - hot and horny as they watched.,throwitupwatchitfall,ircuckold,https://www.reddit.com/r/ircuckold/comments/6z0wzo/story_of_how_i_cucked_these_losers_while_i_got_my/,"At Times Square, I saw the most delicious ass in front of me. It wasn't fat - it was perfect. I walk up beside her and her face is stunning, too.. Mmm. I tell her that I love her walk. We start walking and talking. She's a German intern and just arrived in the city. On her way to a bar to meet people. 

I get her to cancel her plans and we hit up BB King blues club together (what I was going to do anyway). 

After the show, we stroll through Bryant park and end up kissing there. I end up walking her to her station so she can go home, and this is where things got really interesting. 

The train's unfortunately (hehe) 20 minutes away. There's a crowd of people there, but we're standing with her in front of me, pressed back against me, and my arms around her waist. 

I start dirty talking so bad to her. I decided to risk it and do it. She ends up loving it, and so I keep going. I'm subtly telling her nasty things like how I'm going to make her my little slut and she's eating it up. She feels me getting hard behind her, and I'm stroking her hips. She's blushing and sweating.

Minewhile, a bunch of losers guys are looking at us through the corner of their eyes, knowing what's happening, knowing what I'm about to do to her, something that they can only wish they do. I kept getting her horny and all they could do was look and watch out of the corner of their eyes and probably jerk off when they get home. Meanwhile she's biting her lip, rolling her eyes as I whisper into her ear, and clasping my hand as I caress her hips. 

Needless to say, I end up fucking her, and we fucked all day for 5 days straight before I had to leave the city (I don't live in NYC, was just visiting). 

By the way, the girl was white, the loser guys watching were all black, and I'm Aussie of Indian heritage. That's relevant to interracial cuckolding, right? "
6z1npw,19,2017-09-09,It hurts that my mom treats our dog better than me.,kassiebby1124,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6z1npw/it_hurts_that_my_mom_treats_our_dog_better_than_me/,"This is long:

I've never posted here before. I'm 22 and have returned home (not necessarily by choice but it's a little complicated) to complete the next 4 months of my college career and graduate. One requirement for some stupid reason is to complete an 40 hour a week internship for the course of 14 weeks. Unpaid. So I do that and up until yesterday I was employed with a part-time job. I had to leave my part time job because of the stress of everything going on. 


I work LATE most days (usually from 9am-10/11 if I work both jobs). My parents are the most ""we're your family/blood and that's all that matters. Above us (and God if you're my mom) nothing else is important"" kind of people I know. I've been pulling doubles and they think I'm out partying. It's gotten so bad that they stalked my job to look for my car, didn't see it (I park in a different location during lunch rush) and then proceeded to call me a liar, they're sick of my bullshit, etc. This all panned out after I asked and chose to stay with my friend because we drank a bit too much and I didn't want to drive buzzed. I was called childish, irresponsible, and told I don't give a shit about them so they don't care what I do. Sounds like they care right?


I've been here for 2 months now and have to hold out until December. My mom has been emotionally abusive and manipulative ever since I was 12, I guess. She ADORES my older sister (first child, very successful. Followed the ""right path"" while I want to be as far from corporate land as possible). She actually just got off the phone with her raving about how much she loves our dog and she can see now (puppy got eye surgery). It makes sense to baby a pet but she just BLEW UP at me over 7.58 worth of money because I had to take a toll road a month ago. Then turns around and blows up my dad (he is also abusive towards me, occasionally physical but mostly just screaming) because he didn't want to pay for a 30 dollar headcone for the dog because she already has one on her head. She's so chipper speaking to my dog and usually my dad but with me unless she has something planned or a specific piece of information she needs to know, everything seems like a chore. A snippit of a dinner conversation we had this week. We were talking about how I fantasized about being a guidance counselor. 
*Dad* ""I couldn't be a counselor; I'd go to jail for throwing a kid threw the wall. Raising you was bad enough and I have zero patience for you so how I could do that with someone who isn't mine.

*Mom* I agree. Plus expenses. Speaking of which, you owe us X thousands of dollars when you graduate and get a job.

They insisted for me to move back home to partially reduce financial issues (they paid rent for me in my apartment because they didn't want me to work and be in school) and me moving here reduced that and my mom wanted to ""rebuild our relationship"" but so far the chastising has only gotten worse. 
She knows I'm sensitive about my weight and pokes at my fat or pinches it, usually going ""woohoohoo you have some fat rolls, but don't I look slimmer,"" talks horribly about my clothing and hair but then will give me money for expenses and will be kind and nice to me. She's not a terrible person; shes just a bad mother to me and I don't understand why. Sometimes we're jovial but it's rare. Same with my dad. They wanted me here when all I wanted to do was be away and I've returned as a punching bag. 


Without my job (I plan on going back in a few weeks but after some physical altercations within my family and them stalking me at work, I needed some time off), I can't afford to move out and it's only a few months. My sister said to just deal with it, do what they say. She knows I hate it here. But she said to suck it up because if they kick me out she won't let me live with her and her husband. 

I don't know why I posted this. I just felt like I needed to. I need help and don't know how to get it. I'm also terrified of completely turning my back on my family because if I do it to one, my entire family (grandparents and my uncle who is like a second dad) included. I don't know what I need to do."
6z1s5v,24,2017-09-09,[REVIEW] 98 Yuan Herschel Strand Duffle Review,mrmanwest,FashionReps,https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/6z1s5v/review_98_yuan_herschel_strand_duffle_review/,"Ok so basically i need a bag which can work well with my smart/business casual dress code for my internship, also i dont really want a backpack which made my back sweaty and shit, so i went for this duffle bag and try to look fresher than my colleagues [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/L0yID)

**PRICE**

Fuckin 98 yuan add this to your haul 

**QUALITY**

The bag comes with the herschel package plastic bag which looks really neat, it feels like it really is a retail piece lol. The bag feels sturdy, the fabric is actually kinda thick but considerably light weight as well, i feel like this bag is gonna last at least 3 years, no joke. HOWEVER, the bag is definitely not 1:1 and have some flaws:

* The ""Welcome to Herschel"" inside tag stitching is kinda sloppy.
* The main tag have some rough edges but it can be fixed easily using a pair of scissors.
* MAJOR FLAW: Even the main tag have the ""QUALITY"" spelled correctly instead of ""QUAUTY"" like the other batch, the tag missed the line ""Designed in the Herschel Workshop"". This may be a HUGE callout factor, but no one would really notice that unless they have an identical duffle, then condolences to you brother/sister.

**OVERALL**

It is a really really good quality bag for the price. The capacity of this bag is kinda huge, theres no tiny compartments inside the bag tho, also there is only one small sleeve pocket outside the bag, but well i think it is durable for daily use, get this bag as a backpack alternative or for your weekend short trip with your friends.

My name is Chad. I'm a junior studying Math and Computer Science in the U.S, and I'm looking for a tech internship this summer in Berlin. 

My German is quite awful, but I would really love to live in Berlin over the summer -- I've been there once before and had an absolute blast. I have some experience with software development in Java, C#, etc. I have a few questions for anyone knowledgeable on this subject:

1. Are tech companies willing to hire an American who isn't fluent in German?

2. What kind of pay could I expect?

3. Any companies you recommend looking at? What are good sources for finding internships?

Thanks for the help, everyone! Berlin is a great city and I hope I can work there over this summer."

I determine high vs low wages on the pay per hour. $7.25/hr is super low. Thats the minimum wage. $9/hr is good pay while $12.5 -$15/hr is high pay for hourly part time jobs. (given that these jobs are your college level entry jobs. grocery store, fast food, etc. not anything like contract workers)

Going into salary positions, I want to get a better grasp of good pay vs bad pay in salary positions. Sure i get $100,000 is really good and not many people get that. It also depends on position. Teachers make little, while doctors make bank. I'm getting a BS in computer science technology. The field is good pay. 

So what is good pay and bad pay for this field? I have an internship opportunity that says $65-70,000 salary. This seems good... is it?"

Maybe I'm a call girl you decided you wanted to have full time. 

Maybe you want me to lactate for you and every day I bring you lunch in you office and then you feed from my tits. Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping and you approve everything I own. 

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I'm not looking for a novelist, but someone who wants to get into these characters and find fun ways to explore them as well as write some fun sexy scenes. Lets figure out how I got to be your mistress, what the relationship is. 

Kinks: BDSM, spanking, anal, traditional gender roles, cheating, lactation play, older men

Limits: Humiliation, toilet play, feet, violence, bimbofication

https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6z1fu1/do_i_give_the_candidate_honest_feedback/
I interviewed someone for a position yesterday and the experience made both my co-worker and I cringe.  

The candidate graduated from college in May and had an internship with another company over the summer.  He was interviewing with us for a full-time, permanent position directly related to his field of study.  

He came to the interview completely empty handed -- no copy of his resume, no note pad, etc.  My co-worker started the interview by asking the candidate to walk us through his resume.  (We wanted to be able to get into a bit more detail about a few things that were on it.)  My co-worker told the candidate that he had an extra copy of the resume if he wanted to refer to it.  The candidate literally rolled his eyes and told us that he didn't need a copy of it to remember his background.  He then went gave us a clearly pre-scripted response that didn't seem to match his resume at all.  

After a few other questions with similar responses, I told him that we rely heavily on excel.  I asked him how strong his excel skills were.  His response:   ""I wouldn't have put it on my resume if I wasn't comfortable with it.""  

We asked him his GPA, and he told his is major GPA was 2.9.  We asked him what his overall GPA was, and he told us that it's not relevant unless the work involves knowing history or literature.

Every response was similar.  I got the feeling that he thought he was doing us a favor by interviewing.  At the end of the interview, we asked if he had any questions, and he said no.  It was almost like he was going out of his way to be dismissive of us.  I actually asked him how his job search has been going, and he told us he knows that it's just a matter of time before a company recognizes how much he can contribute.

It was the strangest interview I've ever been in.  His arrogance was overwhelming, especially considering he had almost no work experience and was being interviewed by people with 20 plus year of experience.  

He's clearly not a good fit for our team, so he's no longer a candidate for the job.  I normally follow up with candidates personally, and I'm wondering if it would be wise to give him a bit of honest feedback.

Thoughts?

[July/August 2019]

____

(Kaduna) Following the passage of legislation in the All Progressives Congress (APC)-controlled National Assembly, the Nigerian Ministry of Education has been given a task it will be delighted to carry out. 

Recent years have already seen a massive surge in education and healthcare spending in Nigeria. The education budget, which was [roughly $2.7 billion in 2016](http://allafrica.com/stories/201606030204.html), now stands at a healthy $11,447,049,600.00. The funding until now has been used mainly for the ramping up of existing educational activities and practices.

However, now the National Assembly has taken action. Prompted by the surge in manufacturing and research and development aimed at strengthening the Nigerian Armed Forces, legislation has been passed to ensure a pool of qualified engineers and technical personnel. In addition, changes to the government and structure of the economy necessitates well-educated economists and businessmen take over the private-sector established by their forefathers. 

Two new ""flagship"" universities are being established on government orders:

_______

### Kaduna Technical Institute (Projected Enrollment: 30,000)

&gt;Kaduna Technical Institute, KTI for short, will become the leading STEM university in Nigeria. Generously-funded and equipped with modern research facilities, the university will be expected to breed a new generation of Nigerians, educated at home and capable of closing the technological gap with the developed world. The location is no coincidence; Kaduna is the location of many military headquarters and is seen as the military's city. The close proximity ensures that a tight relationship will be formed with the defense industry. 

### Kano School of Economics (Projected Enrollment: 45,000)

&gt; Kano School of Economics aims to be the leading economics and business university in the broader West African geography. Charged with developing the nations upcoming white collar work force and the economists of the future, the university will fill an education gap left by the 2nd largest city in the country only housing the #19 ranked university (Bayero University Kano). Programs will be set up to expose KSE's students to internships in the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Finance Ministry while funding will be used to bring in the best guest lecturers possible in order to raise the school's international profile. 

____

In addition, each of the flagship universities will establish a ""feeder highschool"" in every Nigerian state to raise the levels of secondary education and set a benchmark for other regional high schools to follow. 

## KTI and KSE are seeking international partnerships from internationally-respected universities to increase the quality of education and interactions between academic institutions. "
6z40w0,2,2017-09-09,"My(23M) internet friend(24M) keeps venting to me about something hurtful his father said, but isn't motivated to try and change his situation at all. I'm getting sick of listening to it all the time, but I don't know what to say or do.",RAWRizard21,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6z40w0/my23m_internet_friend24m_keeps_venting_to_me/,"To try and put things into context: I have this friend whom I've been talking with over the internet for about 8 years now. We found that we had a lot in common with the video games we liked to play and movies/ TV shows we watched. As we continued to talk, we started getting more comfortable around each other and started talking about our personal lives more. My friend told me that he's not always looking for advice when he's had bad experiences, but it just helps him to have someone like me whom he can vent to without being judged. I never had a problem with it before because I liked having someone I could vent to as well about my problems and I like to comfort my friends and listen to their problems whenever I can just to show my support.

However, something happened to him recently and I feel it has changed my friend for the worst. We're still only friends over the internet. We've never met in-person, but we've been talking for such a long time that we've earned each other's trust. We've also talked over webcam so we know what each other looks like and we know that we're being honest with one another about who we say we are. Still, that doesn't mean he's willing to reveal absolutely everything about his life so I don't have all the exact details about what's going on. I try not to pry too deeply and still respect his privacy by not asking too many specific questions. I pretty much go off of whatever information he chooses to reveal to me.

But what my friend told me is that he got into a nasty argument with his dad recently which ended with the latter saying he hasn't accomplished anything in 20 years. My friend was incredibly hurt by that comment and has been for a few weeks now. I asked my friend why his dad would say something so awful, but my friend told me his dad wasn't completely wrong. 

My friend is a year older than me, but he's not in college and he has very little work experience. He had a job once. He hasn't told me exactly what he did, but it doesn't sound like it was something big. He worked with his older brother at some place and only got hired because he had a family connection there. But my friend recently revealed to me that he quit the job a while ago (hasn't told me why) and that he has been out of work for several years now. Pretty much all he does now is sit at home, play video games and surf the internet all day. 

Prior to this revelation, I had always wondered why he was always online and ready to talk to me whenever I had time to hang out and chat. I'm in college right now, I've had a part-time job for the past six years, and I'm involved with a bunch of clubs and stuff at my college. Basically, I'm really busy so I don't have as much time to play games or watch TV and I only talk to this friend on weekends. He's always been farther than me in the single player games, better than me in the multiplayer ones, and he often finishes a TV show entirely before I've even watched the first season. But now I know that it's because he sits at home and does this stuff all day while I'm out and about with other priorities. As his friend, I've tried my hardest not to judge him and show my support when he's needed someone to talk to. But I'm starting to understand why his dad said my friend hasn't accomplished anything in 20 years. 

He's not doing ANYTHING with his life right now and it's starting to irritate me! Every time we talk, he keeps complaining about how hurt he was by what his dad said and how he's waiting for his dad to apologize for it. But this is pretty much ALL he talks about now and our other internet friends are starting to get annoyed by it too. Whenever we try and change the subject and talk about something else, my friend finds ways to steer the conversation back into pitying him. I suggested that my friend try to do something to change his situation such as by getting a part-time job, but he claims he isn't motivated to do so just because it's hard to get hired anywhere with little work experience. He says that he's been depressed over what his dad said, so I suggested he talk to a therapist and figure out what he can do to change his situation. My friend agreed, but he hasn't made any progress with that either because he isn't motivated to do that either.

I understand that since we're not friends in real life, I can't do anything to physically help him so it's going to be up to him to change his situation to any degree. But the fact that he's making excuses is really starting to irritate me because I was raised to work hard and make something of myself. My family forced me to get a job in high school so I could pay for college, buy my own car so I could drive myself everywhere, and to never quit just because things get hard. I can completely relate with my friend about how hard it can be to find work since I had the same problem trying to get an internship last year. But I sucked it up and kept trying instead of quitting just because it was hard. Not only did I get an internship, but I also got a full-time job offer so now I have a job waiting for me while I finish up my last year of school. I've proven to myself that when you work hard, you can make something of yourself and go far. But to see my friend just coasting, complaining, and making excuses when I've given him support and advice that he isn't taking, it bothers me.

At this point, I just want to tell my friend to suck it up, get the help he needs, and start seriously searching for a new job because in my opinion, it doesn't matter if his dad apologizes or not. I feel my friend needs to prove to his dad that he can still do something with his life if he wants his situation to change at all. I'm tired of listening to my friend vent all the time without doing anything to change his situation, but I'm worried I'm going to make things worse for him if I lash out or stop talking to him completely.

So my question to all of you is: Is there anything I can do or say at this point to help my friend?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My long-time internet friend has been upset because his dad told him he hasn't accomplished anything in 20 years. He's not in school and hasn't had a job for several years so he really isn't doing anything productive with his life right now. I've listened to him vent, offered my support and my sympathy, and I've tried to give him advice, but he's not motivated to try and change anything. Instead, all he wants to do is sit there and complain to me about it over and over again. I'm tired of listening to this and I want to tell him to suck it up and get help to change his situation. But I'm worried I'm going to upset him even more. I don't want to stop talking to him completely, but I really want something to change here because I want to be able to talk to my friend without the subject of his passive home life constantly coming up."
6z4aex,7,2017-09-09,Me [19 M] with my girlfriend [20F] have been dating for 7 months. I think that maybe I only love her because she loves me.,OhItsPreston,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6z4aex/me_19_m_with_my_girlfriend_20f_have_been_dating/,"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 7 months now. She lives in my home state, and I live much further away going to college in another state. For the first 3 months or so, it was great—we’d Skype every night for hours, have a great time, and just in general click and work out well. However, one persistent problem that we’ve had is that whenever she got upset about anything, I felt she would take it out on me, and I would spend hours trying to comfort her and cheer her up. For the first three months, I was “OK” with it, and I told her that we would work to improve that aspect of the relationship.


In May, I went on an extended camping trip with my friends, and I didn’t have any contact with her for about a week. Although during the camping trip I really missed her, after I came back from the camping trip, I just felt a lot less strongly about her. I still loved her, but I just didn’t really feel the need to talk to her all the time like I used to. Also during this time, I stopped being so understanding of the way she treated me when she was upset. Instead of spending time with her trying to make her feel better, I just started letting her sulk and mope until she got over whatever was making her upset. However, when I went home and hung out with her in person, it felt like everything was OK again. During the summer, I left again to an internship in a different state, and during this period it was much of the same—whenever I was hanging out with my friends or when she was upset, I really didn’t feel any need to date her, but as soon as we Skyped or she flew in to visit me, I just felt like I loved her so much.


My college semester started just recently, and I still feel the same way—whenever I’m with my friends, I don’t really feel like talking to her, but whenever we Skype I feel absolutely in love with her. About a week ago we had a big argument, and I was close to breaking up with her, but when I saw her crying and asking if we could stick together, I just…couldn’t. I loved her too much, I thought, and we made up, and I promised that I would stick with her and we would work it out.


You know how in middle school or high school, you’d know someone, and be apathetic to them, but then when one of your friends tell you that the person has a crush on you, they suddenly become more attractive? It’s kind of like when you know the other person likes you, they just become more desirable. I’ve came to the unpleasant realization that there’s a good chance that I feel this way.


It all adds up. I don’t really feel the need to talk to her until I do, because whenever we spend time together she just showers me with affection. She constantly tells me how much she loves me, she buys/makes me tons of gifts, she’s very sexually attracted to me, and she does so much for me that I don’t ask for. These actions make me feel affection and love for her, but I now strongly suspect that those are the only reasons I feel for her. That’s why when we’re not talking/spending time together, or when she’s unhappy, I just feel really disinterested in her.


I’m really, really conflicted about what to do. Even now, I feel strongly for her, but I know that loving someone because they love you isn’t sustainable in the long run. I also don’t want to hurt her, since she’s so, incredibly into me that I feel that I can’t hurt her by breaking up with her so soon after I promised and reassured her that we were OK. Since we had our discussion a week ago, she’s made a lot of improvements to treating me better when she’s upset. She doesn’t take things out on me anymore, and she’s genuinely really, really interested in being with me for the long term, and she’s trying so hard to be good to me. To make matters worse, just yesterday she spent almost 100 dollars on a gift for me, and to make matters even worse, she’s coming to visit me this Thursday. To reiterate, I don’t dislike her. I love her, but deep down, I think I’m realizing that the reasons just aren’t sustainable. I want her to visit, but at the same time, I don’t. I know that I’ll enjoy my time with her a lot, but at the same time, I’m scared it’s for the wrong reasons.


Even now, I’m texting her, and she’s telling me how much she loves me and I just can’t bring myself to imagine hurting her by breaking up with her. I really do care about her, but again, I’m worried it’s for the wrong reasons.

6z4nu7,0,2017-09-09,Social Epi,howaboutudance,publichealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/6z4nu7/social_epi/,"So I just finished an internship at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. I am a graduating senior and I am starting to get serious about grad school (I know I should started hard last year). I am graduating with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Public Health Studies. I have been talking around during my internship about social epi schools, so far I have on my list:

UC Berkeley
U of Michigan
George Washington University
Columbia
U of Minnesota

My interests in social epi is health disparties. My research from my internship is in housing quality/value as a social determinent of health, particularly for historically black neighborhoods experiencing displacement/gentrification. I am being pushed to go into a PhD coming from undergrad instead of a MPH because I am so research focused. I also am considering school with decent urban health focus like U of Illinois - Chicago.

Any thoughts on these schools? Better suggestions of other schools?"

Warning: this may get ramble-y, it's hard for me to put all this into perspective 

I'm stuck in a really rough spot. For reference, I'm an adopted 19 year old female, who is going to college fairly far away from my narcs. When they first took me under their wing, they were pretty nice to me. However, when I started getting older (either triggered by my dad's dad dying or me just getting older and wanting independence in general) they started getting worse.  Dad has a wild temper and has done everything from hit me, tell me to kill myself, taken my phone away from months at a time for petty transgressions, gaslighting, and many many more I can't list briefly. He goes through 9 beers and a bottle of wine by himself, minimum, each night. He's cut me off from countless friends, never respects my opinion and generally has given me hardships that affected me deeply throughout my life.  

Dad is more the stereotypical narc; Mom is more Emom but she does adopt some of his traits. Mom acts a lot as his flying monkey, and she sometimes acknowledges how bad he is and tells me she considers divorce, therapy, etc, but never leaves him. Her form of abuse is more subtle (telling me I'm gaining weight, interrupting stories that are important for me to finish, mocking me for getting hurt when they make fun of me, etc).

So, in short, I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder as a direct result of them, and it was only when I went away to college that I really discovered who I was as a person. College has been the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm super excited to graduate. 

Enter problem.

My parents, for all their faults, do recognize that college is important for me and want me to do well. They will pay for my college tuition in it's entirety, and aren't bluffing when they say they have the money to do it. However, they are dead set on me doing college their way, not mine. They're obsessed with me having the perfect ""college experience"", to the point it's some creepy mantra. I want to graduate in 3 years, they want me to graduate in the traditional 4. I don't go to sports events because I'm not a fan of watching sports, they berate me for not supporting my team and disrespecting them by wasting their money they pay for in my tuition to get me into sports (money that, if given the option, I would just as soon opt out of paying). But the most serious disagreement about college we've had so far is about jobs. 

They don't want me to work during college. They claim it's because they're worried about me doing well in class and getting a job, but I know it's because they don't want me to have the money to support myself, resulting in my continued dependence on them. This is proven by the fact that I wasn't allowed to work during the summer, despite only being in class for 4 hours a day. This has been a major frustration, but I abided by it all of my freshman year. This summer I got a job, but due to a lot of crazy things happening, I made zero money, kept having to draw out of my savings to do things, and my job ended up going bankrupt so I was broker than when I started. This semester I was offered a paid internship. My boss is only asking me to work 6-8 hours a week, so it won't pay much at all, but it won't interrupt my studies. Sure enough, when I told my parents, they were appalled at the idea. My dad eventually relented, but said I could only work 2-4 hours a week, and wasn't allowed to use my phone or computer for work-related things (despite the fact I'm interning with a start-up company). 

Obviously, no job is going to hire me to work 4 hours a week max, and a startup can't give me company equipment, so I decided to take the internship on the terms my boss and I agreed on, not on my dad's terms. This decision has since terrified me. My dad has stated that if I disobey his orders I'll be cut off. I have very little emotional attachment to them, and certainly don't care to obey his terms out of loyalty, so I don't want to obey him just because he said so. This internship is a really great opportunity, and I'm getting lots of resume fluff and experience from it, so I don't want to give it up. This winter break I'm certain they'll find out I disobeyed them, as they'll insist on helping me with my taxes because they think I'm too dumb to figure it out on my own. Once they find out, I'll be cut off in a dramatic fight that's sure to emotionally damage me and be fodder for my therapist for a month. But I can't afford college on my own. I can take out student loans perhaps, but I'll be moving in/possibly getting married to my boyfriend soonish, and I don't want that debt to turn into his responsibility. Plus, unless I'm mistaken, that won't cover my housing.

So, TL;DR: do I stay with my narc parents and give up an amazing internship position so they continue paying for my college education, or do I get kicked out and become dirt poor?

6z52fr,107,2017-09-09,Breathing new life into bad rings!,Lulink,RotMG,https://www.reddit.com/r/RotMG/comments/6z52fr/breathing_new_life_into_bad_rings/,"First of all, what do you think of the snake eye ring?  
It sucks, right? Good! because it should, since it it uncommon at best.

But wouldn't it be great if it had more potential? Wouldn't it be great if there was a ring with the same stats except viable? What about the Crystal Bone ring? The Spider Eye ring? The Ring of Faith?

Well, here is my idea:  
Each low tier UT ring would have a stronger counter-part.  
You get it by completing a tinkerer quest (one random ring per day) requiring the base ring and a certain number of marks of the corresponding dungeon.

EG: A Snake Eye Ring and 3 Stheno marks would turn into a Ring of the Cobra.

Additionally, I would add a ring to the Limon's loots because I feel like we need to have enough ""starter"" rings to make this interesting and there aren't enough ""sprite world items"" (only the sprite wand looks like it comes from the sprite world.

And here are the stats I propose:  

 * The Spider Eye Ring (3VIT 3 WIS) turns into the **Ring of Arthropods** (4DEF 4VIT 4WIS)

 * The Snake Eye Ring (3ATK 3SPD) turns into the **Ring of the Cobra** (4DEF 5ATK 4SPD)

 * The Crystal Bone Ring (3DEX 3WIS) turns into the **Ring of the Lost Civilization** (40MP 5DEX 4WIS)

 * The Ring of Divine Faith (5VIT 5WIS) turns into the **Ring of Miracles** (30HP 30MP 6VIT 6 WIS)

 * The **NEW** Sprite Ring of Magic (40MP 3SPD) turns into the **Ring of the Intern** (4DEF 60MP 4SPD)

[And here are the designs!](https://i.imgur.com/HL8F7JD.png)  
Because... Seriously... Who wouldn't wear a ring themed after their favorite character?

I'd like to hear your thoughts!  
I personally think my sprites are almost all decent enough, but I'm not too sure about the stats...  
Oh and if you don't like my idea at all, please tell me why this new type of quest is bad.


**TL;DR:** The low tier UT rings can be upgraded through Tinkerer quests with marks."

He never showed up for my appointment, his supervisor called later and said he's on personal leave, but it's an indefinite personal leave. She cancelled all future appointments and said he'll call me if he can see me again. I'm losing it. What if he doesn't come back? How do I cope without my therapist? I've seen him for a bit over a year and a half so I've come to really trust him, and he's been there through suicide attempts, leaving an abusive relationship, trips to rehab and the hospital; everything that's happened. I can't just get a new therapist like my family and roommates tell me. I very likely won't find another DBT therapist I can afford in my city, so I'm going to have to go to a community place probably and work with some student that will just move on when their internship is over. I never even got to say goodbye to him so there's no closure. I'm self destructing. Everything we had worked on is blowing up. I'm back to suicidal ideation, binge eating, self-harming and just not caring. Fuck everything, why even bother trying when I lost my support. I'm alone, nobody understands how devastating this is. I've been crying so much since I found out. I feel abandoned by everybody. I have IOP Monday, but why bother going? I'm supposed to have a therapist though while I'm in the group, and I no longer have one. I just feel abandoned and like I'm going to explode if I don't find someone I can talk to who understands this. Yet I simultaneously feel ridiculous for caring so much and being so upset, because I don't want to depend on anybody (after all everybody leaves in the end). I'm starting to lose control and all of these feelings are too strong. It hurts so much and I can't even use DBT skills to get this under control. Has anybody else dealt with this kind of situation?

You get all dolled up, hair up in a tight bun, thick-rimmed glasses, a tight well-cut suit jacket and pencil skirt perfectly designed to both show off your curves and present a professional faced, and then instead of working with any of the partners in the firm they stick you in a small room with some jumped up ganger with delusions of grandeur as a client and an absentee first year lawyer as a supervisor. 

Sure they had done some, I pause in my internal rant to check through the list of potential charges, holy shit, okay all of the crimes, and running one of the largest gangs in the city was kind of cool in its own right, but really how am I supposed to make a good impression on my higher ups if none of them are working on this case with me? Not that this is even a case, just the firm you have on retainer touching base about any potential litigation we may have to prepare for … and people wonder why lawyers are seen as the bad guys …

Just to look professional I skim through the papers in front of me again, shuffling them a little bit, before looking up at you, my blue eyes carefully considering your face across the desk.

“So what can we do for you today?” I’m pretty sure I got the right amount of chipper in my tone to hide some of the boredom but … you don’t look exactly fooled. 

_______________________________________________
So this idea is a little half-formed after an evening enjoying some retro gaming with Saint Rows 2 (is that old enough to be retro now?). The general idea is that a law student sort of riding out her summer internship meets the leader of one of the larger gangs in the city and they eventually corrupt her from prim and proper law student to tattooed gang slut.

I’m open to any kinks where I don’t have to be dominant, but the one I’m insisting on including is some kind of -ification or corruption (slutification, bimbofication, ect.). 

I’m also more than happy to flesh this out before starting or just jumping in. Special attention will be given to females or futa but I’m open for business to anyone tonight.

Anyway, hope to hear from you pervs soon,

*SEPTEMBER 9TH*

“I’m afraid I can’t let you leave,” a voice resonated through the basement chamber. One of the Insurrectionists tried the door once more, but to no avail. A man then stepped out from behind one of the missile stacks. “I told you, you can’t leave,” he said sternly, but with an oddly friendly tone. “Now that you know our secret, I can’t let you go out and tell everybody. You were never supposed to find this.” “Our secret?”, one of the Insurrectionists questioned. “Who the hell are you, anyway?” The man responded, “You know who I am. I started all of this. The company, the war, all of it. There was always an endgame, and I needed to create a diversion.” The Insurrectionists were puzzled before they clued in that this was the man who owned Solstice Inc. But their confusion was still very apparent. “An endgame?”, one of them asked. “What the fuck are you talking about?” The owner stared the Insurrectionist directly in the eye. “You’ll find out, in due time.” He turned and walked away. As he did, he spoke into what appeared to be a comm unit on his wrist. “Get down here.”  The team of Insurrectionists hadn’t the slightest idea what was happening, or of what the owner was talking about. Their only concern now was escaping the chamber.

Back upstairs amongst the fighting, one of the Administrators received a message. “Get down here.” The next step of the plan was beginning. They rounded up a couple of their colleagues, and began to head down to the basement. The building was much more open than it was before, and the fighting had begun to slow as fewer employees remained. As they passed through one of the atriums, however, they witnessed /u/Pandanspongecake being held at gunpoint by multiple masked assailants, before they were executed. The Administrators paid no mind, though, as they had more important matters to attend to. They continued into the corridor until they reached the passage, and found the bodies of two more fallen employees just before the entrance to the stairwell. They identified one of them as the Insurrectionist leader. They glanced at each other with arrogant smirks.

The team of Administrators entered the chamber. They then heard the voice of their boss call out from behind the missile stack. “Over here!” They followed the voice, and found that behind the stack was another small flight of stairs leading down into a small office. Inside the office was the squad of Insurrectionists, bound and sitting on the floor against the wall. The team of Admins entered the room purposefully. The owner gave them a nod. One of the Admins pulled out their pistol. However, before he could make a move, they heard a sound coming from the top of the stairs to the office. They turned and saw that they had been followed by /u/ayaa96. No risks could be taken. With one shot, she was picked off before tumbling down the stairs. Moments later however, /u/spludgiexx, one of the Administrators, collapsed. In the panic of the moment, the shot that was taken was careless, and the bullet had passed through her chest before hitting its target.

 An eerie silence filled the room.

I hope you are all well. I was hoping to find a hot older sugar daddy to take me out on nice dates and holidays abroad all in exchange for my tight teen body. I will play as a college girl who has an expensive lifestyle but no money at all.

You can play as a hot older man with a big wallet, a big sex drive and an even bigger dick. Come on guys what older man does want a horny teen sucking and fucking his big cock, telling him how great he is.

I can be one of your daughter's best mates, a student, an intern, a neighbor, a college girl in a bar or maybe on a beach (love a nude beach), tbh any ideas I'm up for it x

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

I have a huge girl crush on Dani Mathers, Sam Blacky, Tammy Hebrow, basically any hot blonde so would love to play as them!

Anyone who sends a hot gif or pic of who they want me to play as or to include in the scene wins bonus points

Look forward to playing, obviously all stuff will be 18+ on the ages x"

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls
The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I'm posting on this sub, because I normally feel this is a supporting and understanding bunch. Hope that's ok!

I'm your typical girl, in her mid-twenties, feeling like she's going through what is hopefully your typical mid-twenties crisis. Like the title says, I have this nagging feeling that I am constantly out of place, even with the people that I love the most. I'll explain briefly!

I'm originally from a countryside town, a very small one at that where everyone knows each other. I always felt this was too small a place for me, given that I am quite ambitious and am always striving too improve myself and achieve my goals. My family is pretty humble, so that was always very motivating for me. I went to college in a bigger city, which was wonderful to really open my eyes to new people and experiences. I met my lovely boyfriend there and we've been together for 6 years now! In college, I had awesome grades, which allowed me to get an internship in an area I liked, in the big city! That internship turned into a job in the same company, where I've been for the past three years. The company has its shortcomings, of course, but the pay has been improving based on my performance, I love what I do, I love my team and I feel valued and like I play an important role there.

What is the problem, then? The problem is that, despite all I've achieved, I feel immensely out of place in every part of my life: 

* With my family and hometown friends, it feels like I can't quite explain to them how complex my job is or how important it is for me to go to concerts, travel and read books, or the little things about living in the city. Life is simpler here and, at the same time, I love that, I miss that and sometimes I'm even jealous of not being able to lead the slow-paced life they're able to. When I'm with them, I feel sad that I'm ambitious (ridiculous??!), because that brings unecessary stress to my life and I could lead such a fulfilling, homely life here.

* When I'm with friends from college who have continued in academia (the vast majority of them), I always feel subliminally undermined for being in the corporate world. For being good at it and discussing it passionately, at times. It's like they're the amazing bastions of knowledge and I'm the greedy consultant, leading a boring 9-to-5 which oh my, sometimes extends into a 6, a 7 or an 8! To what? To return to my boyfriend, in a two-bedroom in the suburbs. How tragic! (you get the idea?)

* With my friends from the city and from work, well, I really feel like I have more in common and I'm generally comfortable around them. They're seldom the issue. It's again, that feeling that the city life was never meant for me and that go through an unecessary amount of stress, spend an excessive amount of money and chase dreams that I'm not really sure are that much worth it or if I'm just going with the flow. I have little time to spend with them and little energy to develop any hobbies.

So, you know, major identity crisis! I've been to therapy before, for my insecurity and anxiety, and I can tell you from the outset that this is something that could probably benefit from talking with someone professional. But I'm also aware that all this questioning and all of this self-doubt is a part of the process of growing up. I'm ""venting"" here in the hopes of exchanging one or two ideas with the lovely ladies who are going through or have gone through the same. What has helped you figure yourself out and your place in the world?

Thanks a lot in advance for your patience and understanding."
6z87m0,2,2017-09-10,118 Day Nofap Journey,NetherMink,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6z87m0/118_day_nofap_journey/,"Hello Everyone, 
Thought I would share my Nofap journey since I'm coming up on 120 days.

It all started back in April, I had been fapping every day for the past three months consistently and looking at porn about once or twice a week. My internship ended halfway through and I was sitting around not really looking for a new job, mostly playing video games and relax. Overall, feeling kinda shitty and depressed. On the 17th of April, I was on some website with pirated movies and was watching some sex scenes. Halfway through the scene, I was bored and didn't even want to fap. At that moment I decided that it was time to stop fapping for good. I'm a 26 year old male and fapping didn't have the same appeal of when I was younger, time for me to grow. I had tried to quit before with some success. Previously, I had stopped fapping for the first semester in college and then for a mission trip. I was uncomfortable fapping in the dorms with a roommate around, but eventually I returned to my old habits. 

This time it was going to different. I needed to convince myself that it was going to be different this time otherwise why would I even try. At that moment, I decided to tryout the Fortify program and spent $40 on it. The program was alright, it was mostly focused on pornography addiction. I didn't consider myself a porn addict. I would occasionally google search for some sexually explicit content on a weekly basis. The fortify course wasn't as useful as I hoped it would be. Most of the materials are short videos and journaling activities. I didn't care much for the journaling, eventually I skipped it altogether. The videos were alright, most of them had content I had previously seen on the internet. One of the best videos was on S.M.A.R.T. goals. Would highly recommend googling S.M.A.R.T. goals. I really like the battle tracker, it gave me a sense of accomplishment. I would stay up every night past midnight to track my progress for the day.

I was good for about two weeks and then the urges got really strong. I caved, watched some porn, thought I was alright, stopped watching, couple of hours later I masturbated. My mind was playing tricks on me and convinced me that if I didn't masturbate with my hands it didn't count. After I relapsed I binged and felt terrible. This is when I came to the realization that battle trackers (streak counters) are a dead end. They don't truly reflect the progress you've made. They tell you, ""your a failure and you're no better off than when you started."" They give you an excuse to binge once you've fail. They reinforce the cycle of addiction.

From that moment on I decided to not care about streaks. Instead I would look to what I was before Nofap, a daily fapper, and compare it with the frequency of my habit now. I started a spreadsheet to individually track my porn, masturbation, and orgasm habits. Every time I peeked, edged, or orgasm I would write it down. I haven't masturbated since then, at least according to my definitions.

In order to track my success first had to define my success. I setup working definition of constitutes use of porn, masturbation, and orgasm. 
Porn: Seeking out sexually explicit content or nudity.
Masturbation: Touching or rubbing the genitals.
Orgasm: Blowing my load.

After I defined what failure was, it was much easier to track my success. Over the past 3 months I've had 2 slip-ups looking at porn. I was at a Barnes and Noble and I looked at a book with some photographs of naked women and the other time one of my coworkers showed me a video a naked woman pooping out eggs (wtf?).

As for masturbation, I've stayed true to the definition and I haven't touched or rubbed myself down there. However, there has been couple of times I came close. A couple of weeks ago I was trying to get off by rubbing my nipples, but I just couldn't do it. I lost a lot of precum and felt terrible. Since then I try not to touch my nips as much as possible.

Since I binged in May I haven't had any orgasms, just couple of wet dreams around the 40-60 day mark. I don't mind wet dreams because wake up in the next morning feeling refreshed, unless of course it's dream about relapsing then it doesn't feel that great.

I have a link to the spreadsheet I've been using. I recently updated my excel file to include a current, longest, and average streak calculator to track my progress. Feel free to copy and use for yourself.

6z8oo4,2,2017-09-10,Economics degree questions,KevinT2122,economy,https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/6z8oo4/economics_degree_questions/,"I have just started taking an economics class (Micro/Macro AP) and I find it very interesting. I understand that there is so much more to economics than this entry level type class but also whenever I watch or read the news anything about the economy is what is most interested in. Because of these reasons I am considering getting a degree in economics but I have a few questions. 

Another thing to add is that my dad is pushing my towards a computer science degree and having taken 4 classes on this topic I am not 100% sure if this is what I would like to be doing for the rest of my life so if anybody can compare and contrast between the two degrees when I ask my questions that would be very helpful. I know that in the end it’s ultimately my decision but I would like to also be comfortable with my decision when I make it. 

My current plan is to become an economist  for the government. 


Do you need to go to a top tier college? Like most jobs it’s obviously better to go to the best university you can possibly go to but is economics a career where you need to go to the absolute best if you want to get a good job? My top two colleges are Penn State and University of Wisconsin and one website had them ranking in the top 25 for economics. For computer science since there is so many job openings as long as you keep your grades up it doesn’t seem to be as important as other degrees.


2. How is the job market? I’ve read that the field is growing at an above average rate but will I be able to get a job right out of college? For computer science job opportunities are thrown at you. I doubt it is a similar situation because the tech industry is booming but is it at least favorable. Also how hard is it to acquire an internship? 

3. What amount of education is needed? Some articles i’ve read say you need a masters other say a bachelor is enough to get a government job.

4. What is the typical salary for entry level and future positions? I know that salary isn’t everything in life but I would still like to know. For computer science you receive paid internships an entry level positions starting from around 80k and future positions can lead to 150k+. 

5. Like I said before my current plan is to become an economist for the government. Would I start at local/state governments or is it possible to go straight to national?  Also if somebody could briefly describe the work environment that would be very helpful. 

6. What are the other type of careers can I pursue with this degree that might meet my needs?

Thank you so much for your help in advance!

Obviously everybody is different, and there are many paths to becoming an established film and television writer, so I guess I'll start with some background if that helps.

I'm 23, live in Canada, graduated film school two years ago with a BFA (basically meaningless, I know) During that time I wrote and directed a *very* crappy five minute short, and wrote a series bible &amp; one hour pilot for my thesis. In hindsight I should have chosen to direct another, better, short for my thesis. I left school having learned a lot about producing, writing, directing, editing, etc; but never truly felt like the four years were worth it. Totally willing to accept that I just didn't understand how to make the most of it at the time, and that's on me.

I've spent the last two years 'dailying' on various film and television sets around the city, primarily in the Grip and Set Dec departments - always very low level and never for more than two weeks on one production.

I have known for a long time that I want to be a writer / director / show runner, and have done enough research to have some idea of how to get there.

I've written nine pilots and two features, all have a one page' and many have detailed and fleshed out bibles. I hired an editor who I trust with many years of experience in film and television. Together we went through and identified the five 'strongest' projects and edited them to a point where we both agreed they were the 'best' they could be. **I know** this is not a lot of stuff, and am in no way trying to say I've done enough work to *deserve* anything, just want to be as detailed as possible here.

**BUT** recent experiences have left me feeling unsure. Which brings us to the meat of the question. (If you've read this far, thanks)

I attended TIFF this year with a Conference Pass and have attended as many of the talks and workshops as possible. I've learned a lot but would be lying if I said it isn't a little bit demoralizing. Everybody there seems so successful and accomplished at such a young age; everyone seems to have made multiple shorts and independent features and win all these awards. I'm hearing people speak who attended writer's fellowships and on and on and on. I'm just left with the impression I'm out of my league.

I know grip and set dec are not the paths to success as a writer, despite being amazing jobs in their own right, it just feels like a dead end for what I want to do career wise. I've always seen the first step as getting an agent / manager. But have no idea how to get it into anyone's hands short of cold e-mails (which I did with one script and one page a few months back but heard nothing (obviously).

I've done some script coverage for people's work in the past, and am thinking of applying to every single agency I can as a reader or whatever. I am no longer in a position where an unpaid internship is feasible and I don't even know whether they pay people for those sorts of jobs. I know the prevailing advice is to get to L.A, and I know this is good advice, I won't argue it, but I just cannot afford it even within two years. Even at 23 it feels by then it'd be too late anyways.

Then I thought about trying to get into the director's guild as an AD and working my way up so I'm closer to the more 'above the line' folks. Currently I'm never able to speak to anyone like that really. I'd love to speak to a script supervisor or even the on set reader about how they went about getting their job but everybody always seems too busy and I'd hate for my first impression to be bothering them.

I was told in one of the Q&amp;A sessions by a writer that winning multiple contests with a screenplay is a good way of getting it read, I've always been hesitant of sending my work to contests because the general consensus online is that they generally aren't worth it and *don't* get you any closer to being read. Have I been misinformed? Have I set myself back by not applying to more contests this past year?

I don't know. There's so much information out there, I'm pretty overwhelmed. I know it takes time and people spend years, even decades trying to 'make it'. But I know in my heart this is what I want to do and I'll write hundreds more scripts and one pages if I have to. I'm just pretty down because it seems short of tracking down a producer and directing these scripts myself, nobody is ever going to notice.

I'm just wondering if anybody has any advice in terms of focusing myself to best achieve my goals. How did you do it? Am I on the right track with any of my ideas? I know this is all over the place, as I'm kind of all over the place right now. 

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer, and for reading this monster. "

I shared my story here before but quick overview: I'm having a hard time finding a full time job in marketing despite having graduated with a degree in it and completing two internships. My mom forced me to go back to school for nursing and every day she bullies me and berates me for getting a marketing degree and tells me I will never get a job in that field. She also threatens to throw me out of the house at least every week if I drop out of school. 

Everyday I just think about calling her a dumb bitch once I finally get a job. I just think about the dumb look she'll get on her face and how sad she'll be that I won't be a nurse and that she wasted so much money on classes. The icing on the top of the cake is calling her a bitch and then calling her a bitch every day until I can afford to move out. Then I'll never talk to her again. 

I think about this a lot, but I know it's bad to do. Like I know it's really mean of me to belittle her the way she constantly belittles me. How do I overcome this? How can I be the bigger person? 

I'm Hindu, so karma is a pretty big deal to me. I don't want bad karma from calling my mom names, but at the same time, I just want to hurt her. I want to hurt her the way she hurts me. 

How do you stay above it? How do you stay being the better person?"

I did and while the first month was rough and I stalled I had a 9 pound whoosh and then the weight started to drop. I was under a ton of stress, working 60 hours a week, planning a wedding, and also doing my masters internship at the same time. I ended up getting a new job and have completed my masters, and in less than 2 months will get married. The problem is a couple weeks ago I let myself break keto for the first real time for my bridal shower and haven't been able to get back into it. It just kinda snowballed... well I've already broken, I'm going to try these new flavor of chips, I'm already out I'm going to have some gluten free pizza... and so on. I can feel how crappy I feel. It's like my insides are congested and I've gone from 196 to 204, and my starting weight was 243. I really need to recommit to my ketosis because it was such a big game changer, it helped with my migraines and my energy, it made my life easier in so many ways, and my fiance was onboard and any time I ""cheat"" he does too. :/ "
6z99ex,21,2017-09-10,"Moving to a higher caliber restaurant, but actually aa slower station than before. Am I stagnating?",cash_grass_or_ass,Chefit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/6z99ex/moving_to_a_higher_caliber_restaurant_but/,"I'm moving from a 30 ish % GFS ready made family restro to a 90+ % scratch trattoria.

Background information:

I have about 15 months professional experience as a line cook.  I just finished culinary school as well. First 3 jobs were at garde at a Spanish tapas bar, then prep cook at a fine dining Cajun (internship for school), then garde at an international tapas restaurant.

I decided to leave the international tapas restaurant because there are too many dishes, or components of dishes that come pre made from GFS: I can't learn from prep if so many things comes half cooked already.

So I applied at the trattoria for garde, did my stage, and unfortunately was offered a position of deli which is even lower than garde.  The chef explained to me that my knife skills, as well as general organization,  though precise, is too slow. But, he likes my attitude, work ethic, ambition, and knowledge base. So he's telling me deli is the training grounds, and I'll possibly get promoted up to garde in as little as 3 months.

So I'm starting to second guess this decision, as a friend not in the industry is berating me for ""still being in the same position after a year."" He also accused me of being not ambitious enough, and cites how he in his only restaurant job of 8 months managed moved through all the stations and eventually did expo at a corporate kitchen sports bar- Shoeless Joe's to be exact.

The way I see it, the wealth of knowledge I can learn increases exponentially when you move up in caliber of cuisine- like a MacDonald hamburger, to a corporate chain such as a TGIF, to a Ritz Carlton hamburger. So I don't mind taking a detour if I'll learn more things


How I found this job was, I submitted my cv to the recruiting agency. We didn't discuss what position I am eligible for, and the recruiter forwarded my application to her clients.  One of her clients responded with an opening in garde.

Please advise on whether I'm selling myself short by not focusing on moving up from garde as my #1 priority, as opposed to finding the best restaurant I can be hired at based on my current experience."
6z9l2k,21,2017-09-10,I networked hard and landed an incredible internship.,poookz,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/6z9l2k/i_networked_hard_and_landed_an_incredible/,"Hello friends.

A short amount of time ago, I was at a tech conference marking the opening of a new technical education building in my area. Attendance was required as a heavily weighted grade in my Cisco Networking class. There was a 30 minute panel about how raising public awareness for the tech field was important and vital to economic growth. There were 5 panelists, each of them a mid-high ranking businessman/tech-spert. There was the the guy in charge of IT at a large local university, an executive from Lockheed-Martin, two other large corporations, and the CIO of the Department of Justice

At the end of the panel, there was a Q&amp;A session. My teacher requested that I ask a generic question and thank them from our local community college. I commented on how most of the talk was about large nation-wide awareness, state level laws, and university policies, and how those all felt out of control for aspiring students. I asked if any of the panelists had recommendations for students like us about career advice, how to distinguish oneself from other job candidates, that kind of thing.

They were all very engaging and spent about 5 minutes talking about their opinions and career advice. As they closed up, as another event was scheduled and starting, one of them said that I was welcome to come talk to him more personally in a few minutes.

I did, and my teacher came with me. We spent another 20 minutes or so chit-chatting about relevant topics, and it was a great conversation. The previously mentioned CIO of the DoJ walked by and joined the conversation. Super engaging and interesting talk. A few minutes later, he said he had to leave to eat lunch with one of our two senators, who was also at the conference and invited me to come along.

I now have an internship with a contracting company for the DoJ, started a few weeks ago. It's going incredibly well and I'm learning so much. The best part is that they're paying me. It's incredible.

This is the first real job I've ever had, having worked previously in a dorm on campus and at a local fast food joint. I have an extremely smart mentor and I'm doing real work that has value. It's entry level and I'm the least intelligent person in the building, but I'm learning more than I learn in the college classroom. I'm developing contacts, meeting lots of people, and having a blast. I love my job.

I just wanted to share, and honestly brag a bit. This is one of the best things that has ever happened to me and I've been very happy for the last 6 weeks :)

Thank you for reading."
6z9ocy,8,2017-09-10,"She's texting me ""I miss you"" after our hookup fizzled out. How do I go forward?",mauswrangler11,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/6z9ocy/shes_texting_me_i_miss_you_after_our_hookup/,"Long story short, I met a girl at the end of last semester, and things moved fast. Over summer though, our communication dropped off. Pretty much stopped talking the last month. I was kind of peeved about it cause it was largely on her end -- sure she was busy w her summer internship, but she basically showed zero initiative.


Back on campus, I ran into her and she asked if we could catch up. I said yes, so we planned on coffee. Everything went well, and we talked a while before I dropped her off. We've been talking again since coffee, but I stopped texting/snapping after I asked her out to a date party and she couldn't go. She seemed bummed she couldn't.

I get a message from her a week after I stopped talking, some meaningless question about something we talked about and I replied pretty abruptly and teased her on some stuff. Kind of being a dick. She replies something equally sarcastic and I don't respond.

Out of the blue she just goes: 
""Okay hi.
I have nothing to say I just miss you.""

She's been texting and snapping everyday since then.

How do I go forward on this? I honestly feel like a girl that only takes initiative when I cut her off really isn't worth the time. Am I wrong to be skeptical on giving a second chance?"

However, I want OUT. Since I've graduated at the age of 22 I've been a waiter and a retail salesman. Although my degree has provided me the opportunity to move up to management, I'v done the jobs for the money and the experience. I look at my bosses and see that I'm headed to be a retail manger where I'll remain for decades maybe my entire career. I'm grateful to have come form little and have come this far. Its GREAT stability but its not for me. Here at home I just report for work, save money and study for GMAT and feel like I'm waiting for some opportunity. Thing is, there is nothing, no one and I want more purpose to fill in the gaps with. I don't have any real special skills like languages, or technical skills but have leadership experience and sales which is probably how I've achieved this much.

What I really want is a corporate role with something more purposeful, pay that will allow me to build a family on financial stability, legit responsibilities, achievements, travel ect. In school I was a communications intern for 2 years (low pay but it put money in my pocket). The best time I'v had was moving out to Florida for 3 months during semester break away from home to flip pizzas, hang with kids from all over and just live. I have a general interest in entertainment, communications, marketing, promotional materials, and business leadership with great benefits. I'v had a stint learning to code with Python and scripting, but never got that far.  To be honest Im not sure what I wouldn't like to do, but I know its not retail management or a floor salesman.
 
So earlier this year I did a EXTENSIVE job search because I'm able to move now with the money i'v saved and am willing to go wherever as long as it doesn't lead me down the road to homelessness and poverty and I can earn more than 50k with a fulfilling life. I'v tried small and LARGE companies, marketing to management roles to finance roles. In-state, Out of state, out of country, and the only response I've received was for retail management AGAIN but just with a 50k salary. After 1 month of working while getting closer to 26 I know that this is not where I would like to be and I'm still searching for more, comrades, challenges, travels.

Right now, I'm studying for GMAT to pursue my MBA in hopes of finding and earning opportunities through the boost said document would provide. 

However, I happened to look into my family history to realize how much of my family have served. (Father, uncle, grandfather, brother, great uncle, etc and all at a younger age than I currently am). So I gave it a look and would consider OCS in hopes to move into a branch such as Intelligence which goes well with a business degree once my service is up. Although, thats just my opinion, I dont know for sure. In fact, I'm not sure if anything would be waiting for me once I leave service.

 I would love to get out of here and serve in the ARMY and see the world, but I do have reservations. Here it is, the main question I'm fight with is...........""Will 4 years in service do more for my career than 4 more years of civilian life?"" I understand the huge honor it would bring and if I had the luxury of just cutting out four years of my life just to serve for the heck of it and come home to handouts in the form of a trust fund and jobs, I probably would, but I really have to look after my self. I'm not sure how it would work out, but I'm concerned if joining the Army would just kill what career I do have. I don't mean harm by it but I'm not a med student going in to be a medical or a engineer student going in to be an engineer. If that were true, Military is fantastic. However, I chose marketing and the Army is not recruiting me as a specialty which means I could land anywhere doing anything unrelated which could kill my career once I return back to civilian life. 

Ideally, intelligence or communications would be a boost but I'm not guaranteed.

I'm just looking at my options here. Experience wise, Army would be another experience I look back on an would'nt regret a thing. However, I could return from duty and not have a career or relatable experience to explain to hiring managers at corporations. Leadership experience is great, but also relatable job skills are needed. Again. my main struggle is..""Will 4 years in service do more for my career than 4 more years of civilian life?""

thanks. 



ps...could you guys touch on things such as pay as a OCS candidate, and housing allowances? As a civilian I can barely afford an apartment on the east coast, but maybe soldiers have it better cut out for them.

For two, I'm a computer science student that's already pretty swamped with classwork, and I don't know if I would be able to juggle both that and being in a corps.

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

After a boring internship, the company decided to hire me, paying me a shitty wage of 10$/hour. After one year of being loyal to the company and where people who were less skilled than me got 4 times my salary, I decided to ask for a raise. One week later I was fired.

I decided to start my own company in e-commerce. As of right now I will be a millionaire by the end of next year.

I do not like consumerism etc, and I don't want people to know that I am rich. - But somehow I keep buying bottles in the club, for me the bottles are cheap but for my friends the bottles are expensive. I feel like they will take an advantage of this situation and only hang out with me because of my money from now on.

The truth is, I don't give a fuck about money and love spending it if it makes the situation better, i.e.; drinks in the club will make everyone happier overall. But I feel it would make me look like a beta bucks of the group?

Furthermore, my investments are solid, so that's not a problem. I will probably hit 10 mill within the year after I become a millionaire.

*SEPTEMBER 10TH*

The small office in the secret chamber below Solstice Inc. was silent. /u/spludgiexx, the President of the company, lay dead on the floor. The body of /u/ayaa96 was a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs leading into the office. The team of Administrators stood in shock as the Insurrectionists looked up at them. The owner of the company slowly began to pace the room with heavy, foreboding steps.

Upstairs in one of the atriums, /u/dancingonfire was walking through the aftermath of the fighting that had taken place their. Bodies were strewn about, as well as bullet casings and bloodstains amongst the collateral debris. She was alone, and decided to take a moment to herself to eat. She had a small backpack that she kept with her, which she opened up and pulled out a container of pasta. She sat down against one of the walls and sighed deeply as she tried to relax. She removed the lid from the container, and out of her pack she then took a fork. She stabbed it into the bowl, and began to twirl it, watching absently as the noodles wrapped around the fork. She took a bite, and immediately knew that something was wrong. Whether it was in the taste, or just a gut instinct, she began to panic before breaking out into a coughing fit. She came to accept that she had been poisoned as she struggled to breathe between coughs. Soon, she collapsed. /u/dancingonfire was dead. Soon afterwards, /u/MoseCarver came through the same atrium and found what they believed was a perfectly good bowl of pasta, not connecting the noodles with the dead person laying right beside them. They scooped up the bowl, and began to eat. Within minutes, /u/MoseCarver had also pasta-way.

#Post Body:

I have an internship interview with them next week but I'm currently on holiday. Posting this from my phone. My interview is (sort of) the same day I land so I have no prep time apart from maybe in the hotel the night before depending on when I arrive there. Or on the plane but sleep should probably be priority there.

Anyway, why do you want to work for Exxon? I read something a few weeks ago about them burying a climate change study a few years back and I feel like I'm always hearing similar stuff. Is it acceptable to say I want to make a change in one of the biggest O&amp;amp;G companies in the world or will they laugh and burn me as a heretic/outsider?

Do i go generic and just talk about what their values say on the front page of the website?

Thanks

I have worked in downstream, upstream, and midstream of oil and gas. Always company side, never service side (IE never worked Haliburton, EPC, etc.)

&amp;nbsp;

Most oil companies, if not all, are great companies to work for. 

&amp;nbsp;

Some keypoints why to not work for ExxonMobil:
&amp;nbsp; 

* They deferred maintenance at their former Torrance refinery. The former Torrance refinery was notorious for having bad morale, equipment not working, and other issues.
&amp;nbsp; 

+ They don't pay bonuses. ExxonMobil is notorious for giving a high salary, but no bonuses. Your total compensation is much better than your base salary. I will say, my previous employer paid better than XOM as it includes a bonus with XOM base equivalent.
&amp;nbsp;

+ Most oil companies give a pension, 401(k) match and other benefits. I wouldn't look solely at the amount, as vesting schedule takes into effect. As far as I know, COP pays the highest 401k match, an effective 9% whereas XOM is 7%.
&amp;nbsp;

+ Lots of oil companies are run by engineers. CVX's new CEO (with JW out), Wirth, comes from downstream.
&amp;nbsp;

+ ExxonMobil is known for forced rankings. Most oil companies are forced rankings. I have heard CVX was the most laid back with forced rankings but this may no longer be the case.

&amp;nbsp;

Some keypoints why to work for ExxonMobil:
&amp;nbsp;

* Working for an oil and gas will be challenging.  XOM is the largest of the large. You will be given a lot of responsibility, and expected to perform.
&amp;nbsp;

+ You will be paid a handsome salary. Most oil and gas pay fairly well.
&amp;nbsp;

+ You will be given chances to relocate elsewhere. XOM has locations everywhere.
&amp;nbsp;

+ It looks good on the resume."
6zcrgf,2,2017-09-10,Nervous about a study visit at a second-hand shop in the morning,Eravohn991,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/6zcrgf/nervous_about_a_study_visit_at_a_secondhand_shop/,"And by in the morning I mean 6 hours.

I met with a psychologist with a focus on jobs from the unemployment center and she said that there's no wonder why I'm indecisive about what I want to do since I haven't really done anything.

So she set up a little study visit (if I'm saying that right) to check out a second-hand shop. If I like it I'll get an unpaid internship there for about a month.

She mentioned that the people that work there are nice and that some of them had mental disabilities (I don't remember how she worded it but it was in a nice way which felt comforting).

I'm a bit nervous about it. Wherever I think about having to work or my future I get depressed. And I hate the feeling of having somewhere to be. Etc. 

Been up planning my bus route etc to make sure I get there in time and stuff. I'll get about 5 hours of sleep which seems normal when I have to be somewhere early (11 am. I sleep at like 5 am..)

She said I get to decide whether or not I want to have my internship there but I think I'm gonna say yes no matter what. Partially because I think I will have to make a decision when I'm there; when I go yo similar things then everything feels good and I'm a bit proud of myself for doing something. It's only hours after when I come down from my high that I think about the reality of the situation and become way less excited about it. But also partially because I have to do something. And a second-hand shop sounds like a good place to start.

Going back to the romanticized version in my head; it's a nice place. A second hand shop. Old stuff. Cheap stuff. Helping people kinda. And the fact that she said mentally disabled (again a better phrasing I can't remember) people work there I feel more comfortable. 

Anyway.. Yeah. I always ramble too much sorry.. Maybe I should sleep and get that 4 hour 25 minute rest.. And see what happens tomorrow.I

I got a good internship and went crazy with my spending not realizing I wouldnt be able to pay everything back right away. Now I'm trying to set myself straight but need help on planning what to pay first.

Here are my current debts:
 * Capital One CC (24%) - $2700/$3000

 * Chase CC 2 (20%) - $3900/$3500

 * Chase CC 1 (no interest will March)- $400/$500

Here are my monthly expenses:

* Chase CC 1 - $25 until March then interest payments

* Capital One CC - last charge was $90

* Chase CC 2 - Last charge was $125

* Car Payment  (17%) - $250 monthly, $9797 left to pay

* Phone - $40

* Insurance - $200

* Apple Music - $5

* TOTAL: $520 + (Minimum payments of Capital One CC and Chase 2 CC)

Income:

* ~$840 every 2 weeks

* $200 school refund check which I should get sometime November I think

* Credit Score: 605

Currently ive been paying my minimum on all my cards except for the Capital One where I will throw extra money when I can to lower the balance. Once thats gone im going to the Chase with 20% and do the same. Should I continue doing this or is there something else I can do? I was thinking of trying to consolidate everything into one loan but I dont know if its possible with me this deep in debt and with such a low score. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

She was my first everything, from holding hands to dates to even losing my virginity. Somewhere during the third year, due to our busy schedules we couldn't see each other as much, and we started developing interests on things that the other party didn't really like or care about. Whenever we tried to share about our experience to the other, the other party just wouldn't really care. 


Last month, we agreed on a breakup because even when we are hanging out together it's suffocating and we just aren't having fun. I was devastated, I couldn't function well and would just spend my days on the bed wasting away. I would constantly think of all the things I could have done right to prevent the breakup, and waste hours each day. I started my internship (office job) last week, and I hoped that it would take my focus away from the breakup, but it didn't. 


I learnt that she has found another man that makes her really happy, and I can't get rid of the thought. Everyday images of them being happy together clings onto my brain and I lose sight of everything important. I regret everything that I've done wrong and just hope that I can rewind time. Some times I wind up pathetically talking to her hoping I can get some conclusion or relief out of this whole thing, but it always makes me feel worse in the end.


I have tried hanging out with friends, going out, gaming, working out. They provide temporary relief, but at the end of the day I fall back into the pit of despair.

I am here because I want to know what I can or should do to get myself to a state where I can function independently without having the past crush me every time.


TL;DR: Broke up with long term gf due to mutual reasons, regret the breakup because I could have done better, waste hours everyday thinking, finds out gf found a new guy, need help getting out of my slump



Edit: I still really love her, and wish her happy with the new guy, this post is a call for help and not to put down my girlfriend's actions."

I am a new hire, as an intern, and would love to pivot this blockchain payment based app to the IOTA platform, due to no fees. 

I am not shy of learning a new programming language, but where do i start?! 

What language should I learn to be able to interface their business with IOTA instead of bitcoin?

What platforms should I download to test IOTA functionality, is there a testnet, or some dev tools? Documentation?

Sorry for asking all this as a bunch, but im so keen to get started when my internship commences next week, and the CEO said he is keen on IOTA so I would love to be able to further the IOTA project by integrating it with their international money transfer app!

I really want to aim quant trading (or dev) internships (specifically Tower, DE Shaw, JSC) for my next internship after my sophomore year ends. Now after work I typically come home and go to the gym and I have around 3-4 hours that I feel I could make more use of. I'm doing questions out of leetcode, firecode.io and interviewbit for the CS side and I want to get better at those questions and I'm also thinking of doing arithmetic brain teasers (i.e. many math questions quickly in a row, finding sequences) and some Bayesian probability. I'm still a bit confused on what I should be doing now to make the next 8 months as productive as possible so that when I go back to school, I'm already ready and prepped for internship interviews. 

It did make me quite sad to be delayed a year (and be separated from my first year friends) but I really didn't have much choice given the situation. I think there could be a silver lining to this situation where I'm working in SF making decent money, going to the gym and taking care of myself and also using this extra time to get ahead of the competition and get those internships that I've always wanted.

For people that have interned at quant firms as traders (or devs) I would love to hear about your interview prep plans. I'm not sure if I should focus on improving my C++ (I guess thats more on the execution side) or if I should take a course on machine learning (I've already taken the Coursera one before), but I wanna hear your opinion on if that's a good avenue to pursue.

I did a brain teaser for Akuna and IMC before but screwed it up - don't wanna do that the second time around

A plan, websites, courses or anything really that might help me land and/or prep for interviews is appreciated. Thanks"

To introduce/add context, I didn't have the best ""life"" academically, because I got a stroke after my birth, I got brain damage so things like planning en social-emotional skills are harder for me than an everyday person. I've been to two elementary schools and two high schools (There's no ""middle school"" in the Dutch school system) instead of finishing my education in one school because schools discriminating me because of my disability and difficulty with planning, despite me being a good learner. I did get my high school degree in a normal time and I was off to college. I chose IT because I am good with fixing computers and grew up with technology

I did a level lower education (MBO3) than my degree qualified me for (My mom would call discrimination, and I used to too, but am actually grateful for doing lower first in hindsight) and got the degree in that level to go to the level I am qualified for in the first place, where I am now. Teachers have warned that the jump between the two levels are pretty big, but I didn't let that faze me for a while.

But now, the topic, that education makes me hate college in general almost. Or at least higher level (MBO4) college.

Planning things yourself, being able to sustain a much bigger load of work than the level under it and all other kinds of pressure is one of the most (Or more) important things in the education I am in now. I have to do projects that need a lot of documentation (Like deadline planning, requirement documents, drawings ect).

I am fine with writing documentation, but planning is my biggest stumble block. I have to precisely know when I am ""done"" with a certain project and how much time these parts take, and all that on my goddamn own. If that is the most deciding factor in IT, then I'm not made for this shit and if I decide to drop out, I don't know that much what to do instead of falling back on my previous degree and try to find a job with that (Although I don't have much of a shot of getting one) or search for something outside of IT that doesn't need (as much) planning. I am falling behind since April (Not that I haven't made much progress, I did and still do, but at a slower rate than expected in the cirriculum)

If it weren't for my mother who panics/gets mad I get setbacks acedemically, I would've dropped out at the end of the year. Work feels more relaxed than the school benches and during my 6-month internship two years ago, I've learned a hell of a lot more than college has ever taught me, but because of my MBO3 diploma, I can't work in many a places so I'm stuck trying to make the best of my MBO4 cirriculum until I get so stuck that I can't go any damn further

Edit: I began falling behind in April instead of Feburary, in Feb, the courses were still well sustainable, but in April everything came at me at once with planning and documentation"

* Honestly, 101K HP... need I say more?  
* **CID MISSION: Complete Suicide's Follower (++) with a FFT party that must include Ramza!** Very easy CM, all you really need is someone to summon Orlandeau OSB and she'll have about 2K HP left ;)

* This is a fairly easy fight, and with their low HP totals, you are encouraged to go the AoE route. Bringing along a AoE BSB will also help immensely.

* **CID MISSION: Complete Sworn by Steel (Ultimate++) in a party of FFT heroes only!** No 5* dancer here, so bring along Rapha with the 4* attack dance, Ramza with Full Break on the summoner, and summon Orlandeau OSB for the win.

**Notes:**    

* Zalmour is accompanied by a Monk and a Knight - however, you only need to defeat Zalmour to end the battle.  
* Everything here is 100% physical based, so you can leave Shellga/MBD at home. Zalmour can raise the adds if they are defeated with 100% HP, so I would just focus fire Zalmour.  
* It looks like the interns at DeNA were responsible for this event... 252K HP is Ultimate level, not A+. Especially after the magicite dungeons, this is literally a walk in the park.

**Notes:**    

* We are entering the era of where the Jump Start will have higher stats than the A+ battle, so I will split them out going forward.  
* Other than the slight HP/stats bump, the fight is exactly the same. Again, 303K HP is a joke, just spam your SB's and the fight will be over before you know it.

3. Lower Isilud's Magic.  

**Notes:**    

* You'll face off against Isilud along with a Knight and a Summoner - if you defeat the Knight, another will replace it, while an Archer will replace the Summoner. However, you only need to defeat Isilud here, so I would just focus on him.  
* Everything here is 100% physical based except for the Summoner's attacks. Since he uses mostly AoE's, I would devote some breaks to him to keep the damage down on your party.  
* Isilud has a couple of AoE attacks as well as an attack that reduces a party member's defense. However, his most dangerous attack is Ultimate Jump, which reduces your character to 1 HP, leaving him/her ripe for the picking. Last Stand coupled with instant cast Curagas will keep the party members relatively safe.  
* No weaknesses/resist, so feel free to use whoever you want this week!

I'm married, after all, to your older sister. That was enough of an ordeal as it was, dealing with your crazy conservative parents through that entire courtship and wedding. At least she's allowed to stay out past 10pm with me now. Seriously, there's a reason we don't visit very often.

But that's only just the tip of the iceberg. Even if I wasn't married to your sister, I'm way too old for you. At 32, your parents felt I was the right age to be a good, stable influence on your sister's life. She's 24, and they're still of the mind that a woman can't figure out how to pay a bill without male guidance. But you just turned 18, still finishing up your last year of high school.

And I haven't even mentioned that I'm your boss. Yes, I know you developed a real passion for environmental justice during your junior-year trip to Ecuador. And it is, I admit, convenient that I'm an attorney who specializes in environmental law for a non-profit organization. But nonetheless, it is a bit awkward that you're my intern this summer. Right? It's not like I've ever spent a huge amount of time with you before.

Yet despite all of this, despite my wife, your sister, your parents, your age, and your position at my job, you're going to convince me to do the unthinkable. Years of wondering about what I might be doing with your sister when she stuck out at night have taken a toll. Your parents might have kept you from attending Sex Ed and controlled your internet access, but you've got a pretty decent guess at what she did on her ""secret dates"" with me. And what she still does as my wife.

You're going to persuade me to teach you, because you need to know. More than that, you need to experience. And no matter how long the list of reasons why I shouldn't, you're going to push the line of propriety, bit by bit, until you have it all. How? Let's find out...

Kinks: Gradual build up, teasing, flirtation, innocence, D/s, dirty talk, light bondage. Limits: Non-con, violence, bathroom play."

I've been doing an internship over the summer and I was meant to be finishing and going home to see him this weekend, so it's come as quite an unpleasant surprise. I've decided the best thing for me to do is to try and be productive. This is my first relationship and breakup (we've been together since the end of high school), so I would also appreciate any reassurance that feeling angry, resentful and is normal and that it will eventually hurt less. The relationship ended with a big argument and me blocking him because he broke up with me by text. I told him that I didn't always think he treated me that well either- breaking up by text or at times during the relationship, after which he became very upset and angry that I brought up things from the past. So also some reassurance that ending on a bad note will heal over time as well. Many thanks

I tried stopping but I could never manage to stay clean more than a couple of days, and even that was only with the help of alcohol. When I dried up all my savings and couldn't afford hash anymore I started abusing benzodiazepines. That's when I realized I really have a problem. I went to an internship rehab and finished successfully, and today I'm clean for 7 months and 22 days! I know that compared to others I'm still at the beginning of my journey, but from the experience I've accumulated so far, I can say it's really worth it. Before I began recovery I was very shy and had a low self esteem, rarely leaving my room. But today that I'm clean, I feel much more self confident. I'm able to talk with people and look them in the eye, and made a lot of friends who love me and respect me. I was very depressed and had a lot of suicidal thoughts before, but today I really want to live, and learned how to enjoy the small things in life, like going to eat some ice cream with your friends. I can say that my best day in the time I used doesn't get near my worst day in recovery. It's not a easy path, and you gotta give up a lot of things, like your friends that still use and going to bars etc, but it's really worth it! For everyone who is at the very beginning, and is experiencing for the first time in a very long time, maybe years, what it's like to be sober and really feel what's inside of you, don't give up! It gets easier with time, and even though you don't have pot to numb the bad feelings anymore, and it's sometimes hard to cope with them, at least you're truly experiencing life as it is, and it's worth the great moments you'll achieve and won't numb them out​ too. I recommend for people who are trying to start recovery to go to na groups, that's what worked for me, but really do whatever makes you stay clean. Anyway, I hope for everyone to achieve their happiness in life, and I hope I helped someone to do so with what I wrote. Peace ✌ "

Two questions:
1 - when they say experience, would studying myself and getting a certification on my own count to an employer, or is it strictly SAP ""work"" experience that matters.
2 - If a certification would help/count towards helping my resume, then where is a reputable place to get a SAP certification?  Also, which type of SAP certification?

It's been a while since I have given an interview and I feel like I need to brush up on the things I should be prepared to know as I'm going in to interview for a mid-level creative position. This is at a big agency in a big city. (Edit: I'm meeting the CCO who liked my book apparently, and the person who recommended me said he put in a good word about me to the CCO)

I have a list of questions that I will be preparing for - and am requesting additions to this list? Hopefully this thread can become a good reference for how to prepare for interviews.

Also, if they ask if I have any questions for them - I remember a post mentioning good questions to ask - I will write the ones I remember, but additions would be welcome!! Any interesting, witty questions you know of?

Things I remember I have to prepare for:

* Name, history, and best work of person interviewing me
* Names, best work of CD's I'd like to work for in the agency
* Recent campaign (in general) that I really liked
* Recent campaign that the agency has done that I really liked, that fits the kind of work I want to do
* My favourite piece in my own portfolio, and why
* My weakest piece in my own portfolio and how I could have done it better
* Maybe why I am leaving my current agency
* What inspires me
* What am I looking for in a new agency? What do I want to achieve there?


Questions I can ask:

* What is the work culture like? 
* How is the work-life balance?
* What is the best campaign *interviewer* has done at this agency according to him/her
* What accounts will I be working on? Is there a specific CD they want to put me under?


Finally - in terms of a salary increase - I am currently a regular copywriter at an agency with about a year of experience. 2 years if you count one year's worth of internships at some really good agencies. Dropped the junior title early because of a long list of student awards (including Clios and NYF). It's a smaller agency and they're paying me very well - 70k annually. Can I expect a hike in my salary? The agency I am interviewing with reached out to me - they had an opening and I was recommended by a sr. creative who was once my teacher. I was told (by my dad) to ask for a 20% increase straight up but am conflicted and slightly shy about such things. Advice here would be appreciated!

Thank you so very much.

6zgsl2,6,2017-09-11,A lot of temptations,StraightAndNarrow35,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/6zgsl2/a_lot_of_temptations/,"Hello.


This is a bit of an odd post for me however I suppose that this is what this subreddit is for... and it is my cry for help.


I've been struggling with temptations to sleep with other women for many many years now.  I often fantasize about it, it's on my mind almost every night, actively look for porn stories/videos around it, and think not so good things about the women around me beyond just my wife.  The problem is, the temptations are continuing to increase for me...


A little bit about me and my background...


* I'm a 35 year old male
* I'm married, have been for 13 years now
* I have two kids with my wife
* I've only slept with my wife my entire life, no other women
* I travel a lot for work
* I absolutely LOVE my wife, we have an incredible relationships and great sex and she's beautiful to this day in my eyes
* We probably have sex 2-5 times a week (depends on how much I am travelling that week) and enjoy it quite a bit
* I am a faith based individual, I consider myself to be very spiritual and have a great relationship with God and my church.  This is probably the only thing keeping me from already jumping down this dangerous road as I don't trust my self control without God's influence.

The issue is that I've always had this urge/fantasy with sleep with a lot of different women.  I guess that means I'm diagnosed as a male, as the world often says.  lol.   However, the temptation has really picked up and it's not just me fantasizing now... it's becoming more of an option in my life and it concerns me.  


I don't mean to sound conceited when I say this, but it's important to understand why I feel this is becoming more of a risk to me...  I consider myself a fairly good looking guy.  I am in the 98 percentile of my age bracket for income, I take care of myself physically, I eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle, I'm very out-going and upbeat, I consider myself to have a good sense of humor and always seem to be the center of the circle when I go places.  I love sex and I consider myself good at it, my wife seems to agree, and we love to have sex a lot.  But I can never seem to satisfy the urge or need in me... which is OK because I can usually just keep at it with my wife.  However this temptation of other women is getting stronger and as I age, grow my career, and become exposed to more people it's no longer just a desire without any real path it's a desire with MANY paths in front of me to make it a reality.


None of that is meant to brag... the reason I mention it is because during my travels I've had women sexually approach me in some fashion.  I've done speeches at universities around my industry and had plenty of young college girls approach me after, I've even been invited to dorm rooms.  I've had partnerships in the industry where women move in on me while we're out.  Even my neighbors wife (who is home a lone often) has thrown things my way that are clear around her intention.  I am not saying there is a flood of women desiring me, even if it's a few every 3 months that's a lot to handle for someone as tempted as me.  


What recently broke me to reach out for help and input was one of the closest incidents I had where I almost ruined everything...  I had a young intern spend the day with me as she learned my day to day in the industry.  She was beautiful, young (23), great body, and would probably have been an amazing person to have sex with.  When we wrapped up the day she specifically asked me if I was going back to the hotel and said she'd like to join me.  She sent some physical signals my way that made everything in me want to pounce.  I told her no I was going to drive back home that evening (about a 6 hour drive from home) and dropped her off at her hotel (a different one from me).  I lied, I wasn't going home, I went back to my hotel and just focused on my phone, tempted to contact her and let her know I am at the hotel but I just prayed about it, got over it, and went on my way.


I don't know how I avoided it.  But everything in me knew this was my chance to do what I've always wanted.  It terrifies me, because I know the option is going to come again whether it's tomorrow or a year... and I don't have faith in myself to keep it up.


Most people/sites say to get rid of the porn.  I am sure that would help.  But honestly, if I didn't masturbate to it I would be like a loaded gun and I doubt I'd have self control at that point.... 
 

Any advice is appreciated.  I know this is my problem to work on.  But I came the closest I've ever been to ruining it all."

This month's topics include:

Android and Raspberry Pi Security System

If you've listened to enough podcasts you'll no doubt have heard advertisements for products that allow you to look in on your home while you're away. But those usually require you to subscribe to a service. Worse, most of those products require you to trust a third-party service to not do something foolish with their system. What if you could instead create your own variant of these systems?  With some Android knowledge and a Raspberry Pi 3 you can build your own Cloud Security System. Ronald Daugherty presentation will:


• Show an Android Things Hardware Overview
• Show how to set up Android Things on Raspberry Pi 3
• Show how to set up Google Services on Android Things
• Demonstrate a Cloud Doorbell
• Demonstrate a Motion Detector

Ronald Daugherty is a University of Michigan - Dearborn student majoring in Software Engineering. He’s been an Android developer for 2 years and recently an intern at Arbormoon as an Android Software Engineering. He has over 7 years experience in rooting and modding Android devices.

Pain Points: Python and Virtualenv

Pain Points is a series of short talks that describe areas that seem to cause folks pain; whether that's installing software, understanding how to best configure something, or figuring out how something fits into a workflow.

This month we'll talk about Python and Virtual Environments. Python uses Virtual Environments to separate your program's Python environment from other program Python environments. But Virtual Environments can be a little confusing to use. In this talk Craig Maloney will go over the fundamentals of how to set up Virtual Environments. He'll also cover how to use Virtual Environments, best practices to keep in mind while using Virtual Environments, and neat tricks to help ease the pain of using them.

Craig Maloney is one of the board members of the Michigan!/usr/group. He overshares his life at http://decafbad.net.

Plus we'll have our regular features: Jobs Looking for People, People Looking for Jobs, and much more! We'll also be meeting for dinner at Buddy's in Novi after the meeting.

I am using Ubuntu 16.04 and had it installed on a intern SSD (16GB-Ubuntu) to use it simultaneously with WIN10 on my other SSD(250GB-WIN10). Now i wanted to migrate Ubuntu to the big SSD because i thought i was confident enough to fully seperate from Windows and let Ubuntu become my only OS. 

I used Clonezilla to migrate the OS and it works. I am now writing from the new SSD(250GB-Ubuntu). BUT Clonezilla created a partition of 16GB where the OS runs now. I expanded this partition with gparted but Ubuntu does not seem to see it. 

How can i make Ubuntu recognize that it has a new and bigger playground now?

6zi9v3,119,2017-09-11,"One year ago I participated in the Heart Walk, which kickstarted my journey. This year, I was nominated for AHA's Lifestyle Change Award. (Long, emotional post. Sorry.)",it_takes_everything,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6zi9v3/one_year_ago_i_participated_in_the_heart_walk/,"I didn't win, but I was one of four finalists. September has been an emotional month for me because I'm reliving everything that brought me to my decision to lose weight (which isn't the greatest thing to remember). On September 7th, 2016 my world cracked. I was dealing with an attempted sexual assault and while I was reeling from that, my best friend told (well, texted) me she would no longer be able to move into our apartment with me - on the day we were set to move in. So I was left alone in an apartment intended for two and had to pull myself through that. Two days later, a family friend who was like an aunt to me, was murdered in a robbery. I regularly call those three days the worst days of my life. I was so numb to everything and as desperately as I tried, couldn't seem to evoke the slightest spark of happiness. 

On September 10, 2016 I walked my first 5k. To be completely honest, I almost didn't go since 1) getting out of bed was incredibly difficult and 2) I weighed almost 330 pounds and the thought of me walking 3 miles seemed like an impossible feat. But I decided to go because I didn't want the coworker who organized it (it was a company wide event) to ask questions on Monday. And more importantly, because I didn't know how to say ""My world crumbled around me in a matter of 3 days and trying to focus on keeping it all together is REALLY hard at the moment"" in a professional manner. 

So I found myself at the Heart Walk and had my music ready so I would not have to talk to anyone (or keep up with anyone), but somehow I ended up next to a woman who worked at the same company, just different floors so we never crossed paths before. For the next hour and a half we walked together and just talked about our lives, aspirations, goals, etc. and before I knew it, we had crossed the finish line. I was drenched in sweat and my heart was pounding, but I had finished. And for the first time in 3 very long days, I felt joy. It could have been due to endorphins or the pride I felt over accomplishing something I didn't think I was going to be able to do or a combination of both, but all I knew was that I needed to recreate that feeling again, because I was in such a low place that I thirsted over any drop of happiness that came my way. 

I spent the next week researching, planning, and organizing my weight loss. I reached out to a friend and asked her to be my accountability buddy, since I had tried losing weight before and did not want to fail again. I looked up recipes, exercises, meal prepping ideas - everything you could possibly think of and on September 19th I actively started to lose weight. Within the first week, I lost 10 pounds and that feeling of joy was there. So I kept going and with every pound lost I could feel the pain of those three days fade away. 

I was already down 40 pounds when I received an email at work about a Biggest Loser Challenge. No one had really noticed (or at least commented) about my weight loss, so I was a bit timid about participating, but there was a cash prize for the winning group and I'm a broke graduate student so...you know the story. Somehow I found myself as the Team captain and was soon talking with my teammates about my personal story with losing weight. We had a rough start: we came in last place our first week and had a member quit shortly after that, making us ineligible to compete but then the CEO decided to join in their place - which was a whole separate experience in itself. Ultimately, my team ended up winning - which was a HUGE surprise to everyone considering I was a part time intern who somehow had successfully managed to lead the underdogs to victory. And as the intern, people LOVED the idea of me being the Team Leader of the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. That's when my story started to catch wind and people started noticing my weight loss. They asked me to write a blog post surrounding my experience and shared it with the company worldwide. I had people in Europe and Asia congratulating me on my hard work. It was surreal. Then they asked me to be one of the models for this year's Heart Walk promotional material and I happily obliged. 

And then one day I received another email notifying me as a finalist for the Lifestyle Change award. Apparently the same coworker I had dragged myself out of bed for a year ago was the one who nominated me. I cried at the realization of everything I had been through this year and how someone had noticed and deemed it worthy enough to be nominated. And how that story was worthy enough to be selected amongst a group of strangers as a finalist. So this year, I came to the Heart Walk with my two best friends, my little sisters, and we walked together. Both of them are also chronically overweight and I just hoped they'd get the same sense of pride and accomplishment as I had last year. Now they want to go on every 5k they can find. 

I have one week left until my official anniversary and so far I've lost 83.6 pounds and I'm hoping to reach 85 before then. But come that day, I will probably cry and look back and wonder if it was all worth it. And to be perfectly honest, while I have had an amazing year, those 3 days still haunt me and I find myself going back to those feelings of numbness and disillusionment.

I hope you are all well. I was hoping to find a hot older sugar daddy to take me out on nice dates and holidays abroad all in exchange for my tight teen body. I will play as a college girl who has an expensive lifestyle but no money at all.

You can play as a hot older man with a big wallet, a big sex drive and an even bigger dick. Come on guys what older man does want a horny teen sucking and fucking his big cock, telling him how great he is.

I can be one of your daughter's best mates, a student, an intern, a neighbor, a college girl in a bar or maybe on a beach (love a nude beach), tbh any ideas I'm up for it x

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

I have a huge girl crush on Dani Mathers, Sam Blacky, Tammy Hebrow, basically any hot blonde so would love to play as them!

Anyone who sends a hot gif or pic of who they want me to play as or to include in the scene wins bonus points

Look forward to playing, obviously all stuff will be 18+ on the ages x"

Need help deciding whether or not to move out.,georgianablythe16,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6zj7vj/me_21f_with_my_mom_52f_is_overbearing_and/,"Hi everyone. This has been a problem/situation I've been dealing with for the last three years or so and I'm just about reaching my breaking point, so any advice would help!

Here's the general story: For the past three or so years I've been living at home with my parents while I work a part time job as a waitress, intern, and commute to college. For the first half of my time living back at home (I spent my first year of college at a school about two hours away, before moving back home for both financial and mental health reasons) my older brother also lived with us, and it was a lot easier to live at home when he did because I didn't receive the brunt of my mother's ""disappointment"". 

My mother is VERY Catholic. Like, it's a very integral part of her identity, and she would say the most important part of her identity. The problem is that both my brothers and myself have steadily grown further and further away from our faith. I was the last to do this, and was always seen as the ""golden child"" who wouldn't fail her when it came to serving God and following his wishes/direction for my life. She made me promise multiple times that I would never have sex before marriage, never move in with a man that wasn't my husband, and generally just be a top notch Catholic/learn from her mistakes and not ""follow what the world tells me"".

For awhile I really wanted to be that daughter for her. I decided not to have sex until marriage, even though I really kind of wanted to. I promised her I wouldn't ever move in with a man I wasn't married to. I went to church and confession and tried really hard to be what she wanted me to be. But then I started to do my own research, and develop my own way of looking at the world and realized that I didn't agree with everything the church said. A the major turn in all of this was the past presidential election. I became very disillusioned with christianity in general after seeing all the hate surrounding this election and the terrible, horrible things that people were saying about one another. I couldn't believe that my mother could defend some of these things and as my political views shifted from her own, so did my religious views.

Still, I resigned myself to get along with her, but more strain developed when I began a relationship with a coworker of mine. He's a bit older than me (29M) but he's absolutely wonderful and funny and altogether one of my favorite people I've ever met. We can have conversations about religion and politics and really anything about life in general and talk for hours about things I never thought I would want to talk about again (because all of these subjects had been so exhausted with my mother - and most all of them had ended in fights) He makes me really, really happy, and I love every minute that I spend with him. 

My beliefs in religion and God and the rules that my mother and the church set before me were already wavering by the time this relationship started, but once I abandoned my whole ""no sex before marriage pact"" thing I realized just how awful these rules had been on my life and my outlook on sex and relationships. All I was ever taught growing up was that sex was dirty, and that it should only be used to make babies. I felt kind of betrayed, and I started growing further and further from my old beliefs, even more so than before. I got on birth control - and had to do all my own research/ask friends for advice because all I had ever been taught about contraception is that it was bad and sinful. My mother obviously doesn't know that I'm on birth control, nor does she know that I'm having sex, but if she were to find out I know she would kick me out of the house, and this is where my dilemma lies.

I pay all of my tuition out of pocket and of my own dime. I also have a car payment each month that I pay for, and I manage my own credit card and bank account as well. I am financially dependent on my parents for living arrangement, as they don't make me pay any rent. I am INCREDIBLY thankful and grateful for all they've done for me because this arrangement has allowed me to take out minimal to no loans. However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to live at home, and the older I get, the more problems I seem to have with my mother.

We fight constantly. At least three times a week, and she has taken to telling me that I'm ""breaking her heart"" and that I'm a ""disappointment"" because I'm straying away from my Catholic faith. I still go to church every Sunday because I would be kicked out of the house otherwise, but I think it's clear to her that my priorities are not in line with her own.

However, ever since I started hanging out/spending time with my boyfriend, our fights have been getting worse and worse because I'm home far less and come home much later. She has some bad anxiety problems that she'd never admit to, and she absolutely WILL NOT go to sleep until I get home, which frustrates both of us because I want to be able to stay out later, and she wants to be able to go to bed earlier. She makes me text her multiple times when I'm gone from home, and if I don't answer right away then I must be doing something sinful and bad, and it immediately starts a fight. I'm also nervous about her somehow finding my birth control pills and it causes me a lot more anxiety, on top of all the other anxiety that I already have (I was recently diagnosed with GAD - and have a lot of trouble managing my anxiety, especially when my mom and I fight)

All in all, neither of us are happy. I've wanted to move out for quite some time but I live in a small town and all my friends either are away at college, or live with their significant others. I don't know who I could room with, and I'm not sure if I can afford a place on my own. I know for sure though that if I moved out I would need to take out private loans for the remaining of my school tuition - which is about 5,000 dollars total. I already have about 9,000 dollars in loans from my first year of college, and I have a really great credit score from both my car payments and my credit card, but I'm still nervous about taking out this loan. I also know that me moving out would make my mom really, REALLY upset, and we would get in another blow up fight about it, but I figure that we fight constantly already, wouldn't it be easier if I wasn't home to continue the fights/make them worse?

I guess what I'm looking for is advice about whether or not I should move out, because if I do I'll be putting a bit more of a financial burden on myself. The great thing is that I have a job offer after college at a nonprofit a state over, and they've agreed to pay for my grad school as well, so I'm not worried about finding a job after college and being unable to pay off my loans. I guess I'm just wondering what the best move is here. 

TLDR: my mother is overbearing with her religious and strict house rules and I'm wondering if I should move out despite financial difficulties."

I realize that sounds pretty vanilla ... and is probably not actually a kink at all. But god help me nothing turns me on more than that hungry-eyed, lip-biting look. That desperation. That need. Plenty of kinks come from that. Cheating is thrilling, especially when there's the danger of getting caught. Public sex really gets my motor running, and not semi-public, I want an audience. But it's got to have that I-fucking-want-you-right-now quality to it. I want that primal, urgent, unstoppable lust.

As you may have guessed, these are the rantings of an unfulfilled married man. Everyone wants what they can't have, and for me right now that's passion. So instead I fantasize about meeting the intern in that dark hallway behind the break room, or hate-fucking the bitchy supervisor who loves to show off her tight little body. There comes a point where that's not enough anymore, though.

What I'm looking for: An online friend with benefits. I want to talk about every dirty little thing under the sun. I want to tease you until you can't help but sneak away to the bathroom. I want to swap dirty pictures and audio and video (if you're game for that). But you can't have the benefits without the friend. Bitch about your boss and then we can fantasize about what it would be like to fuck in his office and make a mess of the place. I'll complain about my lack of sleep and you can tell me how you would make me look forward to waking up in the morning.

This is maybe starting to sound more like an online relationship, but that's not really it. I'm just hoping for something casual and fun to take our minds off reality.

Who I'm looking for: If any of this sounds good, then it's probably you. Being married as well gets you bonus points (all the better to commiserate with). Being over 22 would be nice, but exceptions can be made. I don't care about race or body type, as long as you have that passion. Also, please understand that I could disappear for a day or two because of personal and professional responsibilities, and I'll extend you the same courtesy.

So hit me up and let's get to know each other. I'm good with reddit or google or kik, whichever you prefer.

*SEPTEMBER 11TH*

/u/Nargles_AreBehindIt had discovered the passageway to the basement, and was on her way down the stairs. She took her time and navigated with care all the way to the bottom. However, she failed to check the small opening under the stairwell behind her as she approached the door. A masked assailant crept up behind her, and in one swift motion, grabbed the top of her head with one hand and her jaw in the other, and twisted violently. There was a snapping sound that resonated through the staircase as her body slumped to the ground. Her assailant then stepped back into their hiding place, then heard what sounded like a cannon being shot off high above. They suspected it was /u/alchzh, and they were correct.

The owner sat at his desk. He scanned the room. He then looked at one of the Administrators, /u/Galileo787. “You. Come here,” he asked. /u/Galileo787 cautiously stepped forward toward the desk, and was shaking ever so slightly. “Yes, sir?”, he asked. The owner looked up at him. “You know what’s at stake. You know that I have eyes and ears in every part of this building. Unfortunately, what they’re telling me is that you’ve been found out. It’s been figured out that you’re not what they’re made to think you are.” /u/Galileo787 looked down sullenly. “I’m sorry, sir.” “It’s too late to apologize. This carelessness is intolerable. I’m sorry I have to do this, but like I said, you know what’s at stake.” The owner then pulled a pistol from under the table and shot his subordinate. /u/Galileo787 fell to the ground as the remaining Admins and Insurrectionists in the room looked on.

I've learned that I'm not the type who has what it takes to become partner, or become a ""leader"" in finance/accounting in industry. Therefore, the highest level I think I can reach is 150k as a manager by the time I am 40 (and stay there for the rest of my career). Also, it seems like salaries in the field aren't really increasing much (mostly just plateauing).  

Given how well IT is doing, would it be wise to go into something like computer/software engineering? I'd have to do another 4 year degree, but I can do internships and possibly make good money. Also, I'm low income, so I can get a lot of financial aid...

What are the drawbacks? Is the grass really greener on the other side? "

I escaped by moving away. I'm NC but we have mutual friends and he finds ways to contact me. Last time we spoke was about a year ago (I'm 26 now, for an idea of how much time has passed).  I have CPSTD from this abuse and abuse from my childhood.

So, my husband is currently an intern with a company that is all over the US, with his team covering the northern part of our state, and all our neighboring state (my home state). Well, a job is about to open in my home state and is most likely going to be offered to him, which is great because we need the money.

But... It's in the same town my abuser is from. He grew up there. His family is there. His friends are there. I know he isn't living there during the school year, but what I gather from mutual friends is that he visits a lot. 

I'm terrified. We got the news today that it is very likely we will get the position. We need this position. But I'm so scared I will see my abuser or he will find out I'm living in the area. He still asks people about me. I have gone home, years after we broke up and I tried to go NC, and he was telling hairdressers he knew I visited about me and how he loved me. When he contacted me last year, he did something similar while also sending me explicit messages that centered on old abuse. He still tried to control me after years away from me. I'm panicking about moving now. I started having flashbacks again and I'm terrified to sleep because of nightmares.

What do I do? How do I tell my husband? I've worried he will want to turn the job down and we can't afford that. Am I overreacting?"

I did finally get a headset. I got the official Sony one. Read a bunch of reviews and it's supposed to be good. Don't really notice the 7.1 though (but I heard not all games support it. Uncharted 4 should, so I'll try that. Both FIFA17 &amp; PES18 demo didn't seem to)

Anyway. It's there a better way? Also the PS4 video editor is not user friendly for me. I'm used to working with mouse and keyboard on pc. I have basic knowledge of video editing software.

About over a month ago I walked away from a very, very, abusive relationship. I had moved across the world (USA to EU) to be with her. My partner [19 F] hit me, made me feel very unwanted, and pretty much gave me damage not only to myself, but also to my health and my well being. She tried to kill me as well by choking me, stabbing me, or actually driving me to try to kill myself many times. I have damage in my upper arm due to her beating as well, that may or may not be able to be healed and fixed. When I would try to leave she would try to cut or kill herself, and then she would break up with me again. Random triggers that cause me to throw up or shake from before such as facebook calling or video games makes me feel ""fear"" and I can't move or do anything. Her last words were, ""You will never find another nice girl like me."" She sends people every now and then just to bother me, and she still watches watches my games time to time, which makes me even feel worse. I have forced NC, even though I broke it once to try to get back her back for some reason and to get back the ring I gave her. She has tried through mutual friends, and through others she sent to bother me. She has a new girlfriend already whom she told me before was nobody. I am just trying to heal and I feel like she is opening the scars all the time by new and new things. 


A little about me: I just got into a very very good graduate program for programming. I have experience abroad from her country for programming. I have many interviews for top companies in my area for programming to intern there. I am working on loosing weight and expanding my hobbies beyond video gaming. I would love to meet someone beyond video games, and technology who I can click with. But I am just scared with my past, that I moved to be with someone I never met across the world that they will reject me and think I am crazy, or that I was abused they will think I don't deserve to be loved. Or that I like bdsm, or that I want to settle down and have kids someday, or that I was engaged to my previous abuser.


TDLR: I am scared due to my past experience that I am ""unloveable"".  How can I move past this and gain more confidence within myself?  "

Right now I'm trying to figure out if this is a feasible idea.

I'm in my last year of a computer science degree, and I decided a little late in the game that sitting around at a desk all day isn't for me. I'd love a job that involved being outdoors, so naturally I'm considering the idea of working in a park. Finding this sub has been extremely informative! I'm putting in volunteering applications at my local wildlife center and state park, and this summer I'll try for an SCA internship. I've got my eye on Utah afterward.

I understand that applying for a ranger position will involve a lot of seasonal work and probably moving around. My questions for you guys: 

What do/did you do during the off times while working seasonally? I'm coming out of school with debt and would like to find a way to get into park work while still being able to pay that off, so off-season work is a concern I need to address. 

Are there any jobs around the park other than rangering, or do you guys do it all? 

What if I looked for a position with a regional office first? Since I won't have a whole lot of relevant experience right out of school, it seems like a good idea to find a job where my degree will be helpful first and move on from there.

Thank you for your thoughts. :)"

Throwaway account because I don't need the wrong person to see this.

I recently applied for a lab technician job in the STEM related field. It would entail field work on a boat with another tech. Reading over the qualifications, I am more than qualified. I have worked with this company as an intern and I pretty much know everyone relevant in the office. This office is somewhat divided into two sections, one that works on X projects, one that works on Y. When I interned, I worked with side X, and the job I applied for is in side Y. When I got the interview I told one of my good friends, who I worked with on side X (lets call him Jimmy), that I got it and he told me to come to him with whatever questions I had. Well, Jimmy called me and gave me some advice and some pointers. He was more than supportive and gave me all the encouragement I needed until he broke the news:

""I hate to say this, but with what I've gathered, I think they're wanting to hire a guy since the other tech is a girl.""

EXCUSE ME?? I knew STEM discrimination was a thing but I had personally never experienced it until now. It honestly knocked the breath out of me. Why would a man be so much better to have on the boat? Because he is strong and probably knows how to fix a boat motor? Well.....I am strong and can fix it too. The main activity this job entails is something I did all the time as an intern but just because I am a woman I'll have to prove myself ten-fold.

Here is the kicker though... the hiring manager is a woman. Interview is Friday.

/endrant Only a few of my friends really understand how much this bothers me and just needed a supportive platform to talk about it.

TL;DR I (female) applied for a job that they want a man for even though I am more than qualified for. But they want a man on the boat, not two women.

So little girl, now you know how millions of more qualified men feel.  We were passed over and lesser qualified females were hired for diversity.  Equality.  Someone who isn't banned should tell her that."
6znxuf,2,2017-09-12,Relapse and Regain,erehelp,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6znxuf/relapse_and_regain/,"Hi everyone,
Its my first time posting here. I would like to take this chance to thank all of you for insights and motivation at my weakest days. I started this journey as a new years resolution for 2017. At that point I felt dead, uninspired, unmotivated, unloved you name it. Honestly I do not even remember how I came across this community but I thank god I did. I was really committed at first. I wanted to see if these stories were true so I went 40 day complete hard mode until i came across a porn actress on twitter named darla crane. One thing lead to another and I was there with a jizz in my hands to one of her videos. But during that steak, I was working out (P90x) and was noticing all the ""superpowers"" like strong eye contact, clearer face, thick hair sparkly eyes. I took on a leadership position on school project for the first time. I approached some girls weather drunk or sober (all went terrible not even a text back). Overall I was really content about my state at that time and sad about why I didn't do this way earlier like first year of college or high school. But after that relapse I was motivated more than ever, I went 110 days on no pmo ( although  some day i picked at porn but never binged or masturbated). At the time I reached new energy level, started applying to internships, socializing like never before (Like I didnt talk to anyone except 4 of my friends before)  . May came around and I felt like a failure because almost all my friends left for graduation, I failed to get an interview for the summer let alone any internship, and I was completely lonely going in to the summer. Well the streak ended to one of darla cranes videos. I felt really sad a depressed and the next ten days where pmo heavy. After that I knew I had to do something productive over so I reached back to my boss from the previous year to get my canvassing job back for the summer of 2017. I also started working on the project [Building a house] I took leadership position on. So summer kept me busy we no fun and pleasure aside from sleep and food. During summer I had a bunch of 10-15 day streak and one 31 day streak which ended to darla video . The ""superpowers"" in the summer period were vauge not noticable at all. I was just motivated to keep going. 

One thing a keeps me down is being a minor minority at a big campus. Its hard to from actual friends with people although you are open about it. People look at you weird if you try to hangout with the after class or project. One day your sitting next to them in class and having a small talk about their weeknd, school or work then next day they do not even want to make eye contact with me when they see me around. It like I am receiving both negative and positive attention during this experience. But this have made me more daring to talk to women especially when I am drunk although the conversation gets quickly to 100 (they laugh and look like they are digging it) then they go completely cold. Forget getting a text back for some reason that feels like it currently out of my realm. Honestly, I dont even need women like that I just like to have them as a friend and build social confidence and friendships/connections. I am constantly trying to greet am meet people but I am lacking any sort of positive feed back which kinds makes me sad sometimes. So on the days like today [ I just relapsed again after 15 day streak ] when i am sick with cold I am very weak to relapse because all this though come rushing down. So, I seek this pleasure to relief my misery. One thing is for sure tho, I am not a pmo addict like i used to be alhouth it keeps catching me off guard sometimes. I would like to be back where I was during my 110 day streak. I keeps tapping out after a week or two recently. 

Little background about my self:
I am a person that Immigrated from Africa eight years ago so I pmod since they day I got here to deal with cultural shock, lack of mental support from family , lack of relationships, lack of life experience and money. I am currently at my 5th and final year of undergrad at a public university studying engineering with similar problems but working slowly towards changing them unlike masking them like the years before. I cry sometimes when its hard because I have no one to tell this to or to hold me accountable except myself.  Any advice you give is truly cherished by me.

6znxwn,1,2017-09-12,m4F - Cuckolding your Alpha Husband with your Submissive Intern,moonfacedmask,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6znxwn/m4f_cuckolding_your_alpha_husband_with_your/,"Every woman you know envies you. Your husband, Troy, is a veritable demigod: his chin is fit to crack walnuts, he has a reserved spot at the gym and bodyfat percentages that require a decimal point to express. His cock has to be strapped to his thigh, and he has the stamina of a plough horse. He sweats pure testosterone. His vice-presidency at Daddy's business keeps his wallet full of cash, but Troy's actually not that good with numbers (or letters, and even some pictures are challenging), so you have control of the finances. Of course he gets some on the side, but doesn't mean you don't still get pushed face-down into the mattress and fucked senseless when he feels the urge.

Maybe the envy of other women was enough for you at one point. You're in your thirties now, but you still have looks others would kill for, even if you put away the blond hair dye years ago. Even if you don't need to work, you're too intelligent, your mind too busy to stay at home, so you have a paid position at that non-profit everyone wants to volunteer for. Cue more envy.  You could have something on the side, too, if you wanted. All your friends tell you so - just wear that tight red dress to a bar, or waggle your ass a bit at the gym when you're on the stairclimber, and it would be like ringing the dinner bell. But you can already get empty sex at home whenever he wants.

What you want - what you *deserve* -  is attention. Affection. Adoration. You want someone whose world revolves around you - at least for a few hours - someone who cares whether or not you're satisfied. And rather than Tinder or some meat market, you may have found him in an unlikely place: the file room.

Ethan is still in college; a summertime temp job turned into an ongoing internship, which is basically a way of making a glorified errand boy wear a shirt and tie for little more than minimum wage. He noticed you right away - obviously - but in a building full of $500 haircuts and fake tits wrapped in designer skirt suits, his green eyes still sparkle when he has an excuse to stop into your office. When you're in the file room, you can feel his eyes on your legs, no matter how deep your nose is in the manila folder. What started out as innocent flirting (perhaps more innocent than flirting) has become anything but after you playfully told him to stop licking envelopes *that way*. He always licks them *that way* when you're around now. That one night you convinced him to have a few drinks with the other girls from the office (despite protests that he was only twenty), he danced around admitting that he was thinking about you rather than the envelopes, but his flushed cheeks said what he wouldn't.

He knows you're married; he's met your husband (and winced when Troy shook his hand and crushed his knuckles) and so of course he thinks it's nothing more than simple flirting. He wouldn't dream of it, You know that if you make the first move, though, you'll have him wrapped around your finger. Will it be a simple little office affair, a moment of indiscretion and release after hours? Or will you take him home with you? Troy would be furious at wearing the cuckold's horns, but you could just tell him Ethan's the new pool boy; he's probably too stupid to figure it out anyway.

6zo296,6,2017-09-12,Get closer to suicide every day,jb12489,spirituality,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/6zo296/get_closer_to_suicide_every_day/,"Hi, as the title says, so here goes.

I feel like my world is getting smaller and smaller. I skipped class this morning and have been deep within my binge eating disorder the past 4-5 days. I just want to get to a  place where I can heal, without having to worry about money, or any kind of financial burden (for me or my parents). But I don’t think our society (USA) has any such places where a person can go if they are severely mentally sick. They have been cutting away at the social services for decades now and so I just don’t know that there’s anything available to me. 

I do know of a spiritual community that I could go to that would cost $500 for the first three months. My parents are already paying $1500 for me to go to school this semester, but want me to save up and completely pay on my own for the spiritual community, as they are unwilling to support me doing that.

So basically, for the past month or so I’ve oscillated between a lot of different cognitive states/plans. I’ve thought about trying to do something illegal to try to get this $1500. I’ve tried to apply for loans to get the money. I wrote a highly detailed yet currently unsent letter to my cousin asking him for a loan of that amount. I’ve even started a gofundme to try to get this amount. And I’ve worked my ass off, as much as I can within this state of mind, to find a job(s) to work long enough for me to get out there. But I’m just not sure in this mental place if I could hold a job right now, especially at the kind of fast food places I’ve been accepted to.

I don’t want to hold my parents hostage, so to speak, but I need them to understand how intense these demons are within me. I actually held a knife to my throat this morning, and I looked up suicide methods, saw cyanide, and thought about going onto the darknet and ordering some. I do not want to commit suicide and have to face the truly unfathomable pain that my parents would feel, but my brain is just so scrambled and sick right now, and I need to try something different.

My brain is very ill right now. I don’t know that I can make it the 4-5 months of working full time and McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts (ugh!) in order to make this move happen on my own dime. So I am considering suicide as a means of escape, I guess because in my mind, the pain of not holding a job or being in classes and just sitting around my parents’ house doing nothing, is greater than what I would expect the pain of suicide to be like.

I feel intense shame, in large part because my parents have already spent ~$60,000 on various programs and treatments to try to help me get better, and yet, here I am, feeling as shittty as ever. I think this plays into why I am desperate to move out and be on my own, because I do not wish to continue to burden them financially or continue to take up space rent free in their house. In other words, I so desperately wish to be liberated from being ‘their problem’, and to just be able to live on my own regardless of what anyone that’s in my life right now would say.

I really feel that once I was able to get out to the community and have some time to heal, I’d be able to get a job in order to support myself at least enough to be able to live in the community (I would only need to work ~30 hours at even a minimum wage job to support my living there, and only after the three months were completed, as they have an internship that costs $480 a month).

--------

(A short while later) Well, I just cancelled both of my credit cards, so I can’t run up a charge anymore. What I’ll have to do now is just give my money to my dad from my paychecks as I soon as I get it, so I can get enough savings to make this thing happen. I also dropped 3 of the 4 classes that I had been planning on taking this semester so that I can focus on working as much as possible, as well as not feel any guilt about having my parents pay for classes that I may not end up needing.

I’m pretty sure this recent episode of binge eating only started once I had received a second credit card in the mail, and this in turn led to feelings of hopelessness, because I felt like I simply wasn’t going to be able to have cash to save because I was going to keep running up charges on my credit card.

Should I stop taking weed edibles? Is this impacting my spirit in a highly negative way?

6zo2qj,2,2017-09-12,Need advice on if I should stay on my parents' money and control or not,lacycandi,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6zo2qj/need_advice_on_if_i_should_stay_on_my_parents/,"[TW: physical/verbal/emotional abuse]
Warning: this may get ramble-y, it's hard for me to put all this into perspective
I'm stuck in a really rough spot. For reference, I'm an adopted 19 year old female, who is going to college fairly far away from my narcs. When they first took me under their wing, they were pretty nice to me. However, when I started getting older (either triggered by my dad's dad dying or me just getting older and wanting independence in general) they started getting worse. Dad has a wild temper and has done everything from hit me, tell me to kill myself, taken my phone away from months at a time for petty transgressions, gaslighting, and many many more I can't list briefly. He goes through 9 beers and a bottle of wine by himself, minimum, each night. He's cut me off from countless friends, never respects my opinion and generally has given me hardships that affected me deeply throughout my life.

Dad is more the stereotypical narc; Mom is more Emom but she does adopt some of his traits. Mom acts a lot as his flying monkey, and she sometimes acknowledges how bad he is and tells me she considers divorce, therapy, etc, but never leaves him. Her form of abuse is more subtle (telling me I'm gaining weight, interrupting stories that are important for me to finish, mocking me for getting hurt when they make fun of me, etc).
So, in short, I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder as a direct result of them, and it was only when I went away to college that I really discovered who I was as a person. College has been the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm super excited to graduate.

Enter problem.

My parents, for all their faults, do recognize that college is important for me and want me to do well. They will pay for my college tuition in it's entirety, and aren't bluffing when they say they have the money to do it. However, they are dead set on me doing college their way, not mine. They're obsessed with me having the perfect ""college experience"", to the point it's some creepy mantra. I want to graduate in 3 years, they want me to graduate in the traditional 4. I don't go to sports events because I'm not a fan of watching sports, they berate me for not supporting my team and disrespecting them by wasting their money they pay for in my tuition to get me into sports (money that, if given the option, I would just as soon opt out of paying). But the most serious disagreement about college we've had so far is about jobs.

They don't want me to work during college. They claim it's because they're worried about me doing well in class and getting a job, but I know it's because they don't want me to have the money to support myself, resulting in my continued dependence on them. This is proven by the fact that I wasn't allowed to work during the summer, despite only being in class for 4 hours a day. This has been a major frustration, but I abided by it all of my freshman year. This summer I got a job, but due to a lot of crazy things happening, I made zero money, kept having to draw out of my savings to do things, and my job ended up going bankrupt so I was broker than when I started. This semester I was offered a paid internship. My boss is only asking me to work 6-8 hours a week, so it won't pay much at all, but it won't interrupt my studies. Sure enough, when I told my parents, they were appalled at the idea. My dad eventually relented, but said I could only work 2-4 hours a week, and wasn't allowed to use my phone or computer for work-related things (despite the fact I'm interning with a start-up company).

Obviously, no job is going to hire me to work 4 hours a week max, and a startup can't give me company equipment, so I decided to take the internship on the terms my boss and I agreed on, not on my dad's terms. This decision has since terrified me. My dad has stated that if I disobey his orders I'll be cut off. I have very little emotional attachment to them, and certainly don't care to obey his terms out of loyalty, so I don't want to obey him just because he said so. This internship is a really great opportunity, and I'm getting lots of resume fluff and experience from it, so I don't want to give it up. This winter break I'm certain they'll find out I disobeyed them, as they'll insist on helping me with my taxes because they think I'm too dumb to figure it out on my own. Once they find out, I'll be cut off in a dramatic fight that's sure to emotionally damage me and be fodder for my therapist for a month. But I can't afford college on my own. I can take out student loans perhaps, but I'll be moving in/possibly getting married to my boyfriend soonish, and I don't want that debt to turn into his responsibility. Plus, unless I'm mistaken, that won't cover my housing.
So, TL;DR: do I stay with my narc parents and give up an amazing internship position so they continue paying for my college education, or do I get kicked out and become dirt poor?"
6zo3zj,8,2017-09-12,"I was never prepared for this, I hate how useless I am",throwaway2017-123,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6zo3zj/i_was_never_prepared_for_this_i_hate_how_useless/,"I'm 23, I've been out of college for a year, and I had to move 8 hours away from the only support system I vaguely had to a job that I ended up in only because I needed one and they were offering after my internship. I was never supposed to stay but I don't know what else to do and my depression is making me shut down and push away everyone I was close to.

This is the first time I've been away from family and it's really fucking hard. Even through college I bummed it on my sister's couch because my depression also hit hard when I started college. I was always basically codependent on my sisters being there for me and it's incredibly unfair to them and I hate that I need them so much but I feel like they were the only constant in my life. Now I live 8 hours away and feel like I can't talk to them anymore because I don't want to burden them with how codependent I am on them.

(backstory: less than a year into my first, official ""adult job,"" a bigger money-hungry company bought us out, cut benefits/everything, and displaced the entire art hub (which basically became like family) so we all had to either scramble to go to local, individual stations or be jobless. Only 7 out of the 27 people chose to stay with the new, shitty company, including myself. I chose to go to a station 2 states away because my supervisor (who was basically like a second dad/mentor to me) and another coworker I was cool with ended up there too. Then my depression started deteriorating everything and I'm not on good terms with either of them and can't fix it due to my depression.)

I'm at a job I don't even care for that pays ""good for an art job"" but just shitty in general. I roomed with a coworker from our old company for convenience sake but due to my tendencies of shutting down they basically told me how they don't want to live with me anymore after less than 5 months of rooming together. I hate change so much and I feel bad because I took the risk to be the first in my family to actually go out and have a job, even though I didn't want to.

I feel like I took that risk because it was going to be ""good for me"" and that I'd ""love it in this new city"", etc. But, I don't know if I was ready. I don't know if I ever was, am or will be. So that's why I left. I needed to have a job to keep up with capitalism and paying off student loans, and you always hear, ""No one's ever ready, you just do it and it'll work out!""

I technically can go home, but I'm worried about basically career suicide and not having good references to take away because the only people who could give me decent ones I've basically pushed away. Also, I don't want to be a burden on my sisters because I recognize that my codependency on them is harmful and they need to live their own lives, and I don't want to come back and fuck that up either.

I feel like I should've stayed and not gone off to this job because I've basically fucked up the relationships I had with people from before. But, I feel like I ""needed this life experience"" too in a way, but I've also never been more depressed/suicidal/isolated either."

This is mainly an intro, but any possible help is welcome. My parents has convinced me that I need help... again. I'm calling my doctor tomorrow so I can get help from a healthcare-paid psychiatrist or psychologist. And I'm going to some free help at some nearby place on Thursday, I'm not completely sure what it is yet though. And I'm writing this. No shit, Sherlock. But it's important to mention though, since I'm writing this instead of playing a game. For about a month now I've primarily spend my time on two things on a daily basis: Work at an internship and play Diablo 3 on my PC at home, which is at my parents. I'm looking for my own place again, but the search is going poorly. My internship is a part of my computer science education and at the company I primarily do business web app development. I hardly have the energy the work requires unfortunately. I'm not currently in danger of getting fired, or whatever it's called for interns, but I most likely won't be able to get a job there when I'm done with my education. I was looking forward to the internship, but it currently just feels like unpaid work. I do learn a lot though. Even a bit on bad days, like today.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm gaming to get away from life. To do something that I enjoy, because I don't enjoy life. Not since losing my ex-girlfriend over a year ago. But I need to cut my time spend on gaming somehow. I'm considering to develop some games in Unity in my spare time. I'm also considering to spend less time in front of a PC and spend non-existing energy on real life things. Maybe I can do both if I cut down my playtime a ton, I don't know.

&amp;nbsp;

Trying to think positive whenever possible. Thanks for reading my post. Any shared thoughts are appreciated. But just writing this has already helped myself a bit."
6zq9kk,5,2017-09-12,[ROLEPLAY] A New Opposition for Singapore,ZaphodBrox42,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/6zq9kk/roleplay_a_new_opposition_for_singapore/,"A party colleague rushed through the hallways, running from corridor to corridor attempting to find Meeting Room C037. The news in his folders, hot out of the printer, contained news that could collapse four of the Workers Party's opponents. Of course the governing party would take a hit too, but not enough to displace them from government. Han Leng had dreamed of such a day, after standing in a few seats over the years he had always been quashed by the PAP, but this could at least drain some of the overpowering government's powers.

Of course, the People's Action Party had dominated government since the dawn of Singapore's democracy, and since then many of the people had become disenfranchised. Yes, voting numbers stayed high, but the 50+ year reign of the Party had gone uninterrupted, leading to speckles of corruption, spreading like a fungus' spores in society. Some, including Han, saw it to be a disease, rotting away at the city state, and it was time for change.

As the intern burst into the room, shouting and rambling about the fall of the political opponents, he found a makeshift control room, with eight easily recognised figures gathered around one monitor. The opposition leaders. Every one.

""We know"", whispered Low Thia Khiang. The leader of the Workers Party, surrounded by each one of his opponents. Underneath the alpha male of the PAP, these eight leaders had scrapped and fought over the scraps of the feast table of the government. Slowly but surely, Leng understood.

""Shit..."" he whispered, reading between the lines of his folder and the news. The political grenade in his hands seemed insignificant compared to the bomb soon to be published on the monitor.

""So, I guess you didn't read into the Security and Intelligence Division's leaks. Can't blame you, nobody else bothered"" chuckled Chiam See Tong, a look of exasperation seeped into his eyes. Thinking back, Han did recall a leak from around a month back, stating something about a political scandal amongst the President's deputies and a brothel owner, linked in with a big crime gang? The news had only stuck around for a few hours until being stomped out by the Party.

""Well we have more news"" stated Thia Khiang. Then, over the next minutes, a plan that had clearly been designed more carefully and intricately than the fine European paintings lining the walls of this room.

Over the past months, the governing party had been infiltrated, with leaks on policy and secrets from ministers revealed, and all in one the opposition parties planned on releasing every single one. From the secret bastard children of Cabinet ministers to lightly researched policy ideas such as the abolition of some workers rights, selling laws and debate time to the highest bidders. The Brothel Leak was hinted at by insiders in the PAP to an agent from the SID, and released, in order to establish how the PAP would react to a potentially destructive leak.

""So"", finished the Opposition Leader, a smile creeping into the ageing man's lips, eyes gently crinkling at the edges as the old politician seemed to reach the end of his speech, his final speech, ""the government may fall in the coming election, with a new politics to rise in Singapore. The PAP are in tatters, and these documents incriminate some of us too, protecting but a few of our friends. You are one such friend, Han.""

Unsure of what to think, the gears in Han's mind attempted to go the gargantuan distance to reach the truth. Maybe he knew it, just couldn't quite comprehend it.

""The Kejatuhan Kuasa Dossier is soon to be released, containing all of their, and some of our, secrets. Not all of the parties here will survive, so we have the papers ready for a new political group. Logo, hierarchy, even deputies are sorted. All we need is the signature of the leader. You'll adopt a new party, to do with as you wish. The election may be tough, but hell, you have no opponents if the leak works. Let's hope you're not as shit as we were, eh?"" chuckled the ex-leader.

Han couldn't quite believe the powers laid before him. Essentially a power vacuum, and he was the one rat large enough to steal the scraps. Leng signed the papers at 3:42pm, announcing his leadership of the The Regenerative Front, and by 5:30 the Dossier had dropped, just in time for the evening news to spread the dirt all over the state.

Singaporean politics would never remain the same again. With the PAP scrambling to silence the news, the other opposition parties split between allegiance and preparations to stab Han in the back, the nation was Han's to attempt to grasp. Only time can tell if the city would flock to his security, or fall into chaos."

You could probably recognize me as ""o_o"" or ""ounderscoreo"" in the older forums. I've been very inactive so you likely won't know me. Anyway, in the early 2017, I made a thread that got Berezaa's attention. It was me complaining about MH being repetitive with the same goals, with extremly huge money prefixes.Berezaa replied he would possibly create a sequel to Miner's Haven, since he would get to join the ""intern accelerator ROBLOX project"" thingy, which explains a lot of things. As we know, he instead decided to work on a huge MH update. But the thing is, he probably forgot about MH2 or he just thought it would be waay too hard to create or would just ruin MH, as it's very advanced already and it would be a shame to restart all over again.

What do you guys think? Did Berezaa forgot about making a sequel to MH or he simply changed his mind at the end?"

6zr7ik,3,2017-09-12,First Internship Advice,DelayedWorld,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6zr7ik/first_internship_advice/,"This is going to be my first post on /r/Accounting and I've seen some very helpful responses to others' questions, so I'm hoping I can get a bit of guidance on my accounting journey.

**Background**: I am an upcoming junior majoring in accounting and information systems at a big target school in Washington state. At the beginning of the summer, I applied to an internship posting for a local small CPA tax firm and went through a phone interview, an in-person interview, and even a ""3-day trial"" internship with this firm. I was hoping to get this internship so I could have a better job than my old one for the school year. Ultimately, I was offered the position, but on the condition that I start in January 2018. 

I liked the firm and the atmosphere felt nice, but they also told me they wanted someone that would be willing to stay longer than a year and also eventually become a first-year associate after graduation. I feel that I am too early in my college career to make a decision like that, and I am unsure if I should accept it.

**Concern**: I know that Fall is where a lot of recruiting happens and I do not want to fully commit to the internship (for a year or longer) and take away my chances of possibly getting an internship with a bigger firm in audit (what I was more interested in doing) for the Winter or Summer 2018. However, there is also a chance that I might not score another offer this recruiting season if I decline the one I already have and will be left with nothing. I also don't want to accept the offer and then leave for another summer internship if I was to get one.

I am a good student with a high GPA, am involved in leadership positions for clubs on campus, and I feel confident in my ability to interview well. Also, I am a minority student and I have seen a lot of postings about Big 4 internship opportunities for minorities on my school website that I would really like checking out.
Overall, would you suggest I decline the offer and go through recruiting risking that I do not get another?

Thanks in advance.

6zrmg0,83,2017-09-12,I fucked three different women in one day,[deleted],SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/6zrmg0/i_fucked_three_different_women_in_one_day/,"Not altogether, mind you. 

At the time, I was running a music venue,  and had employees and interns. I was in my early thirties,  and one of our interns had a crush on me. She was twenty,  a brunette with green eyes and braces.  And perfect fucking proportions,  beautiful tits,  at least Ds or DDs, great ass, smooth skin,  tight like a pharmacy bottle. 
We had a one night stand which turned into a very regular thing. (I later found out I was her third,  and the only guy to have ever fucked her more than once. )

Anyway,  that Friday night we had a show and she walked home with me, I would fuck her that night and then again in the morning.  I was super selfish with her and got very selfish head from her,  fucked her hard not caring about her pleasure (condoms were not a part of my world), get more head,  pound her out some more,  and always cum on her face,  usually really big loads because I'd been getting close for so long. Then we'd sleep,  I'd wake her up and do it again before kicking her out. 

I went back to sleep and eventually went on with my day,  but I had my regular okcupid fuckbuddy texting me.  I wasn't sure I could meet up with her though because I had a first date later that night. Anyway,  I told her to come over but that we had to be done by 8. She came by.  She was a great fuckbuddy,  no drama,  super chill.  She was dyed black with spiky short hair, glasses and one of those beauty mark piercings,  cute little tits,  couple of tattoos, great big bubble butt and thighs (i like strong thighs) We usually did the same thing every time: she'd give me head and then ride me cowgirl,  getting herself off several times while freaking out about how big my dick was. Then she'd keep riding me while I choked her and slapped her until her cheeks got real red.  Her pussy was also super tight and i would pull out and cum all over her ass while she was on top of me.

After she was putting on her black panties (which they all wore black lace panties) I told her I was going on a date which she thought was hilarious and wished me good luck. 

I went on the date.  She was nice,  kind of nerd cute,  long brown hair, kind of big tits little ass. She was kind of blah though.  After we went out for drinks she came back to mine for more. I wasn't feeling a connection so I was wondering why she was hanging around,  it was almost 1 am. Then I figured she just wanted to bang so I started kissing her,  and yeah,  she did.  She had very pale skin and had some hidden literary tattoos. We fucked missionary and doggy style,  and she gave me some head. She really wanted me to cum in her mouth,  so I did that while she masturbated and then swallowed. Then she packed up her shit and left.  I thought about calling up my intern but she wouldn't be there for an hour and I was pretty tired. So I went to bed. 

Yay.  Thanks for reading."

*SEPTEMBER 12TH*

On this day, there was no open conflict, only mass confusion. The autumn solstice had arrived, but instead of leaves falling, it was snow that began to land on the massive panoramic skylights that lined the roof of the building.

In the basement, the small office was covered in blood and littered with bodies, but none of the Administrators, or captive Insurrectionists, seemed to mind anymore. Taking a deep sigh, the owner of Solstice Inc. gestured toward one of the remaining Administrators in the room, /u/HedwigMalfoy. He turned to one of the other Admins, and simply said, “Get rid of him.” Promptly, /u/HedwigMalfoy was taken from the room, and soon after, the other Admins had returned, with no trace of their former collaborator.

The owner then picked up the telephone from his desk. “Well, it’s time,” he announced.

**[Then, throughout the building, the intercom system sparked to life, as shock overcame every single person who heard their owner’s message.](https://vocaroo.com/i/s1tojLAAHWIF)**

Those that had been approached by either side joined with those that they had pledged themselves to in the hustle to the basement. There was no turning back now. However, /u/HippoAddict had gone alone before everybody else, where someone was waiting for them, still hidden in the stairwell. The unknown assailant quickly dispatched /u/HippoAddict, and hid the body before they heard a thunderous tide of footsteps coming down the stairs. The killer deftly joined the crowd as they entered into the massive room.

Lives had been lost, oaths had been taken, and the end of Solstice Inc. had truly begun.

6zsez7,1,2017-09-13,My dad has MS and I have a lot of feelings,thhhrowaway797,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6zsez7/my_dad_has_ms_and_i_have_a_lot_of_feelings/,"Throwaway because I'd rather be safe than sorry. My dad has progressive MS; I'm 21 now and he was diagnosed when I was around 13, but he had it before then (it took years to diagnose). I have mental health problems (mostly depression and anxiety) that have been going on as long as I can remember, but started getting really bad around the time my parents spent a lot of time in and out of hospitals and doctors offices trying to figure out what was going on with my dad. I felt like my parents weren't there for me when I needed them and reacted by becoming really independent and self-reliant to the point it feels like isolation (which has proved to be a hard pattern to break.) I live with my parents and sister. Because of my dad's MS, he's retired and has difficulties doing things around the house. My mom works full time and does her best, but she can't do everything. My sister is an engineering intern, working full time and taking a few online classes. She doesn't do anything at home (I don't really blame her, her classes are hard on top of her work hours.) I'm a nursing student in an accelerated BSN program, also working (not full time.) I feel as though a lot of responsibilities that could be spread out between my sister and I to make things easier on my parents (stuff like dishes, cleaning, taking care of our dog) get put on me; my parents are more likely to ask me to do things than my sister because I'll actually do them. I feel too that she gets a free pass sometimes because what she's studying is harder. It's honestly starting to feel like my sister's school takes priority in my life. I've tried talking to my mom about it, but nothing has changed. Confronting my sister is difficult; I feel as though every time I try to address something I get accused of being mean. (I will admit in times of stress or depression it can be difficult for me to be diplomatic, but I try not to have these kinds of conversations when I feel that I cannot be calm or reasonable.) So, I'm not really interested in talking directly to her about it.

 I'm very much interested in moving out of state, but feel as though I cannot at any point in the near future. I feel like my parents, especially my dad, need me nearby for help. I used to live on campus at a nearby college and would have to go home sometimes to help my dad with projects or household stuff. I've missed class because of this before. (My sister normally goes to an out of state school, putting her entirely out of the picture when she's at school.) In the future, I'd like to at least get my masters, but I'm also thinking about pursuing a PhD in psych of some kind (this plan is still very much in the works). However, I will NEED to go out of the area for this; there's no masters or PHD program in my area in what I want to pursue and I don't particularly like the area I'm living in anyways. I feel as though I'm having to put things in my life on hold because of what is required from me at home. If I go, I'll feel guilty because I'm leaving my parents and they might not have someone they can rely on. My mom is wonderful and strong as hell, but I don't want to put her in a position where she needs to act as a primary care giver without much (or any) support. That's not fair to her. (And no, I don't think my sister would be involved or provide very much support, and she may not be in the area either.) If something were to happen to my dad that I could have been able to prevent, I would never be able to forgive myself. I would also feel very guilty if my mom were to suffer from stress that I could help alleviate if I were there. I've kind of accepted that I will probably not be able to get a masters or PhD in a program of my choice until my dad dies. I feel like I'm putting my life on hold for my parents. On top of all of this, it's hard to talk about. I can have difficulties opening up and I don't really have many friends who I feel like I can talk about this with. (My boyfriend and my best friend have been amazing sources of support for me.) I want to make something clear, I do not resent either my father. I love him, I greatly dislike the disease he has been forced to deal with. I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense or it runs together. I just needed to get it out of my system."

Bernie's op ed in the [NY Times archive](https://archive.fo/FrNDt)

&gt;This is a pivotal moment in American history. Do we, as a nation, join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee comprehensive health care to every person as a human right? Or do we maintain a system that is enormously expensive, wasteful and bureaucratic, and is designed to maximize profits for big insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, Wall Street and medical equipment suppliers?

&gt;We remain the only major country on earth that allows chief executives and stockholders in the health care industry to get incredibly rich, while tens of millions of people suffer because they can’t get the health care they need. This is not what the United States should be about.

Snip

&gt;Even though 28 million Americans remain uninsured and even more are underinsured, we spend far more per capita on health care than any other industrialized nation. In 2015, the United States spent almost $10,000 per person for health care; the Canadians, Germans, French and British spent less than half of that, while guaranteeing health care to everyone. Further, these countries have higher life expectancy rates and lower infant mortality rates than we do.

&gt;The reason that our health care system is so outrageously expensive is that it is not designed to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, but to provide huge profits to the medical-industrial complex. Layers of bureaucracy associated with the administration of hundreds of individual and complicated insurance plans is stunningly wasteful, costing us hundreds of billions of dollars a year. As the only major country not to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry, we spend tens of billions more than we should.

&gt;The solution to this crisis is not hard to understand. A half-century ago, the United States established Medicare. Guaranteeing comprehensive health benefits to Americans over 65 has proved to be enormously successful, cost-effective and popular. Now is the time to expand and improve Medicare to cover all Americans.

Snip

&gt;***The transition to the Medicare for All program would take place over four years. In the first year, benefits to older people would be expanded to include dental care, vision coverage and hearing aids, and the eligibility age for Medicare would be lowered to 55. All children under the age of 18 would also be covered. In the second year, the eligibility age would be lowered to 45 and in the third year to 35. By the fourth year, every man, woman and child in the country would be covered by Medicare for All.***

Snip

&gt;Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want. According to an April poll by The Economist/YouGov, ***60 percent of the American people want to “expand Medicare to provide health insurance to every American,” including 75 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of independents and 46 percent of Republicans.***

&gt;Now is the time for Congress to stand with the American people and take on the special interests that dominate health care in the United States. Now is the time to extend Medicare to everyone.

[politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/13/bernie-sanders-single-payer-democrats-medicare-242616): Sanders's single-payer push divides democrats.  Good.  We're seeing ***which side they're on:*** the side of the people, or the side of the corporations.  Here are some examples.  Any doubts about ***which side they are on?***

&gt;Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that he would be “looking at all of” the party’s “many good” proposals to expand health care access, but declined to back Sanders. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi declared that her priority is shielding Obamacare from a GOP repeal push that’s not yet dead for good.

&gt;Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, one of the few Democrats subject to 2020 speculation who has not signed on to the Sanders bill, warned against letting the party’s attention slip to “longer-term health care policy” while the future of the Affordable Care Act remains up for debate.

&gt;“I think the risk is that we get distracted,” Murphy told reporters. “September’s not done. They can still ram through a repeal bill.”

[the hill](http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/350386-bernie-sanders-flexes-power-on-single-payer): Sanders flexes power on single-payer.

&gt;When Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) last introduced a single-payer bill in 2013, it didn’t attract a single co-sponsor. Now, as he unveils his “Medicare for all” bill on Wednesday, some of the biggest names in the Democratic Party will be by his side.

&gt;It’s a vindicating moment for Sanders, who is seen as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination in 2020.

&gt;The Vermont senator’s bill has virtually no chance of passing this Congress, and many Democrats, including members of leadership, remain wary of the idea.

&gt;But that doesn’t detract from the scope of his accomplishment. From the start of his insurgent presidential campaign last cycle, Sanders’s goal was to drive Democrats into his camp on health care and other issues — and it’s working, perhaps better than he could have ever imagined.

&gt;“I guess this is why the 2016 Democratic primary was a terrific thing,” said Jonathan Tasini, a prominent progressive organizer and former Sanders campaign surrogate. 

A thousand times yes!!!  

&gt;“Without that primary, ‘Medicare for all’ — the idea that millions of people would have what everyone has around the world — would not be in the conversation.”

A doctor's [op ed](https://archive.fo/lBsXc)

&gt;In nearly 40 years as a doctor, I witnessed time and again how inequality kills. Those without health insurance, such as Sarai (there are almost 30 million in the country), often cannot access the most basic care, let alone complex specialty care. But the problem is more serious than a simple lack of health insurance. What insurance card you hold can literally be a matter of life and death.

&gt;health insurance system affects hospitals, clinics and patients. I have practiced at three hospitals along a two-mile strip of Ogden Avenue in Chicago. I spent 17 years at Cook County Hospital, now the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, rising from intern to chief of general medicine. When I practiced at Cook County Hospital, it was largely a hospital for the uninsured.  Despite many improvements, largely because of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, many services, such as screening colonoscopies and hip replacements, are still beyond reach for patients and their doctors. I spent a decade at Mount Sinai Hospital, a not-for-profit hospital for the poor in North Lawndale, a neighborhood of concentrated poverty in Chicago. Sinai cares for a mostly minority population that is mostly uninsured or on Medicaid. In my 27 years at these two safety-net hospitals, not one of my patients received an organ or bone marrow transplant. Yet the organs that fed the transplant centers across the region came from the dying patients in these hospitals.  Our patients — the poorest of the poor — gave, but they never received.

Snip

&gt;I realized that all the doctors and nurses in the world could not cure health-care inequity if the insurance system itself was the problem.

Snip

&gt;My experiences also reflect the observations of Princeton economist Angus Deaton, who noted that the United States virtually has an apartheid health-care system. As structural racism has concentrated black and brown poverty into certain Zip codes, the hospitals and clinics serving minority neighborhoods often face severe resource challenges compared with those serving affluent neighborhoods of concentrated advantage. This inequity is only magnified by the way health insurance has been distributed across America. But it not just the poorest who are at risk. Our current multi-payer for-profit health insurance system perpetuates premature death by putting many people at an extreme disadvantage when it comes to affording care. Those who have better health insurance policies can access better care. However, even patients with insurance cards face skyrocketing co-pays, deductibles and pharmaceutical prices that keep them from seeking care. Last year, 27 percent of Americans said they had postponed or avoided getting care they needed because of the cost; 23 percent said they had skipped a recommended test or treatment due to cost; and 21 percent said they had chosen not to fill prescriptions for medication because they couldn’t afford it.

&gt;Death rates tell the same story. Since 1980, there have been dramatic gains in life expectancy for the top 20 percent of U.S. earners. At the same time, the poorest 20 percent have seen their life expectancy plummet. While access to health insurance is not the only cause, it certainly contributes to the life expectancy gap. In Canada, with its single-payer health insurance, the life expectancy gap between the rich and the poor narrowed during the same period.

Snip

&gt;The best solution is a national solution; one that has been implemented by nearly every other developed nation. Medicare, the popular insurance program for those over 65 and people with disabilities, has a 90 percent satisfaction rate. Under a Medicare-for-all program, every worker and business in America would pay into the system through a combination of payroll and other taxes and fees, just as we pay taxes and fees for schools, water and the military. There would be no complex health insurance payments to navigate, no prohibitive co-pays and deductibles, no corporate welfare to boost insurance company profits. Untangling health care from employment would not only free workers to change jobs or start new businesses, but would also eliminate the largest and most stealthy tax loophole in the U.S. tax code: the $250 billion annual tax-free subsidy of employer-based health insurance.

Snip

&gt;The right to health care in America is not an issue of the left or the right. It’s a matter of right and wrong. Winston Churchill reportedly said, “You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing … after they have tried everything else.” Today, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will introduce a bill in the Senate that will provide a path forward for Medicare for all. Let’s do the right thing. We have tried everything else.

[Brent Budowsky](http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/350237-clinton-should-back-sanders-medicare-for-all-bill): Clinton should back Sanders's ""Medicare for All"" bill.  No.  Just no.  Keep her far, far away from it.  We don't want her fucking it up. 

&gt;In the coming days, Clinton will either support, oppose or equivocate when asked whether she backs the Sanders bill.  Her answer will have important implications for health care and politics in America and how Clinton is viewed by the huge number of voters who favor ""Medicare for all"".

&gt;Clinton should unequivocally support the Sanders bill. If she does, it will bring together the national leadership of the Democratic Party behind the program that will be a landmark achievement of the next important Democratic president, and it will bring together those who supported Clinton and those who supported Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries.

Good thing Hillary is never unequivocal.

Wait, there's more!  Bernie will be introducing his free tuition plan on [10 Oct](http://www.castletonspartan.com/news/view.php/1029518/Bernie-coming-to-CU-to-unveil-free-tuiti)

&gt;Get ready to feel the Bern again on Oct. 10 at 7 p.m. in Castleton University’s Glenbrook Gymnasium.

&gt;Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is coming to campus to propose his plan for a legislation that would give free tuition to all students who go to any public college or university in the country, Dean of Advancement Jeff Weld said in an interview on Friday.

&gt;The event will be open to all and it ***will be live-streamed at other colleges and universities during hundreds of rallies across the country,*** Weld said.
When asked why Castleton was chosen for this event, Weld said Sanders wanted to make the announcement at a Vermont college.
“Castleton is one of the most affected [colleges],” Weld said.

Edited to add CNN' report on details. [link](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-plan-details/index.html)

&gt;Under Sanders' proposal, Americans would receive a ""Universal Medicare card"" that would be a ticket to a comprehensive health care services, including hospital stays, doctor visits, substance abuse treatment, dental, vision and reproductive care -- ***including abortion.***

Take that!  Planned Parenthood &amp; NARAL.  

&gt;However, ***consumers may have to pay up to $250 out-of-pocket for prescription drugs,*** with incentives to use generic medications. Sanders, who's been vocal about lowering drug prices, would allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies.

Per script?  Per month?  Per year?  Way to be imprecise &amp; incomplete in your reporting, CNN.

&gt;Long-term care, which Sanders had included in the version he unveiled during his presidential campaign last year, will not be covered. It will be addressed in separate legislation, an adviser to Sanders told CNN.

&gt;The bill calls for the elimination of premiums for private health insurance, deductibles and co-pays. However, most Americans and businesses will pay what Sanders says is a much smaller share of their income to fund the program.

[quartz q&amp;a on bill](https://qz.com/1075942/medicare-for-all-how-bernie-sanders-single-payer-system-would-work/)

I know there is some particular interest in this:

&gt;What about abortion?

&gt;The bill covers comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion services. Making abortion a part of the bill, “was not an afterthought,” the Sanders aide said, and the proposal tries to address all of the limitations that might try to stop its inclusion. ***The bills specifically deals with the Hyde amendment, which blocks federal funds from being spent to pay for abortion services, stating explicitly that “RESTRICTIONS SHALL NOT APPLY.*** Any other provision of law in effect on the date of enactment of this Act restricting the use of Federal funds for any reproductive health service shall not apply.” Further, the bill would forbid—both at a federal and state level—discriminating against an eligible provider on the grounds that it provides abortions. ***The bill is intended to send signal that abortion is a core right for the Democratic party to defend.***

And again I say, take that!  Naral &amp; planned parenthood.

And this:

&gt;But is this going anywhere?

&gt;Not in the short term. And an immediate fight is not what Sanders and his allies want, either. ***According to Adam Greene, the co-founder of Progressive Campaign Change Committee, a grassroots organization that worked with Sanders in developing the bill, this is a first step to building viable support behind the idea of a universal health care, with the hope of gaining enough momentum to be able to turn it into law the next time Democrats have the majority.*** They are thinking along the lines of what happened when the Family and Medical Leave Act was approved under the Clinton administration— after consensus for it had been built under George H. W. Bush’s presidency.

&gt;Though the proposal—and the widespread support it’s gaining—has raised criticism for being too bold, and getting the party tangled up in another big health-care reform, Greene says going bold is the right path. With Republicans in power in both houses of Congress and the White House, Democrats have an opportunity to pursue and build support for big ideas. In fact, his group hopes to make it an electoral issue, and capitalize on the Republican party’s inability to provide an alternative to Obamacare. ***“Republicans might have done Medicare for All the biggest favor by showing they have no way to improve the current system,” Greene says.***

6zur15,3,2017-09-13,"Never give up [F, 33]",KengthePeng,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/6zur15/never_give_up_f_33/,"There are conventional ways to start and lead your life, there are also unconventional ways. I honestly couldn’t tell now what prepares you better for what’s out there, healthier for sure, better, nope. I’ve been hesitating for a while now, if I should share my story or not but I think unconventional life stories can help others to find motivation, new ways and courage to do a step they’ve never considered. In the end, it’s up to each individual if they’re taking something from it or not.

I’m not quite sure where to start so I’ll just start randomly at a rather young age of around 10 and grade 4. I’ve been in Germany for about 3 years at that time. My parents immigrated from Russia 2 weeks before my 7th birthday. If I remember correct it was the political asylum kind of move. At the age of 10 my language was already really good from what I recall but I’ve never really enjoyed studying. I must add that when we left Russia I was supposed to go into the second grade right away, after a test concluded that I was further advanced than other kids my age. Which meant I would have skipped first grade. In Germany, I got into the first grade where kids learn to spell their names, as I did not talk German at that time. I could count, spell, read in Russian, and was mostly bored in school once the language barrier lifted. By the 4th grade, my parents, which were still rather lost in Germany had to decide which school I was supposed to attend. I told them straight up “I won’t study” – COMMON I was 10 years old! They listened to my teacher at that time, a teacher that could not stand me or my parents, my first experience with racism. She recommended [Realschule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realschule) which obviously no one objected, how could they? I did not care and my parents did not know any better. I wasn’t great at school, I was mostly lazy and couldn’t care less for studying. 

Here I am, 5th grade Realschule. I’ve had some kids I knew from the elementary school in my new class but most of the kids I’ve never met before. Why would I care though? I’m now 11, a happy and outgoing kid that never had any issues with making friends. I was quiet at times, I always liked to be private and drawn back but I’ve also been just as outgoing as I was quiet. 

Few years went by, with ups and downs where the downs by far outweigh the ups. Think about the stereotype of a class, that was our class! It was divided into the nerds, careerists, cool kids, outsiders and some other weird groups. I’ve never belonged to any of them but bounced between each. I think that has something to do with the fact that I wanted to get along with everyone and my interests were so wide spread that I just couldn’t stick around one group for too long. I didn’t like the cool kids group, because they were threatening everyone else like garbage, including me most of the time. Nerds were fun but they stuck to themselves and weren’t really going out a lot, which I did at that time. That could also be applied to the 3-4 girls that tried to get on the teachers’ good side, studied hard but were boring for the most part. So yeah, I bounced – got along with the suck ups, played games with the nerds, was needed by the cool kids and was still somewhat an outsider because I never had the feeling I belong. Everything about that was shallow, everything. My friends were all outside school. Looking back, I never really cared. School was a necessity, a place you would go to because it was expected of you, everyone else was doing it and you would get in trouble if you didn’t go. It’s never been a place for me to gain knowledge, meet friends, have fun or any other particular reason you might find in your memories. 
Around the age of 14 was probably the worst time for me as I tried to change. Everyone has their own way of going around new situations they’re thrown in. Some are fast at making friends, others need some time to get adjusted to their surroundings. I’m the later and I first observe. But I’m not weak by any means. I’ve never been quiet really nor did I ever had troubles making friends. Kids are cruel though, once they think they found a weakness, be it real or fake, they’ll abuse it and if you’re alone it’s close to impossible to get out of it. One of the biggest bully points was the fact that we weren’t the richest people around. My parents used to buy me second hand clothes and I never really mind. I didn’t care what I was wearing and I never understood why other did. But they did. So, the first change was to go from second hand clothes to branded stuff. My mom tried to help me out as good as she could because she saw how much I suffered. I got what I wanted but my style was still way off from what the kids were used to. I was playing football at that time, roller hockey, skateboarding and a lot more so my whole look was baggy. I cut off my hair, short, like a boy and was wearing baggy clothes. Lots of it was practical. I couldn’t stand tight clothes and since I loved to play football anywhere, I preferred clothes I could move around in. Long hair bothered me when I was doing sports and the fact I had long hair and boobs bothered the guys on the field a lot. With those changes, I was still a girl but it didn’t hit them in the face as they were playing with or versus me. They didn’t hold back as much anymore, especially new players that have never met me before. School is a different story though – you are a teen and you look different, you’re in for some troubles. I felt good though so honestly, even back then I did not care. I laughed about most of the stuff they said or did – not the crazy way but the “I don’t care about you guys” way. 

My life slightly changed, barely noticeable at the age of 13. It wasn’t something you could grasp, see, hear or even feel. It wasn’t something that would hit you in the face and be like “Hey I changed” but it was slow, crawling, not visible in anyway. I got irritated faster at things, moody, slightly more aggressive – verbally. Now you think, 13, teenager…..right that has to be puberty!  Well, that’s what we all thought. I’ve started trying to get with my head through the wall on any occasion I could find. I did not feel understood, not in school, not by friends, especially not by my family. I felt alien. It’s the feeling when you talk to someone and you can see that your words do not reach their thoughts. Like you’re talking a different language. Again – puberty huh? As it came unnoticed without any big bangs or big symptoms, crawled into our everyday life, it was taken for granted. If it looks like puberty, smells like it and acts like it, it must be exactly it. Now if I think back, the puberty amplified all the symptoms I had, 10-fold. That was the first time I jumped on my bike and just wanted to leave. I actually left but didn’t get too far. I cycled to the next big city, which was about 1 hour away by bike, calmed down and returned. But that’s where shit started to hit hard, really hard. Over the next few years I’ve had thought about running away, suicide and a lot of other things a lot. They were always on my mind, especially when I had another big fight with my parents. Remember I said I felt alien? I didn’t feel like anyone understood me and in fact, no one ever took the time to even try. 

I’ve had a lot going for me. I did a lot of sport and could try whatever I wanted. I had a lot of freedom. My parents trusted me, even though we’ve always clashed. The boundaries were tested though, in any aspect you could think off. When I had to be home at 10pm, I was home at 12. When 12 was the limit, I could come back at 4am. You might be surprised by the times and wonder if my parents neglected me. That’s not the case though. Yes, they worked a lot and had barely time for me but I’ve never really felt neglected, not understood yes, neglected, never. It was trust. I’ve never really tried to cause trouble. Headstrong, stubborn, moody and a lot more but I could tell the right from wrong. I swore, I partied, I tried drugs (only weed) I drank and I smoked but I’ve never done anything to get myself into trouble. I never got home drunk, high or taken in by police. Well the drunk part was never obvious so they just didn’t know. I was allowed to stay out late, go wherever I wanted and do whatever I wanted as long as I did what my parents wanted me to do – study. Never happened – didn’t know how.

It was manageable till the end of the 9th grade. I did miss a few hours or days here and there but most were excused by a doctor or my parents so I moved into the 10th grade after I passed a makeup exam in English. Barely passed I must add. The trouble in school for me started way earlier but were only obvious a lot later. 
I never intentionally tried to make any trouble in school but I couldn’t sit still except if I had a pencil in my hands or a book to read. I’ve had always problems focusing but it just got worse with time so the only way to keep me still was to let me do my stuff. I would still fully participate in the lessons but I wouldn’t bother other kids with my shuffling ect. It was my German teacher that noticed it and she also asked me to show whatever I’ve produced in her lessons to her. The others, they kicked me out of class or told me to quiet down once they took away my pencil/book. I’ve been told later, years later that I’m an auditory person, I learn by listening. You can imagine, having 400 missing hours, I did not attend a lot of the classes which eventually led to me not receiving my papers for [Mittlere Reife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittlere_Reife). So in addition for me having all those issues at home which could not be explained, bullied at school for being who I am and ignored/stamped “lazy and stupid” by the teachers I’ve not received my papers and left the school with [Hauptschulabschluss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptschulabschluss) after the grade of 9. A small explanation: To get Mittlere Reife I would need to get Hauptschulabschluss after the grade of 10 and then I could get the other degree. To go to university, if desired, I would need Mittlere Reife with qualification and could go to a Gymnasium to get my Abitur. There are a lot of different ways to receive either of the degrees and it would be way too much if I would try to explain all of them. 

After leaving the school my parents were obviously mad but my mom still signed me up to a [Waldorfschule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education). A slightly different kind of school but she put me in a grade lower than I could have gotten. So again, boredom kicked in even though all the bullying ect. completely stopped. I went to that school and tried to attend even though I still had big health issues which everyone completely ignored. Some of which were, now chronic sleeping issues, paranoia, hearth racing, constant adrenaline issues and stomach pain. I’m sure I forgot some but you get the picture; I wasn’t feeling great. At the age of 19, I went to see a doc. I’ve been there before obviously, I’ve had a 24 hrs EKG, different tests for different issues but I’ve never went there before and told her everything at once. Once she heard it, she lay me down and checked my throat right away. 2 weeks later I’ve had new medication and an organ less, they removed my thyroid gland almost completely. My new life began but…it’s certainly not easy to change from one day to another after going through a small hell for 6 years. I’ve needed almost a year to adjust to the medication and being able to sleep properly. This led for me missing out on a lot of school. They said I could advance into the next class but once the 12th grade was done, I wouldn’t receive my degree because I missed out too much. What to do? Obviously, I left!

The next step, I’m not 19, close to 20, was evening school. Going to school during the evenings would allow me to get my sleeping stuff under control and finally get my degree. But missing out becomes a second nature, it’s not just sleeping in, oversleeping ect. but it’s the non-existing fear of the consequences if you miss a lesson or two. I’ve been close to be kicked out of school, pulled it through though and went out with the Hauptschulabschluss after grade 10 as the best in my grade by literally just attending. I’ve still never studied, I didn’t even know how. Now one more year and I’ve got my Mittlere Reife, one, more, year. Half way through shit went down. My life was thrown upside down and I’ve had a decision to make. Neither of the decisions were great but I took one that had the best possible outcome. Which meant – stopping and leaving. I left. I’m now 21 years old, still just the lowest degree I could get (or one of the lowest), in a new country with well, limited English. I was the worst in English back in school. What new country you may ask? I moved to Sweden. 

I got friendly with the idea of a new start and started preparing for university. The great thing about Sweden, you could get in if you get enough points for the subject you want to study. They don’t really care about your degrees. Obviously, most kids get their points in school but you also could get courses ect. to gain those points, which I did. I think I’ve had about a year to finish, which would then let me join the university – I honestly can’t remember what I wanted to study anymore. It didn’t matter, my life changed again, from one day to another and I returned to Germany, again without achieving anything. Back in Sweden I was depressed for 2 years that I’ve stayed there. The way I left Germany and the way I lived there wasn’t healthy for me but I tried to pull through. 
So here I am, back in Germany, with still just the Hauptschulabschluss after grade 10, years older than before – I was 23, nothing accomplished yet. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, or who I wanted to be or who I even was. I was totally lost and a week after my arrival I hit the darkest place I’ve ever been too. That changed my life, for the most part. About 2 weeks later I’ve read up on the options I had to finally get my degree. I was and still am lazy so I managed to find a way which would allow me to get it instant more or less, without going to school. It’s a test you sign up for and if you pass you have your degree. Allowed only for those that finished at least the 9th grade, which applied to me.  I obviously signed up without any idea how I would even prepare for it – remember, I never studied and didn’t know how. At almost the same time I got an interesting opportunity. The youth club I went too as a kid and teenager was still active and they’ve just started a program that was supposed to help kids “with issues” to find a good education. I was put in touch with a CEO from a tech company and he gave me the chance to apply for a software development position. So, I did! To no surprise, well actually it was a surprise to me, I got rejected at first. I had a friend who just recently joined the same company and he was slightly worse off than me so yes, it did surprise me. They’ve told me, if I would pass with an average of a 3 or better, they would take me – honestly, I was super upset. Why did I have such requirements when my friend went in without any. I found out later, that it was due to my body language. Apparently the way I talked, with confidence, didn’t really work well with my body language, which was rather shy and insecure. Lesson learned huh?

To my biggest surprise, I passed. I got my degree with an average of 2,7 which would qualify me to get my abitur. I, to this day, have no Idea how I’ve made it. I was out from school for years, I did not really study, I tried but it was mostly in vain and I still passed. I was happy but also unsure. My pride was really hurt when I was declined on my first try and thought about not going there. At that time, I did not know the reason why I got declined, I’ve got told that way later. I swallowed my pride and called them. I’ve got an internship right away and they let me join the education at the start of the new school year. The internship was great, everything was new, people were nice to me and I made some friends there. I enjoyed coding for the most part even though I’ve never touched anything alike before. But that’s where the problems begin. A year passed, I’m 6 months into my education and I’m getting bored. We’ve had another guy who joined with me and he had to catch up to me, because I was 6 months ahead. So, it was going slow and nowhere for that matter which annoyed the hell out of me. A year into the education I was more or less done. I didn’t quit but I wasn’t happy anymore. I didn’t want to quit cause I wanted to finally finish something I’ve started. Some issues I’ve had back then never went away. I’ve still issues with sleeping, a really bad relationship with sleep all together. This led to me missing out on school or coming late to work. The Company I worked for was patient with me. This program was for kids that has issues after all. In addition, I’ve took on way more than I could handle from the very start. I wanted to earn money, I want to be more independent so I’ve had 3 jobs for the first year. Second year I’ve actually dropped my other jobs and tried to get my Abitur which didn’t really succeed as I’ve burned out about 6 months before my finals. My brain fried. My project manager was a real asshole. No empathy or sympathy for that matter and he dumped on a trainee more work than she could handle, especially on a topic she wasn’t even studying. I am lazy, always was so I’ve found a way to go around reprogramming the stuff over and over again which he wasn’t happy about. Paper prototyping, slightly advanced and not on paper. I’ve made screenshots from the applications and modified them in gimp. To find something he would finally like so I wouldn’t have to spend hours or days doing something he would scramble right away. I ended up doing that for a huge project and be responsible for the whole team. I’m no designer, I’ve no clue about customers and what would be great for them. I did not receive any training nor help. Only thing I heard was “That’s not good, redo it.” How, why, what exactly – I do not know till this day. 
I was out for about 6 months going through a therapy that made me gain a slight momentum to not abandon everything and actually finish my education. It wasn’t because I wanted the therapy but I wouldn’t have been left alone without a paper from that doc that would say “Yes, she has a burn out, leave her alone”. I passed, barely but I passed. The last words I’ve heard from my manager “How can someone like you pass?”

Thanks to my therapy I made a decision. After I finish my education I’ll do what I want. I had my degree, which my parents insisted on, I had my education, which my parents insisted on but now it’s time to do what I want. I left Germany about 2 weeks after I’ve finished my education. 7 months later I’ve started my dream job. I still needed about 2 years to find myself. To know who and what I am. I’m no alien, I’m just not like others, not the majority at least. Others might struggle to find out who they are because they’re looking in the wrong direction but there’s nothing wrong with it. Some might never get there but again – as long as we keep trying, nothing’s lost. Don’t be sheep. 

One thing I think is important to add – our school system, especially in Germany requires us to know what we want really early on, especially if we want to have the most comfortable way to get there. I did not know what I wanted to do, till I started doing it. I was 28 at that time. Not 10, where you decide what middle school you will attend. Not 16, when you finish that middle school. Not even 19 when I could have finished my abitur. My education only showed me what I most certainly did not want to do. Take your time to figure out what you want and make sure that you don’t spend most of your life doing something you don’t enjoy only cause someone else was expecting you to do that. It’s your life!

I’ve still the same feelings as I’ve had when I was a kid. Nothing changed for me on the understanding part to be fair. Doubt anyone gets me, but again, why should anyone get me? The difference is, it does not matter. I understand myself. You learn the skills you need to be a part of the society, it does not mean you must fundamentally change yourself. You gain the skills you require without giving yourself up. I still can think the way I do, I just need the skills to communicate those thoughts (Still working on this bit). If you look or dress differently, wait….what exactly is wrong with that? We’re all unique. No one has the same face, hair, skin, body as anyone else (except twins maybe :P) so who said, we have to dress/style alike? I think we all should stop telling others what they’re supposed to do, who they’re supposed to be, what they’re supposed to think and how they’re supposed to think. Our standards aren’t everyone’s standards. We all should start listening to what they want, who they want to be, what they think and most importantly, why they think that. No one is in any position to tell me or anyone else for that matter, how to dress, what to eat, what to think, what to like/dislike, who to love/not love ect. We’re all so self-centered that we forget that we aren’t absolute and our opinion does not matter to anyone else but ourselves. 

On that note, I think having someone neutral to talk to is a must have if you’ve a rough patch in your life. I’m not talking about medication, hypnosis or any special treatment. I’m talking about a person you can trust, who will listen, and help you find a way to deal with whatever you are dealing. Trust me, there’s more than just black and white. There are a lot of grey shades (please don’t make the 50 shades of grey joke now) and a lot of different paths that can be taken, you might just not see it. A good counselor won’t tell you what to do but he/she will help you find those possibilities you might have never considered with asking the questions you’ve never asked yourself. 

I’ve had a really rocky path. It’s not cause I’m stupid or lazy, it’s cause I’m different. I can’t study like others do and I’m really sure that there are a lot out there that have the same or similar issues in that aspect. Being bullied, some never get up after this. Having teachers that do anything but help you, I still strongly believe that the educational system in Germany is flawed to an unimaginable extent. But I’ve never used anything as an excuse to give up. I never stopped. In the end, it’s no one but yourself that has to live your life. Not my parents, not my teachers, not the bullies or even that stupid project manager. I’ve left a lot of questions open, about the bullying, about my illness, about my education and I’m more than happy to tell you more if you want but I don’t think it really matters for this particular story.

6zvkpg,10,2017-09-13,Feeling bummed over fruit,ornamental_conifer,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6zvkpg/feeling_bummed_over_fruit/,"**TL;DR:** Was consuming lots of fruit by adding both fruit and chia seeds to morning smoothies, turns out that was a very bad idea. 

Hey everyone, long time lurker first time poster. Super quick backstory: I was originally 151 lbs about 3 years ago and got that all the way down to 127 when I was stressed to the max in graduate school (although I would never endorse a stress-induced starvation diet). I'm a small woman, so for me the difference in that weight loss was like night and day on my frame. I carry nearly all of my weight in my torso so any weight gain is super noticeable super quick. After a summer internship I rebounded up to around 141 lbs thanks to a ton of departmental lunches, then slowly got it down to 131 through calorie tracking and exercise. After graduating from grad school this past May I made a promise to myself to *really* overhaul my diet and make healthier choices.


I started making smoothies in the morning in my Nutribullet with kale, spinach, coconut water, almond milk, flax seeds, chia seeds, and lots of cut-up fruit like bananas, cranberries, blueberries, mango, and strawberries. Along with those morning smoothies I would cut up a separate small piece of fruit, usually a plum, and eat a bowl of whole grain cereal in order to have something solid in my tummy. 


Since I'm super ultra hungry in the morning I thought the healthy morning breakfasts would be great for my diet since it would all be pure vitamins and minerals. I took about four months off from calorie tracking because I found myself really obsessing to an unhealthy degree and unfortunately it showed up in the scale. After plateauing at 131 for 2 months post-graduating, I suddenly went up from 131 to 135 in the span of the most recent 2 months and wanted to know why. I logged my breakfast on MyFitnessPal and come to find out I am consuming around 735 calories just in the morning between the smoothie  and the cereal. It doesn't matter that I skip dinners most nights, the fact that more than half my daily calories are eaten before I even get to work makes me feel like an idiot and it explains most of why I've started gaining weight again. I thought my breakfast was low calorie and healthy so I would unknowingly exceed my calorie goal during lunch. MFP is also telling me that the sugars in the fruit I'm eating are blowing away my daily sugar goal, even though I'm only using raw fruit that I cut up myself. I had no idea raw fruit was that unhealthy for me. I also didn't realize 1 tablespoon of chia seeds has 138 calories in it. Oops.

I guess it's back to the drawing board. If you can't tell by now I'm trying to keep my daily calorie intake to around 1300 or so. Because I'm so short 1600 calories is considered maintenance and 1200-1300 is considered weight-loss. I'll have to cut the smoothies out of my diet and be more disciplined about eating hard boiled eggs instead of whole grains since grains pack so many calories as well. I'm also wondering if it's a good idea to cut down the calories drastically in the morning by only eating a single hard boiled egg and then reintroducing a small dinner back into my diet. Right now I only eat breakfast and lunch and I don't snack at all. It's so frustrating being small with a non-existent metabolism but I'm hoping by tweaking my diet, removing fruit, and continuing the 3-times-a-week exercise routine I'm in I should hopefully be able to reverse this trend. 

So yeah, lesson learned. Fruits are bad, vegetables are good. "

I'm not a terribly good writer, so constructive criticism is highly coveted and welcome.  

I know that the prompt asked for a character literally born w/o emotions but gained them over time via a GoFundMe - esque activity.  However, the prompt inspired me to write about my experience with high - functioning depression (which I've had since sixth grade, though not so much any more).  At any rate, depression quite often feels like a void without happiness.

The skies were dark and dreary, black - gray banners to an army of rain.  Flashes of light brought out the shadows of large buildings -- *one, two, three* -- and a roll of gravel soon after.  

He sat without and in all his nervous angst; it was too crowded inside for an open seat, though a half - log bench held one place empty, an equal distance from the singer and the bar.  The coffee had grown cold and was bitter besides, and stood out from under the cover of a wide cafe awning.  His wood - and - steel chair was colder than his drink.  He held no doubt that when he stood, his arse would come to life with a thousand pins and needles.  *No pain, no gain,* he thought the old adage went.  But the words had spun a different tale.  *Pain is your friend.*  My *friend.*

A waitress came through a glass door that was slick with wet and hard to look through.  She held a metal pail and a cloth and brush, and bent over the first table beneath the canvas overhang.  “Beautiful day,” he said, but his lips choked on the words.  It wasn’t beautiful.  It rained heavy sheets and he could barely see across the road.  He could see her back, though, and his eyes drifted down.  “Cold, isn’t it?”  His question came more as a stutter.

The waitress ignored him and scrubbed, the bristles of her brush scratching manfully against the metal tabletop.  There was nothing new in that.  She moved to the second, third, and fourth and fifth.  He watched her pull suds from the pail, scrub, rinse.

“My coffee’s gone cold,” he told her.  “Could you get me a refill?”  Her back stayed turned, and he did not see that she was wearing headphones.

Winds raced across the empty street with wrappers and plastic cups to bring a shiver down his spine.  The hems of his pants were wet and wetter.  He felt a cold creep along the length of his calf past his knee, but it was only spilled coffee.  It was so cold that it almost burned.  *Hello, friend,* he told himself, and wondered if a friend would hear.  None of his, he knew.  He had none.

He thought he’d found one, but it had been a long time since that it seemed many years had passed.  At work and by his desk, he remembered.  Fake wood, four poles, a computer, in a cubicle by the window whose shades never closed.  “Hey, want a drink?  I bought extras,”  she said.  She’d come six past noon, when the skies had dimmed and the stars opened sleepy eyes.  Her dirty - blonde hair splayed behind her, angled and twisted as though her comb’s spears had failed, but it was only a winter storm outside.  *Who was she?*  He had wondered.  *An intern?  The coffee - girl?*  There were neither interns nor coffee - girls.  She worked a couple rows down in a larger cubicle.  *You aren’t supposed to leave before seven,* he almost told her.  She winked and placed a cup on his desk.  “Our little secret.”  It was as if she’d known what he meant to say.

They found themselves ‘neath another overhang -- an eave of stone overlooking a frigid bay -- sitting beside ankle - deep snow and with ballerina flakes for company.  It was eight, if his watch held true, and he was trembling from the cold.  She was not; she wore his jacket, black and thick, puffed from down.  “Pretty night,” she said.  She giggled and pointed up, where a mound of snow perched over a lamppost.  A nightly bird alit to shower them in white.  A couple three tables down kissed over a white tablecloth and two emptied plates.  He nursed mulled wine in his palm, breathed the steam and smelled the spices, wondered if they might do the same.  They hadn’t.

Where was she now?  It was on his mind most days, especially now with rain draped over the walkways and there was little else to watch.  A car drove past, but it was only two headlights or gleaming orbs, perhaps angry eyes and nothing more.  *She left you,* he told himself.  *No, she moved.  It doesn’t matter.  You were alone then, and you’re alone now.*  Small wonder that the world was weeping.

The waitress finished her rounds.  She turned with her brush and rag and pail, and made for the door that stood halfway in and halfway without.  A trumpet of heat sounded and his gooses coiled back, before the door closed and it was cold again.  He sat for a while, thinking of what was and what could’ve been.

Sometimes, he dreamed of a life with her.  *If she had stayed,* he thought, but another person sneered from the shadows of his mind.  *If you were less pathetic.*  Other times, his thoughts fixed on his past and brought tears to his eyes.  Or was that the rain?  *Pain and rain.*

He stood some time after his cup had gone empty and his bladder had swelled.  It had been hours by then, but the rain showed no sign of letting up.  Sheets of water rippled down the sides of buildings, pooled along gutters where the drains had become clogged.  The glass door was open a crack, where the sounds of feasting sneaked through.  As good a time as any to leave, he told himself.  Though, if truth be told, he had been hoping for a smaller crowd.

Inside, a fire licked against rounded walls of stone, rising and falling and rising again in the wake of each passerby.  Yet try as it might, its tongues never leapt far enough to reach the wooden floor beside the cobbled pit.  It filled the air instead, with a musky scent of charred wood and ash.  Tables had been laid over that floor with log stumps for chairs.  Cloth banners fluttered from the rafters.  Sports teams, colleges, the local schools.  Polaroid pictures hung framed in black and covered by dust, in a fashion that most bars kept to.  In a corner, a man feasted on roast chicken stuffed with onions, potatoes, lemongrass, and rosemary.  A thinner man sat a row of seats down, nursing a cup of something warm as he stared into the twitching flames.  It was loud.  *Too loud.*



He fled, his coffee cup abandoned on the corner of the bar.  Outside, he found an angrier rain.  A raven quorked and pecked along the fringes of the sidewalk, its feathers matted.  People stared from the glass walls of shops and other bars.  *“What an idiot,”* they seemed to say.  A few words leaked through the thinner panes.  “Why is he outside?” One said.  “Without an umbrella?”  He thought it might be how the fishes felt, stuck in their bowls and with odd faces staring down.

Why indeed, he wondered.  Perhaps if he stood long enough, the rain would wash whatever was on him that drove others away.  *No.*  He shook his head and squeezed water from his sleeves.  Years of scrubbing would not clean his skin.  *If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.  Then quit, when you’ve tried too many times.*

He turned an alley where the rainfall was lesser, but the drain was backed up and the street so deep with water that it made little matter.  It lapped at his ankles and covered them, and ended just slightly above.  *What if I stuck my head under?*  Rough concrete walls and foggy windows flickered in and out of view with the street lights above.  A group of men huddled where the sidewalk was tallest that it stood above the water like an island.  One turned and spat, and watched the white spittle dissolve over brown waters.

Cars were more frequent on the alley’s other side.  It was busy for a Saturday, and nightlights had already begun to flicker on in the corners of doors and above the street, where strings of lights swayed in the wind.  A sandwich man stood on the corner of one street.  “Buy one, get one half off!”  The man gripped his signs to keep them from flapping, pointed down, wiped his brow, then gripped his signs again when the wind gusted by.

“Hello,” the man said as he passed by.  “Care for a sandwich?  It’s half off if you buy one!”

*As if I hadn’t read the words.*  “On my way there,” he said.  *What have I got to lose?*  Another voice whispered over his shoulder, but the walkways were empty when he turned.  *A lot,* it said.  *Six figures, a home.  Your life.  An easy life, yours, so why are you sad?*

When he reached it, he found that the sandwich shop held a want for repair, though it seemed that repair had not hastened to come.  Cracks criss - crossed the walls and floors, and both were dirty and sticky to touch.  *There is not a line, at least,* he told himself.  When he reached the counter, he found it far cleaner, with a stainless steel tabletop and glass so polished that he mightn’t have noticed had he not looked closely.  Behind it in plastic crates sat vegetables: bell - peppers and mushrooms, jalapenos and Thai dragons, tomatoes, onions, and a stack of flatbread and wheat, and much and more bread that he could not name.  

“You seem sad,” the cashier said, so bluntly that the man opposite him stopped and stared.  His beard was unshaven, his hair rough and unkempt, but his nails were neatly trimmed and his hands seemed freshly washed. “First sandwich is on me.”

“But…”

“No.  It’s free.  Feel better, friend.”

He left the shop with a sandwich in his hand that was melted pepper - jack and turkey, with peppers and mushrooms and pickles.  The first bite was hardest, but each one after went down easier and quickly.  He didn’t question, wonder, or sigh.  He didn’t think, either.  He just ate.  

When he had finished, he reached for a napkin but saw a note written there.  *I don’t know from where your sadness comes,* it read.  The black ink was smudged and the paper torn at the corners.  *But I see your misery.  Drop by if you ever need to talk.  You know where to find me.*  He smiled and tucked the note into his pocket and wiped his lips clean with the back of his hand. 

He ducked under an awning that was near full with people and shoved his way past to the other end.  He ran to the next overhang, then the next after that.  His heart pounded against his ears.  *Thud, thud,* it said, though that was perhaps the caffeine who had come to bear.  His drum had never sounded so loudly.  *The coffee, or the movement.*  He liked his coffee lightly creamed and barely sweetened with honey or condensed milk, never sugar.  The bitter taste was rough on his tongue, but he savored each sip.

By now, he had made it to downtown where the streets were fullest.  Cars had lined up to wait for parking spots, so the street must needs be backed a block or two if his ears heard true.  It was difficult to see past two cars down.  But he was no stranger to main street, to its sights and smells and people, though he thought the latter might not know him so well.  He could tell Biascetti’s by the scent of tomatoes and the *chink* of plates.  As it passed, he smelled garlic and saw a fat man by the window, straddling a bench.  Light flashed half a block down, and he took it for the fire station or the hospital.  Those stood abreast, though one was brick and the other was metal.  That flash might’ve a water - truck or ambulance.  It would not surprise him if he heard that there had been many crashes that day.  Such was the storm, he thought, that even headlights could not pierce the veil of rain.

“It is a dull thing, rain,” said a balding lady beside him.  She smelled of mothballs and had leathered flesh.

The man beside her shivered and muttered darkly.  “Gray skies all,” he said.  “Too cold for me.”

A roll of gravel echoed across the sky, and many stepped from their hidey - holes and canvas roofs, or peered through watered windows to look up towards the sky.  *Dull enough?* He thought waspishly.  Where had that come from?

Then the skies were alight in hues of white and gray and black as lightning rent the clouds and its rolling hills in two.  The man gasped and shuffled away and the sidewalks became empty.  Windows and canvas awnings were steered away from, but he moved into the rain and stared to the sky, watched as white strokes carved their way across a palette of gray.  He thought he had never seen anything so bright.

Windows and canvas awnings were steered away from, but he moved into the rain and stared to the sky, watched as white strokes carved their way across a palette of gray.  He thought he had never seen anything so bright.

6zw0em,2,2017-09-13,I think I'm finally seeing past my Nmom's bullshit. I think she tried to blame me for her say no to helping a friend who desperately needed it.,kassiebby1124,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6zw0em/i_think_im_finally_seeing_past_my_nmoms_bullshit/,"Am I crazy or is she trying to turn this on me? I'm sorry this long (and posting on here so much). I tried to make the scenario as unbiased as possible:

My best friend got his car towed yesterday and since he lost his job, that's where he's been sleeping. He has never asked me for help. Not once. He deliberately goes out of his way NOT to ask for help, especially from me. He's one of those people who will deal with whatever comes until it gets to the breaking point, actually breaks, and then will continue to try and mend the pieces on his own. 

Last night was the first and probably last time he ever asked me for anything but asked me to ask my mom if he could crash on the couch. She said no. I'm clearly a bit put off about it. I understand why, she doesn't know the guy and stuff. Ultimately it's her decision to let someone into her home. But she told ME not to feel bad and I did the ""right thing"" by asking. And I need to stop internalizing people's problems. I told her that she made the decision not me. It wasn't my decision to make. She said I need to stop trying to ""save"" people. Cool I get it, I find myself unintentionally helping people who are good friends often. They gravitate to me and I don't mind helping someone. I love to help if I can. But when I told her she was the one who said no she literally shut down and legitimately SHUT UP. Bitch was stunned to the point of silence. As if she realized she fucked up. Did she realize it? I don't know because she changed the subject immediately and didn't even acknowledge the decision SHE made. And said it was my fault for being miffed about her saying no. I don't know if I'm right but I felt she tried to turn the outcome of this onto me and make it my fault for being hurt that she wouldn't help. 

After she said no, she literally avoided the topic. She jumped from 4 or 5 different topics in the course of 5 minutes, padded with awkward silence and her smiling at me. ""So have your talked to your bf? Tell him I said hi"" ""So what are you doing at your internship?"" ""Are you hot? Isn't it hot in here?"" She gets up to turn down the AC even though I said no. I'm grumpily texting my friend about the situation. Then she said it's my fault that things turned out how they did (I.e. Her saying he can't stay here) and me being upset about it is stupid. She had the worst attitude when I gave her short replies for her trying to make light conversation. ""Are you going to have this attitude for the rest of night because you need to get over it."" 

If I've had years of friendship with someone and they asked for my help as an ultimate last resort I'd say yes. Especially if it was for less than 24 hours. She was so willing to open the door to my older sister's friend who was in this situation from high school whom she's never met until the night of. So I figured this situation would be acceptable since it's the same concept. If my GC sister's old friends asked for help, ""yes yes yes I love so and so!"" But she never met them a day in her life. When my friend asked me for help, it's an issue he ""has to figure out on his own"" and no one seems to want to look past themselves in this situation. I could be included in that too (not looking past myself) but I'm trying to do something about it instead of changing the topic and screaming because I'm disappointed in the response. 

She shouldn't have asked me for the details of the situation if she had her mind made up in the first place because she asked my why he needed a place to crash and why his other options weren't available. She damn sure shouldn't blame me for her decision to say no. And it's fucked up that I'm the one who is get chastised for wanting to help someone who desperately needs it. 

I get her reasoning (random 20 something guy she's never met before and doesn't know their motives but I've been close with since 2013) but when she's done this in the past with someone else it's not right in my mind. 

Then she had the audacity to call me this morning saying she's sorry about his situation, asking if he can rent a bedroom even though I told her he literally just got hired and hasn't gotten paid yet. She was the one who told me you can't rent any place without first and last months rent so why would that change for someone else? Also she will ""pray for him to find his way."" I have nothing again religion; I was raised Christian but it's not my thing. I'm just annoyed because she's putting her faith into something that she could have used her ""purpose to help"" (she says that's why she's here in the world. She's selfless and loves to help. This has also been ""confirmed"" by a fortune cookie she keeps in her wallet because it was a sign. But it's bad that I feel the desire to actually help? Okay.) someone who needs it. 

The worst part? My best friend is leaving. We just reunited a couple of months ago when I forced to move back under my mom and dad's request (long story short she didn't want to pay for my campus apartment and she's the owner of the car I drove so she threatened to report the car stolen if I didn't come back with them) and he's moving away again because literally everyone is kicking him while he's down. I don't know where but probably back to Mew Jersey. So I just lost a good friend because anyone who we've reached out to is too selfish to help. It tears me apart. "

(abusive),toor00t,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6zw0ww/should_i20m_break_up_with_her18f_abusive/,"I will try to keep this short. I'm currently in a long distance relationship (for one year now) and thought she really was the one. However, for more than 8 months out of the 1 year we've been together up until now, it only gets worse.
I had to cut all of my friends off because it ""hurt her"" that I talked to them. She's threatening me with suicide as soon as I disagree with something she says. She's constantly, and by constantly I really mean constantly angry at me. Literally every single day, then says that I'm ""wasting her time"", she ""doesn't look forward to being with me anymore"" and ""deserves someone better"", but apologizes for it an hour later, and I always loved her too much to not accept her apology. When I have to work, she gets really, really angry and wants me to quit everything I'm doing. When I don't talk with her 15 hours a day, she's threatening to leave. For the last 4 months, I've only slept 3 hours per night because of this (I'm in Europe, she's in the USA). When she gets randomly upset (and I really mean randomly), like because someone got hit in a TV show and she tells me about it, she yells at me via phone call because I ""lack empathy"". Almost every weekend, she says when we're together, she wants my children as soon as possible and then kill me (but always says it's a joke). I tell her that I love her body (she's a bit chubby), but whenever I say that, she accuses me of being a dishonest asshole because my ex girlfriends all have been skinny. When she shows me an article that she has no proper knowledge of, to which I respond with ""well baby, I wouldn't judge something that I haven't done my personal research on just because someone else says ""look here, it's like this"" or ""look here, it's like that"""", she says I'm an egoistic jerk that boasts with his intelligence and does nothing else (I've been having the title of a child prodigy when I was younger, but never had the chance to get an internship because of the area I live in and a very poor family that I had to be there for which is why I had to work for everything myself). Now, what should I do...? I'm really unsure about it, I know it may be the best option to break up with her, but it seems to have many consequences as she's threatening me with suicide, says she'll send my family nudes of myself, or create diverse social media accounts with manipulated screenshots to show how ""bad I was towards her"" (I sometimes haven't gotten any sleep in 3 days because I had to make sure she understands that the spider on her wall won't kill her).


About her; (turned) 18, has nothing to do but go to school and watch TV all day. She's sexually innocent and used to treat me perfectly until we actually got together (she had a crush on me since she was 14), which is why I fell in love with her a while ago. I thought to myself ""oh wow, finally someone who shows patience and isn't too basic"". Although now I realize it would have been too good to be true. She was meant to live together with me in a few months. I promised she would never have to do anything and we could go to visit all the countries she wants to visit (I'll explain why that would be possible later on in this text) since I just want to protect her, but now it seems like that's a bad idea.


About me: 20, came from a rather harsh background (European ghetto). Now successful software developer and ecommerce expert, my product is consistently improving on the market (had to do it all by myself since there was no money to hire anyone last year) and I'll be able to retire by May 2018 plus buy my sick parents a house because of the money it's been making. I have also always been good with the ladies, yet had to cut off contact with ALL of them because of her. Seems like I'm utterly incompetent when it comes to relationships, or just tend to go for the most questionable choices.
Should I give her another chance or grow some balls and break up with her as soon as I can? I know this situation sounds laughable to many of you, but I've been through a lot of shit so naturally I'm afraid of losing people who have been close to me. It seems absurd, but since I don't have the time to find someone in real life to ask this, or want to burden my family with it, I feel like most of you on this subreddit have enough experience to help me make this decision. I normally don't rely on other people or want to take away their time, but I hope some of you will stop by and read this.


TLDR; Abusive girlfriend, threatens with suicide. Relationship is getting worse and worse but I love her too much for what she once was. Should I break up?"
6zw4cx,55,2017-09-13,I managed to escape the abuse of my ex's horrible family and I ran back to my country to save my life,123truthhurts370,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6zw4cx/i_managed_to_escape_the_abuse_of_my_exs_horrible/,"I'm not a native English speaker so please forgive me but I need to confess this. 

He was 3 years younger than me. I was 21, he was 18

He was from another religion than me but i didn't care. I really loved him. He loved me too. 

We were together for 1 year until he took me to meet his parents. 
I lived in another country because I was studying. So i was alone, i only had him. 

He was perfect when he was with me but as soon as i met his parents i saw he was so different when they were around. 

His father was a bit restrictive and he wanted to respect traditions from his religion etc.  But I have a feeling he was a pervert too and that has nothing to do with religion itself in my opinion. 

We had a dinner the night I met his parents. Considering i was older, they asked me dirrectly if i am a virgin.. i was petrified.. of course I was not a virgin, I even had sex with M (his name). 

But I couldn't respond because M answered before me "" of course she is, i wouldn't have been with her otherwise' 

I was shocked again but I didn't say anything. I heard before about no sex before mariage and M knew I wasn't a virgin so i was ok. He wanted to please his parents, that's what I thought. 

I was living in a dorm in that country so after the meeting with his parents, they invited me to stay at their house with M, at least 'for a while'. 

Because of the expenses I had, I accepted telling myself it will be just for a while, a few months. 

They treated me like M's wife somehow. I felt weird but I thought they want to be friendly idk...

His mother seemed nice and understanding at first but soon she approached me trying to find out private things about me (i mean sexual things) and also she tried to teach me how their religion works because 'i will convert when i will get married' she said. Lol. 

Once she approached me asking me if I am fertile and can have kids because M wants kids and they want a big family. She asked me if I ever got intimate with her son, not necessarily penetration. And she asked me a lot of fucked up questions. 

I tried to avoid them nicely and I went to M and told him. 

He said that his parents are overprotective etcetc and to ignore and excuse them. But he didn't stand up for me when they were in the same room. 

We went for a walk during a summer day near the sea and drank some juice at a place there. There were other family members too (of his). I was mostly sitting with his family. With His mom actually since M went to hang out with men and women had to stay and discuss separately. 

Her mom started the indiscret chat again. She 'tried to teach me' that I have to offer oral sex to M often and to please him because 'it is my duty'. I just ... hoped the day to be over soon


When we got back i told M i want to move out to his house. I explained why but he said it's not possible. That it's a shame and if I do it his parents will shame both of us and he can't do it and we will have to break up. He was so led by his parents but i felt abused already. I wanted out. 

That night when i tried to make the bed, his mom saw me and asked me why i am crying. (I couldn't handle that shit anymore). I told her I just miss home etc (being away from my country, it was a perfect excuse - even though it was real too, but that was not that reason I was crying). 

Once again she started with a shitty motivational speech how a woman must be strong for her man etc. 
Then M's father and M entered in the room too. His mom told them I am sad because M neglects my sex needs and maybe it was 'the time' - WHAT THE FUCK - i told them it's not true lol. I looked at M hoping he may say something but he was dead silent. 

His father said something like 'if they want and if she is a virgin, they can start to have sex now but only if they marry soon' but i had to prove I was not a virgin to his parents (basically his mom had to check the sheets for blood after 'we were done' ) - how fucked up and embarassing. I had to prove my ""purity"" and my loyality to M and his family. 

It was already too much for me.  I yelled i want to go home and i ran out of the room in tears. 

Shortly after, M followed me apologizing for his strict parents. He told me if i do what they want, they will leave us alone. 
But he knew i was not a virgin so how could we fake this?

He told me to wait until my period and then have sex while on period. ..

In around a week, my period came and M went to his father to tell him 'we are ready'. 
He set up a nice room (they were really rich) with very white sheets. It was so fucking embarassing thay everyone in the house knew i was gonna fuck..

Anyway i believed M that his parents will leave us alone after that. 

I couldn't gather myself to have sex. I felt disgusted by M and me. I just undressed, opened up my legs and told him to get away with that shit. I felt so used..so horrible...

After it was done, the sheets were dirty too so i went to bathroom to clean myself and to stick an intern tampon inside of me to hide my period... 

Everyone seemed pleased. They called me 'one of them' and I was so congratulated for being defloured by M. Als M got congratulated for 'becoming a real man'. .. what the fuck..

However I told them I would like to move back to my dorm. They didn't even want to hear about it ... they said i had to stick with them now. His mother tried to teach me their traditions and how to dress according to their beliefs etc... 

I called my parents that didn't know I live with M. They thought i was at dorm this entire time. 
I told them I want to go home!! I told them everything. 

They got scared!! But my father knew it's complicated to 'start a family war' to get me out of there. So he made up a plan. A very smart one. 

I wasn't M's wife so I kept my religion and my views (i still do). 
My parents told me a really close relative is very sick and I had to go back to the country to see her because it may be the last time. 
I told M and he believed me - I had to lie him too. 

M told his parents and they believed him but they didn't let me leave alone. They told me M had to go with me. They demanded it!!! 

I accepted anything to get out of that hell. 

I packed my stuff and prepared for the flight. 

When I got home with M, he found out the truth. He said it is unacceptable that I lied and made horrific threaths towards me. He told me he will expose me to his parents that i wasn't a virgin. He called me a whore and the man i fell in love was suddently gone. He transformed into a controlling asshole. 

I told him we are over and he gladly accepted this. He made life threaths towards me that he will find me when i go back to the country of study and it will 'not be good for me'. My parents kicked him out so he flew back. The next few days i received threaths on my phone so i blocked his number. Then fb threaths came in. 

I removed my social media. I changed my phone number and I also interupted my studies. I was too afraid to go back to that country for a while, so i remained home with my parents whom i am really thankful for their support and understanding. I love them so much and without them I would have been abused and in an unhappy marriage for the rest of my life. 

Thank you for reading to my confession. "

I am currently a freshman college student, most likely pursuing a degree in Marketing, PR, or something similar. 

I know this is a long ways from now but for a long time ive wanted to be involved in the industry, specifically I have wanted to be a talent agent, casting director, music supervisor, location manager, etc (something that generally requires business acumen but helps the creative process). Unlike many other people in this sub I don't have a desire to be a director, cinematographer, etc. 

I was wondering if any of you had advice on how to succeed in this portion of the industry, in which individuals act as a liaison between the creative and business aspects (whether thats what major to get, where to intern if I dont live in LA, classes to take, etc.)

I was recently rejected for the NBA Hackathon and I was extremely surprised / disheartened when it occurred. I've yet to land an internship for CS (currently a Junior) and my clock is ticking to land something this summer. 

I put a lot of effort into the application questions and I would appreciate any feedback. First was a simple program testing the probability a basketball team wouldn't lose consecutive games if their win% was .800. View here: https://repl.it/JDMq/24

Secondly was the big project - read every NBA game from last season in and simulate a season, determining the date on which each team was eliminated from playoff contention.

6zx9cr,3,2017-09-13,"New to reddit, really hope I can finally kick this addiction.",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6zx9cr/new_to_reddit_really_hope_i_can_finally_kick_this/,"Hello everyone.

I've just made a reddit account with the only purpose to finally stop this addiction that has plagued my life for the last 8 years. This is going to be quite the story and introduction, so strap in your seats. I'm sure some if not most of you can relate to this stuff and have seen these types of posts thousands of times, but I honestly just want to get everything off my chest.

Alright, a little about me. I'm a 21 year old chemistry student who lives on his own and I'm currently working a full-time internship. I've got a decent social life and I have a girlfriend who I love dearly. We've been together 4,5 years and only a month ago have I told her about my addiction and how deep it impacts me. But we'll get to that later. Overall I'm a pretty relaxed guy, enjoys simple things like cooking, squash, socializing and watching movies/ reading books. And porn.

The first time I came into contact with porn was when I was around 11-12 years old. A guy from school told me to go to one of the websites, and wouldn't you have it, I was instantly hooked. At that time I didn't really know anything about sex or porn, so it was all really exciting stuff (like it should be right?). So pretty much when porn came into my life, fapping soon followed. At first it wasn't anything unhealthy, I'd do it every so often and most of the time I wouldn't even watch porn with it. This went on for about a year or two before things really started getting out of hand.

At the time where I was around 14 years old the exciting feeling about porn completely dissapeared. It was all about instant gratification and it became a daily habit. This is still the current state of affairs unfortunately. My entire mindset about sex and sensuality got twisted to what I still feel like beyond repair. I've grown a fetish (don't really want to get into what, it's not anything extreme or big deal, but just can't be arsed), that's still with me today. I'd only watch porn videos of that certain catagory and nothing else would satisfy. It still doesn't. 

At 15 years old I lost my virginity. Sex itself was still really exciting to me, plus being a teenager pretty much means only thinking about sex (at least for me). In all honesty, it was good. Although way too soon in my opinion and with terrible girl at that, it was good. I enjoyed my pretty self. Ended up sleeping twice with that girl before everything ended. Still though, after and before all that porn was still watched paired with fapping on the daily. 

At 16 years old, two huge things happened in my life. Firstly, my father passed away. Don't care to get into how what or why, but it happened. Tough times. Used porn and fapping as a coping mechanism of sorts, ended up 'using' at least twice a day. The second thing is that I met my current girlfriend. She was a virgin at the time, so sexuality and sensuality were two entirely new concepts in her life. There was still alot of excitement around sex so there were no problems yet until my fetish began to creep up on me. 

Fast forward a couple of years where I'd still be watching and fapping daily, to the point where I couldn't even masturbate without watching porn anymore. I fell down a deeper and darker hole. Started to get more picky about my porn, satisfaction would become less and less, and I'd get more angry and depressed personally. Eventually me and my girlfriend got to a point where sex wasn't as exciting anymore (completely normal). But this is when things started to get south. Slowly but surely I'd get less interested in actual sex and more into watching porn. What made things worse is that my girlfriend actually somewhat shared this fetish I build up from porn, and we started carrying it out. We still do sometimes. 

This is when the mindgames started. I only could think about peforming my own sexual desires when sleeping with my girlfriend, there was little to no intimacy and each and every time I could only help but to think about my fetish and how good it was. This got to a point where I became really frustrated and acting irrationally and unfair towards my girlfriend, which I'm ashamed of to this day.

Eventually I started to realise that porn was a problem. It was time to stop. But oh boy, did I not realise that that was no easy feat. By far. Suddenly trying to destroy a day to day habit that you've grown used to for such a long time was no easy thing to kick. But I tried. No success. Always ended up fapping on the daily again. Decided to tell my girlfriend after 4,5 years of dating. She's incredibly supportive but I don't think she understands the enormous impact it had and still has on my life. I became motivated to quit, but still seem to lack something to see it through. Don't know if it's willpower, laziness or that I secretly don't want to. My girlfriend adviced me to go to the doctor, but I'm too ashamed and scared to. In any case, this addiction is ruining my intimacy, my mood and my general view on sexuality and sensuality. I'm at the end of my rope, it's depressing me, upsetting me and just generally fucking with everyting about me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm actually typing this 5 minutes after having a wank. If you guys can help me with tips, stories or whatever else I'm all ears. I respect each and everyone of you who are/were able to kick this underrated and underestimated addiction or those who are trying. If you've read my story thank you, I honestly do appreciate it. I kinda feel like this story is all over the place and the sentencing structure is very poor, so I'm down to answer any questions you guys might have and apologies for making 0 sense. But most importantly, I'd like you guys to help me. I want to say I'll do everything I can to kick this, but I honestly don't know if I am capable. Thank you for reading, I love you guys."

I should be about 6 weeks pregnant now and my spotting has stopped. Yay! My husband was informed last Friday that he is being hired on full time at his job after being an intern for 2 years. Super yay! Once he gets his salary negotiated, we're going straight to mortgage and house hunting. We've been living with his dad since 2013 and we want to be our own family very badly. 

My pregnancy confirmation appointment is next week and I'm allowing myself to get excited. My body is very unhappy with me, though. My kidneys are pissed (I had bad kidney stones while I was pregnant with my son) and I am definitely not sleeping. I tried liquid Unisom but it does absolutely nothing. I was able to sleep a few nights ago after taking Phenergan for nausea. That was nice. Now I just need to get my kidneys and bladder to behave and I'll be good. 

I wasn't going to let myself be excited but I gave in. Here's hoping everything goes well. I need a turn of good luck. My whole family does. 

Edit because I forgot to mention my amazing husband is bringing me home more chocolate than I can handle and I am so thankful. Lol. Our anniversary is tomorrow ;)"
6zyirf,8,2017-09-13,High School Student offered a non-paying position on a mainstage production at a local theatre,The_Derpologist,techtheatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/techtheatre/comments/6zyirf/high_school_student_offered_a_nonpaying_position/,"Hello, all

I am a Junior in High School with extensive sound and stagecraft knowledge. This summer, I was contacted by a local theatre which wants me to come and run sound for one of their 6 shows coming up in this season. The show will run for around 4 weeks, with shows all nights of the week minus two for break. 


The schedule for when we tech the show is pretty crazy as well, with two back to back 10/12 days before we open. I know this would be a huge experience for me and a great thing to put on my resume. They have also discussed hiring me full or part time in the future season and possibly later in this year, once they receive more intern funding. 

I am concerned that I am giving away my time, though. I do like the work that I do, and I firmly believe that it will benefit me in the future, but I don't want to be taken advantage of. You wouldn't think it, but my schedule is pretty crazy. Between school, work (I have another job that is some weekends late at night, but does not interfere with the show), social life, and all the other projects I have signed onto, my time is short. 


I know I can allocate time to do the show and do a good job, I'm not worried about that. I am wondering if y'all here on this sub think that I should refuse to work without pay. 

Thanks!"
6zyquj,3,2017-09-13,"Yeah, this place changed my life.",AsymmetricArmMan,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6zyquj/yeah_this_place_changed_my_life/,"If you’re a frequent member of this community, you’ll know that the vast majority of us have seen significant changes in our lives due to the seemingly straightforward concept of resisting masturbation.

I have a story to tell, rooted in abstaining from self-pleasure, and I know this community is most likely to understand (details changed a tiny bit for anonymity).

In November 2016, I had a really, really bad experience at a house party. It was soon after the start of my sophomore year at my first choice college doing something I’ve always wanted to do. On paper, my life was going quite well. I was getting alright grades in a subject I loved, I was eating mostly healthy food, I was exercising, I was going out to my favourite gigs and had some guys to hang out with on weekends.

However, something was missing at the time of this house party. Sure, everyone sometimes feels that way, but I had **ALWAYS** felt that way, basically ever since I was old enough to look at a pretty girl and have a tingly feeling inside. In fact, in November 2016 the missing piece had grown to chasm in my mind so big that something *had* to give. The missing piece was contact. Specifically, contact with the opposite sex. 

A big reason why I’d been able to get into the right place academically was because, somewhat unconsciously at the time, I avoided contact and closeness at every opportunity and therefore focused most of my energy on non-human things like math and science. It started with being shy during puberty, and quickly the drive to push through the shyness was dampened by PMO. Growing older still, the stigma surrounding my lack of experiencing real intimate human contact, alongside a (dubious) diagnosis of a mild form of autism, began to create new mental barriers and self-justifications. Turning 20 years old in the summer of 2016, I had done no more than awkwardly and quickly kissed a couple of girls on drunken nights out, and I was more or less living my life as an actor portraying a well-rounded human being. Online research, movies, books, YouTube, and real-life observation had taught me how to fake being a normal sexual human male, and I was convinced that I could just *fake it till I make it*. Problem was, I had been faking it since I was a kid, and due to so little REAL drive (PMO's fault) to take the next step, I felt like an alien trapped in a man’s body with no survivable means of escape.

So, it’s November 2016 and I’m driving alone upstate for the house party. It was held to celebrate somebody’s younger brother beating cancer, and brought in a bunch of my high school buddies alongside their friends from the nearby college. It was set to be a huge gathering, and I spent the long drive there thinking how best to use the occasion to break my façade and become a real man. The ""JUST DO IT"" Shia LaBeouf video popped into my head, alongside random quotes by various famously great men, and I eventually played a bunch of my favourite Eminem songs and sung for the final hour of the drive at the top of my lungs. Shortly before arriving at the venue, I remembered one of the issues when attempting to get close to girls was that I’d often get an erection and would then feel embarrassed, so I took a detour through a quieter forest road and stopped for a quick jerk sesh.

With my mind seemingly cleared and some great quotes looping through my head, I arrived at the house party with high expectations. Initial conversations were easy, since it was just catching up with my guy friends and describing my summer and lecture content at college. But when new faces started arriving, especially the sorority girls, my conversation skills began to nosedive. Eventually, I was left chatting with probably the only guy who jerked off more than me while everyone else was busy dancing with the girls and generally making the most of a house party. One girl in particular suddenly caught my attention. She was in my eyes the most beautiful girl there; tall, slim and with shimmering brown hair.

Feeling the sharp spear of Future Me in my gut telling me now is the time to act encouraged some shuffling towards the larger group of people, downing a couple more shots of vodka, and some attempts at conversation with a girl waiting in the corner. My stunted speech, lack of eye contact and obvious discomfort meant she quickly found an excuse to walk away, leaving me with hot embarrassment flooding my thoughts. I went for a walk alone outside, pacing the gardens away from people and muttering more motivational phrases. Out of the dark, a voice called in my general direction, and I turned to see a long-haired dude with a Beatles hoodie on smoking a joint and sitting by the steps at the back of the house. He said I looked like a schizophrenic talking to my demons, and I laughed and said I had just bombed out with a chick and needed to clear my head. We sat and chatted for a bit, and in my slightly drunken state I let slip some details about my aversion to intimate contact with girls. The guy began to seem genuinely interested, and tried to offer advice about just ""going for it"" and ""not thinking about it"". Immediately I mentioned how my current state of mind *just isn't* able to work like that, and to that this long-haired dude responded by reaching into his pocket and bringing out a small bag of bluish-brown pills. ""This will give you a new perspective, man"", he said. Even in my clouded state I knew they were speed or ecstasy, and I’d never tried anything more than weed up till that point. Feeling at the end of my rope, I decided to ""JUST DO IT"" and I bought a couple of them and listened to his instructions on its effects and what to do.

After popping the first one and chatting with the guy about love, life and the universe for a few more minutes I thought I’d go back into the house so I could be ready to dance and talk and be a new man when whatever was in the pill kicked in. **Oh, how wrong I was.**

For the previous decade I’d been hiding my insecurities surrounding intimate contact with lies, heavy research on the subject and frequent, almost daily masturbation to pornography. So, of course I was setting myself up for disaster when I decided to ingest strong psychoactive chemicals and put myself in a highly challenging social situation.

It started to kick in during another stunted and awkward conversation with a really drunk sorority girl. I began to feel energetic, and so my forced speech simply increased in tempo, and became even less coherent as my attention span dropped to near-zero. Instead of feeling euphoric, paranoia set in at the prospect of being judged for dropping ecstasy in a house where people just wanted to get drunk and get laid (“pill dick” is a thing). I began wandering aimlessly through the house, trying to avoid people’s gaze while at the same time craving a heart-to-heart conversation with the prettiest girl there. After a few minutes of trying not to have a panic attack, I saw the tall brown-haired girl from earlier, and my totally fuzzed mind sent my legs walking in her direction. Stopping right in front of her, I looked up and tried to smile. She took one look at me and let out a gasp, followed by rapid comments about why my pupils were huge and what the hell I’d taken and whether I was dying. Realising I was pulling a crazy face and staring at her, clenching my jaw and with bulging eyes, I attempted to relax my muscles and say something. My memory of what followed was pretty hazy, but basically she freaked out and told me to go away, and a couple of my high school buddies brought me outside and sat with me for the next few hours until everyone had either left the party or gone to sleep.

The next morning was the start of the biggest wake-up call of my life. My brain completely drained of dopamine and serotonin, I was reduced to a shadow in the corner, barely able to help clean up garbage. I hardly said a word to anyone, no more than a few apologies for ruining the night's vibe a little. After a slow brunch on leftover pizza, I started the long lonesome drive back to my college and had a very tough, raw, brutal think about my failures in life.

The next couple of weeks were quite possibly the worst of my entire life. Every day I’d open my eyes and mutter to myself about how much of a waste my life is. I’d slap myself in the face when looking in the mirror. Trying to watch a funny cartoon would sometimes put me in tears. My favourite songs now sounded forced and cheap. And of course, I’d be jackin it every day to try and numb the sadness.

Then, at just about the time the drugs ""comedown"" was supposed to start receding, I had just enough mental energy to browse through a long reddit comment thread and come across a brief mention of nofap. At around the same time, I found a really great book on the subject and also other aspects of intimacy anxiety. At first, the nofap community seemed like a bit of a cult, with guys refraining from what I’d been told was harmless all my life. However, after reading a bunch of chapters of the book I'd found, especially one section that talked for a while about the harms to a man’s character and overall wellbeing of masturbation, especially with porn, and made me reconsider the importance of nofap. Diving back into the nofap community with a newfound curiosity, I began carefully reading through the top posts, and then through the new posts, and then doing some research elsewhere on the internet. 

On my first try of quitting PMO cold-turkey, I lasted a couple of days. After that, a week. For the following month, I got better and better at understanding my sexuality and finding productive ways of using the frustration. Of course, when I started lasting more than a few days I began to feel something inside me change. It really was just like that film Limitless, when he first tries NZT and describes the effect, ""I wasn’t high, I wasn’t wired. Just CLEAR. I knew what I needed to do and how to do it."" Of course, a pill that gives you a 4-digit IQ doesn’t exist yet (and I hope it never will for the sake of ethics), but I believe essence of nofap is better. It’s a change in mindset, a change in lifestyle, a change in how we treat pleasure and how we seek it. Thinking back to when I used to find it strange why so many religions encouraged abstinence from various indulgences, I began to understand its importance, and realise why this western world has become so addicted to pleasure. Fast food, rapid-fire internet entertainment, society telling you that you’re a better person because you purchased that product, and of course self-pleasure in the form of masturbation; it all creates a society that consumes and consumes so that a select few may realise their true dreams by exploiting the simple needs of the masses. It’s a pretty standard existential problem that everyone complains about once in a while, but with my unleashed *superpowers* I felt as though there existed a route to freedom.

Countless posts on nofap have talked about the Dopamine Challenge. For the unfamiliar, it’s basically a lifestyle change that means you avoid activities that give you a quick, cheap hit of dopamine (like pornography, masturbation, junk food, and high-frequency internet entertainment).
For me, the Dopamine Challenges was something I started about a month after discovering nofap. I used reddit, YouTube and Netflix only after 7pm and for no more than a couple of hours, and did my best to stick to wholesome content. During the day, I’d make an effort to put more time into my studies, exercise, reading, meditation and sometimes I would even stare at the ceiling thinking about my life.

Guys, after really getting into the habit of refraining from masturbation and other artificial pleasures, my life just got better and better. I’d wake up in the early morning for a jog and smile at the rising sun like a telly tubby. My simple breakfast of porridge and banana tasted *incredible*, the morning shower (hot or cold, depending on my urges) felt like liquid sleep. Walking to lectures, I would hold eye contact with random interesting people I passed for a split second longer than I used to. Social situations became much easier, and if I found myself chatting with an attractive girl I could maintain eye contact while listening with genuine interest in what she was saying. My thoughts were coherent, my words well-timed and effortless. Almost never again did I become the wallflower in a group conversation. My sexual desires didn’t disappear; they just didn’t stir up my thoughts anymore. I now felt more *in control* of my sexuality.

My grades improved, both my course and personal projects improved in innovation and quality, and I joined a couple of sports teams and societies. I put effort into applying for countless internships for the following summer. I went to my first interview for an incredible company and unfortunately didn’t get through, but it didn’t deter me from pushing harder to find something even better. My next interview was for a big-city tech startup, and because I had spent the previous 6 months (mostly) keeping to my Dopamine Challenge lifestyle, I had a tonne of recent projects, skills, general knowledge and all-round conversational skills to present myself to them fully. About a week afterwards, they called and said they wanted me to join them for the summer.

However, I must mention that there were plenty of hiccups along the way. My contact anxiety has continued to persist throughout my nofap journey, although a big reason that might be my improved social skills attracting more beautiful women, who are intimidating to even confident men. In these situations, I’d still be able to have a long, passionate conversations and soon she’d be shuffling closer to me and putting out all the usual signs of being seduced, which even with my superpowers would tip me in the direction of a minor panic attack and result in an awkward excuse to leave. After such failures, the combination of being a bit drunk and feeling terrible about myself would end in a relapse when I got back to my room.

So yes, my nofap journey has yet to come to its climax. As of today, I’ve been fully keeping with the Dopamine Challenge for about 3 weeks, and my superpowers are stronger than ever.
Last weekend was probably my greatest social success yet. My internship had just finished, and some last-day conversations with colleagues had resulted in me being invited to a night out in the really swanky part of town. An unfortunate sequence of events that night meant several of the people coming had to drop out at the last minute. That little detail resulted in the seemingly terrible situation of me walking into the bar alone and finding the only person from the company there was the impossibly attractive secretary and her date, who was an immaculately-dressed Mediterranean man with a magnificent beard, tattoos and huge muscles.

Immediately, the phrase ""third wheel"" whizzed around inside my head. I didn’t stand a chance of not bombing out in this social situation. But that’s the thing about life. *Sometimes life ain’t fair*. And that night, life wasn’t fair to the wealthy Mediterranean man. I believe what followed was the direct effect of nearly a year of highly disciplined lifestyle training and self-improvement.
I hadn’t eaten junk food in months, so my skin was clear and my eyes shone. I’d been either running or working out in the gym almost every morning for months, so my body was lean and precise. I’d read books and studied hard and invented things for months, so my mind was sharp and bursting with knowledge, passions and stories. Abstaining from cheap pleasures like PMO had given me the drive to do something *real* every day. Compared to my former self, I was superhuman, and I felt it every second I spent talking to the attractive work colleague and her formidable male friend. My friends weren’t going to come and rescue me. I had to either sit there and earn my place or leave as a coward. One minute turned into five. Five minutes into thirty. After an hour, the masculine Mediterranean was starting to look visibly flustered, while the girl couldn’t stop smiling at me. Here I was, a poor student with old, crumpled clothes and no beard playing and beating a greater man at his own game.

Soon, the man suggested to my attractive colleague that they should get going because a party was starting in another part of the city. She invited me to come with, silencing the uncomfortable grumbles of her male friend.

This next club was unlike anything I had seen before. Everyone was a somebody or dating a somebody, with fast cars parked outside and doormen in little hats efficiently making sure only the most eligible were allowed to enter. Again, I knew in the back of my mind I didn’t fit in here. If I bought one drink I’d have to cut my rice rations in half for the next month. I’d borrowed the collared shirt I was wearing from my uncle, and it was probably old enough to vote. I’d trimmed my facial hair with a mostly blunt trimmer.

But, I did have one simple trick up my sleeve. I’m sure a lot of the successful people in the club occasionally followed lifestyles similar to the Dopamine Challenge, and now suddenly I was one of them. Just near the entrance was a small group of people smoking or waiting to get in, and during my animated conversation with both my colleague and her friend, the people in front were interested to talk to us. Since I was now at the centre of this larger group and making most of the noise, when the doormen approved one of the rich men out front they also let through the rest of us, wrongly assuming we were all distinguished guests.

Inside was as impressive as expected, with a few people buying drinks for everyone around them. I spent the next few hours chatting with everyone, enjoying the music, dancing without worrying about how I looked and eventually getting a bunch of attention from my attractive colleague. Still, as she became a bit more handsy my anxiety eventually took hold, and at about 4am I had to make a rather cowardly exit. Yeah. But considering I'd only relapsed a couple of weeks earlier, it was still an incredible result.

So, my story isn’t yet a complete success. But still, after less than a year of living with nofap, my life has gone from 9% to 90%. My life has changed forever. I hope that with just more time and trying harder every day to achieve things, and of course practicing abstinence from cheap pleasures, I will fully reset and become a fully-fledged real man. I implore anyone still reading this to use this as yet another example that stuff works.

**TL;DR: Life was alright, but something was missing. Went to a house party, tried drugs for the first time and realised how shit my way of life was. After a couple weeks of hell, I discovered nofap and in a year my life when from zero to 100.**

6zyrwi,1,2017-09-13,Starting out in industry instead of public for IT audit?,thoraway5100,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6zyrwi/starting_out_in_industry_instead_of_public_for_it/,"Had an interview that went well for an industry internship for IT audit at a large healthcare company. Originally I only applied for it because why not apply for as many opportunities as I can? But after researching the company a bit and giving it some thought and then finally interviewing, I realized this seems like a viable option. Some searches show that the average starting salary for this position in similar companies is around 70k/yr which doesn't seem to bad, and they promise that there are plenty of opportunities to advance. 

Background: currently a senior, going to pursue a MACC with a systems focus the year after I graduate.

I guess the question is: Would my options still be very limited if I decided to start out here (industry) if the internship goes well rather than starting out in public, or should I still try to get a public internship/ eventual FT offer?"

I'm going out of my mind trying to figure everything out. My work experience has never been quite like this. I never really knew what an internship was like. This is my first one. I went through the first week learning about the company and assisting with some help, but not a whole lot. One day I was actually so upset that I thought of changing internships because there wasn't any work. In all my work experiences I've been commanded what to do, how to do it, and etc. This job is not really like that. I am expected to ask but I never really knew that. Each time I felt like I wanted to, I worried that everyone else was too busy, and that I'd be annoying. Today one of the workers mumbled something to one of my other coworkers and I only realized they were talking to me because I heard my name. I asked what, because I had heard my name, and she explained to me that the other chick said ""I miss the old intern"" and she repeated what she said, which was ""but Ani is pretty good."" I am pretty sure she had agreed because I noticed that gesture (although not paying attention to what it's about). I brushed it off, but later started to think about it. I initiated a conversation with the person who said they miss the old interns, hopefully to smooth it all over. She told me to just initiate more. I said if there's anything I can help her with I definitely will. I think it went well. 

But later, I started eating some almonds (I don't have a whole lot, like literally less than 1/4 of a ziploc bag). The person who said I was ""pretty good"" gave me a death stare. I was confused because I thought she was looking behind me at first, and I stared at her waiting for her to say something. I noticed very obviously I offended her and put her in a bad mood. I'm pretty sure she wanted me to offer her some while she was staring at me, even though I didn't have all that many as it is. I actually did later, but she rejected it. She asked me if I wanted chocolate covered almonds, I said no thank you. She said something on the lines of ""of course, ms. I'm afraid to ask for anything"". I feel bad, she had brought in candy last week and offered it to everyone, although I didn't have any.. She kept telling one of the male coworkers and another coworker in the office that she wanted to go to lunch. I'm 99% sure they talked about me there. I don't know what to do. I think I will just go in to work tomorrow and ignore it. Pretend it didn't happen. Did I really do something _that_ wrong though? I can hardly think, I just don't know anymore. I have such bad social anxiety as it is, people wonder why..........

This is an internship that I like. I was hoping I'd be offered a job by the end of it, but I think I blew my chances for that already. The co workers are really nice to me, the company is really great. I just don't fucking know lol. I feel like I won't fit in anywhere. How can I? I get scared way too often."
6zz7zu,290,2017-09-13,How Reddit Was Destroyed (ver 4.0),Hearthstone4LyfeBro,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6zz7zu/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver_40/,"1) The first thing they did was take away r/reddit.com.

This took away the only tool for communicating with reddit about reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/reddit. Taking that away was the first step.

2) The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.

I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious campaign to filter him out of the election.

3) Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.
I remember when r/IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be ""approved"". 
Someone named Victoria is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.

There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. Check out this post which was pushed into r/undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/technology.

4) The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.

All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/HailCorporate. ""Feel good"" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions ""Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?"" From brand new accounts that never posted again.

Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city! I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! ""Didn't you read the memo Billy. US military bases are never to be included in our yearly stats!!!""
Anyone who tries to convince you that shills don't exist is either grossly uninformed or a liar. Protip: the big political subreddits can’t seem to keep the seal on the circlejerk during weekends, almost as if an entire team of manipulators is suddenly on weekend hours.

5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/news, r/worldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.
What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.

Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.

Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media.

6) Speaking of voting, they changed that too.

We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if anyone agreed with you.

7) Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random ‿^

No more r/circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/nottheonion.
And speaking of the female demographic and ""gender discrimination"" being represented, that happened around the time this person took over as CEO of reddit.

8) You are posting too much, please wait...

It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing ""well"", then you get benched.

Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment.

A sneaky tactic, but hey, at least it is only your comment and not your whole account. Isn’t it great that we have shadow-banning on a website that claims to support free speech.

9) Reddit is not a meritocracy.

tl;dr: Your votes do not matter. The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a ""head-start"". As we have learned at r/conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/bestof, after this amazing comment that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. They actually gave that user the boot. How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!

10) The arrival and subsequent take over of r/undelete.
Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. Nope.

11) Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills. Which is interesting considering that nobody seems to care when the accusations are sponsored by the mob: “This guy is a Putin-bot! Everyone must think the exact same way about complex geopolitical events.”

12) All of the proper ""checks and balances"" are now in place.

R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the Two-Minutes Hate from George Orwell's 1984: a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.

But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!
Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum. Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the manufactured consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, without any other evidence, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.

And speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can’t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.

13) Online guerrilla tactics.

When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now https://voat.co/) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?

Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen. Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE. Super [secret](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/6zyx47/rconspiracy_moderator_takeover_and_abuse_of_powers/) link. And once you have the customer, it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones. So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.

14) Shark Shank's Redemption (title credit to: Iridium777)

So I made this post and it went viral on r/conspiracy reaching +3500. I woke up the next day and by accident I signed out and saw my user page could no longer ""be found"". I then noticed that every comment I had made was stuck at 1. After over 6.5 years on reddit, I had received my first shadowban.

So I made a new account and made this post about it, it also went viral. I was given advice to message the reddit admins about my shadowban, I eventually received this message:

It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.

I have no idea what ""vote brigade"" I would have been a part of and you don't have to believe me but I have never been a part of anything that even vaguely resembles a ""vote brigade"".

Anyways, the whole thing stinks to me. Like a canned response. The admin version of ""yeah, our bad"". Multiple years on reddit and I get my 1st shadowban ""accidentally"" within a day and a half of my most viral ""How Reddit Was Destroyed"".

…………………………………….

It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.

Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. They designed a system that would take advantage of the Eternal September syndrome and this manipulation has encouraged the retard masses to become their useful idiots.

I believe this can essentially be boiled down to not just greed, but controlling and manipulating the information that the millions of people see on a daily basis. Reddit gets billions of views. Manufactured consensus is very real and doing it through social media is the gold standard because people are hard-wired to value the opinions of their peers.

The people who run reddit are not the ""cool bloggers"" they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence.

And they know it. You should too."

*SEPTEMBER 13TH*

The tension in the massive chamber was palpable. All who remained from the conflict were now together in one room. They waited for what seemed like an eternity for the owner of the company to address them like he said he would in his earlier announcement. That was, until the ground began to shake violently. Many struggled to keep their balance, and some even lost it entirely and fell over. At this point the tension snapped, and became an unrelenting commotion. The shaking didn’t stop for quite some time, and it began to feel as though the room was ascending. The crowd filled with panic. Unfortunately, /u/bspez was one of the unlucky few who had taken a spill, and amongst the pandemonium they were trampled to death.

Then, the owner finally stepped out and began his address. “So…”, he projected. “This is where our true task begins. The shaking you feel, that feeling like we’re in an elevator… It’s a good thing, so you can all just calm down. When I started Solstice Inc. years ago, I had always wanted to do something revolutionary. Today, right now, that dream comes true. This building in which we stand, was never just a normal building. It’s a spacecraft, and as we speak, it is launching. We are the next wave of pioneers, of innovators, of world-changers, and our time is right now. I’m sorry that this is the way it had to go, but there was no other way for us to make it happen. Your bravery is commendable. Thank you all.” He then stepped back down into his office, and disappeared. The panic in the room escalated to unhinged chaos.

The people of Toronto were amazed and horrified when suddenly, the monolithic headquarters of Solstice Inc. began to rise out of the ground on a pedestal of flame. The entirety of the company’s gargantuan campus was nearly vaporized, but the city itself was left mostly untouched. Civilians watched as the massive building lifted off, and slowly disappeared into the vastness of the sky...

Also, all the interviews was on digital marketing, i really want to work on this area.

So, the thing is: i have 3 people who want to put me in charge of theirs pages and ads (freelance), but i have no clue if i have enough qualification or how much to charge. 

On previous job i did the ads, banners, headlines and some landing pages, i have knowledge on some basic marketing stuffs (read cashvertising couple of times).

So i want to know, what i need to study to improve theirs results? Should i try this or keep looking till i get on some agency?

TL;DR- i cant find a job but i have 3 people to do some freelance (Facebook Ads), need some insights on what to study, how much i charge then, if i am qualified enough, etc. 

Any type of advice is valid.

Thank you"

Also, a couple questions:

1. Do I need to change my major in order to take the actuary tests, or are they passable if I just study for them? I'm going on 3rd year but I think it should be fine? (Business Economics and Accounting math is totally different from Actuary math I think)

2. Whether or not I change majors or not, should I start studying for the tests? Kinda confused about the tests though, should I be taking ""Exam P/1 - Probability""? I heard the rules are changing but I don't really understand the lingo yet.

3. Should I start by joining the Actuary clubs here at UCLA as well?

So I'm slightly having an issue and need some advice and viewpoints. I'm 26 full time student (last semester and swamped), not working, on my own fully self dependent (loans, annuity, frugality) I'm at home but working on schoolwork a ton and am graduating with an almost 4.0 GPA so I can easily get into graduate school. I also have anxiety and have to be very frugal. My parents passed 8 and 2 years ago (where I get my annuity, siblings settled for lump sum). 

Anyways, I have a 21 year old sister who has a boyfriend where things have been unstable and almost two year old so full of temper tantrums. Anyways I adore and have a very mutual relationship with her ie we both help each other out when we can me giving her money her helping me with transportation and other non financial things (I always budget more strongly then I must, this semester things are really strapped though). Her and her boyfriend recently had some job issues and while both just barely got new work and were trying to repay the past rent due they are being evicted from their housing sometime early next week. They should already have a place lined up and ready to move into on the 23rd and are looking for other options if that falls through (they had this weeks notice and have already applied to rent). That gives them a week to two weeks of not having a place to stay at except for me, the boyfriends mom (who has many issues, more then Ill list here), seeing if there's any way to move in earlier, or seeing if there are any other options. 

I offered my place without thinking about what it would do to my studies and anxiety. I really like having a place to myself where I can study in silence, do what I want as I want, escape from people, etc. I did tell them that I wanted them to find somewhere else to keep their non-necessity items, big reason that I didn't mention is I know they have fleas (they're in denial) which I got from them and just barely got over (but I know there's a strong chance Ill get them again by them staying with their cat). I also only have a one bedroom and cant offer anything other then the tile floor of my living room (which has breakables and isn't childproofed). I'm kinda regretting offering but I also would rather know they're safe and not having to live out of their car. I also don't know how my management will deal with it as technically anyone staying more then a few days has to be on the lease and the management here is really bad. I also worry about finances, I'm really cash strapped and I know they are too and I cant really afford to feed 3 other people and since we just briefly mentioned it over facebook while shes on lunch I don't know their expectations (and as a borderline diabetic trying to lose weight there's a ton of food conflicts with her boyfriend who likes really unhealthy food. Also worried about studies, this should be my last semester and I'm a full time student plus an internship that I'm spending at least 10 hours a week on and need my GPA as close to a 4.0 as possible to compete for graduate school whereas her daughter screams and gets into things constantly (not good studying environment). I'm pretty much working 60 hours a week most of it at home studying so I get good grades. Finally, there's the issue of them bringing bugs in which I'm already dealing with roaches and my boyfriend not being able to spend time here with them here but being willing to bomb my place for roaches as he brought some home with him. 

I guess I just need some alternate ideas and suggestions. Do I let them stay? If so how do I navigate having them here without having everything I'm working for fall apart? If not how do I bring it up?

700931,1,2017-09-14,Feeling depressed after moving,owenn652,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/700931/feeling_depressed_after_moving/,"I think I'm slipping into depression.

Typically I'm a very happy-go-lucky individual, and like most people I've had my share of ups and downs that just naturally come with life, but lately I can't see any hope for the future.

A quick recap:

So I moved to a brand new city in a brand new state six months ago. I moved with my girlfriend who I love and adore; we have been dating for eight years now. In this city I have no family and have one friend who I knew from high-school. We're friendly and have hung out a few times, and although I really appreciate him as my friend, we have hung out maybe five times in those six months.

We originally moved from our home state (where we are both from) because my girlfriend wanted to pursue opportunities that a bigger city can offer her  (she is a really talented classical singer with her elite-honours degree) and I also wanted to get out of my home-state due to feeling stifled and maybe, selfishly, feeling that I was too good for it.

We had savings and a place to live for eight weeks before we needed to find somewhere permanent and managed to achieve all that, primarily because my girlfriend managed to secure a full-time job on our 4th week post-move. It wasn't in the area she wanted to be in (it's a retail job) but she took it as she needed an income and at least one job is needed to get a rental property.
Now we're six months in to the move.

My girlfriend had made some friends from her workplace and has gone out on a few get-togethers with them and seems to be relatively settled. She hasn't pursued any singing activities at all since moving which is a concern to me.

I'm another story. I'm still unemployed after six months of job hunting. I've applied for numerous jobs and end up hearing nothing back. I got rejected from benefits; a welfare payment for university students while they are studying, because apparently my girlfriend makes 'too much money' which is ridiculous as she honestly doesn't and could not afford to support another person on her salary. I thought about lying and saying I was single but it was way too much of a risk.

I feel truly depressed and now spend most of my days home alone because a) my GF is out at work b) I can't afford to go spend money on anything c) I don't know anyone d) I have no job.

My savings that I moved here with are now all but nearly exhausted and I'm genuinely worried about what is going to happen to me and my relationship because I'm not going to be able to afford rent soon.

I have one more semester on my post-grad degree but looking at the current job-market I'm not particularly liking my chances of employment once I graduate which is making me more depressed. I had to do a three-week internship which was the one truly great thing about moving here but despite getting really good feedback nothing came of it which was yet another blow.

I'm constantly thinking negative thoughts (which I never, ever used to do), feel lethargic all the time, sometimes (although not often) feel the urge to cry when I don't quite know why, and just generally feel extremely low.

I feel embarrassed to say I miss home and I have fantasies about moving back there, picking up my old job and just being with friends and family until I can figure out what it is I really want, but I know I can't do that as my girlfriend really wants to stay and we have a lease until May of next year.

I'm trying to hide a lot of this from my family back home and my girlfriend, because I don't want them to worry but I'm not sure how I can pull myself out of the hole I find myself in.

I know this is a whiny piece but I have never felt like this in my life and I don't know what to do.

For the first time ever I really can't see any hope :(

Thanks for reading guys, I know it's long but I needed a place to vent...

Found out so much later about it these and this hurts me and does not know how to move past it",rygpb,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/700i4w/my20f_bf_20m_had_a_crush_on_somebody_else_at/,"My BF and I met August 2016. During that time we have been just seeing each other and fooling around, and we didn't have immediate plans of what this relationship will lead to. However, I had to leave for a semester to intern abroad a month later. He was sad but told me that he look forward to meeting me when I come back from the program etc. That fall he didn't message me and I didn't message him. 
After I came back in the winter, I sent him msg saying that I am back and how is he doing blah blah. I see that he was online but he ignored my msg and never seened it, even though I knew that he was active. Some weeks weeks later, I bump into him and we decided to hang again, ultimately, our relationship turned very serious and romantic. I forgave him for ignoring me. Months later, He confessed to me that he loved me, and I started feeling love this June. I passionately cared and loved him with all my heart. 
But then we had a fight yesterday. I found out 9 month into our official relationship, that the reason he ignored me when I got back then was because he had just started training this cute new chick at work which they were very flirty with each other. Found out that he still had a crush on him the first few months of our official relationship.
So I searched stuff and found this timeline.
1 month into the Rel he accepted her fb request. 
2 months in, one time I wanted to read this interesting article that was on his fb newsfeed, he got all so protective, privacy n shit. So I didn't think much and understood him, because I trusted him with my life.
 3 months later, she asked my bf why he went cold. Because they work together, they see each other at work time to time. My boyfriend didn't say much! But most of all he didn't tell her that he has a GF and have been with me for a while. He omitted it. 

Then in May, when he graduated he posted obligatory, thanks you friends family post with bunch of photos. But he didn't include the pics he took with me at the ceremony. At the time, i asked him why he didn't include me, he said that the pics were on my tablet, and he was lazy and wanted to post this exciting news asap. I was kinda hurt, because people always thanks their SO's. (After all, who supports and listens to him complain until 2am ? Who cooks him when he is too busy to eat? ) we are not fb official becuz of my preference . 
But I didn't take it personally, and tried to understand him, since intrust him. So I let go without thinking too much, even though it hurt.

But then we had a fight, yesterday, and all these things happened feels effy. Maybe he didn't want to show me on fb to that chick? And makes sense he was paranoid when I used his fb that way. So after the fight he had me read their msg, but they didn't have much stuff anyways. Cuz it was all in person stuff.

But he tells me that he had a crush on her earlier in the relationship, and that he loves me, and that girl has bf now. He was just physically attracted to her at the time, but he is attracted to emotionally and mentally. I really do know and feel that he loves me truly. but I just found about this thing that happened months and months ago, and I can't help feel very hurt and betrayed and I don't know how I can move past and forgive him for it. I feel so naive, especially during the beginning of the relationship. And I am still grudgy about the fact he didn't message me and also ignored me before we started officially dating. 

TL:DR 9 months into our relationship, which is yesterday, I found out that my bf had a crush on this girl at work, but he claims to have moved on and that the girl has bf now. Our relationship is good and I know he loves very much, but I just can't help but feel shitty about it."
700yz9,2,2017-09-14,WILL YOU GET THE JOB FOR ME?,ADARSH647,Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/Student/comments/700yz9/will_you_get_the_job_for_me/,"In this competitive world, it is the question that every fresh graduate ask others- will you get the job for me.
It has become really tough for many to find a job after spending a huge amount of money for the studies and still not getting a job make many young graduates in the stage of depression. People start doing certification courses to reduce the odds of them and other job applicants. Later they start applying through job search portals. Some gets succeed and other fails.
On contrary to this, It is not because the job market is dull or HR are not interested to hire you. But the main reason is most of the graduates are not skilled enough to get employed. The present education system teaches to award a degree not employment. The first and foremost thing every company that looks on a candidate is whether he is capable of doing the work and for that the candidate needs experience.
The easy way to get experience that companies are looking for is by working as an intern. An internship can provide actual work experience and information about the career they pursue and by the graduation, they will be capable enough to handle job their own. 
To conclude the fact of a student is in their own hands, instead of asking others to get a job for them, try to be employable during the study time itself.

7022ue,29,2017-09-14,Wedding pics prompted us to start Keto,MzShelleRae,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7022ue/wedding_pics_prompted_us_to_start_keto/,"My husband and I got married yesterday in a small ceremony. We had some pictures taken and had the same reaction: ""What the hell!"" We looked bloated and unhealthy. We've been considering going full Keto for a while but that prompted us to take this seriously. 

He has done a blend of Keto/Paleo before to lose a lot of weight and maintain for years. I ran a lot and watched calories. For me, over the past few years, a desk job and being a student and the stress from that caused me to gain 35 lbs. For him, a new job and a year of dating and too many nights eating out also caused him to gain weight 

But those pictures were a wake up call. Our actual big ceremony is October of 2018. We both agreed we won't be unhealthy and overweight. 

We're both mentally prepared for the required changes. The biggest one is no more beer. It became a routine to come home on Saturday, him from work and me from my internship, and either meet friends for drinks, cook out and have drinks, or go out to eat and have drinks. That led to poor food choices and then hangover food the next day. We're ready for that to go and have picked some good outing alternatives that promote us being active and engaged in activities outside of beer. 

So, yay, we got married. Not so yay, our pictures were eye opening and we're doing something about it. 

I am meal prepping all day tomorrow (my strong suit since I did that regularly when my girls were still home) and we will have a new weekend that includes getting out and active and not too much beer. 

Yay!"

My boyfriend, who I love, decided to take on a job at the bookstore, on top of his 15 credit finance schedule, internship, and him being treasurer for his large fraternity.  I'm in school too, but all I have to do is go to class and study sometimes.


I've barely seen him the last three weeks. He's gone by 8am and doesn't get finished until 10 or 11 if you include the time he spends in the Library. That's monday through friday. Friday his fraternity has parties, which he has to be at/ stay sober for them because he's on exec. Sober duty for his frat sucks too. I've sat with him for it multiple times. It's turning away dudes, breaking up fights, getting girls water and calling ubers. It sucks for both of us.


Saturday's we've been together all day so I'm happy with that, but sunday's are frustrating because his day revolves around the Cowboys and Fantasy football.


I don't know what to do. He's apologized for not being around, and said that Sunday's are really his only days to see his friends, which is true. He goes all out for me on saturday's and Fridays he doesn't have to be sober. It's fun days, hikes, brunches and joking all day when we can be together on Saturdays, but I don't know I feel like I should see him more during the week.


I also feel like a brat for even posting this. He's great to me, and works so hard. It'd be different he was lazy or just blowing me off for his friends. However, I""VE received calls from his mom, best friends, other friends asking where he's been because no one has seen him or talked to him I guess, so it's not just me.


What do I do or how do I start the conversation about not seeing him enough
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriends loaded schedule is causing me to feel neglected. He works, studies, handles his obligations, but I pretty much get one day with him a week most times because he's up before me and doesn't finish until about 11 most nights. I want things to change, but feel like a brat for asking because he works really hard and has always treated me well."
702q49,0,2017-09-14,Moving out of Parent's house,Kintsugi2,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/702q49/moving_out_of_parents_house/,"A little background of my situation...

I graduated in 2016 and began working full time in finance a few months after. I started as an intern but am now making 40k a year + bonuses (between 5-10k). I deem myself fairly lucky as I had a lot of scholarships in college so I graduated with 28k in student loans. (I am 23 years old)

As of today, I only have 4k left of my student loans with my bonus of 6k coming next week. I plan on paying off the loan entirely (it's at 4.6%, not the worst but still want it off my back). So I am able to save a lot of money now that I am done aggressively paying off my loans. Living at home makes that possible. I can save ~1,500 a month for investments and emergency fund. I already contribute 15% towards a Roth 401k so I am fairly well off in terms of saving. 

However, I am growing tired of being at home. It's a 50 minute commute into the city (large U.S. city) and I have absolutely no social life at home; it's deep in the suburbs. 0. I try to visit friends from college but I went to school in another state so it's not the most feasible thing to do all the time. I've tried dating but it's extremely difficult living at home so I have given up for now.

But I only make 40k. I plan on asking for a 25% increase to 50k in my yearly review (January); and I am fairly confident in getting it. The city I work in is expensive. For a single it's 1500+ a month (not including utilities) and if I share with other roommates (which I likely would) it will be ~900 a month + utilities. I lease a car for 230$ a month that gets great mpg and my car insurance is 110 a month. So my necessary monethly expenses would be 1250 + utilities + food + gas. 

Obviously I can save an incredible amount of money by staying at home, but the trade-off is rough. I am young so I want to enjoy my social life while I can. But I don't want to live frugally. I'm definitely not a baller but I like to go out for drinks, go to concerts, eat out once or twice a week, etc. I've always been a conscientious saver, but now I'm at a point in my life where I feel like saving isn't my biggest goal because I am missing out on so much. I'd still be contributing 15% to my Roth 401k, but besides that, there would be little savings. What is everyone's opinion on moving out?  "

7039c6,0,2017-09-14,Father demanding I move to my own auto insurance because I am moving out for now.,Aweave15,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7039c6/father_demanding_i_move_to_my_own_auto_insurance/,"Hi everyone, just to give you a little background on my situation. I graduated this past spring and have been working since June as a software engineer in the same area I grew up. I was lucky enough to be able to save these past few months on rent since my parents house is ~10 minutes away from my office, I make approximately $84k a year and don't have any student loans, I just have to pay my dad some money back to officially own my car and transfer it in my name.

Anyways I have had a plan to move out for quite some time now. Due to internships and school I hadn't lived at home since the beginning of my sophomore year and do not like the limited freedom and rather boring life I have at home. The time has come and I am moving to a city near me with some of my friends. Not too bad, my commute goes from 10 to 20 minutes and I can have privacy &amp;a fun at the same time.

That being said, my dad is making kind of an ordeal about me having to get my own auto insurance because I won't be living at home anymore and me moving out requires me to get my own car insurance. Whether he is doing this just as a roadblock to keep me at home, or genuinely thinks this I haven't decided. Right now on his insurance I pay about 800ish a year. Looking at quotes online I expect that to double on my own, the best rate I saw was from geico for about 140/month.  

My question is: Do I have to switch auto insurances to my own? My lease in the city is only a 6 month lease with a possibility of extension. We did this because I may be job hopping in the near future and don't want any constraints.  So this city address would not be my permanent address and I probably wouldn't classify it as my mailing address either. Would it be perfectly acceptable to continue on my parents insurance, and is there any info I could provide him to support my argument?

Also, let's say it is necessary or my dad continues to be stubborn and makes me get my own insurance. Would I be able to put my address down as his address, since this is really temporary housing for now?  I imagine rates in the city are higher, but I don't want there to be any suspicion of fraud or something like that.

Thanks for any info! And sorry for the over-detailed post I just wanted to provide as much detail to my situation as possible


Edit: Thank you to everyone who provided me with the clarification and information I was looking for. Turns out I do need my own insurance and will make sure to get it to avoid any fraud. I guess my confusion came from my internship/college experiences where I didn't live at home and still remained on their insurance. Looks like that joy is behind me now."

We didn't use to be long distance because we went to the same college when we were studying abroad for a year at my university during my freshman year. We loved each other so much and decided to make the jump and stay in a relationship. The last time I say him was when I visited him in Brazil January of this year. Since then our relationship. Also, he's in Brazil and in the US. 
He works 8 am - 3 pm at his paid engineering internship, then he takes classes from 5 pm - 11 pm and also is working on his thesis that's due by graduation in December. Obviously, that puts so much stress on him. He doesn;t have time for anything and he barely sleeps. He has friends but whenever he goes on break he doesn't hang out with anyone because all his friends are from college. 

We barely have any time to even skype and whenever we do he is always tired. I was put up with this feeling neglected and that we really aren't connected because he really doesn't have time. It;s really hard to me because I miss the way that we used to be when we would skype for hours at least 4 times a week or more. Now, we barely skype for 10 minutes maybe 4 times a week. It's not enough. But I will try to support and be kind and understanding to him because this is a hard tie in his life. 

He mentioned to me last week that he thinks that he has depression and he has been feeling this way for months which I suspected but it's gotten bad enough that we actually mentioned it to me. I don't know what to do to help him because I can't be there, and he doesn't have time to skype with me. 

His depression and stress have manifested into being rude to me something. For example saying ""Good job responding"" if I don't respond to his texts in like 5 hours or whatever. And then just not being lovey dovey and acting like my boyfriend in general. TMI he hasn't had skype sex in maybe a month. It's not the same and I don't like it. It feels like were barely in a relationship. 

Whenever I say bye on Skype or Facetime we kiss the camera of our phone or computer to I guess kiss each other through the phone. And yesterday he was in a tired and upset like he usually has been when we Skyped. I asked him to kiss the camera like we always do and he rolled his eyes to showed he was annoyed. I can't remember if we ended up kissing it. Then I texted him and the messages below are what we said. 
ME - ""That was rude"" (referring to the eye roll)
HIM - ""Sorry? I am not feeling well is you didn't notice...Don't make me do things that I really don't want...I'm already too upset and depressed""
ME - ""Wtf I know but damn. Don't let that get in the way of being nice to be though""
HIM - ""I don;t think you really understand what depression means...but alright ok. I'm sorry it was my fault I'm terrible""
ME- ""I do. I used to take medication for depression, you know that,  so don't tell me that I don't understand."" 
HIM - ""I'm going to sleep""
ME - ""Have you thought about going to therapy?""
HIM - ""I don't want to talk about it""
and then we went to bed 

I don't really know what to do because I want to support him and him there for him but I also don't want to be treated like this. I want the boyfriend back that was affectionate and caring not this guy. I can deal with the distance and him being busy if he would just be nice to me but if he can't do that I don't know if I want to date him. But don't know him if being stressed and depressed is an excuse for the way his is acting and treating me. 

I don't know what to do in general. I need any sort of advice! Please help

Hello guys! Just wanted to give you guys a little update on what's been happening. I just started my full time internship along with a 4 month end of bachelors project which are both followed by professonals in the software engineering field. I started my intership and the project this week and I have decided to set an official weekly day for Diamond Hunt updates. This will allow me to mange my time, and I'll be able to add new content and really test everything before release on mondays. I'll be working on Diamond Hunt everyday and hopefully will deliver awesome new content on a weekly basis.

Info:

* Updates will occure every Monday.
* All bug reports will be answered on Monday, right before the update.
* Server will be monitored for a few hours after the updates go live to hot fix bugs if they rise.
* These weekly updates should contain much more content at once as I have all week to work/test them."

So week one has concluded, the first two days of the waiver wire have concluded. Trades have happened from our last update, and some trades have happened but haven't processed. 

Overreactions?! Maybe. But week one is in the books so now we really get to the good stuff. 

First things first [The Scores!](https://imgur.com/a/F0xRI) Certain people like yours truly got their asses handed to them (god dammit Le'Veon Bell!) and certain people struck sheer gold with stars Kareem Hunt (Andy Dalton Wilcox) but overall, it is only week one. Who knows how the season will shape up from here! 

My pick for the week 1 winner: Punch Waterfalls. He took over 'Team 5' from last week, and made a ton of trades in order to bolster a roster he was given, and didn't choose. And he took the win (from me) this week. Great job Punch Waterfalls! may you lose every other game this year you asshole. 

Without further rambling, here's our beloved players, and their teams heading into week 2 

- [Andy Dalton Wilcox](https://imgur.com/a/mm4kf) With the Patriot slayer himself Kareem Hunt! We'll see if he can keep up his production, but boy what a start to his NFL career!

- [Beaucoup Dolores](https://imgur.com/a/FxuZC) Who I believe picked up the Ravens D after an impressive week 1 where they intercepted Andy Dalton 3 times in the first half. (and shut them out 20-0) Could be a return to the ravens of old? We'll see... 

- [Classic Jarles Landry](https://imgur.com/a/943aa) Who scored 69 points last week. I think I deserve a win right there! Other than that, I picked up week 1 superstar Tarik Cohen off of waivers. We'll see if this roster does any better for week 2

- [Intern Geno Smith](https://imgur.com/a/r0NT2) Who has the [ball puncher himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlJ2ABqWTFI) Travis Kelce! (Sorry couldn't find a better video quickly ignore the BS commentary) 

- [Kurt Werner Herzog](https://imgur.com/a/VDZAL) Is next and he decided to roll with the old men of the NFL Marshawn Lynch and Adrian Peterson. Lynch worked out well week one but Peterson struggled against a stout Vikings D and competing against two more backs. After suffering probably the worst injury in fantasy, he did pick up Kerwynn Williams off of waivers who is David Johnsons replacement so we'll see how that turns out (David Johnson is probably my favorite player in the NFL to watch, so fantasy aside this sucks balls)

- [Mmm Yes Points](https://imgur.com/a/5oniC) Seems to be missing some roster spots. Not sure if this is because of a trade, or because he has a plan on the waiver wire, regardless we'll see how he does week 2!

- [Punch Waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/mB7Jm) As I mentioned earlier is my pick for the week 1 winner. Granted he played against me who had a terrible week 1, credit where credit is due, he took over a roster with less than a week to plan, made trades bolstered his roster and now is 1-0 to enter week 2. Took the gamble on Zeke Elliott with his legal troubles and appears to have won the gamble as well! Good for you Punch Waterfalls, glad you can compete on late notice. 

- [Team Price](https://imgur.com/a/NJic0) Who while still may be lacking in the name game is not lacking in the WR game. My goodness, look at that roster! Dalvin Cook and Stefon Diggs had a hell of a game to boot, what we need to ask ourselves is, is this the year the Vikings are legit, or was it a product of the good ol' Saints D? Either way, looking good Team Price

- [The Jackels](https://imgur.com/a/tB0NX) Were able to claim Lions superstar Kenny Golladay off of waivers, and even deciding (as of now) to start the former 6th round pick the Semen Demon (Trevor Siemian) over Dak for week 2. Always love those low draft pick QB's so interested in seeing if Siemian is the real deal. Really the same applies to Dak since he was a 4th round pick. 

- [The Lombardo Trophy](https://imgur.com/a/tZ6m9) Decided to start the QB with the lowest week 1 completion percentage of week one for his QB this week, what a loooooser! In all seriousness we all know Brady is going to torch the Saints D and will probably carry his team to a .500 record right there. *sigh* 

- [Vic Takk Poe](https://imgur.com/a/8hi1H) Is starting Devonta Freeman, Jaquizz Rodgers (former falcon), and the Atlanta D this week. Can you tell he's an Atlanta fan yet? He's also starting Hunter Henry who will destroy what little LB's Miami has, I know this from watching this happen far too often... So congrats on 2-0 Vic Takk Poe!

- [Wiger Hates Brees](https://imgur.com/a/6ZITv) Is our last player! Starting Clay over Bennett, I think this now as I'm typing I should make a trade offer... Other than that, he's starting the Jay Train (Jay Ajayi, but I'm clearly no homer guys) so he'll easily be 2-0 this week! I will say, pray on a Green Bay slaughter, because his two starting WR's are both from Green Bay. 


And now that my shitty commentary is over, I'd just like to say, week one went well, everyone seems to be active and having fun, so we'll see how week two goes and update you guys later! "
706ug8,4,2017-09-14,Advice needed - starting alone,marklezs,digital_marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/706ug8/advice_needed_starting_alone/,"Hi i am currently unemployed (brazilian) for 4 months, past job was on digital marketing (Facebook Ads with focus on conversions) and cant find a internship (still have 1 year to go on College), i have done something like 15 interviews and didnt score, but 2 people said i am over qualified to internship. Also, all the interviews was on digital marketing, i really want to work on this area.

So, the thing is: i have 3 people who want to put me in charge of theirs pages and ads (freelance), but i have no clue if i have enough qualification or how much to charge. 

On previous job i did the ads, banners, headlines and some landing pages, i have knowledge on some basic marketing stuffs (read cashvertising couple of times).

So i want to know, what i need to study to improve theirs results? Should i try this or keep looking till i get on some agency?

TL;DR- i cant find a job but i have 3 people to do some freelance (Facebook Ads), need some insights on what to study, how much i charge then, if i am qualified enough, etc. 

Any type of advice is valid.

Thank you"
706vi4,2,2017-09-14,Going Ghost,tiredofyoubitch,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/706vi4/going_ghost/,"Ghosting someone who you knew for two and a half years is a childish ass move. Two weeks is completely understandable but two years? You had opportunity after opportunity to say goodbye and stop talking to us but you never took them. I thought you were better than this. 

I got into a band a few years ago. They seemed like such friendly good natured people. I wanted nothing more than to be friends with them cause they seemed like the kind of people I'd be friends with. I followed many fan accounts of theirs to surround myself with people that also shared the same love for them. Then I find a social media account that seems too good to be true. Anyone can fake being a celebrity. But they have a group chat with the owners in it. And this is going to be my only opportunity to maybe talk to them even if its a far off chance. 

So I join.

Months go by filled with talking and jokes and memes and fun. Timelines start to add up. You only seem to come online after one of your shows is done. Soon I get to start predicting news. Monday, you'll casually mention you have a stuffy nose and your sick. Wednesday, you show up on a late night talk show with the sniffles. You being sick wasn't public information. Last time you were seen in public you weren't visibly ill. 

Coincidences like this keep happening so often its hard to believe they're just coincidences. 

Soon my friend group on the group chat gets smaller. We start video chatting in groups instead of just messaging. You don't turn on your camera or speak yet. But we start to get to know you. You were always so secretive about your identity but yet open at the same time. You tell us about your managers and how invasive they are in your life and how they control a lot of you and how the industry you're in is full of craziness and lies and similar situations. You aren't allowed to be out at your job. You have to appear straight. You have to pretend you aren't in a same sex marriage. 

Then you tell us you're leaving in a month. 

Your managers won't allow you talking to us anymore. You try to convince them to let us sign NDAs. They won't allow it. At this point its a unspoken truth among us that you are really this band member we've suspected for months. It remained unspoken until you admitted to it. You revealed yourself to us and we were so happy. It's actually fucking you. Wow. 

A few days later you come online to video chat. A small handful of the oldest of us were already video chatting. We kind of formed a closer relationship as the rest of the people were younger. The account you use is only used when you want to talk to us so we assume its you online. We gladly add you to the call. We all felt something was off so instead of calling you by your real name we decide to use your original pseudonym. 

Just to be safe. 

It was a good call because it wasn't you on the other side of your profile picture. It was an overzealous intern to your management team looking for incriminating evidence that shows you revealed who you were. Having our privacy invaded like that was discomforting. The younger people didn't understand so we decided it was best to just cut them out of our lives. Their lack of maturity was getting to be quite annoying. 

You messaged us on a new account on a new platform to tell us that you were willing to risk your job to continue talking to us. You appreciated us having the wits to be cautious in that infamous call. If any of the younger people were on it, they would've blown your cover. 

We start talking once a week. Then it became a few times a week. Then it became nearly everyday were were either messaging or video chatting. You turn on your mic and start talking. Hearing your voice with your accent gave me chills even though by now I've stopped idolizing your public persona. We knew you personally. We knew your likes, dislikes, bad habits, and values. We even knew your kinks and fantasies because we were that close. 

You even got a matching tattoo with us. 

It was originally going to be between us minus you as we didn't want to force you to do such a drastic sign of friendship. The group we have without you are closer simply because we weren't as busy as you and had more opportunities to talk. But you still got it anyways. 

You called us your best friends. Right behind your family and bandmates. We thought of you as our best friend as well. 

Everything was fine until you didn't talk to us for two weeks. You came back only to disappear for a month. 

Then you suddenly cut off our mutual friend who originally set up the fan account that had the group chat. You knew them for years more than you knew us. Now months go by between talking to you. We wanted to ask why you cut off that friend but our chats were so few and far between we didn't want to piss you off.

We always kept your best interests in mind. We suppressed certain topics of conversation that upset you. We didn't mention certain people you didn't like. A message you sent never went more than five minutes without one of us answering. 

But you still disappeared for three months. 

It was publicly announced a close family member died. They were diagnosed the month you suddenly stopped talking to us for two weeks. Our group chat was the first place I went to when the woman who raised me took her final breath. Before I even told my own brother who was out of town. But it took you two weeks to do the same. We were supposed to be best friends. 

But hey you were back and now we knew what was occupying your time in the period you were gone. It also could explain why you lashed out at our once mutual friend. Except that call was the last time we'd ever talk. It was a perfectly normal call too. No one got mad or overly emotional. Just a simple catch up. 

It took you seven months to log back into the account we mainly used to talk. 

In that time, a few of us met up for the first time, I fell into and slowly got out of a major bought of depression. I finally started school. One started an internship at their dream job. A few lost their virginity and had their first relationships and break ups. One was sexually assaulted. One was raped. 

At first we kept messaging you like normal so when you logged back in you had some knowledge of what we did in your absence. I live messaged you watching a show you recommended. I never finished as I was waiting for you to come back so we can talk about it. I'll never watch an episode of that show again. We all slowly stopped messaging you as the months went on. Eventually a few angry messages we sent towards months five and six, mostly on my part. 

All this happened in the seven months you took to log back in. 

And what did you do when you logged back in?

You deleted us. 

You didn't read our messages. You just, deleted us. 

We never got your phone number. Every means of communication was login based. 

You could've just let the account go inactive and we would've got the message.

But no. You took the time to login and delete us one by one. We were the only people who knew about the account and who were friended. 

It didn't hurt because you were once my idol. None of us held you higher than we did any of our other friends. And thats what you wanted. We always did what you wanted. 

The friends you left behind all have incriminating evidence on you. To prove to the people that matter that everything we would say is true, we have an old phone number that would definitely be on file. You gave it to that original mutual friend all those years ago and you promptly changed it when you cut her off. We could go public with it and while the everyday person wouldn't care, your managers would. They would ruin you just like you said they would. 

But we wouldn't do that. 

We promised you privacy and were respecting it. If only you treated us with that level of respect. 

You really hurt me. I still cared for you even when you obviously didn't care about me. 

I never wanted to be catfished more in my life. To know that the person i once looked up to is a true life dick sucks. But it's actually you. 

I hope I see you on the streets of LA one day. To walk up to you and pretend that I'm just a fan. I'll make sure to bring up whatever pr stunt you're acting out at the time just so i can see you lie to me one last time. 

I thought you were the celebrity who's nice on camera and in private but that task is clearly far too complicated for your weak little mind and body to handle. 

So fuck you man. I know you'll never read this cause you didn't even know what Reddit is. But fuck you none the less you selfish cowardly asshole. I no longer feel bad for you so I wish you nothing but the full brunt of the music industry onto you. The fake relationships, fake marriages, fake kids, fake beef, and fake friends. All of it. You deserve every single bit of it. Because you are just as fake as the rest of your public life. You really are nothing but a typical celebrity. Too caught up in your own ego to realize how much of a hypocritical douchebag you really are. 

Fuck. You. "
707b2h,2,2017-09-14,Shitty Staff,1sttimesenioring,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/707b2h/shitty_staff/,"How do seniors handle working with shit associates who just don't get it?  Am I better off:

a) Bringing it up to the firm, with the chance it makes me look like a shitty leader for not being able to handle my staff.

b) Patiently wait 6 hours for a poorly performed workpaper, send it back 3 times and end up wasting 2 days on a task that I would expect to have taken 1-2 hours to be done properly.

c) Wait 2 hours, ask what's taking so long, have them push it into my queue unfinished and personally spend 30 minutes resolving all the issues and then spend 30 minutes walking them thru what I did.

I think this person is unteachable at this point, I'm not exaggerating when I say the intern who was here for 3 weeks was more beneficial to the team than this person who has been here for 7... so I find b) to be an unrealistic option, and to not look like a shitty leader to the firm I'm doing a lot of c)....

7098is,1,2017-09-15,"Blue pilled guy losing hard in sex life, kept on leash, GF travels around, possibly hottest sex life.",fullasian,PatheticStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatheticStories/comments/7098is/blue_pilled_guy_losing_hard_in_sex_life_kept_on/,"Hello people,

I have read many posts of people in similar situations, but I feel I need more eyes on mine. To give some perspective, it is now September and this originated back in April.

My GF (now ex) and I were together for nearly 3 years, I am 26 and she is 23, our relationship was so strong and she was the absolute apple of my eye. In April she decided she wanted to do a 2 month internship in China, I accepted this as she always hinted that she wanted to work abroad/travel and it was only 8-10 weeks which I could stand without her.

When she left, it was as if we were still together, we spoke often if not everyday and we were talking about plans after she returned. A month in, she was offered a full-time job and said she going to take it, as she didn't want to regret any decision she would make, at this time in her life.

This completely broke me... I was furious and emotionally unstable and after a very long-winded conversation on the phone I just concluded with ""why didn't you just break up with me before you left"" to which she replied ""well lets just break up then"". It seemed her decision was made so I stopped contacting her.

A few months passed and I found out (through social media) that she decided not to take the job, and was travelling around Asia. I had received a few messages over this time along the lines of ""I always thought I would be here with you"" and ""I miss you very much after all these months"" - all of which I was so pleased to receive, but I responded with a message saying she knows how I feel about her (I'm still so in love with her) but stated that I had respected her decision and needed space to move on.

It was her birthday the other day so I messaged saying Happy Birthday to which I got a response that opened up a short dialogue and phone conversation where she said that she still loved me more than she ever loved anyone, that I was the biggest love of her life and she was so sorry for everything and being selfish and going travelling. She also said that she had not slept with anyone else, which I found hard to believe but she seemed very sincere. To me, that was everything I wanted to hear - and it sparked emotions that I had spent so long trying to remove and get over, and it gave me some sort of false hope that she would want to come back to me.

A few days later I then received a message saying she was in Sydney and was going to stay in Australia for at least another year.

I am now back where I started - upset, angry, alone. I have not responded and I am thinking of just blocking her off everything and completely shutting her out of my life. Because any communication I've had with her since she left has only led to me breaking down.

Was it selfish of her to say all of the things she did (about how much she loves me) to then turn around and say that she's staying away?

Why would she even say that if she doesn't want to come home and be with me?

Although it has been 6 months since I saw her face, I am finding it so hard to let go of her and now that she's in Australia indefinitely, she is most likely going to move on and meet someone else - which I just cannot handle.

My head is all over the fucking place and although the idea of being single is not the worst thing in the world, I'm struggling to move on. We never really broke up properly (just over the phone) and I have not had any explanation as to what was wrong with our relationship - though I have been told it may not have been anything and it's just a time in her life that she needs to travel/see the world.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation that has any advice? Any help is greatly appreciated (sorry for the essay)."
709hwe,2,2017-09-15,Student loan payments - why should I bother trying to pay them down?,7abib,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/709hwe/student_loan_payments_why_should_i_bother_trying/,"I'll try to keep this succinct. 



I graduated with a Bachelor's debt free, but after looking for work unsuccessfully and slaving away at unpaid internships, I decided to get my Master's degree and took out student loans. 



I owe somewhere in the region of $100,000 for my master's degree and looking back on that decision, while I don't regret my choice to do my degree, I do regret not trying to keep those loans lower by looking for financial aid and scholarships or working part time (though I did work part time the last 6 months while I was finishing up my dissertation). 




After I moved back home, I spent about five months applying for jobs before I got the job that I'm still in today. I've been living at home rent free, and my other expenses each month are pretty low. I make roughly $2,000/ month after taxes, and of that I probably spend between $7-800 on gas, phone, food, and car payment. I've been putting away roughly $400 a month into an Ally savings account (1.2%, about $5,000 saved right now). I am contributing 6% of my income to my 401K (100% employer match after a year, which is coming up next month). I have about $8,000 sitting in my checking account (emergency fund, I suppose?), and I don't have any other debt. 



My student loans are on an income-based repayment plan where I will never pay more than 10% of my income. After I believe 20 years, my loans will be forgiven. However, I am also under Public Service Loan Forgiveness due to my current position. If I remain in public service, my loans will be forgiven after 10 years (EDIT: 120 payments). When I first started working, it was toward the end of last year (October). Because of that, my tax return for that year shows that my income was less than minimum wage. Due to the tax return from last year, all of my payments so far for this year have been zero dollars because it goes off of the previous years tax return. I have made a couple of one off payments here and there, but I've probably only paid about $2000-$3000 off of my loans. I called and asked my loan provider if these zero dollar payments count toward my 10 years of payments for public service loan forgiveness and they replied that even if my payment amount is zero it still counts toward the 10 year (EDIT: 120 payments) goal. 



My main question is why should I pay extra towards my loans right now when my zero dollar payments are still counting? Assuming I continue to work in public service, regardless of how much extra I pay, after 10 years my loans will be forgiven. Due to how high my student loans are I doubt that I would be able to actually ever repay the loans. Even if I do not remain in public service, my loans will still be forgiven after 20 years. I know that I have to pay interest on whatever amount is forgiven, and that can be quite pricey, but I am having a hard time understanding why I should try to re-pay these loans aggressively. Right now for example I could be paying 800 or so a month toward these loans if I tried hard, but I haven't been bothering and instead have been saving up money. (Side note: I am engaged and saving up money towards an eventual wedding as well as for possibly a down-payment on a house). 



I feel like, reading this sub, I see so many posts talking about aggressively paying off student loans but I'm having a hard time understanding if I should be doing the same in my situation. For things like credit card or other debts I understand, but for my student loans, I haven't been able to find an answer.  I don't want to *not* pay off my loans now while I have the extra income that would normally be used for rent, but I also want to be able to save as much as I can right now for future expenses. 


TL;DR: Do I have the wrong idea in waiting 10 or 20 years for my student loans to be forgiven? 



EDIT: A lot of people are attacking me for assuming that I'm trying to get out of paying back my loans. This is not the case. I'm not trying to 'steal' or 'cheat' the system. I am aware that it was my choice to take out loans. I am aware that loans are given with the agreement to pay them back. I am aware that it is my responsibility to do what I can to pay them back. 
I have been set a monthly loan repayment of $0 by the loan provider. I have been making additional payments on top of that money. My question is if I should double down on making those additional payments, or if - from a personal finance point of view - it makes more sense to continue to try to save a lot of money.  Sorry if that wasn't clear from my original post.  Thank you to the commenters who actually answered that question already. "

- Bought from the Microsoft Store with a warranty (HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO BE)

- Product had and still has zero defects

- I am a freshman year college student, physics/math double major, doing a few internships. I do a LOT of programming (github.com/jrfarah) and a LOT of 3D art (so GPU and CPU strength is a must for me). Outside of that, I was looking for a thin, light, powerful laptop that I could use for taking notes, writing reports, a significant amount of simulation-based programming, and for Blender3D. 

- I do not use this laptop for gaming, so I may be able to offer some insight into whether or not this laptop is a good match for people who may like the aesthetic, build, or power, or whatever, but aren't sure if a Razer laptop will suit their needs because they don't game. 

- This is my second Razer laptop; I originally had a Razer Blade Stealth, before that, a Dell Inspiron 15R 5500, and before that a Dell Latitude d380. 

If there are any questions I can answer about my experience with the Razer Blade 2017 (GTX 1060, i7-7700HQ, 512GB SSD, 16 GB RAM) or even about Razer in general, please let me know. :) Ask me anything!"

.......and I really would love to spend that on the road with a drum corps doing something;  would love to do something like an internship, social media, or something like that but if all else fails I'm totally okay with volunteering and being around that environment.  I think it would be a pretty amazing experience and chance to get to watch the best of the best in the activity I love so much in a new and exciting way and give back/contribute in whatever way I can.  I'd love to start getting stuff out soon and be ahead of the game rather than try and jump in next year before the season starts.  

So my questions to those of you who may or may not fit the description above (if you got something feel free to chime in) are:

- Is there some kind of application process for this or do you just have to throw your self out there and contact people on your own?  Probably different for every corps but just whatever you have experienced/do would be great to know.  

- What is the time table for when I should do this?  Don't wanna jump the shark only a little over a month after finals but also don't wanna wait too long and miss an opportunity.  

- Anything outside of a resume and stuff like that I should have ready?  

- And lastly, I didn't do drum corps for a variety of reasons, which is something I regret every day of my life, so I'm just worried that I'm some random person trying to insert themselves somewhere they won't be welcome or don't belong.  So should I even think about doing this in the first place?  

Thanks in advance, I almost did something like this last year but was too scared/anxious to do it but I'm ready to just go out there and do something for 2018.  Feel free to message me anything specific as well.

Discovery Weekly is what got me to pick Spotify over Apple Music.  I LOVED IT.  Ever week was super interesting new and modern music I wouldn't hear anywhere else.  For the love of EVERYTHING HOLY.  WHAT.  HAPPENED.

I just got finished with a string of songs played to me by Discover Weekly so preposterous I had a stroke: Big Tymers - still fly, Clipse - When's the last time, TI - top back, Young Roddy - Chopping Bricks, Mase - Welcome back ..

...

WHAT!!?!?!?

Was there a 30 year old intern assigned to the Discovery Weekly algorithm who decided the only music worth discovering was the music he used to smoke blunts to back in 2002?

I'm stunned -- literally stunned.  I'm lying paralyzed on the floor of my office communicating to my secretary via grunts and she's typing this out.

It can't be intentional, because even if Spotify concentrated ALL its energy on ruining Discover Weekly on purpose - they couldn't have done this thorough a job.  This is beyond the technical capabilities of ISIS so that's not the answer either.

I'm thinking maybe this is definitive proof that we really do live in a computer simulation and whoever's simulation it is -- his asshole teenage brother just logged into his account and is trolling me directly.

I need an explanation for this insanely random change like I need oxygen to breathe.  How did this happen?  Why?  Who's responsible?  What is their address and do they have any fatal allergies I could exploit with a well designed piece of mail?

So I just got a internship out in SF and my company is gonna reimburse for most of my expenses to get there, so I figured I'd make a trip out of it. Like I mentioned, I definitely don't have a lot of experience road tripping, have definitely been driving for a while though. 

I'm trying to make the trip in 6 or 7 days using RT 80 - my biggest challenge is that I don't really know where to stop! Like, which cities/sites/attractions are worth stopping for or are a ""must-see"" in this rare road trip?? Specifically ones that aren't too too far out of my way. I plan on driving at least 8 hours a day, and staying at a hotel/Airbnb during the nights, would love to sight-see during the mornings though. 

I'm hoping someone who's made a similar trip will be able to recommend a few things. Anything from which National parks to favorite spot to eat or which city I just have to stop at! I'm not the most outdoorsy guy but I'm definitely active and ready to try new things :)

Any feedback is appreciated, thanks in advance!

Ok so in January, I move back from a big city job to a smaller firm where I did an internship which helped me get my job after graduating uni. One of the internship co-ordinators is my boss in the new firm... let's call him Bob. Bob basically helped me get the job.

A week after starting, Bob was amazing. He was such a friendly, approachable and helpful guy. I log on to Growlr to find that Bob is gay and is in an open relationship. Awkward at the time so I just didn't message him... but my curiosity wouldn't let me block him. 

Weirdly, Bob never talks about being gay in the firm. You would have no idea. I was the only other gay guy in the firm - I'm quite open about it and everyone was very accepting and cool about it.  Bob still doesn't even mention that he is gay (even to me) although I understand he likes to keep is private life private.

Then, one break when it was just me and him, he brought in some cake that he made at home. I asked him if he made it, then he explained that it was his partner... and he opened up to me about being gay and stuff. It was really endearing and it was nice that he felt comfortable talking to me about it. He also explained that I accidentally messaged his partner on growlr (oops). 

A few days later, I get a message on growlr for him. I felt really awkward at first, like a line was being crossed but I went along with it. I kept it strictly platonic but he wouldn't stop messaging. He told me how his marriage is basically dissolving and he's seeing another guy 50 miles away. They live in a huge mansion in an estate but are both miserable with each other. 

Then, he starts talking to me in work about it. I opened up about my own issues with my family not being so accepting of my gayness. It was nice to have someone to talk to in a relatively small town. 

So we keep messaging and talking. The Growlr messages from him become a bit flirty but I keep it strictly platonic. We talk about hot guys and stuff but that's about it. 

On his birthday, he gets drunk and messages saying how he's been dying to take me to this gay sauna. I have to admit, this is where I made my first mistake. I trusted this guy so much and I was beginning to get a bit infatuated. It felt so, idk, comforting to have an older (albeit sexy) guy listen to all my woes and worries. I stupidly said yes. 

I also end up moving to the town closer to the firm, he finds an apartment beside his BF. I take it.

So, we go to the sauna. I go to his huge mansion beforehand. We go up. I genuinely didn't expect a gay sauna to be THAT fucking explicit. I see him naked, and fucking another guy. I don't know, I knew I was crossing the line right then and there but it was so hot. We agreed not to do anything with each other. 

I think it's relevant to mention at this point, I was actually quite depressed if not a bit borderline. My family had basically just rejected me, I felt like I was at a crossroads and I was couch surfing. He knew this. I needed someone to rely on. 

We go back to his place and it was surprisingly not awkward. We talked and he kept going on about his relationship with this other guy, and how his husband was away on a business trip. I asked him for advice about my family and stuff. We keep chatting and then he breaks out the wine. I get drunk and basically let loose on all my problems. ""Why don't you stay at mine tonight?"" I drunkenly agree. 

So I'm lying in the spare room, drunk as a sunk. He messages me on growlr asking to have a ""jerk off sesh"". He appears with porn and we both jerk off together, kiss.. you get the drift. Luckily I can't remember most of it because I was so wasted. Thinking about it even makes me sick. 

So, we were both working the next day. I wake up beside him in shock thinking, what the fuck have you done. He gets up and doesn't say anything for ages then says for me to take the day off and he'll put it in as annual leave. So I go home a bit hung over. Fall asleep. Wake up and that horrifying moment of clarity hits me. I message him in a panic on growlr. He plays it all off as cool and just a drunken mistake, I calm down.

Then that's when shit hits the fan.

At first, he seemed ok. Then he turned into a right nasty bastard. Totally disregarding everything I say, shouting, avoiding. I feel like shit and dread meeting him in work. He still, weirdly enough, talks to me about his relationship issues. I turn into a nervous wreck, constantly riding the wave of his constant bipolarness. Constant anxiety attacks. Everytime I try to bring up what happens he change the subject. The worst part is I felt totally disregarded and thrown to the side like a piece of trash.

I move into my new flat beside his bff. She is a spinster who constantly checks up on me and feeds info back to him. I generally avoid her. He tells everyone in work what happens (e.g. if I hook up with a guy, get drunk etc). 

It all comes to a head after a colleague's wedding party. We leave in the same taxi and my brave drunk self kinda loses it on him. I confront him how he basically groomed me to go to a gay sauna, got me drunk to have sex with me and now is acting like I was the one in the wrong. He shrugged it off being I was being too sensitive and paranoid. 

I felt a bit relieved but after going back into work, he acts x1000 worse. Other people have noticed too. 

So basically, I get hell on earth at work because of him and I'm under constant surveillance by his bff neighbour. I have become so depressed, I feel like I have fucked up my entire career over something to stupid. I barely eat or sleep anymore its getting me down so much. There aren't any other jobs nearby I can go to, and I can't go to HR bc they all protect their own assess. What I regret the most is losing the friendship, although looking back it probably was an insincere gesture to bone me. There says a lot about a guy who can cheat on his husband with another guy then shag trainees and go to gay saunas. 

I don't even know if there is a solution to this but I feel broken. He has ruined everything for me. I don't know what to do anymore. "

Today, at times, I realized that I was having some pornographic thoughts and I struggled to get them out of my mind. I apologized to God for thinking that.
The next few days will be very difficult. Lately, I can only stay for a week without PMO.

I want to share two blessings with you.
1. I have obtained an internship in a public agency and this will keep me away from idleness and the PMO, as I will spend more time away from home. (Thanks God)

This time last year tripped on Acid, intensified a compulsive disorder (was on medication that I believe initially triggered it) for the worst after I abused it and tripped in a bad setting and parents got home early triggering what can only be described as a seizure from how intense the compulsions to crack/stretch my body got in front of a bathroom mirror.

January hits, money problems consume my mind, non stop thought/worry etc, I develop DRDP

Mid February as a last resort I begin meditating and wow does this work, just 10-15m here and there nothing major; where has this been all my life

In the summer I read The Mind Illuminated and being doing 45m sits religiously with 2 hours sessions sprinkled here and there, insane progress, sometimes got so deep I heard the universal hum and another time the sound of a forest (the breeze of the wind, a stream flowing, crickets and birds chirping), go to some music festivals take acid again; all is well, life is going great, Doctor switches my medication (brings back some OCD but nothing like the previous meds) and the OCD practically disappears. 

I believed that my winter/spring session was the Dark Night of the Soul or something similar however the fact that meditation helped me so much makes me say otherwise unless LSD can trigger a Dark Night too.

------

Now the juice:

Here I am on September 15th at the edge of life. (hear me out)

3 days ago I read about the noting method, every time you catch yourself thinking/pondering/hear a voice in your mind ""thinking"" and move on. I read that this method can be the fastest way to progress/enlightenment albeit unstable and I see why.

I have achieved a state of no self before in the summer, an entire day where I felt like I was the air around me, the people around me, etc and it didn't really bother ""me"" at all.

Yesterday getting off the subway after work I all of a sudden felt a return of the Depersonalisation, not derealisation (I feel this is important to note) the difference is unlike the winter I wasn't panicked, or afraid, it was a very different ""feel"" to it. 

""Stairs on the left or right, prove to yourself you still have control, go right"" and then my body went left, and I just watched from 1stPOV this human walk on autopilot, look around on autopilot, talk to someone asking for directions on autopilot, etc, total detachment/dissociation.

As I neared my house my mind understood finally the key, our entire lives our minds have been writing this story to make it seem like we have control, and so feeling upset is literally all in your head, ""I choose freedom"" and my mind went silent for almost the rest of the day.

Woke up this morning feeling great too and performed some self inquiry meditation over lunch from the office and realised that I am nothing and everything, I am love, I am compassion, etc etc; mood felt good, was talking about randoms and in a very upbeat zone.

Then the commute home and the ego returns with a vengeance, realising that my future is basically predetermined, my entire life is predetermined, every thought I have is out of my control, everything I have ever done was simply an illusion my brain gave me to make me think I have agency when in reality I'm simply an organism like some bacteria floating around that just happens to have a brain smart enough to bestow a sense of self and be able to study the universe and create things that no species to our knowledge has been able to achieve as of yet. 

It felt sad, like my its (ego's) entire life was a lie, I go to the gym and on the rower begin some self inquiry and ask ""what am I"" and go through a few cycles when suddenly...

""What am I...I am dead, I is dead, I is gone ... to whom did this thought occur to?..... *silence for basically the entire gym session minus a few brief instances of thinking about how much weight to put on etc*""

To exist in this society we need egos, we need that sense of self, but it all feels like such a rat race now. We get herded into machines in the morning to go to the city centres to make money for those at the top and most of us will never escape and we don't even really have a choice in our escape, either we do or we don't.

I used to rag on meditators, I used to laugh at buddhism and its monks in mountain temples, and yet now it almost feels like I should go camp out in a cottage in a forest away from everyone else, yet I know I won't. It feels like I'm in too deep, my parents are low key relying on me for their retirement and I can't let them down, I couldn't live with myself with the suffering I know I'd cause them. I hate my business degree and think I'll finish my remaining year then go for premed and get the reqs and go for medschool and ideally become a neurosurgeon or neurologist.

It's a catch 22, I see the folly of the ego but at the same time need to keep it alive and so it bites back at me trying to reclaim itself. 

Everywhere I've read said this phase will pass and once I come out of it by meditating more (no more self inquiry/noting for me I think, pure vipassana and metta for now I think).

""I"" feel lost, when there is no I (or it's at least very diminished) everything feels okay, and conjuring up that state is pretty easy at this point, but sitting at my internship listening to my colleague and other finance grads go on about the ""big deals"" they closed, the ""huge package they wrote"" the crazy expensive lunch they went for like it was nothing to their wallets makes me uncomfortable. A year ago I was all for the hoorah $$$ of the investment world but now it feels so empty and fake and unfulfilling.

I don't regret meditation, it got me out of a dark spot of my life that had some suicidal ideations and self harm involved but now it's put ""me"" in a dark spot of a much vaguer/conceptual nature.

1. I have no accounting related internship experience. What should i do to line up a internship in the summer? I've been sending out resumes to companies but no one is responding. I have a 3.5 gpa, 2 club memberships, and 1 non-accounting related volunteering work. My school requires us to get 160 hours of internship experience to graduate. So I need to get something done asap 

2. Should I get my master's after my Bachelors? The master's program would take 1 year and I would graduate in December 2019. I will be CPA eligible with my bachelors, so idk if it's worth getting the master's. Plus, I am hoping to find an internship that will offer me a position after I graduate with my bachelors (so is start work Jan. 2019). So would the master's be worth it, or in the long run is experience &gt; master's more worth it?

I am an intern at a firm and I've been there for over 2 years. We hired another intern (We'll call her Jess) in my department about 6 months after I came on, so we've been working closely together for about a year and a half. 

We work on most of the same projects and tasks, and our cubicles have been next door to each other our entire period there at work. Working side by side with Jess for over a year and a half, we've developed a close friendship. 

We've found out a lot about each other's personal lives, go out to lunch several times a month, go on double dates with each other's SO's and just gel well together. 

She just graduated from college this past spring (I have 2 years to go) and has been on the search for a full time job. She's spent this last month interviewing, and 2 weeks ago, received a job offer from across the country and accepted. The pay is good and relocation expenses will be covered. Today was her last day.

It's bittersweet for me. Of course, I am absolutely happy for her. But I also feel pretty down about it. She's been an awesome person to work with and discuss our personal lives, and after my SO, she's grown to become my best friend. I'm going to be feeling a little down about this for a while. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. How do you guys deal with with close colleagues moving on?"
70eiay,12,2017-09-15,(Spoilers Extended) The Patron of the Pigboy,Brayns_Bronnson,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/70eiay/spoilers_extended_the_patron_of_the_pigboy/,"TL;DR: Jaq/Alchy/Pate is working for either Sarella Sand or Qyburn.  Sorry for the meandering structure, but I had some really interesting tangential thoughts while writing this.  Enjoy.

There's a lot going on in Oldtown in the books, and due to the frustrating division of POVs it has really only featured for us in two chapters of AFFC: the Prologue, and Sam's final chapter in the ~~book~~ *series to date* (fml).  We've got the various factions within the Citadel, the mysterious machinations of the Hightowers, our beloved Fat, Pink Maester-in-Training, a breakfast club of Acolytes and Novices, and a Faceless Man going about his faceless things.  

The first of two big mysteries have already been cracked by the community:

1. [Alleras the Sphinx is Sarella Sand](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/60725-alleras-the-sandsnake-complete-analysis/), 4th Sand Snake, bastard daughter of Prince Oberyn ""the Red Viper"" Martell.

2. Pate the Pig Boy, whom we see in the final Sam chapter looking conspicuously *not murdered*, is in fact the Faceless Man who had been calling himself the Alchemist, and is in all likelihood the same Faceless Man who had once called himself Jaqen H'gaar while journeying north with Arya Stark in ACOK.

Poor Pate is a lowborn fellow, who must have been just smart enough to read, which got him through the door at the Citadel, but now he's stuck in a dead-end internship shoveling bird shit for Walgrave, the senile Archmaester of Ravencraft.  He just wants to get to be the first guy to bed his crush, and now he's dead.  The presence of Pate/Alchy/Jaq has spurred a lot of questions.  Why is he in the Citadel?  And who is he working for?  

Notably, the FM does not simply pick off and replace Pate at a whim; he makes absolutely certain that Pate is in possession of the skeleton key to the Citadel that belongs to Archmaester Walgrave.  However, the FM has not made a bee line straight for whichever objective he was intended to reach with the key, and has instead been maintaining his ruse.  As Pate, this FM seems to have infiltrated the Citadel, and prevented anyone from learning the wiser, which means he has continued to fulfill the real Pate's duties of taking care of Walgrave and the ravens.  

Digression #1: Hilariously, this means a FM has been sitting on the nexus of all communications **FOR THE ENTIRE FUCKING REALM!**  If he is truly managing all of the ravens at the Citadel then he is likely the most informed person on current events in the realm, and could easily be filtering which messages get disseminated to the rest of the maesters.  This isn't even my actual point, I just realized it while I was typing this and I'm gobsmacked that it hasn't been made a bigger deal of yet (or perhaps it has and I'm just out of touch).

The fact that the FM is still occupying the role of Pate, and in possession of the skeleton key could be explained by a few hypotheses:

1. The key grants him access to an objective, but he is unsure where in the Citadel it actually is, and needs time to precisely locate the objective, and design an effective plan for accessing it.

2.  He knows where the objective is located, but its security is sufficiently robust that the FM needs time to concoct/execute an effective plan to access/extract the item with the commensurate level of stealth.  Perhaps the Pate identity can't get close to this objective without setting off alarms, and/or this objective must be completed without anyone knowing it even happened.

3.  The objective is not a portable item, but a machine/instrument/artifact that is cumbersome/fixed in location.  Instead, the FM has to be able to access it often and repeatedly in order to fulfill his mission.

The Citadel is noted to have a few shady things going on in it: the maesters study anatomy and pathology via dissection and autopsy (not in and of itself shady, but probably very distasteful to the sensibilities of the masses), the maesters have a frightening command of rare poisons and are known to keep well-stocked on their reagents, and the maesters are speculated to have preserved fragments or whole copies of a few infamous banned books, including *Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns: Their Unnatural History* by Septon Barth, and *Blood and Fire / the Death of Dragons*, which Tyrion describes as being a ""fragmentary, anonymous, blood-soaked tome"" and kept in a ""locked vault at the bottom of the Citadel"".

Digression #2: the title of *Blood and Fire* is an inversion of the House Targaryen words *Fire and Blood*.  The sigil of House Blackfyre is an inversion of the Targaryen sigil.  Daemon II Targaryen was a proven prophet / dragon-dreamer, who spent at least a decade of his life as Bloodraven's prisoner in the Red Keep in order to obstruct Bittersteel from being able to crown and rally any of Daemon's younger brothers to be the next Blackfyre Pretender.  Bloodraven believes in prophecy and magic, and so he ""milked"" Daemon for visions during his captivity, probably drugging and torturing the poor boy at turns.  *Blood and Fire* is the chronicle of what Bloodraven extracted from Daemon, it is literally blood-soaked with Daemon's blood, because Bloodraven was taking notes while he tortured the guy, it was anonymous and fragmentary because Bloodraven didn't compose it as a book or intend it for anyone else to read, and it was confiscated among some of BR's other personal possessions after BR was arrested for murdering Aenys II? Blackfyre, possibly read by Aemon, and sent to the Citadel for ""safekeeping"".  That's my theory, anyway.

Now, Sarelleras is at the Citadel and studying hard, having already earned three links in a year.  Prince Doran mentions that Sarella is up to a personal ""game"", which may not have been derogatory since Doran often equates his own life-and-death political maneuvers to the game of cyvasse.  Oberyn has instilled his daughters with a fierce desire to be great in each of their chosen pursuits.  Obara is a fighter, Nymeria is an aristocrat and cutthroat, Tyene is a cleric/poisoner, Sarella is an archer and academic, Elia is a jouster/rider.  Sarella could just be out to forge a Maester's chain, then tell the maesters ""see, chicks can do this too, girl power!"" and while that isn't an ignoble pursuit, I don't think it is why she's there.  Other readers have dissected Doran's machinations at length, and have pointed out that no angle makes sense.  If Dorne ends up committed to any side of the wars to come, they will loose badly.  Notably, Preston Jacobs has proposed that the deeper plan may be to allow/encourage his enemies to wipe each other out, with dragons if necessary, so long as they Dorne can neutralize the dragons and move to the top of the Westerosi food chain in the aftermath (especially since the Martells can claim Targaryen descent).  Sarella could be positioned to gain intel/resources to achieve this end, including the aforementioned books, in order to assist her uncle.  Her time of being at the Citadel for about a year, means she has likely been at the Citadel since the beginning of ASOS, meaning news of Dany's dragons may already have trickled into Doran's ears as he was keeping a closer eye on the Targaryen siblings than most.  Sarella being a female and only an acolyte places her in a precarious position at the Citadel, and she likely cannot get close to the forbidden wing of the library, even with some polyjuice potion.  But she has money (which Lazy Leo Tyrell points out while accusing her/him of being a lordling), and a pig boy is not a pricey target for the Faceless Men, so she could ostensibly afford them to facilitate her plan, which she has already done the recon work for, so that she can keep clean hands but still provide essential assistance to her uncle's plans.  Between Sarella, Nym, and Tyene, Doran has Sand Snakes positioned to disrupt the Citadel, the Small Council (which will be reeling from Kevan and Pycelle's assassination, largely overrun with Reacher Lords who are not going to be happy about a Dornish bastard joining their council), and the Faith which is already in upheaval.  With Arianne treating with fAegon and Quentyn hopefully making contact with Dany, Doran is poised to make one heck of a chaos ladder climb.

Or the FM is working for Qyburn.  Qyburn could have met then-Jaqen after the Weasel Soup incident at Harrenhal, since there are parts of that story that don't really check out, and Qyburn is quite sharp.  Qyburn appears entirely too well-informed in the Kings Landing chapters of AFFC and ADWD.  While he has assumed control of some of Varys's informant network, he may also be supplemented by hand-picked info coming from his man inside the Citadel (see Digression #1 above).  Qyburn also believes in magic, and possibly prophecy, and he knows the side he has aligned himself with is on a collision course with Dany if she should ever come west.  He also ingratiates himself to his new patrons by proving himself extensively useful, thus demonstrating dragonlore gives him an option to flip to Dany if she should show up and crush Cersei in the future (Qyburn can't be blind to Cersei's ineptitude/volatility).  As a former maester, Qyburn likely knows enough about the workings of the Citadel including the existence of the skeleton keys, the senility of Walgrave, the possible tractability of Marwyn as an inside man, and the location of his objective to have the plan all worked out in advance.  He simply tells the FM to choose an appropriate patsy.

Or Qyburn is part of the Dornish Master Plan, as has been posited by others, and he and Sarella are actually two facets of the same mission.  Or none of the above.  Either way, let me know what you think."

70fxf2,9,2017-09-16,Pursuing PhD in Aerospace Engineering from Master's in Math Possible? [X-post from /r/GradSchool],Lafojwolf,aerospace,https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/70fxf2/pursuing_phd_in_aerospace_engineering_from/,"I'm currently pursuing an MS in applied mathematics, but I want to switch to something much more engaging that I unfortunately just don't have the background for.

I would like to switch into aerospace engineering, but my experience with engineering is limited. I remember in 2012 when I was first starting college, I had great desires to eventually end up in aerospace engineering, but I wasn't able to afford any programs in undergrad that could lead me there. My local university offered mechanical engineering, but I completely hipstered out on that, thinking that engineering was too mainstream and I wanted to be different. I remembered I thought I was going to study my ass off and transfer into Caltech, but I just got so busy that it never happened. It probably wouldn't have even happened at all. I ended up in math for two reasons: 1) I got a full scholarship to a big-name university for math, but barely anything for engineering, and 2) I was just so angry about choosing my major that I just decided to do math and never look back. I don't regret majoring in math, but I just fear now I won't be able to fulfill my actual dreams.

I keep wondering if I'm making this change too abruptly, but it's not spur of the moment. I've been thinking about this the last few months (since about March) to the point where I planned my schedule for this year (last year of my master's) to try and segue into the field of engineering as much as I can by taking numerical analysis classes and the control theory sequence. With the recent news of Cassini, it's burning in my mind more than ever right now to do aerospace. I would like to get a job at the NASA Jet Propulsions Laboratory if I could, but I'm a little daunted by the path I'd need to take to get there, or if I've completely fucked myself over.

Here are my stats:

 - 23 years old.
 - Applied math background with numerical analysis emphasis.
 - Graduated from big-name school with a 4.0.
 - Lots of teaching-related experience.
 - I only took a few engineering classes in undergrad, and I barely remember any of it.
 - I also have no internships, which I understand is kind of bad.
 - No GRE scores right now (yes, I actually got into grad school with no GRE). If I took the GRE, I'd probably get above-average scores, but likely not anything stellar if my SAT scores are any predictor.
 - I could probably secure at least three good letters of recommendation from faculty, past and present.

-------------------------------------

The last few weeks of the start of the semester have just been... depressing. *I'm just not loving what I'm doing right now* and want to make a change. The difficulty isn't what's getting to me--it's just I'm not interested in my job prospects with the degree.

I've told all the faculty I'm working with that I'm interested in software engineering types of jobs, but are they going to judge me if I come out and tell them that's not what I'm wanting to do anymore, like 5 weeks later? 

I also need to take the GRE, but the problem is that I'm busy as all hell teaching my first actual class this semester. I don't know where I'm going to find the time to study for the GRE by December 1st when most applications are due for PhD programs. 

What can I do? How do I explain this without feeling like professors/faculty are judging me for an abrupt about-face in course of study? What kind of programs would accept me? Would I have a shot at any programs in California/Texas/Alabama?"
70g6sj,7,2017-09-16,My [GF 23] of 6 years broke up with me [M 22] a week ago. After much thought and consideration i want to get back together with her. Thoughts?,Throwaway167801,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70g6sj/my_gf_23_of_6_years_broke_up_with_me_m_22_a_week/,"Hello Reddit, I hope you guys are having a wonderful day/night wherever you are. Before i explain my situation, I'd like to preface this post by saying that English isn't my first language so do let me know if certain bits and parts of my post do not seem clear.

The past Monday (11th of September), my GF of 6 years broke up with me through text. She cited my reluctance to grow up as being the main reason for our split.

To further elaborate on the situation, and i know i'll probably get some flak for this, I've always put her above all else in my life. Above family, work, studies etc etc.

 For example during my last internship at a relatively small start up company, i was supposed to meet my superior to discuss some minor hiccups with regards to the company. Though the meeting was scheduled to be later in the day, my GF decided that she wanted to meet me for a lunch date. So I told my superior this (He was super chill about the whole thing, as long as I handed in my work on time) and he said it's cool and that i could take the day off.

So i grab lunch with my GF and told her that i was supposed to meet my superior but decided that i wanted to have lunch with her instead. After telling her this she became absolutely furious with me due to my lack of proper prioritization and lack of responsibility in general.

At the time, I was curious as to why she would be angry at me as I've chosen to spend time with her instead of work. Though in hindsight I understand that what i did was essentially a huge turn off for her.

Another instance that comes to mind was that I was rather manipulative or emotionally abusive for lack of a better term.

Post-Diploma, i was supposed to continue my tertiary education for my Bachelor's Degree overseas. The course would've spanned 2 years and the very thought of leaving her for the next 2 years of my life was daunting to say the least. So without putting too much thought or consideration, I proceeded to delete my acceptance email for the university that i had been accepted to, thinking to myself that if I was willing to stay for her, then she would do the same for me right?

So fast forward 2 years (3 months ago actually), I've graduated with a Bachelor's Degree and I couldn't have been more happy to have stayed and finished up my education on local grounds.

However, she began to face problems with our relationship, her other friendships, her academics and the like, and as a result she told me that she would very much like to continue her education overseas to gain a certain sense of responsibility for herself.

I was fuming when she told me this bit of news, to think that she would even consider leaving me for x amount of years was absolutely mind-boggling to me at that time. Though of course, one part of me wanted to support her in her endeavors and interests, cause that's what couples do right? But another part of me would have really wanted her to stay. So of course i don't blow my top off and tell her off but I heavily hinted at my dislike for her choice.

The next day, when i was in a clearer state of mind, I told her that if she were to pursue her education overseas, I would still assist/help her whenever needed but I don't think the relationship would've continued.

So of course, she's absolutely devastated that I made such a selfish decision and remark but she decided to not go at that point in time.

Having said that, i know that what i said/did was beyond selfish and nothing short of being caring or thoughtful. I only wanted my best interests to be met.

Now I'm sorry if this entire post has been an incoherent mess or if it doesn't flow well but I've been an absolute mess this past week or so. I 100% fault myself for our separation and agree with her reasoning for leaving me.

I know that the problems stem from my attitude and outlook on life as a person, and that I only kept my best interests in mind based on what I've written here.

But i can't help but want to get back together with her. I know i fucked up real good and I'd really wish for nothing but another chance.

What should i do Reddit?

https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/70fklk/looking_for_some_honest_advice_about_my_future/
Howdy,

&amp;nbsp;

I'm fresh out of college (UIC) and I majored in graphic design. 25, male, heavily bearded. 


&amp;nbsp;


Something happened during my time studying design where I fell in love with creative advertising. Did a creative boot camp with leo Burnett and absolutely loved the atmosphere and scope of work. Combining my two passions seemed like the perfect career for me. 


&amp;nbsp;


My last year in college we worked with caterpillar for an internship and I loved leading a team through the full exploration of market research and prototyping. We made an app and a book, both of which I designed completely. (Only designer in a team of engineers)

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately I had to work through college to pay tuition and bills. However I worked as a manager for a detail shop, handling all customer relations and graphic work. I was the guy between the client and the staff as we worked on their vehicle. I took classes, I got certifications, and I learned the craft, all to further my skills in educating and speaking with the client.

&amp;nbsp;

I have absolutely no problem with client presentations, and leading a small team. 

&amp;nbsp;

....however I majored in graphic design, and NOT marketing. 

&amp;nbsp;

I spoke with my aunt who worked for ogilvy &amp; Mather for 8 years and showed her my resume and books I've created and she gave me some pointers for what to do, and said I have a great shot, but I'm still getting discouraged for some reason.

&amp;nbsp;

Simply put, I'm a graphic design major looking to begin a career in advertising. I am looking to begin as an assistant account executive or something of the nature to help me as I begin my career.  I want to make it clear to potential employers that while I have a creative degree background, I am a communication man at heart. 

&amp;nbsp;



So I guess what I'm asking is... am I asking too much? Is it far fetched for me to think I can get a job in this industry? Should I go back to school and get my masters? Just been applying like mad for the past month and I keep getting ignored or emails saying ""I was not chosen to continue"". Extremely discouraging not hearing anything back that's reasonable.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I'm located in Chicago, and absolutely love companies such as Leo Burnett, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, DDB, and Havas, the list goes on.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

Keep at it? &amp;nbsp;

Change my approach to the job search? &amp;nbsp;

Go to portfolio school? &amp;nbsp; 

Go to get my masters in advertising?


&amp;nbsp;


Edit:  So my current portfolio is mostly school work, which I don't like to show, and a series of about 3-4 books I've created over the past few years.  Also I have a linkedin and I've been making as many connections as possible, and following all the agencies that I find influential. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also I was looking into this student advertising career conference, but it's $85.  I feel like it's the right move but am i wasting my time? I'd like not to think so.

Me [24F] asked a guy I like [27M] to grab a drink after school (university). I never asked a guy out before, because most of the time the guy asks me out. 

He works at a place where I'm in internship. I don't see him often, because he only works when someone else is sick and I don't see him at school because he's in his last year.  

The first thing he asked me when we worked together was what my age is. After that, we had a convo about vacation and some hobbies that match (anime, manga, series). A colleague told me he is usually not that talkative about himself or doesn't show that kind of interest fast. 

I got his number after we had some conversations via FB-messenger. He asked me why I didn't text him via WhatsApp. And I replied with that I didn't got his number, so I gave him mine. When I post pictures of myself online, most of the time he likes them immediately. 

Til now I initiated contact via texting. He always replies and one day when he was at work and I wasn't there, he said ""Especially today you aren't here"". I don't know if I should take this messages as he's interested in me. Sometimes he stops texting while I asked him something before and he never replies to it. 

Yesterday I texted him when I was at school. I asked him if he also had lessons. He replied he didn't had them. I said something like: ""O too bad, I actually wanted to ask you to grab some coffee together"". He said ""oh chill, but no coffee. I don't like coffee"". I replied with ""then something else you'd like haha"". He then said ""that'd be fun, pick a date"".

The last message I sent were 3 dates (Sun, Thu afternoon, Fri afternoon) I'm available on. After that, I didn't receive any message from him. Why I didn't pick a date myself is I wanted him to take some initiative himself because I always started the conversations and asked him to grab a drink. 

What do you guys think? Is the guy ""not that interested"", is he toying with me or is he just that bad in texting? In my opinion I get mixed signals, but maybe I'm missing the hint. Should I ask him next week if he's still on it or just leave it like this? 

Thanks and sorry if the story isn't that clear to you. Please feel free to ask more questions and I'll try to explain myself as good as I can.

EDIT: Just spelling, grammar etc. 

EDIT 2: I will keep you updated!


**UPDATE**: Today, Tuesday the 19th, I sent him a text: 

""Do you want to meet up or not?""

Within 2 minutes he replied ""I forgot to answer. Maybe it's possible on Thursday"".

I replied with ""I'll hear from you"". 

Some friends of me said I'd to react more with ""I'll look forward to it"", but in my opinion it's ok to let him know I'm a bit annoyed by the fact he just 'forgot' it, he didn't even apologize. And I actually don't buy the 'maybe' either. So, we will see. If he don't reply after this, I'm done with it. I'll be disappointed in him that he can't even reject me as an adult, but hey, life goes on. My investment level goes down for now. "

Back story:
Vince wasn't one for the big city, despite being born in one. After living in a small town that resembled a few houses in a cornfield, he realized he wasn't one for the country either. Without any real motivation, he dropped out of college and made a fair living doing odd jobs in and around town, sometimes training to the larger towns nearby. Eventually he ended up moving to Chicago wig his sister, Zoe. She'd gotten accepted into an internship for working with computers or something, Vince didn't particularly care, as long as she paid rent. After a few months, he notice that his sister was spending abnormal amounts of time in front of her computer. ""Problems with out wifi, something is choking our bandwidth hardcore,"" she'd always say. He never thought much about it until his computer completely crashed. Unsure of what to do, he had his sister look at it. After several unsuccessful hours, she left for a smoke break. She's managed to get the screen running again, with the phrase ""Hello world"" across it.

""Sup, computer""

He thought he was a funny guy until it responded to him in turn.

""Are you Ready?""

Computers aren't supposed to do that, right?

""Yeah sure""

The computer shut down without a moment's notice, leaving Vince feeling as though he had broken it. Static appeared across the screen, And now he was sure it was toast. He shrugged and walked away, only to get hit by a wave of cool refreshing air.

She broke up with me and now doesnt want to give me the 150 for the tickets after previously offering to do so. Whos in the right?,mcbaginns,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70hj1r/i_24_m_bought_vip_concert_tickets_for_my_gfs_21f/,"In our relationship I paid for everything. We both live with our parents expense free and I have a full time job and she has an internship that doesnt pay. I admit I spoiled her, dinners, trips, concerts were the bulk of it, but I did it cause I wanted to. Money was hardly an object to me with her. I even lent her 80 bucks for something important when her dad wouldnt and her mom couldnt. I bought her a 150 drumset (that she never opened cause she was busy) for her bday and we went to disney for mine. I wired 50 dollars to her family while they were evacuating irma. Ive spent thousands.

Well she broke up with me while up away from irma for the week. She owes me 90 already(50 of which will be her moms money) and she mentioned that she will buy my tickets I bought for us a month ago.

These are VIP tickets to meet her favorite band. The one close to our house was sold out of VIP so I took two vacation days and surprised her with it. 8 hour round trip to get there but they wer VIP.

The day after the breakup, she asked me if I was going or if she should buy them from me. I said she could buy them. Then she proceeds to say how she doesnt have the money now and shes just gonna go to the close one alone because she couldnt stand to be in the same car as me for 8 hours, thus making me foot the bill. She got exceedingly hostile even though she is the one who brought it up. 

I never had a problem paying because she had an internship in her career, she wasnt a mooch or anything. But now that her internship pays (a little but it's something) I think its only fair she pays me the 150 it's really 185 but 150 is fine) for the tickets on top of the 90 she already owes me.

I think its inconsiderate that she wont pay me after she was the one who offered! I even proposed she pay me what she can, and that ill work with her on it. She flat out refused. I tried to get a refund but they wouldnt let me. I showed her and she ignored it. 

Our first date was about 120 dollars. Just one dinner and a movie. Ive spent thousands. And she cant even give me 150 out of a sign of respect or courtesy? Am I wrong here? Should I just say nvm and forgoe my stubborness? Its not even about the money as much as the principle. Does that make it even worse? Am I an asshole? I want to end on good terms but noe shes mad. Did I possibly say something in a rude way (I can be socially ignorant at times) that is causing this reaction or is she just mad because its all her spending money shed have to give me? Id show texts but I dont think your allowed.

So, I (straight-28m) am an incredibly busy adult student graduating this December (woo!), I am enrolling in a potentially two month, intensive, live-in yoga teacher training this spring that is more than a couple hours away, and then I have a dietetic internship potentially out on the opposite coast from me for 10 months in the fall.  I feel awful about getting involved with anyone right now with my life in such flux, but the profound lack of physical/emotional intimacy has taken a toll on my self esteem / general emotional well-being...  Sometimes you just want to feel sexy.

Now, I've had one night stands before, usually either stumbling out of a bar, or tinder hookups, but I usually wind up feeling less okay than I did before...  this usually gets split two ways, either my sex drive took over and I glazed over character flaws that I wouldn't have had I not been so hard up (this is another issue I'm working on), or a lack of communication allowed emotions/expectations to become unbalanced (this won't happen again).  Those issues aside, I'm not overwhelmingly interested in one night stands, I found that I really need time to warm up to people before I'm emotionally okay to sleep with someone.  However when I've talked with attractive single friends of mine about intimacy, it gets casually brushed off or flat out rejected.

Let me start off by admitting that I'm fairly new to dating experiences. The last time I dated someone was in high school around the age of 15 (I'm 23 now) for about a year and then we went our different ways. 

Fast forward to today, where I'm currently dating a guy and we've been together for almost half a year. We started dating at the end of the spring semester of school and spent a ton of time together over the summer, however, this fall semester is the complete opposite: we see each other very rarely. He's starting his PhD and I'm taking 22 credits while preparing for internship, which has somehow made our schedules incompatible to meet up for lunch/ coffee/ interacting in person during the week. In an attempt to spend time together, we try to set aside one day or night over the weekend to go eat somewhere or just hang out and this has worked just fine for me until yesterday.

We went on a date last night and then I slept over at his apartment, knowing that he had to leave early this morning for a performance that he is in. I was completely fine with what was going to happen until I got out of his car (heading back home) and said bye. I am totally sure it's because I missed him and would miss him while he's away, but I'm also kind of surprised at my reaction. He would be back by tonight, and it's not like I won't ever see him again.

I just kind of felt like rambling about my experience because this is fairly new to me. A part of me is worried that my friends or family will say I'm being to dramatic or clingy. I also don't want to this feeling to start happening every time we leave from our weekly meet ups. 

Is this something that happens to others? "

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

**Monday March 31, 2008**

An emergency session was announced earlier in the day. By good fortune, most of the Security Council was still lingering in Osea after deciding on Resolution 1917, which happened nine days ago. Holding the attention of the floor was a thin and balding African-American, who was wearing a light blue turtleneck and khaki chinos. He was Dr. David Hartmann, a member of the Usean Center for Nuclear Research (CURN), a developer and operator of Stonehenge, and also a well respected physics researcher from the Usean University of Engineering. He stood at a lectern that was set up in the center of the chambers, at the head of a table that was occupied by several key Security Council officials.

There was of course the Secretary-General, Mathias Overath. Sitting at his right was Lina Dietrich, the Osean ambassador to the IUN. At his left was Lord Alberto Lawrence, Dietrich's equivalent from Emmeria and a member of Emmeria's former royal family. Behind them, sitting at unoccupied seats in the first arch table were other representatives from IUNSC member nations and also Osean president Vincent Harling, FCU President Robert Sinclair, Erusean Princess Rosa Cosette D'Elise and Yuktobanian prime minister Seryozha Viktrovich Nikanor.

Looking at each familiar face made Hartmann more nervous than when he had initially come in. Feeling everyone's gaze on him, he took a sip of water from a glass on his lectern, scratched at his head and began to speak.

""Yesterday as you all know, the Large Hadron Collider began its beam collisions at 1:06 PM, Central Usean Summer Time. In the public eye, it was an event of little consequence. However, it had all of us at CURN and the scientific community at large apprehensive but also excited."" He took a moment to scan the chambers before continuing. 

""The media likes to make people think that we're going to cause the world to disappear into a black hole. For the most part, that theory is largely bunk. However,"" Hartmann wiped his forehead with a sleeve. ""An unexpected event did happen during the first collision.""

""What kind of event, Dr. Hartmann?"" Dietrich interjected.

""The collider had opened up a fissure in the ground within the ring. It was completely hollowed out. But what we saw within it was even more incredible than the presence of the fissure itself!""

""What was within this fissure, Dr. Hartmann?"" Dietrich asked.

""Space, Ambassador Dietrich.""

""Space,"" Dietrich maintained perfect control of her tone, while the rest of the Security Council seemed to deflate like a bicycle tire in surprise. ""Intriguing.""

""Understatement of the century, Lina."" Harling leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table, linking his fingers together. ""Was it populated space, David?""

""From a visual inspection, we could see at least one planet which appears to be Earth-like in its composition. You must understand sir, that we could only see with our naked eyes. We didn't dare to leave the ring for safety reasons. We didn't know how this fissure operates. It could have simply been a window that couldn't be breached. Worst case scenario was that it really was a breach.""

Harling seemed to take the news as if it were just another day in the office. ""What's the current status of this anomaly?""

""Gone. The collider has been completely shut down under the guise of maintenance, sir. We all agreed that it wasn't a good idea to leave such an anomaly in place without knowing how exactly it was created, or if it could even be controlled.""

""Do you have any theories at least?""

""There is one, but it's very thin.""

""Try me,"" Harling thinly smiled. Hartmann had the feeling that the president's eyes were boring through his skull. He had the complete attention of one of the most powerful people on the planet now, and it made Hartmann's hands sweat.

""We were testing several artifacts that were seconded to us by the Osean Air Defense Force. We were told that their presence at CURN was to be considered classified, along with their origin.""

Harling chuckled. ""You mean the Chaos Emeralds?""

""May I assume that the subject is now no longer classified, sir?""

""In the interest of science and my own curiosity, you certainly may."" Harling looked over at the Secretary General. ""Mr. Secretary, I have a very interesting story to share with you all, if I may address the Council. I'm sure a lot of you've wanted to hear it.""

The Belkan nodded. President Harling stood up in his seat and crossed around the table to stand beside Hartmann. ""My little story begins at Cranston in 1947.""

""Amusing,"" Nikanor murmured. Harling fixed his gaze on the Yuktobanian prime minister briefly.

""The official story has been that we recovered debris from an experimental aircraft. That kicked off the UFO craze and people have been trying to find out the truth about what we found ever since. The truth is, we didn't find the remains of a UFO. But the objects in question were extraterrestrial. Seven perfectly cut diamonds of various colors."" He made a fist and held it in the air. ""About this size. We call them Chaos Emeralds because ever since we found them, there were UFO sightings all over, sightings that had no basis.""

""Your military however said that these UFOs did not exist,"" Robert Sinclair interjected. ""Yet now you've sprung upon us the fact that you've found space diamonds. I'd say that they have a lot of basis now.""

Harling chuckled again. ""I'm speaking the plain and honest truth, Robert. We found nothing physical in the air, but there was something. The Air Force figured that they were optical illusions being created by these gems. They were originally called emeralds by the way, because they were green when they were found.""

""And the military was picking at them ever since,"" Hartmann cocked his head. ""They exhausted their capabilities for research, didn't they?""

""And their budget. I'm sorry to say that my predecessor's squandering of Mr. Howards' surplus in southern Belka was the main cause of that."" Harling replied coolly.

Hartmann swore lightly under his breath, shaking his head. ""The man was scouring for minerals and coal while he had the key to infinite power locked away in Bennion.""

Harling patted Hartmann's shoulder. ""I'm glad I made the right decision to send them to CURN. This has to be the most monumental scientific discovery since the bomb."" Hartmann could see that Harling was getting visibly excited, with his smile widening. He made a fist and smacked into the open palm of his other hand. ""Do you understand what this means? This is a major opportunity for multi-discipline investment. It could trigger a global economic stimulus.""

The Erusean princess harshly laughed. ""And where would we get the capital in order to make these investments? In fact, how do you plan to convince your own administration? Your military says you're cutting corners as it is.""

""I intend to meet with several reputable investors in order to provoke interest in investment. In fact,"" Harling looked over at one of the interns that accompanied him. ""Zimmermann, please see to it that the following people are brought to Bright Hill by the time that I get back to Oured.""

The intern pulled out his Blackberry smartphone and brought up a note application. ""I'm ready when you are, sir.""

Harling provided a list of the most intellectual and powerful Osean investors and businessmen before flashing the intern his news conference smile. ""But let's phase this in slowly. We'll start declassifying the military's records and research, make it accessible to the public."" Harling looked over at Hartmann. ""As for you, I'm going to put you in charge of a special advisory council."" He lowered his voice. ""If I can secure the funding, we'll see about reproducing this anomaly in a safe zone.""

""With all due respect, sir."" Hartmann leaned in close to the president's ear. ""The only safe place would most likely be in space.""

Harling shrugged. ""Let it be space, Dave.""

Although recruiting for winter is just beginning at my university, I have already received an enticing offer from a big bank to join their Corporate Audit program.

Now, I know this subreddit is all about Big4, and public accounting in general. I, too, kept pushing for Big4 or a mid-sized. And so far it's looking good (Crowe and RSM are both interested in me), but no concrete offer so far, since recruiting hasn't *technically* started.

Now the Corporate Audit offer is a good one in terms of salary, benefits, and networking opportunities *within* the company. However, I can't help but feel that I'm pigeonholing myself. To me, salary and benefits come second to opportunity for growth, learning opportunities, and exit opportunities.

To make things even more dicey, I only have so much time left to decide (until next weekend). I even thought about accepting and then waiting to see if something better comes along. But when you compare a full-time w benefits vs an internship by a mid-sized... I am left thinking whether I'd make the right decision.

I'll appreciate all serious help and insights!"

While I must be honest I do not do Crossfit... I was in the hospital with severe Rhabdomyolysis and every nurse in the ER asked me, ""Oh, you're here for Rhabdo? Was it spin class or Crossfit?"" and I in fact got it from spin class. I have found plenty of posts about Rhabdo on here but just feel like after suffering through it, I have to help spread awareness because if I can help one person not go through this, well then this was worth it! I have never heard of anything like this before I was diagnosed myself.

Below is my experience with Rhabdo if you are interested in reading but just please everyone, listen to your bodies, pay attention to your urine, drink lots of water and take the time to recover!
-----


i decided to work out and that class was one of the worst decisions of my life lol i went to a spin class (monday) and haven't worked out in awhillllleee and was probably not as hydrated as i should of been.. NO one asked me if it was my first time or around to help me set up.. which i didn't even know you had to do -__-

after 15-20 min of the class i felt DONE like my body was exhausted and i actually txted my mom saying i hate this haha but felt like a loser because i couldn't keep up with the instructor so kept pushing myself and trying for the rest of the class, about 25 more minutes

i went with a girl from work. that day i did NOT wanna go, i just wasn't feeling it after all but she kept insisting that i'd like it lol i was like honestly i feel like wasting $12 and she was like noooo come!!! if she wasn't there in the class with me i would of walked out of there after the 15 min. i even told her that when the class was over lol i was like this is not for me

after the class i could not put any weight on my right leg whatsoever. couldn't go down stairs. like my knee would buckle every time i tried to walk. when i got home i was like seriously i can't walk! it was crazy swollen. i somehow slept thru it and went to work the next day (tuesday) only because we had interns coming in for interviews. i would of called out if we didn't

after work i kept telling my boyfriend i thought there was something wrong with my leg. i wasn't limping yet but it felt like more than a pulled muscle. he was like oh no you just haven't worked out in awhile and you forgot what a pulled muscle feels like. i was like no.. i know what that feels like i am in serious pain. that night i woke up crying because i was in so much pain, and when i woke up my boyfriend when i did, he told me to go to minute clinic tomorrow morning instead of work and he rubbed my leg until i fell back asleep

i woke up (wednesday and also now limping) and my urine was like daaaaark brown (i can attach a picture if anyone is curious haha) and i remember thinking, ""wow i need to drink water! i must be dehydrated"" so i noticed that my urine was dark but didn't necessarily think anything about it. but then still in so much pain i managed to get to the minute clinic when it opened and the doctor told me to stay home and ice it and lastly asks me, ""oh what color is your urine?"" and, surprised she asked, i told her, actually, its really dark brown and she said if that didn't change by the end of the day to go to the ER.. this is when i started to get concerned (im addition to water saving my life - this minute clinic doctor asking me this one question did too)

the next time i peed when i was home it was still really dark brown and red and i sent a pic to my boyfriend and he was like wow okay that is dark and he started to go down the crazy spiral that is webmd. i didn't bother because i was scared anyway. after awhile he txted me saying he wanted to go to the ER after dinner. then i started googling and asked him if he thought rhabdo and he said yes

by the time we were ready to go, i was in and out of passing out on the couch because my leg hurt so bad. my boyfriend finally convinced me to get in the car. i was so depleted i didn't even want to go anymore. the first ER we went to close by told me it would be a SIX!!!!! hour wait.. when we got outside i started crying that we should either call an ambulance so they take me right now and go home haha he said no we're going to MGH (Massachusetts general hospital) which is pretty much the best hospital on the east coast, probably the country and maybe the world. they are AMAZING and saved my life

when we got there (i live about 20 min north of the city) it was around 10PM and they took me right in with my symptoms. they had me pee in a cup before my boyfriend was even able to park the car. my urine was RED like i poured kool-aid into the cup (which i also have a photo of if anyone would like to see haha). they pretty much put me on an IV right after they took my blood. they told me if i have rhabdo i will definitely be hospitalized - how long depending on how bad.

so rhabdomyolysis occurs when you damage a muscle so badly, the muscle begins to break down and a protein starts leaking into your blood stream. they measure it by something called CK, creatine kinase. a normal persons levels are under 200... someone who gets diagnosed with rhabdo has around 10,000.... my levels were at 100,000!!!!!! they tested my blood three times before they told me because they couldn't believe it. the reason it affects your kidneys is because they are like a strainer and the CK in the blood clogs it up and the kidneys can't do their job filtering your blood. so i was a hot mess. its apparently super rare but with the rise of high intensity work outs its becoming super common. when all the nurses in the ER were asking me oh you have rhabdo? spin or crossfit? i was like WTF how does no one know about this??

i went through 2 bags of fluids while waiting for a spot out of the waiting area im the ER. i had to ask them for a stretcher because it was too painful to sit in a chair with my knee bent. then i got a lil room in the ER with privacy. they started taking my blood every 6 hours and i was going thru a bag of fluids every 1-1.5 hours. i was urinating every 45 min to an hour in a bucket that had measurements on it so the nurses could record the color and how much i went each time. i was visited and rolled to a bunch of doctors every 2 hours. i was always beeping lol i didn't sleep for the 5 days i was in the hospital because i was being poked every time i closed my eyes. i was only in the curtain room for no more than 24 hours until i got my own

my levels went up to 140k before they started to go down. they finally went down twice consistently friday night so saturday AM they took me off the fluids to see if i could hydrate enough on my own for them to go down and they did!!!! i went home sunday morning.

it was a crazy experience. rhabdo could also give you serious abdominal pain and nausea but thank the lord i didn't so my appetite was fine the entire time:) that kept me going lol my boyfriend stayed with me in the ER until 2 am the first night. stayed with me every day he could and visited during his lunch. my mom was already planning to fly to boston to visit that weekend in so that worked out cause a girl still needs her mom!!

but its crazy that i actually almost died. they told me if i waited another day my kidneys would have gone into failure and i would of been on dialysis. my liver could of been affected. they couldn't give me much pain meds because it all goes through your kidney and liver. i was at risk for blood clots and compartment syndrome because of my leg. compartment syndrome happens when the body part is so swollen it cuts off circulation pretty much so i was checked my a surgeon every 5 hours in case of emergency surgery to help the pressure. it was insane. thank god my boyfriend brought me. i could of even been in trouble waiting those 6 hours at the other hospital. its the first time i'm glad he didn't listen to me haha! but being that out of commission and having the only thing to be done was fluids was frustrating but also so crazy how WATER saved my life. i mean i needed more than i could ever drink on my own lol but omg always listen to your body, look at your pee and drink water!!!!!!! seriously water fixes EVERYTHING.

but after 5 days in the hospital i am doing so well!!!! i was released august 27 and now its september 17 so we are almost a month out. i feel great! i am almost 100% - even though i am not there yet, i will be making a full recovery with no internal organ damage!!

thanks for reading and i hope i helped you or helped you help someone! i could tell pretty immediately that my injury was serious and that something was wrong so don't second guess yourself! trust your gut! life is too short and like i said if i waited one more day to go to the ER i would of have a different story

this happening to me has brought up stories from friends who also had rhabdo and their stories weren't as light as mine. my boyfriend's boss said that his friend passed away in his home when they were young because of rhabdo and him just thinking he had a pulled muscle.

thanks for letting me share!

How to refinance/what to do?,extasph5,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/70lyyv/graduating_this_year_with_student_debt_how_to/,"throwaway here. Overall, I think I'm in OK shape, but I'm seeking some advice about what to do with my student loans and grad school.

I'm finishing a CS degree at a well-regarded school, and I've taken a tech job near San Francisco after I graduate (1 year from now) which pays quite well ($120k). All roses! However, to pay for my degree, I took out quite a lot of student debt. I have $88k in debt:

$5k @ 4.7% (stafford), $7k @ 4.2% (stafford), $7k @ 3.8% (stafford), $30k @ 10.7% (private), $20k @ 7% (private), $19k @ 7% (private)

I've been throwing money at them from internships and part-time work, but it hasn't made much of a dent in the principal.

I wouldn't be so worried, except the cost of living in the bay area is upwards of $1500/month, for even the most modest space (aka 5-6 housemates). Combined with the potentially $1k/month loan payment + any hope of saving for a house + transportation (screw Caltrain), I'm worried.

Questions:

-How do I refinance the garbage 10% interest rate? Should I try to consolidate all the loans? Where do I even begin with this?

-Is it wise to try to save for a house, or should I focus on paying these down as fast as possible? Houses are uber-expensive here.

-I really might want to go back to grad school (law school, perhaps) in a few (2-3) years, which is potentially slightly lower paying. How should I plan to make this financially viable? Obviously, this means saving money for grad school, in addition to dealing with the debt shrewdly.

Just watched the latest episode

I'm just sick of deku letting Bakugo walk over him - understandably he [deku] didn't have a quirk most of his life, and was more or less powerless - but given his recent improvements/training with the internship, he has a lot more authority. He never seems to stand up for himself and let's bakugo say/do whatever he wants. I just really hope for their fight against All Might he can slap some sense into Bakugo.

I haven't read the manga (which is weird because I always read the manga for just about any series, but I really really like this anime and don't want to spoil it.) - not sure how I feel about the nartuo/sasuke vibe. I guess it would be cool to see him turn to the villain association, then have some sort of cathartic fight between the two where bakugo is finally humbled, but that seems too cliche/predictable.

Anyone else feel the same way? Averse? "

1) You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.

2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower.

3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”.

4) A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…

5) Private tutoring for a young girl

6) You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something…. For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character.

If you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!

70ns49,10,2017-09-17,[Event] US General election 2032,_iordin,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/70ns49/event_us_general_election_2032/,"[M] Long post, there's a TL;DR at the bottom if you don't want to read it all [/M]  
  
The last few years have been a very turbulent period for American politics, with parties fragmenting as well as the election and impeachment of a mentally unstable and possibly insane president. It didn't come as a surprise to anyone that the political landscape had shifted significantly following the removal of president John Reed, as [polling data](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/6wbuoa/eventstate_of_american_politics_end_of_2029/) from the end of 2029 showed that the support for the Green Party had fallen drastically and that right-leaning parties were more popular than ever. The Traditionalists are now the largest party by far and are likely to do well in the presidential election, but because of their lack of support from the far-right and left side of the political spectrum as well as their reluctance to cooperate and compromise with other parties in Congress it is going to be very difficult for them to get any form of legislature passed unless they get a majority in both houses, which is extremely unlikely in the case of the House of Representatives, and actually impossible when it comes to the Senate. Their only other option would be to cooperate with other right-wing parties, specifically the Neoconservatives, Constitutionalists, and Rockefellers. These parties (with the exception of the Rockefellers) are however much farther right, and any form of compromise with them is likely to put off many moderates and pretty much all liberals. All in all, it looks like Washington is going to be a lot more conservative after the elections, but if the right is going to be able to actually accomplish anything is going to come down to their willingness to compromise and cooperate.  
  
**HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES**  
  
Pretty much every conservative party was expected to gain seats in this election, while the Green and Democratic parties were expected to lose support. These predictions were largely correct, but the Democrats didn't lose nearly as many seats as some had predicted and the party is still the second largest. At the end of the day though, the House is dominated by moderates and conservatives with the Traditionalists as the strongest party by far.  
  
*Results*  
  
Party | Number of seats
-|-|-
The Traditionalists | 87
The Democratic party | 69
The Green party | 52
The Neoconservative party | 52
The Rockefellers | 48
The Constitutionalist party | 47
The NRFA | 32
The GOP | 26
The ACR | 22
*Total*| *435*
  
*Possible Coalitions*
  
Traditionalists + Neoconservatives + Rockefellers + Constitutionalists =  
87 + 52 + 48 + 47 = **234**  
  
**SENATE**  
  
The results of the Senate elections were quite similar to those of the House, but the left wing manages to hold on to more power than in the House. The Rockefellers also secured a larger amount of seats than most predicted. The Greens and the Democrats could possibly cooperate with the Rockefellers in social matters and The Neocons in fiscal ones, as those parties have more moderate views when it comes to social and economic issues respectively. Another (albeit unlikely) alternative would be a center-left coalition between the Democrats, Greens, and Rockefellers which could, in theory, halt some of the more extreme right-wing legislatures, but this scenario does not seem very likely in the current political landscape.  
  
*Results*  
  
Party | Number of seats
-|-|-
The Traditionalists | 20
The Democratic party | 19
The Green party | 18
The Rockefellers | 13
The Constitutionalist party | 11
The Neoconservative Party | 11
The NRFA | 3
The GOP | 2
The ACR | 2
*Total*| *100*
  
*Possible Coalitions*  
Traditionalists + Rockefellers + Constitutionalists + Neoconservatives =   
20 + 12 + 11 + 11 = **54**  
  
Democrats + Green Party + Rockefellers =  
19 + 18 + 13 = **50**
  
**THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION**  
  
Because of the failed Reed presidency and the peoples wavering trust in the Democratic party, most experts agreed that the next president would be either a Traditionalist or a Neoconservative. But several scandals and revelations made the outcome of this very consequential election increasingly difficult to predict. As election day approached some even talked about the possibility of the Democratic nominee winning the race.  
  
*The Candidates*  
  
**The Traditionalists: Jeff Flake**  
After many discussions and debates, the Traditionalist party finally decided to once again put their trust in former president Jeff Flake, who was a relatively popular president but lost his first attempt at reelection in 2028 to John Reed. Flake is likely to attract young and moderate voters but is unpopular among older far-right supporters and progressives.  
  
**The Neoconservatives/Constitutionalists: Cory Gardner**  
As a former congressman and former member of the Republican Leadership Cory Gardner had a lot going for him in the early days of his campaign. But after it was revealed that he'd had several affairs with Capitol employees and interns his popularity dropped drastically, and most of his supporters jumped ship to either the Traditionalists or the Rockefellers. The supporters he has left are mostly working-class white men.  
  
**The Democratic Party: Maria Cantwell**  
Since many attributed Bob Buckham's defeat in the 2028 election to him being too moderate the Democrats nominated the staunchly progressive Maria Cantwell, a former senator from Washington. Cantwell is a strong advocate for women's and LGBT rights, as well as a vocal supporter of single-payer healthcare. Cantwell is unsurprisingly very popular among women and minorities but has been criticised for being naive and having unrealistic plans for the country.  
  
**The Green Party: Gordon Fremantle**  
Many people actually thought that Fremantle's candidacy was a joke when he announced that he would run for office. Green party leaders later explained that he was the only one who actually wanted the nomination, as pretty much all prominent Green Party members left when Reed was impeached and removed from office. Most of Fremantle's sympathizers are likely to vote for Cantwell mostly because they don't want to be associated with a symbol of a disastrous administration that most progressives would rather forget.  
  
**The Rockefellers: Kim Reynolds**  
The former governor of Iowa Kim Reynolds became the Rockefellers nominee after months of deliberation. She was criticised by her own party for being too liberal and is hated by evangelists due to her open atheism. However, her experience and economic expertise managed to carry her to victory over her rivals within the party. Reynolds is fiscally moderate, but relatively liberal when it comes to social issues. She is popular among younger conservatives and women, while still appealing to the white upper-class.  
  
The GOP, NFRA, and ACR did not have any official nominees.  
  
*The Results*  
  
On the second of November the Ameican people gathered around any screen they could find to watch how the election unfolded. One by one the results from each state were announced, and it became clear very early that this election was going to be a very close race. Cantwell took the lead early with the support of the Northeast voters but was dethroned by Flake once the results from the South were announced. Cantwell took the lead once again when the Midwest results came in, but Flakes supporters in the northern states evened out the race. Reynolds had been climbing slowly throughout the night, and by 2 AM she was right behind Cantwell. It became clear that the west coast would decide this election, which was bad news for Flake who was passed by both Cantwell and Reynolds once the results from Washington and Oregon had been announced. Nevada liked Reynolds, New Mexico liked Cantwell, and by 4 AM it was just California left, with Cantwell holding on to a small lead. The whole nation waited in suspense for the results to be revealed, and when they were it became clear that Reynolds had defeated Cantwell by less than five thousand votes. Kim Reynolds would be the next president of the USA.  
  
TL;DR: The right has a majority in both the House and the Senate, and Kim Reynolds, a moderate Rockefeller was elected president."

70ocot,3,2017-09-17,Girlfriend (22) frustrated with boyfriend (23) who is very controlling and inconsiderate.,ladidathrowaway1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/70ocot/girlfriend_22_frustrated_with_boyfriend_23_who_is/,"Hi, I am a 22 year old MTF transgender woman who is in a relationship with a 23 year old male and we have been dating for two years. 

I am going to try to make this post as concise as I can, so bear with me. 

We have had mostly the same issues for the entire duration of our relationship. Issue #1 being openness. My boyfriend grew up in a religious LDS (Mormon) household, and while he is not religious, most of his immediate family is still pretty invested in the LDS church. This has obviously caused some contention with us, and I have tried my best to be understanding about his insecurities and anxieties about being with a trans person, but after two years its very hard for me to continue to do so. For example, he has asked me to marry him multiple times probably once a month for the last year, and  I am very conflicted about my answer. For one thing, we’re both still very young, but the larger issue in my eyes is that he has never been open with any of his family (or friends except one friend) about our relationship. If it ever comes up he will immediately downplay it saying something along the lines of “Oh she’s just a really good friend”, he has even told people that I’m just his personal assistant. In the beginning, I was understanding about this, but after two years I personally can no longer accept the excuse of anxiety. For one thing, I spend A LOT of time at his house with his family and have spent Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter with them, as well as other minor holidays like New Years and Fourth of July. For my birthday he gave me a necklace that he made and I wear it often, and both of his parents know that the necklace was a homemade gift from my boyfriend. In my eyes, they can’t NOT know, and my boyfriend’s father has even made it clear to me through conversations and jokes that he realizes we are in a romantic relationship. However, even though my boyfriend knows this and accepts that his parents most likely know we are dating (I mean, his parents are NOT dumb. They have PhDs), he refuses to confront the subject head on. Even when we are in an environment that we know is accepting, he still refuses to do things like hold my hand.

Issue #2, control. My boyfriend is very controlling over my time. At first, I was genuinely okay with that behavior, but now I feel that I was only okay with it because of my low self esteem which I was experiencing at the time. Its so bad that I don’t even have a job because he cannot deal with the idea of me working 20-25 hours a week and instead mostly rely on him for money, which is something I really don’t want to do. If I am not at his house and/or just with him in general at least six days a week he becomes very upset with me, and his tantrums are so annoying to deal with that I have only seen my best friends who I’ve known since childhood once in 2017, even though they only live 20 minutes from my house. When we are actually apart and communicating via text, he’ll will call multiple times, send multiple texts in rapid succession and get very angry with me if I don’t respond in about 3 minutes or less (I’ve noticed a pattern), yet he will just stop responding mid-conversation, sometimes for hours and act like its not a big deal. I also barely get to spend any time with my family either. In October of this year, I will be starting graduate school and I am very fearful over how he will react to that based on how he acted while I was getting my bachelors degree. I have confronted him over this behavior multiple times, even accusing him of using me as an emotional crutch, and he just flat out admitted to it. He admitted that he knew it was unfair but he just couldn’t stop himself. We agreed to work on it, but in my opinion, he hasn’t changed at all. 

Issue #3, respect/empathy. In case it wasn’t obvious, he does not have as much respect for me as he claims to have. He frequently belittles things which I like to do or find interesting… calling my college degree in History useless and a “eunuch degree”, as well as my time spent interning and writing things related to my degree. I have even been offered internships which I have turned down because when I told him about it, he has gotten unnecessarily angry about it. He also refuses to spend time with my friends/family because “he doesn’t like them” even though I spend a lot of my time with his friends and family. He is not open about our relationship to ANYONE, yet expects everyone I know to know that I am in a relationship with him. For example, he will not change his facebook from single to in a relationship but expects me to do so. Another example would be that one of the medications I’m on related to me being transgender is spironolactone which I have to take twice a day. This drug causes drowsiness so when I take it at night I usually fall asleep shortly after. He likes to hold me personally responsible for this even though his dad is a doctor and my boyfriend himself has worked in medical offices so he obviously knows I’m not lying about the side effects. And honestly I could go on and on, but I feel like you reading this get the point. 

I understand that not all relationships are perfect, and I am willing to admit my faults and actively try to work on them, which I feel I have done these past few years. I don’t want to abandon a relationship just because it isn’t perfect, but I feel like I have done my best to be understanding yet there never seems to be a change no matter how much I talk about the things that bother me to my boyfriend. I feel like most other people would have left him by now, but I feel extremely guilty when I think about breaking up with him. I'm pretty sure I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship."
70oiqn,571,2017-09-17,Three Lessons from an Investment Banking Career for your Professional and Personal Lives,sx2eck,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/70oiqn/three_lessons_from_an_investment_banking_career/,"**Intro**

I have spent the last decade working in NYC in one of the most competitive and demanding career paths on the planet. My experience, the people, and my mentors have taught me a few invaluable lessons that I want the present and future generations of boys and men to learn earlier rather than later. Each of these lessons will apply first in its context (my/your job) and second as a corollary to personal life. These are the 101, and a good starting point. 

**The Lessons**

**Be present**

* Your reputation is defined primarily by the quantity of people who can say ""Yes, I know him"" neutrally or better when asked

A common mistake first year analysts make is over-investing in their ""desk"" leadership i.e. their immediate bosses and group heads. While having a core support group (at least 3 mid-senior leaders and 1-2 senior leaders) is important, optionality in your career is derived from broad awareness of *you*. 

Build this presence *indirectly* as a young employee by creating miniature personal connections as opportunities are thrust upon you. This means when your boss assigns you to a one-off task with an unfamiliar team, do not complete the task without a warm connection to a senior person on that team. As a junior there is no expectation to source your own work, only to source your own brand; as you are able assess the ""quality"" of the people you're introduced to, invest accordingly. People strongly bias recency - be recent, even if the recency is mundane. 

*Corollary:* Don't over-invest in your immediate circle of friends, and especially not your romantic partners (present or potential). You will draw power and charisma from the quantity of those who tolerate or appreciate your presence. Do not prioritize ""quality"" until you are able to define it for yourself, and recognize it in others.

**Be different - but only enough to differentiate**

* In order to beat the pack vying for advancement, you must have (in addition to whatever merits competence in your actual work) an indescribable edge. 

This is a dangerous but necessary step if you have ambition that exceeds a basic career track in your field. A harsh reality is that the majority of the people I have worked with are objectively smarter, more pragmatic, and better planners than 97.5% of the population. A harsher reality is that superficial traits are as valuable to this 2.5% as the rest. However, your differentiation must be mostly positive. We can all recall more than one classmate or co-worker who was unabashedly different, and unashamed of that difference. We can also separate them into two classes - abrasive and interesting. Be the latter.

For me, it was my style of dress. I made a habit of wearing [pink windowpane suits](https://imgur.com/a/sTmA) and other fashion that was otherwise entirely anathema to the so called Wall Street Dress Code. Why did this work for me? First, it sent a subconscious message that I was bold in my choices; second, I never apologized or equivocated in the face of criticism. I distinctly recall a senior VP who later became a close contact tell that when he first saw that particular suit, he though, ""Who the fuck is that?"" Despite his internal negative reaction, it *made him curious*. Find your difference and inspire curiosity. 

*Corollary:* While I can't prescribe you the method, this playground trick works everywhere, on everyone. My dress style works in both social and professional circles. I have seen affable positivity work for some, carefully measured comedy work for others. Find one that does the same for you.

**The political cycle - hitch your wagon to the correct person**


* As an entry-level employee, you are *shielded* from office politics. As a mid-level employee who does not yet make decisions, you must be *aware* of the politics. A decision maker must be *involved* in the politics. 

A junior analyst, first year law associate, or young engineer must put his head down and produce good work. Mastery of the things you perceive to be bitch work are the foundation of respect from your superiors. Nobody on Wall Street became CEO because of their Excel financial modeling skills, but none would understand what it actually means to be an M&amp;A banker without those skills. On the other hand, people know the analyst who is always a little too curious about what's going on in that meeting he wasn't invited to (because nobody below VP was anyway...). 

An IB associate, however, should be keeping score. Is your direct manager's view winning out when your group comes to the table? Does your desk have a strong or weak voice when there is contention among internal parties? Again, this associate has no involvement in the charade, but must be aware of the momentum. The purpose of this is to pick your own winner. 

There is no value in loyalty to a profession or product. Mortgage trading was a great game from 1997-2007, but only a foolish 22-28 year old would have stuck around after. By paying attention to who is winning and losing, a non-decision maker maximizes the chance that his early decision making days are already with the winners. Remember, until you're calling the shots, you are just along for the ride. Exit gracefully if you perceive that wagon is headed off a cliff. Hold on tightly if it is moving onward and upward.

*Corollary:* In any social hierarchy, there is an obvious superior group *in each setting*. Only denial can lead to a different conclusion. In school, the superior group is more plainly visible and easy to define - this group is hitting the milestones of early life sooner (relationships, sex, academic/sports victories, prestigious summer internships). After school, superior groups are judged on a relative basis, but nonetheless exist. An aspirant man's goal should be to find his place in this group.

Fortunately, a man can determine for himself how to reach his goal. This provides freedom to choose, but not freedom from social politics. A man can only ""shield"" himself from social politics by not participating at all. While there are ideologies that can support such a lifestyle, TRP is not one of them. A man's choice socially is to lead (be involved) or to follow (be aware). Neither of these are a better or a worse thing - they are each simply a thing. Decide if you are suited to lead - if not, be aware and follow those who you deem fit. 

**Conclusion/tl;dr**

Be present so that you may be relevant; prioritize quantity over quality in your relationships until you are able to define quality for yourself. 

Be different without apology, but that difference must not be disruptive. 

After your social or professional infancy, your shield from the politics is gone; be aware of the game and keep score of winners and losers. When the time comes, choose to lead and become involved in the politics, or choose to follow and hone your awareness.

70pkq3,3,2017-09-17,IT Volunteer Opportunities,boycat,volunteer,https://www.reddit.com/r/volunteer/comments/70pkq3/it_volunteer_opportunities/,"Hi all,
I'm interested in volunteering my IT resources for charitable benefit. 

All I can seem to find in my searches for this nature of work are either geared to benefit an employer and transition into a potential for-hire position (i.e.: day job, etc) or are internships. 

I've also looked at a TON (more than 20) large organizations which do charity/benefit work.. Remote Area Medical, DWB, etc. Either they're looking for ""discrete medical talent"" or ""other"" .. and the ""other"" seems to bucket everyone into a ""general support"" group which is nondescript.

I'm really interested in using my skills to benefit others in a charitable way, but at the same time don't want to ""end up directing traffic or stuffing envelopes."" Without a medical background, it appears as though there's really no ""need"" for IT talent on a volunteer basis - is this really the case? 

I can think of many, many areas that are remote and which would benefit from temporary communication installations, or just mainland support of remote / distributed efforts... yet, none of these opportunities seem AT ALL easy to find when searching for such an opportunity to serve.

Any ideas out there? Are there ""clearing houses"" for specific-detail opportunities in the volunteer arena? 

I just want to use my skills and offer a meaningful benefit, and not be assigned to distributing cups of coffee or lemonade from a relief wagon somewhere. 

Thanks all--"
70pzev,9,2017-09-17,Thinking of leaving my boyfriend (x-post r/relationship_advice,ladidathrowaway1,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/70pzev/thinking_of_leaving_my_boyfriend_xpost/,"Hi, I am a 22 year old MTF transgender woman who is in a relationship with a 23 year old male and we have been dating for two years.

I am going to try to make this post as concise as I can, so bear with me.

We have had mostly the same issues for the entire duration of our relationship. Issue #1 being openness. My boyfriend grew up in a religious LDS (Mormon) household, and while he is not religious, most of his immediate family is still pretty invested in the LDS church. This has obviously caused some contention with us, and I have tried my best to be understanding about his insecurities and anxieties about being with a trans person, but after two years its very hard for me to continue to do so. For example, he has asked me to marry him multiple times probably once a month for the last year, and I am very conflicted about my answer. For one thing, we’re both still very young, but the larger issue in my eyes is that he has never been open with any of his family (or friends except one friend) about our relationship. If it ever comes up he will immediately downplay it saying something along the lines of “Oh she’s just a really good friend”, he has even told people that I’m just his personal assistant. In the beginning, I was understanding about this, but after two years I personally can no longer accept the excuse of anxiety. For one thing, I spend A LOT of time at his house with his family and have spent Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter with them, as well as other minor holidays like New Years and Fourth of July. For my birthday he gave me a necklace that he made and I wear it often, and both of his parents know that the necklace was a homemade gift from my boyfriend. In my eyes, they can’t NOT know, and my boyfriend’s father has even made it clear to me through conversations and jokes that he realizes we are in a romantic relationship. However, even though my boyfriend knows this and accepts that his parents most likely know we are dating (I mean, his parents are NOT dumb. They have PhDs), he refuses to confront the subject head on. Even when we are in an environment that we know is accepting, he still refuses to do things like hold my hand.

Issue #2, control. My boyfriend is very controlling over my time. At first, I was genuinely okay with that behavior, but now I feel that I was only okay with it because of my low self esteem which I was experiencing at the time. Its so bad that I don’t even have a job because he cannot deal with the idea of me working 20-25 hours a week and instead mostly rely on him for money, which is something I really don’t want to do. If I am not at his house and/or just with him in general at least six days a week he becomes very upset with me, and his tantrums are so annoying to deal with that I have only seen my best friends who I’ve known since childhood once in 2017, even though they only live 20 minutes from my house. When we are actually apart and communicating via text, he’ll will call multiple times, send multiple texts in rapid succession and get very angry with me if I don’t respond in about 3 minutes or less (I’ve noticed a pattern), yet he will just stop responding mid-conversation, sometimes for hours and act like its not a big deal. I also barely get to spend any time with my family either. In October of this year, I will be starting graduate school and I am very fearful over how he will react to that based on how he acted while I was getting my bachelors degree. I have confronted him over this behavior multiple times, even accusing him of using me as an emotional crutch, and he just flat out admitted to it. He admitted that he knew it was unfair but he just couldn’t stop himself. We agreed to work on it, but in my opinion, he hasn’t changed at all.

Issue #3, respect/empathy. In case it wasn’t obvious, he does not have as much respect for me as he claims to have. He frequently belittles things which I like to do or find interesting… calling my college degree in History useless and a “eunuch degree”, as well as my time spent interning and writing things related to my degree. I have even been offered internships which I have turned down because when I told him about it, he has gotten unnecessarily angry about it. He also refuses to spend time with my friends/family because “he doesn’t like them” even though I spend a lot of my time with his friends and family. He is not open about our relationship to ANYONE, yet expects everyone I know to know that I am in a relationship with him. For example, he will not change his facebook from single to in a relationship but expects me to do so. Another example would be that one of the medications I’m on related to me being transgender is spironolactone which I have to take twice a day. This drug causes drowsiness so when I take it at night I usually fall asleep shortly after. He likes to hold me personally responsible for this even though his dad is a doctor and my boyfriend himself has worked in medical offices so he obviously knows I’m not lying about the side effects. And honestly I could go on and on, but I feel like you reading this get the point.

I understand that not all relationships are perfect, and I am willing to admit my faults and actively try to work on them, which I feel I have done these past few years. I don’t want to abandon a relationship just because it isn’t perfect, but I feel like I have done my best to be understanding yet there never seems to be a change no matter how much I talk about the things that bother me to my boyfriend. I feel like most other people would have left him by now, but I feel extremely guilty when I think about breaking up with him. I think what's stopping me is that this person was the first person to actually make me feel worthy in a romantic/sexual type of way and I'm scared of losing that. How have others dealt with feeling like that?

70qrdt,1,2017-09-17,I [22M] don't understand why my friend [19F] barely talks with me.,thefrooh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70qrdt/i_22m_dont_understand_why_my_friend_19f_barely/,"First, to clarify things: I'm single, she's not, but I never wanted more from her, but her friendship, I'm not ready to have a relationship in my current state.

We used to be colleagues, where she became an intern in 2016 september, we slowly began to develop this friendship, which is..or at least was really great until 3 weeks ago. Up until then, we used to talk daily at least 16 hours, sharing a lot of stuff. Ever since I know her, she has a boyfriend, who was always jealous at me, but she said for me not to care about him, their relationship is a topic I avoided always, because I didn't wanted to ruin anything between them, and it's none of my business anyways. She had gone through rough events last year; ugly divorce of parents because of cheating, then mother's depression, ovarian cyst removal, and lots and lots of others. She was full of these things, and had nobody to talk to, since her boyfriend is kind of ignorant when it comes to topics like these, he's always been protected by mom and dad, thus not a big help in any of these.

Unlike me. She talked about these things to me back in february during a company drinking, she got a bit of Dutch courage, opened up her soul, and told me everything, including that she's desperately in need of someone to talk to. So we talked all night long, and ever since we were chatting for at least 12 hours a day, meeting once or twice a week (I quit my job because of another one). I'm usually a cold person on the outside, been through things (abuse, cheating golddigger ex, bipolar depression, cancer, etc..), and I developed this ""shield"" just to make sure it's harder to hit me in the future, and honestly it works. The inner me is a nature-lover, hobby astronomist, aviation fan, and truly caring for others, more than for myself. I decided to show the inner me to her, which she really appreciated. 

I can say that I really changed her, or at least she's not worrying constantly about everything, but enjoying the beauty and perfection around. E.g. before I took her to a hiking in the local area, she was afraid of every spider, every reptile, and almost everything that moves and not a human (or a pet). Since then she keeps on uploading images of these animals, even suprising her older friends.

Finally I felt her relaxed and away from her problems. This caused some kind of bond in me against her. No, don't misunderstand me. I always do this to everybody that gets to know the real me, because if there is one thing that kills me is that if I trust someone, and then they just use me as a tool. This is what I feel currently, and honestly saying it hurts a lot. For the last 3 weeks, she's barely answering me, our daily 12 hours of talking is reduced to weekly 5 minutes, she's not writing in the same way she did before, instead of being expressive, now just straight to the point, compressed as if the character count would be limited. 

Of course I asked her what's wrong, and she keeps telling me that everything's fine. I'm not an idiot. Could it be that since she's not having this pressure on her, and finally she can relax and enjoy life, all basically thanks to me, she doesn't want to be my friend anymore, as there is no benefit from me anymore? Ironic that in the last 3 weeks, I lost one of my closest friends due to a bike accident, the team (I'm playing basketball) where I play disbanded after 10 years of playing together, and personal problems also occur, which could be treated if I had someone to speak to: her. As of these problems put a lot of pressure to me, I feel like my depression is coming back...
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**:
Close friend doesn't talk with me for 3 weeks now after I helped her through probably the hardest time of her life (for now, at least). Keeps telling me that everything is fine, but we're talking 5 minutes a week, instead of the previously average 12 hours a day. She ignores me though I'd need her now, desperately. Her boyfriend is jealous at me, though from my side, it's nothing more than friendship.

I'm studying for uni and you are my first thought when I'm on a break, since I can't smoke I'm just smoking thru all of you, just know that.

Sooo, lately every time I smoke I get anxious, anti-social (except for my smoke buddy), paranoid, very sleepy etc. In my country weed is illegal but relatively close to Amsterdam where I went last year. Even smoking Apple Jack, Super Lemon Haze, Amnesia Haze and blablabla I managed to get really anxious, and sleepy af. Strangely the edibles did good, relaxed but not couchlocked. 

Let's stick to my country tho, I don't expect to find great quality but I still want to enjoy it. I tried everything, since I also like to mix weed and other herbs I tried Passiflora, Melissa, and pepper to treat the anxiety and tons of coffee and energy drinks to not feel extremely sleepy but nothing worked.

I don't think a T-break will help since every now and then I have to suspend because of uni, internship or other things, usually 1/2 months.

I usually smoke once maybe twice a week and every sesh is composed by: a joint (in two), a spliff and some bong rips. I think around 2/3 gr in two, will actually check next time.

The thing that bothers me the most is that just a few years ago I could smoke so much more and really enjoy it.

Thank you if you made it this far, I know it's a pain in the ass to read. 

So, any thoughts and suggestions?

We went to the same college, studied for everything together, and things were generally good.

Then I went to Houston. Worked in an engineering research lab doing 80 hours/week, hated my life, our relationship struggled, and I came back home after the internship with some serious depression issues.

I come back home, depressed, tell my girlfriend, and she really struggles with the way she sees me. She cheats, the day after Christmas, with a guy who she was close friends with while I was gone.

We split up of course, both of us severely hurt and both of us still madly caring for the other. We stay apart for a while, until we run into each other one day almost a year ago on campus and start talking again.

Since then, we've been together and getting better, but there are times when she lies to me. She says she doesn't want to, and I know she doesn't want to hurt me. She always ends up lying about who she's with. She might say she's with 3 guy friends, and her plan was to hang out with 3, but only one responded and she's only with him. She might say she's out with girlfriends, but it's actually mostly guys with one or two other girls. She isn't a big drinker or a big partier, and she's an engineer like me so girls are always in the minority. 

But today, she lied again. I got really angry, yelled, she stopped talking to me, I probably called her to talk to her like 30 times because she was totally stone-walling me after she lied. She's in grad school in a different state, so I've been trying to minimize arguments and keep things to just the real issues, but this is a real issue. How can I trust her to tell me the truth? She's in another state for god sakes so communication and honesty is the absolutely critical factor in maintaining our relationship.

I'm about to talk to her in a few minutes this evening. I probably won't make a decision about us staying together right now. I am definitely thinking things through over the next few days. Is it worth it? Should I stay with her after all this time even though she continuously does this?

Are those supposed to be mine?",TinyPotatoAttack,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/70skyv/i_think_my_dad_has_stolen_over_10000_from_me_by/,"Edit: Thanks everyone. I think I've got it now. The summer checks were mine, the other checks were his. Thank God. However, that does mean that he stole $6,000 of that summer money...damn.

Edit: I'm not evil, guys. I'm of course helping pay for college as well, and have a job and internship, saving up money to help pay them back when the billing comes up after school ends. Just want to know if I'm being bamboozled or not so that I stay in the know. It's a lot of money, after all. :P

Hi everyone,

I've been in school for the past four years. During that time, my dad has been taking out parent loans in order to partially pay for my tuition and housing. Each semester, however, he receives a reimbursement for those loans. These are usually about $600, except for summer semesters which are around $3000. Now I was an idiot and decided to be one of those students who doesn't understand finances and lets his daddy handle everything. So, I've been told that these refunds are for him because he's the one taking out the loans. Because of that, I've just sort of ignored it and eaten ramen and tuna fish. 

However, this summer I got a check in the mail instead of him. It was addressed to me, and was one of those $3000 checks for the summer. I called my dad, he got really mad for some reason, we agreed it was a mix-up, and I just cashed the check and sent him the money. That's when I got suspicious. I went into financial aid to ask what happened. They told me that the $3000 was supposed to be used for my summer living expenses. Unlike regular semesters, food and other services aren't provided on campus during the summer, so they figure I need more money than in the other semesters...so basically I had just mistakenly given $3,000 of my money to my dad.

I had a discussion with my dad about this, and he was adamant that it was his money. He also told me a very long, sad tale about how he was struggling and having money troubles. I caved and let him keep the money. I don't like dealing with my dad. So much so, that even $3000 and the threat of eating nothing but ramen and tuna fish all summer wasn't worth doing so.  

But now I'm looking back and wondering if all of those reimbursements were meant for me. I've gone through 8 semesters, and two summer semesters, which would add up to over $10,000 taken by my dad. 

So, am I just being paranoid? 
Are none of the reimbursement checks for me? 
Are the summer ones the only ones I get, and the rest go to him? 
Or has he really stolen over $10,000 behind my back?

Thanks guys. "

My home state has very few opportunities for engineering internships compared to Silicon Valley and other parts of California, so I have some questions about the best approach for me to take when applying for internships in California.

Do tech companies in California typically give compensation to pay for a student's housing expenses during an internship, even if they are only a 2nd year? That is probably the most important factor to me, since housing in the Bay Area is so expensive.

Are there any opportunities to do internships that last for part (around 2/3) of the summer instead of the entire summer?

I assume it would be best to just apply widely to many different internship programs and then compare the location and housing compensation for the companies I receive offers from. Any other advice for out-of-state students applying for internships in California would be appreciated! Thank you!"

But I need some advice. So I came from a mediocre high school which offered to little to no CS opportunities. I didn't learn much code nor did I receive that valuable of a work experience. The point I'm trying to make is that my resume looks empty (except for one crappy internship I did last year). I was wondering if I could do anything to land good impressions at the career fair tomorrow.

Hate my current job, but love the comfort.",Anxiouspalo,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/70te8v/scared_to_seek_out_new_jobinternship_hate_my/,"I am currently a sophomore student in college. I'm lucky enough to be from a major city, so my hometown has a plethora of job opportunities available that could assist me in the development of my career (I am studying communications design in school). I go to a top private school for my major, thus permitting me even *more* opportunities within my field but there is only one problem: 

I currently work at a community pool in one of the outer boroughs right down the block from my current/childhood home.  I've been working there for almost 4 years, and whilst at first lifeguarding and then eventual supervisor work right around the corner was extremely awesome (specially as a high schooler) I have grown incredibly tired of it. We're currently having a major management overhaul, and our new boss isn't exactly thrilled of the current staff and is trying to weed us out (hiring new people, cutting our hours). This once fine work establishment has turned into a constant train wreck, and on top of that I now feel even more inclined towards leaving as all the work I'm doing at the moment is just pointless ""busy work"" 

I want to thrive and work towards my career, but the idea of seeking out a new job is upsetting my already currently on edge anxiety. My current job is everything and anxious person can dream of : low stress/work requirements, convenient walking distance, minimal interactions, above minimum wage pay, but I am beginning to feel hindered by these comforts. 

I am currently up right now readjusting my abysmal resume (I've only ever worked at this job) and I'm shaking just at the idea that this place might call me and I'll have to go through the process of committing to this big company I'm applying to.  I live literally on the outskirts of Manhattan (5 min walk to Manhattan, 20 min commute to midtown) so it's not like I have a miserable commute up ahead but I'm scared that it'll suddenly become an issue despite already always being downtown. I also fear that I'll fall behind in my studies, and generally fail as a result of taking on such an audacious internship. 

I am SCARED and I can't get past it, and I really fear that because of this I won't commit to pressing that ""submit resume"" button that's been calling me for 3 months.

**TL;DR ** I'm really comfortable at my current job even though it no longer benefits me, but way too anxious to apply to any place the would better suit me as I'm scared I'll just fuck up my whole life's flow by taking something bigger on. "

I'm not really even sure what I'm doing, but I enjoy ranting so here goes:

Hello, it's currently 3:45 am and I'm deep in my thoughts. This isn't anything new to me. I stay up this late almost EVERY DAY. I'm not sure if I have a sleeping problem of sorts. But it's whatever, that's not why I was here.

Staying up this late gives me a lot of time to think to myself, usually about stupid stuff hahaha... but tonight's different.

I try to keep my age and personality as anonymous as possible here.  But, I'm approaching the crossroads of ""real life"" that every twenty-something approaches... and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

My whole life I've grown up being told how special I am. I don't mean that in a narcissistic way. Just growing up my family and community invested a lot of time and effort into me. I'm super blessed to be afforded different opportunities because of everyone who's helped me so far.

But that's the problem. I'm sitting here, possibly graduating college soon and getting a job someday for a career. And I don't even know if I'm gonna reach my full potential.

I realized this when I saw the news about Donald Glover winning the Emmy and making history and stuff. That really got me thinking. I don't ""idolize"" anyone but I really admire the guy. He reminds me a lot of myself and I empathize with his life.

But unlike him, everything I like and have a passion for... he does it to winning awards and shit. Like screenwriting? Yep. Directing? Yep. Acting? That too. Hell he's even good at music.

I see my peers doing great things. Like people are getting into law school, med school, etc. I knew that wasn't for me, but then I see peer in my school doing awesome internships and traveling and living an amazing life.

I know you shouldn't compare your life to the best parts that people show on social media and stuff, but I'm only human. Its tough when you gotta slave away to work part time and go to school so you can pay rent and not have enough hours in the day to try and have cool opportunities like that.

I guess I'm just ranting because all my life I thought I wasn't afraid of much... but I found my biggest fear: Being a failure and letting down everyone who believed in me. Being someone who had potential to be great and never amounted to any of it.

Hell I don't even know if I'm anything special. I try to maintain a high level of confidence. But when there's seven billion people in the world, the odds are in your favor of being just ordinary; you start to really wonder if you even are anything different.

I feel like I could do it. Like I've created things that made people laugh. The other day I wrote what I thought was a half-assed fanfic and someone told me they loved it and it inspired them as a writer.

I feel like I would get the most fulfillment out of life being an inspiration to people. Like making things that bring a joy to peoples lives and bring them together. That's why I enjoy the entertainment industry so much. I could only dream of accepting an Emmy because I wrote a show that people wanna binge or dissect the episodes week by week.

Unfortunately, there's no step-by-step guide on how to make it in the world. I wish there was something or someone who could put me on the path to greatness. I know I would work harder than anyone for it if it gave me that passion and fire to accomplish it, ya know?

Maybe I screwed myself trying to be unique and stuff, but I'm just really worried that at this crossroad in life... I'm gonna go down the wrong road and let down all those who tried to make my life better."

Also TL;DR will be at the bottom. 


A little bit of background: me(18F)and my bf(19F) started dating when I was first year student(then 16) and he(then 17) was second year student. This school is pretty much for learning an occupation that we could work as and is focused on IT related jobs. It is kinda like a high school equivalent.


We started dating while we were still underage, but now we are both legally adults, which I think is important for this situation.  We have been dating for almost 2 years. He graduated this year and became a teacher in the same school. I am still currently studying. He won't be teaching me, since I have a different curriculum/occupation. I also won't be attending school for now, since we have mandatory internship for this semester.


He is worried about our relationship causing problems at school, since he is a teacher and I am still a student. Some people already know that we are dating since we were both students. My parents see nothing wrong with this. 


**Tl;DR**: we went to the same school, started dating, bf graduated and became a teacher, I am still a student and will graduate next year, he won't be teaching me directly. 


What would be the best way to handle this situation,  so it wouldn't cause problems? Also, what do you think of this kind of relationship?"

I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my floating around sipping your drinks](http://www.clearwatercolumbus.com/two-women-pool-float.jpg). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later. The sun is still out but it is time I head back in to the house. I grab my towel and head for the back door...
______________________________________
I will let you decide what happens from there. Do I walk in on you and my mom going at it? Do you go back home and invite me over? Do you spend the night and find a way to sneak to my room/somewhere else in the house? Do we include my mom as well? (if you cannot tell, a kink of mine is definitely incest). We could both play the role of her and direct her based on whose turn it is. You can determine your age in the RP, add more back story to your character, and make any other changes you like.
___________________________________________
I'm pretty open sexually. Some of my other kinks include being dominant, anal, light bondage, deep throat, threesomes, public sex, and age play (18+ only). But I'm open to any and all suggestions. I am looking for long term RP for this. "
70w5m8,5,2017-09-18,Question about changing employment during fellowship,LeDarkKnight,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/70w5m8/question_about_changing_employment_during/,"This is somewhat of a specific question that I'm asking on behalf of my fiance. She doesn't know I'm posting here but I'm not really sure where else to ask this somewhat specific question that I wouldn't even begin to be able to answer not being in the SLP field myself. For safety reasons, I won't reveal her actual name, but let's call her Samantha.

Bare with me as I'm only going off of what Samantha has told me and her experiences so far in her career with SLP. I'm not in the SLP field myself so please forgive some of my wording if it's a bit off.

Samantha received her undergrad Bachelor's and graduate Master's degrees in New York and graduated from grad school in May of this year. In the 6 years I've known her, she's always wanted to work in hospitals and work with adults. From what I understand, getting a position in a hospital is difficult and there are far more positions open in schools, at least in New York, compared to hospitals. Unfortunately, the graduate college she attended focused mostly on schools and kids rather than the hospital setting that she had always dreamed of working in. 

Samantha and I moved to New York City in January. She was accepted and took an internship working in a clinic. Samantha loved the clinic setting as she was working with adults and learned a lot. Unfortunately, the clinic she interned with was down-sizing and could not keep Samantha on full-time. Once her internship was over, she applied to tons of different hospitals and clinics but was not accepted in to any of them. She eventually took a position with an agency that specialized in working in schools in NYC. She's been with this agency completing her fellowship since May.

I won't reveal the agency's name as I'm pretty sure that would break Reddit's witch hunting rules, but to make a long story short this agency she's with right now has been absolutely nothing but a nightmare for Samantha. They upright lied to her about the amount of hours and pay that she would be receiving and management is near impossible to get a hold of. On top of everything, she's working in schools and with children rather than the hospital setting that she always wanted.

She's absolutely miserable right now. She was so passionate about the SLP field for the first 5 and a half years I knew her and now she doesn't even want to discuss what she does. She's talking about quitting and going back to school to be a nurse just so she can work in hospitals.

And this is where you come in. From what she's told me, once she starts her fellowship she can't leave the company that she's with or she won't be allowed back in the field or another fellowship won't take her. I have no idea where she's getting this information from but I tend to believe her when it comes to stuff like this. On the other hand though, I'm not sure how much research she's done into changing fellowships or the possibility on doing so. I'm also not sure if her sources are credible.

This isn't a job hunting post by any means. This is just a question about a worried fiance who doesn't want to see the love of his life's career that she worked so hard for come crumbling down around her because she chose a bad company to work for. Any information at all that you can provide would be incredibly appreciated. And if there's any clarification that you may need, I'll do my best to answer.

**TL/DR: Fiance chose a poor company to complete her SLP fellowship with. She's thinking about quitting the field entirely now. Is there anything she can do about leaving her fellowship before it's over and not jeopardize her career in the process?**

70wens,1,2017-09-18,Me 21m with my GF 18F 7 months I'm too selfish for a relationship,Idkwhoiamtoday,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70wens/me_21m_with_my_gf_18f_7_months_im_too_selfish_for/,"I've been dating my girlfriend for 7 months.She's my first real girlfriend. At first we would talk 24/7 and then after three months she lived with me while I did an internship over the summer. It wasn't that bad. We fought for a little bit while we were both taking a class in the beginning of the summer but it got better after that.  She would be home all day doing nothing while I was at work. When I got home she was always excited and wanted to do stuff. I was usually tired. She would wake up around noon and I would get up at 6am. We went to bed around 11pm. I wasn't used to getting that little amount of sleep.

I've always been kind of a self help junkie. I used to mediate every morning and go to the gym 5 days a week. I would also read 30 minutes a day, go to bed the same time and wake up the same time. Since we've been dating I've tried to maintain those things but it's very difficult. I need a lot of sleep to feel good. I told her I want to go to bed at 10 but it's usually 11 by the time we get off the phone. I tell her it's late and i'm tired but she just thinks I don't want to talk. I have 8ams every day and it's a 30 minute commute so I do need to go to bed earlier. I'm very introverted and could not talk to anyone for 2 weeks and be fine probably. I realize most people aren't like this so I try to give her two hours on the phone every night. But usually is busy when I want to talk and waits until later to call.

I also have a problem where if I'm texting or expecting a call I can't focus on anything else. We snapchat throughout the day which is fine, it's just bother some sometimes. I told her I didn't really like texting all day but she took it personal and thought I didn't want to spend time with her.

I've always been alone and focused on myself. She thinks I'm depressed which I think I'm starting to see it. She says I show all the symptoms for it. I'm never really excited for anything besides going to sleep. She says I need to tell her how I feel and stop keeping it to myself. The things I tell her usually upset her. I say how I don't like talking all day and I want to get enough sleep at night, but then she thinks I don't like her.

I just can't see myself ever in a relationship. Because I always want to put myself first. I hate going to family events and stuff like that. I have one of lowest self-esteem of anyone she and me think. I'm too scared to talk to anyone at college. I have friends but I really don't like talking to them because I think I could be studying. I don't understand much that's going on in class and I barely get by with C's. I'm junior now and it's getting more difficult and making me more depressed. I'm a computer science major but I'm not even sure what I want to do. I just hate dragging her along when I can't even be happy.

TL;DR
Idk if I'm right for a relationship. I focus too much on myself and I'm very depressed. It makes my girlfriend sad. I love working on myself and don't like putting others first.

70wjod,26,2017-09-18,"In Need of some Career Advice (Not a Marine, Long-Post, Not-a-boot-question)",ZeljkoBuvac,USMC,https://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/70wjod/in_need_of_some_career_advice_not_a_marine/,"**I would like to preface this text by saying I am indeed aware of r/usmcboot.**

However, I feel that this question is not merely a basic matter of simply enlisting, but rather a more in-depth, detailed question that might warrant the advice, experience, or anecdotes of Marines currently serving, or perhaps those with plenty of experience-- even just with life in general. Furthermore, I understand that sometimes this subreddit is frequented by recruiters, enlisted and OSO's alike. I will most likely also post this on r/usmcboot in effort to gain more responses and insight. 

**Background:**

Currently, I am a recent graduate in the process of applying to OCC 227. Application board will convene 6 November, with report date of early January upon acceptance. I've attended MEPS already. Only thing my OSO and I need to complete are an official PFT and to contract. Also, we are currently awaiting the approval (hopefully) of a BUMED waiver regarding my LASIK surgery in September 2016. OSO sent the waiver 8 September. We are hoping that it is approved in-time.

My plan is, and has always been, to become an Officer in the Reserves. While I have considered, and wholeheartedly respect the Active duty side, I personally feel that my goals and career aspirations are better suited to the Reserves. As a previous federal intern, my ultimate aspirations have always been to end up in the DC Metro area. Personally, I feel that a bachelor's + experience as an Officer in the USMC is a great avenue to achieving that hopeful end-goal. However, that does not mean I view the Marine Corps as simply a stepping-stone. This is something that I have wanted to do for as long as I can remember. That has not, and will not change.

**Now for the conflict:** 

As I've just mentioned, I'm a fairly recent graduate-- and that means that those lovely student loan repayments are hot on my tail. My OSO has advised me to secure employment before leaving in January for a couple of reasons. 1) Easier transition once finished with OCS + TBS+ MOS, eliminating the need to look for employment after training and 2) Employers must hold my job for me while I am away. He has also advised me to not mention OCS until after I have accepted a final offer. 

This of course, is assuming that I will be accepted come November. This also assumes that the LASIK waiver will be approved without any difficulties/in-time for the board.

Yet as it stands, closer and closer approaches January. While it is figuratively right around the corner, we still have a little ways to go before the time comes to leave. While I am both open to and quite excited about the process of securing a job already, I can't help but think/feel how bad it looks to leave employment relatively early in my tenure. For example, a ""best-case scenario"" of starting a job in early October would give me around 3 months of work-time before leaving for approximately 1-1.5 years of training. But what of the worst-case situation? Accepting and starting a job late November/early December, only to waltz into HR to report you're going to be gone for quite some time? It seems a bit much, regardless of how they are obligated to hold your job. For one, I feel it could create an unfavorable impression of you. Not to mention I also feel that you could still be let go for some ""mysterious"" reason. Of course, that's speculation, but who knows? Furthermore, let's say I accept a job and move to the DC Metro area. I would be renting an apartment presumably. How am I supposed to handle my lease if I'm at Quantico? Is that not just money down the drain? 

Point is, what would you do if you were in my situation? Would you continue to apply/interview for jobs and not tell them about your Officer aspirations, subsequently just relying on the law to protect your job once you leave? Would you continue to apply/interview for jobs but TELL them you're joining the USMC, and iterate that you are incredibly interested in the company still, and that you see yourself there in the long-run? 

**OR**

Would you forgo the employment search for now, opting to search once again upon completion of training? (In the meantime, perhaps picking up some sort of temporary work on a local level.) Or would you suggest that your OSO submits your application for the next available OCC class, giving yourself more time at a potential job? (I am not sure if I should even bring this up with him, as I don't know whether it's that easy if we are currently on track for 227) This of course runs the risk of not being accepted to OCS at all, now with nothing but empty pockets.

Apologies for such a long-post, but I need advice and this subreddit is very helpful. Thank you to all in advance. I can definitely address any unclear details on my end. 

Cheers

70x24u,2,2017-09-18,Getting a job after college (Long/Rant) TLDR at bottom.,Bluwolf96,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/70x24u/getting_a_job_after_college_longrant_tldr_at/,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here. Not really sure what I'm hoping for, advice maybe. Also wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation and can share their experience.

I'm a 21 year old who just graduated with a First Class Honours degree in Aeronutical Engineering. I've never had a job before and the only work experience I have is 8 months working as a research intern at a technical university.

Unfortunately my degree is basically useless to me in the country I live. And although I don't have huge debt, I don't have enough money to up sticks to the USA or the UK where my degree would be more employable.

So for the last three months I've been trawling through job sites emailing my CV to as many companies as I can find in search of a job. In the last month I've gone from just engineering firms to any job at all to save money.

So far I've had 1 interview, and that was only because a friend of mine works there. The response to me was 'You're too inexperienced'.

All throughout my teen years and then through college we were told 'If you graduate with a First Class Honours in engineering, you'll be headhunted by big companies'. So now that I'm putting myself out into the job market, it's really frustrating that no one, let alone engineering firms, have responded to my applications.

I've worked for 4 years and graduated in the top five of my class only to find that I can't get a job without experience, and I can't get experience without a job. I've attended I don't know how many seminars on writing CVs and making portfolios. But when it boils down to it, the raw materials of what companies want just ain't there.

I'm with four different job sites and a recruitment agency. I email my CV to at least one new job, any job, every day. And almost all of them don't respond or just echo the chorus 'You're too inexperienced.' How do I do things differently? Am I even close? I'm just frustrated and scared and have no idea why 4 years of stress and hard work has led only to a string of No's.

TLDR: Recently graduated engineer looking for a job. Have almost no experience and have heard noting but No's from over thirty different jobs. No idea what I should do."
70x6wq,5,2017-09-18,Looking for advice on breaking into the field,heyjude0,librarians,https://www.reddit.com/r/librarians/comments/70x6wq/looking_for_advice_on_breaking_into_the_field/,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice. 

I'm a college graduate with a liberal arts degree. I've been out of school for several years, working in various fields, namely in the non-profit sector (doing youth advocacy, program directing, working with houseless folks), and more recently doing childcare. I've always been interested in library science as a potential career, and for the past couple years I've been pretty set on becoming a librarian. 

I interviewed librarian friends to figure out how to get into the field, and the advice that everyone gave me was to first get an entry level job, and then slowly work my way up the ladder, and eventually pursue a masters if I want a full fledged librarian position. 

I've been volunteering at my local public library for about 6 months, with the hope that I would eventually be able to get an entry level position. I've applied many many times for various entry positions over the last few years, and have doubled down even more recently, but I've had no luck at even getting an interview. 

Two of my librarian friends have offered to be my references, and have also supported me with editing my cover letters. 

I'm kinda at a loss with how to move forward, and what else I can do to make myself into a better candidate. I'm considering pursuing a masters in library and information science, without having had any library experience. I'm also thinking that I'd like to take some computer programming and web design classes at the local community college to both prepare me for grad school and to learn some important skills that may be relevant for future employment.  I was wondering if anyone had any advice or thoughts about what I can do to make myself into a more appealing candidate? And if it's a bad idea to move forward with grad school at this time? 

I'm also curious about doing an internship somewhere to gain experience, but with the preliminary googling that I've done, it seems internships are only open to students. I was curious if anyone knew of any internships that are open to the general public?

Ok, thank you!

70xb77,14,2017-09-18,Advice appreciated - 20yo student looking to make sure I'm getting the most from my money,tyler-jackoliver,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/70xb77/advice_appreciated_20yo_student_looking_to_make/,"Hi /r/UKPersonalFinance,

I'm a 20 year old Engineering student, and I've been lucky enough to have a fair amount of money (total about 20k) saved up from inheritances and jobs, as well as a fairly nice monthly income. I'm looking to make sure I'm maximising what I'm doing with my money, as I have more than I know what to do with, to be honest. 

So far, my monthly income from all sources (internships, work, loan) is ~£525/mo after taxes and rent (I luckily have a scholarship that covers rent), excluding bills. I budget every month and spend half of my money, and save half of my money, and covers all my outgoings through the year. My student loan is sitting at a cool £63k at 6.1%, so I can't say I'm particularly interested in even attempting to prioritise paying that off --  I'd need to earn at least £43k a year to even pay off the interest.

So, I want to make sure that I'm maximising my savings here. I have the following already set up:

* Santander 123 Student Current Account: £2000-£2500 at all times at 3% up to £2000. This is the account I 'live out of'; I earn interest up to £2000, and so I keep £2000 in there at all times, and 'top it up' to the £2525 I live out of, to make sure it never goes below £2000.

* Santander ISA at 0.25%: £8000. 

* Coventry Building Society ISA at 1%: £8500. Note: this isn't accessible to me very easily, since I now live in the South. I try to avoid putting money I don't need to in here as a result.

* Santander 'Monthly Savings' account - whatever I don't spend each month saved up. Currently £4k at 1%.

I have money in all of the above set out into different emergency funds (£11k), car funds (to support my little motor: £4k car I bought a year ago, lovingly maintained with cheap (£500) insurance thanks to the IAM test, hoping to help it keep its' value), holiday funds (£2k) and some new equipment funds (computers etc, £2k), but I have about £3-4k not currently really doing anything.

I want to make sure I'm doing the best I can and keeping the money in the correct places. Does anyone have any advice on if there's a better way to store the money? For example, I don't think I need my emergency fund to be £11k.



Thanks!

We're a school of about 30k students with 5k staff/faculty. Our IT department has about 25-28 on board (interns fluctuate). About 8 are what I would call field techs, 4 engineers (2 systems, 2 network), 3 business systems folks, 3 SIS folks, 1 help desk person, 1 ops manager, 1 ed tech, 1 administrator for the whole department, and the rest interns. 

Our department is also unique in that we don't report to any of the Superintendent level folks. We report to the same directors that principals report to, and these directors are under the assistant super.

So really, I'm just curious if we're understaffed compared to others, or overstaffed. Personally, it feels understaffed, and it seems strange to me that we report to curriculum directors.

How is your org set up?

Edit: Maybe to help clarify, I'm not asking about ideals, but more wondering how it's done in other districts. 

Do you have a dedicated team for certain services like network infrastructure, AD, G Suite, SCCM, etc.?
How many site support techs are part of your department? Do they only do site support? Are they responsible for other services?
Do you have a help desk system for answering calls? 
DBA on staff?

As much as a preteen stage would be cool, I'm not sure its very feasible (especially this late in the game).

However, an interesting point was made by /u/tacotamale about having a pack focused on teen. I responded, as did /u/chipaway111, about the other lifestages having a pack.

Right now we have toddlers and kids with their own stuff packs. Would you want a teen, young adult, adult, and elder stuff pack? Would you prefer that to the backyard/glamour/etc packs? 


this is what we have so far in life-stage specific stuff packs:

**toddler**: slide, jungle gym, ball pit, and play dates

**kid**: new music and tv genres, voidcritters (collectible), puppet show. 




Here's some ideas I came up with for the other stages

**elder**: 

* stamp/coin(collectible)

* board-games like scrabble/cribbage/etc

* bikes (!!)

* chipaway mentioned knitting!

* a walking cane?

* bird watching

I am a recent undergraduate working engineer. I'm trying to gauge my chances before I sink time and resources into this path.

Background

I just graduated as an Aerospace Engineer in May from a top 5 Undergrad Program. Tho graduating was a source of pride, I only managed to pull a 3.0.
The program and course load I pursued were among the hardest my school offered. 

While in school I did a long extended 2 year internship which resulted in a big career achievement. Currently my personal code is being used by the Navy to score their missiles. I wrote this code from scratch and spent my 2 years working on it. Before graduating I received a full time offer to work as a robotics engineer with a mid sized company. I have been performing at my job and am nearing my 4th month here.


Goals

It's about time that I think about my future, as to wether I want to pursue IP law, a MBA or my PE license. So I want to scope out my options. As such I wanted some opinions as to my standings.

How high of a LSAT do I need to get so that my Professional Work and score offset my otherwise mediocre GPA? Or should I perhaps get more experience before applying ?

Thank you for your time!

7123kg,19,2017-09-19,40(f) in foreigner country for 8 years. No friends at all. People hate me. I cannot anymore..please help me..,raidaughter,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7123kg/40f_in_foreigner_country_for_8_years_no_friends/,"Hello dearest people.
As you reading this, you are the only people that ever get to know all of this below. I am 40, living in another country, I have no friends, at all and for 8 long years I was not able to talk to anyone as a friend. Too much has happened and too much time has passed and I no longer have friends in my home country, so I cannot talk to them and here, in another country where I live now, I was not able to meet a single friend for those 8 years.


I beg of you, bear with me, as I can get really rambly, because I have never let this out to anyone..About a month ago, I thought of going to therapy, and the moment I have imagined I will have SOMEONE actually listening to me, my worries and fears, resulted in me having a severe breathing/panic attack, which I did not know I had. So much pain has been buried for so long, just the thought of someone LISTENING was way too overwhelming. I was not prepared for that. This is when I realized I need to let this out SOMEWHERE, since I do not have the money for therapy anyway.


This is going to be sad. Please feel free to criticize me. Maybe I just do not see something that others can. I will give some details here that perhaps will help you tell me what can be wrong with me. 


I have been raised in an eastern ex-communist country to a judgy mom, judgy and insulting teachers and dad that did not care at all. Mom always would let me know, that there is someone better/prettier/smarter than me. I had friends there, loved them, and they loved me. I always tried to help everyone and anyone, whether it is an animal or a human. I believe, if I won't - what if no none else will. My life credo is still the same: always, always think of others and try to help. I have always been different from other people, I always felt like a black sheep.


In end then of my 20's I have moved to another country in Europe to live, where I actually met some friends from my own country and it was nice. I wish I could made friends with locals as well but the language was hard for me (not English) and I was ashamed that I struggled with it. In my home country if you struggle with something you are stupid. And that was the worst insult to me in my childhood from my parents and school. All of this will come and hit me again in the future.


Fast forward, six years later, I have met someone amazing, and moved to him to a neighborhood country. He is amazing. But I have never let him know of any of my pain. I did not want to look like a weak victim. Who would love a victim?! Although I denied it to myself, I know, in my 40'th birthday that I think I really am a weak victim of myself.


Here, in new European country I went to a language school (though those countries languages are quite similar at the same time they are very different), where while I was past 35 years old, I was once again, like in childhood, bullied by a teacher. The funky thing with me: if someone ELSE is being hurt or bullied: I'd tear the offender apart. But when it is done to me...I am just helpless. Why?! Could never find and answer to that. I never told this to the head of the educational unit and instead, I dropped out of school, went to a depression for a year, fought it off and made myself return to the school and finish it (to a different teacher's class though). I was so desperately trying to make friends there, at some point I even felt I was throwing myself at people, but no one stuck around.


I tried as well, going out with people who have just moved in this country as well, finding them via Facebook groups and so on. We have met several times, but then I could not listen to them anymore. They hated this country, they despised the  local people, they would mock them and I did not liked it at all. It was loads of negativity and a very unfair and unjust hate. I cut the ties with them and the hopes of finding a friend, vanished once again.


After thinking about my education for the future (I really did not had a proper one) I thought of computers, since I love all about them and I went and threw myself into another education, as an IT Technician. Entire class was boys but I was looking forward to find friends. You think I did? Nope. I was ONCE AGAIN ashamed of the struggle with the language in my life. I kept quiet, afraid to open my mouth and for some reason was very ashamed to speak English. Besides..I could not understand and STILL cannot understand what people are saying to the most part of it. So I became an outcast. Someone that people look at as weirdo, don't sit beside and do not talk to. At 38 years old. But I took it on, for two years. I had so many incomplete educations, I HAD TO go through at least one, FOR ONCE.


Next step in education was a practice. I got a good one, at the local University. This is where I thought I'd make friends, despite my fucked up language! Guess what. Nothing again. I did try to be more around people. But something would always hold me back. One day I would be brave oh so brave, but then the other day the introvert in me would drag me back to my ""cave"". Oh how badly I wanted to be a part of something. To have a friend, someone needing ME. But alas. That internship is now over, I cannot find a job for half a year and I applied to approx 150 jobs. No one even would call me back to invite me to an interview, despite the fact that my CV and personal letter written perfectly in local language, so they have no idea that my language is faulty. I guess it is to do that I am female at 40 with no experience in IT. Needless to say, this makes me take it ""personal"" although I UNDERSTAND the sheer stupidity of that thought, it is there and it is another nail in the coffin.


I play MMORPG, I have acquaintances there, but no one really ever asks how am I and no one really cares. I am actually quite scared that someone from my guild will read this and recognize me somehow. I would be so ashamed. I try to portray myself as someone strong and funny and helpful there. Little do they know how really miserable I am.


And the final drop was that the other day, when my boyfriend/fiancee of those 8 years admitted that sometimes he was looking at other girls, and as he looked at them, he would have a glimpse of sexual intercourse with them. ""Uncontrollable and sort of unintentional thought, in a glimpse of a second"": as it was described to me. 
OK, fuck the fact that I have no friends and possibly the loneliest person in the world. That thing with fiancee - hurt like a million tracks. That hurt so much it has ripped me apart. If I would ask, he would tell me I was overweight a bit, and I tried to work out, for many years but lacked consistency as I was always tend to be on a ""easy gain"" side. I always tried to look good, be groomed, sometimes I would fall off the wagon because I would so get tired with the endless competition of pretty girls I see around me....but then I would pick myself up. Again and again. With grooming and workouts... 


Now I cannot let go of that horrible thought of him looking, I have no one, absolutely no one to tell any of this. I feel destroyed. He was a person I trusted so much, I loved so much, he was my only family, my only sort of a friend, even tho I never ever ever complained to him that I am feeling like outcast, even though he saw I have no friends. (Most of his friends are co-workers with whom he is having after-works, and otherwise he likes to be at home). I also like to be at home, but..sometimes I so badly need a friend, that I could just tell everything I am going through...


I have my two cats. I love them so much. They would never look at someone thinking that person is better than me. They would never judge me for gaining fat. One of them I was forced to leave in that other country and I came back for her, and brought her here. This is the ONLY SOLE REASON why I still did not committed suicide. I feel I cannot ""betray"", I cannot leave her again. And now a second cat too. 


I have tried to hang myself in the shower a while ago, with a scarf, thrown over the shower door frame, but I was not sure it would be successful, I suppose I'd have to bend my legs and I don't know if that would work. But the though of leaving my cats, would always stop me. I think I can understand them so well on their animal level and I love them so much, that I cannot be so irresponsible by leaving them. 


I apologize for an insane wall of text. Being able to tell all that after 8 years of silence was good I guess. I welcome any opinion, any suggestion. I just feel empty, betrayed and suicidal. At 40. I see no future. I sit ""Locked"" in apartment, I get angry. I would begin to hate people outside, despise them. Only secretly wishing inside, I would be part of them. I cry thinking of my boyfriend looking at other girls, it stops my heat, it gives me panic attacks, it reaps me, although he promised to make an effort not to..of course he would not be able to. I am not stupid. 
When he will come home, I will put on a happy face and pretend to all be good once again. Next day when he will leave for work I will be standing and looking at sticking out metal ornaments on top of the ceiling tall fire place, thinking if they can hold me if I will hang myself there. Then I will know I cannot do that, once again, because of cats..and I will just go on again and again same circle..What is the point of living? Nothing will change if I leave. People would cry for a month and forget me. I am just ugly and old. I always feel people look strange at me. As if they can sense that I am different and despise it...


please help me....

P.S: thank you so very much for listening.

So a little back story about me. I recently graduated from college with a Bachelor’s in Communications. Two years ago I was a senior in high school and wanted to be a copywriter. Now I’m only 20 and  was working full-time as an in house Marketing Copywriter for an electrical manufacturing company for 2.5 months. Yesterday, they fired me bc I “wasn’t a good fit for the company”.

What I learned from that experience is that I hate working for other people. I’m a writer and I’m very quite, I feel like people like to tell me things that I already know and people make assumptions about me that probably isn’t true just because I don’t talk just to look more important and I don’t act like I know what I’m talking about even when I probably don’t. 

I also learned that I suck at copywriting for print and prefer the digital platform(after all that's what I went to school for.) I also learned that I’m an introvert and it is very hard for me to mold myself to fit someone else’s culture and forced to take on someone else's passion. 

From my experience in college I took an interest in programming and technology and have been teaching myself as a hobby ever since(6 months ago). That’s truly what I am passionate about but, I have to make money doing what my portfolio is geared towards (writing) until I have marketable skills in web development. 

The environment took a toll on me. I worked in an open office, it literally made me sick and it was hard to focus bc people were constantly talking and walking around. I also gained a lot of weight from sitting on my ass for 40 hrs a week.

Since then I’ve taken an interest in the idea of freelance writing while I purse my passion in web development and technology on the side. When it comes to writing there is no particular industry that I want to write for. I just need someone to tell me what to do , I do it, get paid and move on. I have a few questions about freelance writing...

1. When I think of the idea of freelancing the first thing that comes to mind is taxes lol. So for sites like Upwork and Freelancer.com how do you go about filing that on your taxes or saving money from that for taxes? Do you have to be making a certain amount to file it? 

2. Is it a good idea for someone fresh out of college to freelance? (I have internship experience and 2.5 months of real world experience)

Any related tips or advise in much appreciated, thanks for reading. "

713mgd,5,2017-09-19,Can't hold in my anger with peers,1millionppm,Anger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/713mgd/cant_hold_in_my_anger_with_peers/,"I don't know what's wrong with me.


These people at my phd have been bullying for years now. It really really sucks being denied higher level TAships and being told I'm an idiot and that I'll never graduate. It sucks and I'm sad and angry and so so frustrated. A really popular prof (who might end up on my committee because there's only like 3 other analytical profs here) asked me when I'm graduating and I told him maybe after my third publication. He told me he doubts that'll help me and I should study instead. He also mumbled something about ""can't even TA second years..."" :( Granted he was drinking a lot that night... But he was also the same person who barred me from TAing second years until the 4th year of my phd.


I know exactly why most of my department hates me. It's because I told a girl who is really popular (seriously this is phd level I don't understand why popularity is still a thing here) that I couldn't help her with her experiments because I had my hands full with my own. Ever since then she just made my life miserable and told people I'm stupid and lazy and even at one point retarded. She told peers not to talk to me and if they invited me to anything she'll try to shame them (ex. ""omg what is she even doing here?"" ""omg who decided to invite that downer?"" ""well i guess the party is ruined now with her here"") She told professors not to let me in on TAships and I'm stuck with first years for a number of semesters. And all I could do was tuck my tail in between my legs and sulk around for all these years. I even started stressing so much I couldn't sleep and couldn't come into work so I had to take therapy and sleeping pills and when one of the ""crew"" (that's what they call themselves) found out, they told everyone I'm crazy and going to shoot up the school. It was embarassing and cruel.



But now I just have an unrelenting amount of anger and hatred and sadness. The main bully is gone and I got an internship in the summer to get away from it all. It really helped there because not only did they want ot hire me back after I graudate but they told me I was awesome and for the first time in years I felt welcomed. It was nice being in a nonhostile community and workplace.


But now I'm back and I thought all my negative emotions were gone. But it didn't. I'm back to my shitty habit of waking up late, unable to sleep, lack of appetite, a boiling rage whenever I think how unfair this all was. Those profs and students that all loved that bully still hates me no matter how much I try to be nice to them. Killing them with kindness doens't even work. I tried and they said I was trying too hard and I can never become one of their ""crew"" members. I don't even want to I just wnat them off my back please.


But I'm so so angry. Sometimes I have to really clench my teeth and force myself not to reach out and grab them and twist their necks. I want it to snap into two and break. I want to stab them with a rusty screwdriver over and over until they bleed out. I want to fucking scratch their eyeballs out.


Please help me. I don't know what's happening to me. I'm so angry. I have a future and I don't want these violent thoughts anymore. I just want them to all go away and disappear. I hate this world and I hate everything about this situation. I want to feel happy again and carefree."

714hdq,0,2017-09-19,5 SIMPLE things to follow to become a PHP Master! ZEND HATES ME!,Mygaming,PHP,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/714hdq/5_simple_things_to_follow_to_become_a_php_master/,"Through years of exhaustive research, testing and hours spent on redtube, we've come up with five easy ways to become known as a PHP Guru.

1. When working with others, be sure to add your own style to your coding. Standards are given by employers as a guideline, if you prefer camelCase? Use it! Want your own $methd_of_NMING - use that instead. Just be sure to keep changing it to keep the flavour always fresh, nobody wants a dull moment in their day!

2. SCRUM is basically an acronmy for scrotum, and nobody likes a sweaty scrum meeting... keep the atmosphere cool and be sure to skip every other scrum, you're not missing anything. When something comes up from the meeting, just tell them you already did your tickets and you're going for lunch!

3. Be sure to trash all frameworks, especially ~~CodeIgniter~~ Laravel, that was so 2015. Rolling your own framework and adding it to Github, creating fake stars and contributors really help ""fake it till you make it"". Be sure to include numerous security and usability problems to ensure the other *very* helpful community members will donate their free time to helping you improve your product - it's almost like free internship! (This is how Tesla became a powerhouse, just call yourself the Musk from now on)

4. Everybody knows the measure of a developer is solely based on their income. So to ensure you make everyone jealous of how amazing you are, never sound like a poor person - you make 6 digits yearly, and not some measly 10x,xxx salary.. you're in the big leagues my man/woman/attack helicopter - you're Google certified 200k+ and only work 4 days a week. You wrote certification tests, and collect royalties. You got the biggest ~~nuts~~ brain, the dvorak keyboard coding at 220wpm.. you're a star... as your github profile shows, a single shining star.

5. The most important of all, spend half your day posting on Reddit, specifically in programming related subreddits spouting how creative, how smart, and how **fucked** your company would be without you... and when that fails, include constant shit posting to /r/PHP - this way everyone will know how amazing you are.

There you have it! 5 easy ways to help you along your career to becoming a badass PHP artisan coder wizard superstar with the synergistic properties of a neutron star ready to explode with creativity, positivity and world changing views, applications and other stupid shit.

This summer I landed an internship between Year 1 and Year 2 of my MBA program. At work, I met ""Jules"" [28/F] who works in an administrative &amp; E/A role at the company. Nothing happened at work but she and I stayed in contact and after I left she initiated discussions of a date. We did and have been out 5 or 6 times. In general, things are really great - she's very sweet and thoughtful; she's funny and we share a lot of common interests as well as sharing a similar set of goals. We're well matched, but here's the thing: She often says the wrong fucking thing, then panics, repeats it and then panics further, goes beet red and then buys me a gift. 

I'm going to recreate two encounters that happened with ~48 hours of each other. They're the best of my recollection:

&gt;Me: I'm applying for work today. Busy with classwork, taking a full course load plus an extra two seminars.

&gt;Her: Oh, wow, really busy. Must be looking forward to being done!

&gt;Me: Yeah, and working rather than studying. Paying off these loans would be nice.

&gt;Her: I don't mind that I make more money than you. Not that you're lazy, you're not, but I make more money.. I... uh...

&gt;Her: Forget I said anything. It's that I have a job and you're unemployed.... I mean... ermmm.

&gt;Her: You're studying! You're going to have a great job but you need to find your groove, you know, being unemployed.

&gt;Her: Not that you're useless or anything....

&gt;Her: I need to go........

I get what she's saying, didn't take offense, but I am never sure what she is going, says something she thinks I'll take offense to and then panics and hyper-speed speaks until she has said so many odd/borderline offensive things that she just terminates the conversation. Here's another (and my fav)

&gt;Different Friend: Penis size is so overrated.

&gt;Me: Phew! Dodged a bullet there!

&gt;Her: Aww, don't be hard on yourself!

&gt;Me: Hard. That's what she sa......

&gt;Her: It's cute! It's just the right size for you. Not that it's small, it's just not...

&gt;Her: Let me phrase... you're really good at oral. 

&gt;Her: I like your penis, too! It's not small, I promise. Show them....

&gt;Me: Umm, no.....

&gt;Her: Uhh, sorry.. gotta go. 

I feel like every time we're together there's this potential for extreme awkwardness that just won't end. Sometimes we're together and it's fine, but others... we wind up with the weiner debacle. After the weiner debacle, she sent me a box of chocolates, bought me a lobster, then sent an e-card and an amazon gift card for $50. Then called to apologize for gifts, said she was very happy with ""that aspect of our relationship"" and I shouldn't feel like there's anything wrong/I don't measure up and that she'd understand if I didn't want to see her again. 

This is honestly every conversation. I'm not sure if it's nerves or she's an awkward person or she genuinely holds odd beliefs about me and they keep seeping out of her mouth at the worst times. I feel like our relationship could be okay, or could be a horrible mess or that she doesn't have the heart to dump me and is making it so awkward that I ghost her/bail. 

Everytime I take the direct approach, she swears up and down that it's just awkwardness and that it's ""not you, it's me."" Seriously? She's using lines from Costanza.

715hwl,3,2017-09-19,[HIRING] Our startup is looking for a Hardware/Android/iOS QA Technician,Stevaavo,BostonJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonJobs/comments/715hwl/hiring_our_startup_is_looking_for_a/,"Hello!

Pavlok is a tech startup located in Downtown Crossing. We produce a wearable technology device (a wristband, similar to a Fitbit or Apple Watch) that helps people break bad habits, such as smoking, nail-biting and procrastination. We're a fun and dynamic 6-person company, and we're excited to add a new person to our team.

We would like to bring on a new employee to help us manage our testing process for new hardware/software to ensure that they're top quality and bug free.  In particular, you would be spending a lot of time testing the new product that we are preparing to launch, ""Pavlok 2"".  For example, every time we get a new firmware release from our developers, we'd ask you to download it to a device and try every conceivable combination of button presses or feature usage, to make sure that none of them lead to any kind of bug.  As you go through your testing, you'll carefully document everything you find.  You would also be responsible for testing out our new Android and iOS apps.

This is a cross-functional role, so we're looking for someone who relishes different types of challenges and tasks. For example, you'll be working closely with developers to compile, build and test ongoing work, and interacting with users to identify issues in production. In addition, we don't claim to have everything figured out, and you'll be encouraged and expected to contribute ideas to improve our technology, process and products.

We're looking for a candidate with:

* A knack for troubleshooting, and a good understanding of iOS and Android
* The patience to deal with rough, buggy, early versions of products, and also to engage in workflows that can sometimes be repetitive
* A strong ability to document your work in detail (to help our developers and engineers recreate the bugs that you discover)
* An ability to take the initiative and figure out uncharted territory

We're very flexible on the specific credentials of applicants.  As a small team, we're open to hiring someone with an unconventional educational or work background.  The most important thing is that you have those 4 listed qualities above.  We're also looking for someone who is a good culture fit with the rest of the team.  We're a close-knit bunch, and looking for someone who will be an awesome addition to our odd little group.

We imagine this as a full-time role, but we would also be open to hiring a student as an intern if you can put in enough hours in addition to your studies.  Compensation will be $30,000-$40,000/year (or roughly $15/hr) depending on experience.  Given our small size, there's also a lot of room to grow into new responsibilities.

Pavlok is a really fun place to work, and well-integrated into all the shindigs and festivities of the local startup community. If you're interested, shoot me an email at steve@pavlok.com with a resume and a note about what makes you feel you'd fit well in this role, and in our company. Hope to hear from you!

I've found a few internships I want to apply for in the summer but I'm doubtful about my chances. On top of that, I'm even more worried about trying to find a job once I graduate in 2019. Has anyone else had a shitty GPA throughout college? What did you do to make your situation not as bad?

71679l,17,2017-09-19,Teen Wolf Alternate Ending,invaderzzzzz,TeenWolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenWolf/comments/71679l/teen_wolf_alternate_ending/,"I know it's like beating a dead horse but the ending of Teen Wolf next week will probably be unsatisfactory for most people.

So I've been thinking of what ""alternate"" ending would have been the best ending for the show. As far as the show is concern, the best ENDING (not the season) is 5B's ending with Scott writing Allison's initials and join Lydia and Stiles as they study in the library with an empty seat in memory of Allison.

My perfect ending would have been Peter as the final villain and Scott is forced to kill him which reverts him back to being a normal human (as Derek said that it's rumored that if you kill the werewolf that bit you, you can be cured from being a werewolf) and it would be a callback to Season 1. Scott ends the series being a Veterinarian/Druid like Deaton. Scott will be a professional in all-things supernatural and he can act as an emissary to Liam and his pack (after Scott passes on the torch of leader to Liam) much like how Deaton was the emissary for the Hales. Stiles becomes an official FBI Agent (like Scott's dad) instead of just an FBI Intern this season. Now I'll take something from 6A's ending that I thought was good. With Scott now operating his own Animal Clinic in Beacon Hills and Stiles being a FBI Agent with a brand new car, Stiles visit Scott at his clinic and they reminisce about the past and as a homage to the entire show, we see a quick run through of events from the 6 seasons leading up to that point and their growth as a character. Stiles than get notified of a dead body found in a forest and ask Scott if he wants to go investigate. Stiles is about to go get his new car so they can both go but finds out Lydia took his new car to go shopping (callback to the old sassy Lydia we knew in Season 1 and 2). Stiles asks Scott if he still has his jeep and Scott tosses Stiles the keys and they ride out on the road to investigate and the credits roll. 

I came up with that in like 5 minutes lol. I think my ending is pretty sound and is a callback to the old Teen Wolf that we all knew and love but showing the growth of the characters we once knew earlier on in Teen Wolf as well. 

Feel free to critique my ending below in the comments OR comment your own alternate ending of Teen Wolf."

And how do I move forward now?,theGello,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/716ivj/is_it_considered_cheating_and_how_do_i_move/,"Hey all. My gf[f22] and I[m25] have been dating for about 6 months now. I know it is pretty early in the relationship but we seemed to have moved forward pretty quickly because of how well we get along with each other. I met her during an internship and we were pretty much inseparable for about 2 months and we decided to do long distance since she has to finish her last semester of college.

When we first started dating an old co-worker of hers texted her and asked her to come over and sleep with him. She was confused because the guy is in another relationship but she honest and told me how she used to be in love with him when they worked together a year before we met but asked me what she should reply. I told her it made me very uncomfortable that he was texting her and if she wanted to talk to him that I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone like that. She said she wouldn't talk to him. Fast forward a few months to last weekend. I went to visit her at school for the weekend and we went out drinking. When we got home I went to check out the time on her phone and curiosity got the best of me and I checked her texts only to find out that she's been texting the same guy. It was very obvious they were flirting with each other in a sexual way and he made it clear that he just really wanted to sleep with her because he has no intentions of leaving his gf, yet she continued to pursue it. I got angry and we got into a fight over it. She claims she just enjoys the attention but that it was just harmless flirting. She said she sent pictures where she tried to look cute but nothing scandalous. She said if he's going to cheat on his gf then that his choice and she doesn't feel at fault for never denying his advances.

Since then we've calmed down and talked about things. She said she'd never talk to him again and messaged him saying that I found out they were talking so she thinks it's best they stop unless it's work related. I feel like I should give her a chance but part of me also feels like she lied about not sending nudes and how long it was going on for etc.

I don't know how to move forward in the relationship right now. Any help would be appreciated."

I have a few good, close friends, I am days away from making it official with a wonderful girl, I am successful in pretty much everything that I do, whether I put my mind to it or not, and I am objectively more intelligent than almost every one of my peers. In my high school, I am the primary source for many people for Math, Computer Science, Physics, and Chemistry help. I am regarded as the ""smart kid,"" but I am fairly attractive and sociable, and get along well with almost every single person at the school. However, every B that I get on a quiz or other assignment, every bit of computer code that doesn't work, and every problem that I can't solve makes me feel like a useless idiot that should be and deserves to be dead and buried. My parents have conditioned me to never accept anything below the absolute highest level as a mere possibility; my dad, who has a Ph.D in mathematics, wants me to be him in school. He pushes me to join every club that I can relating to STEM, punishes me for any quarter grade that is a B+ or below, and was incredibly disappointed in me when I didn't put in 2-3 hours a day after school learning web development and data analytics so that I could intern at his cutting edge scientific research company. In general, I feel like a piece of shit, even understand my gifts in life and fortunate circumstances. I don't truly trust or feel that I could rely on anyone--I am growing apart from my friends, have never been invited to a party after over two years in high school, and have lost almost all motivation to be successful. I have been suicidally depressed for almost 3 years now, but an attempt to talk to my parents about it was been met with, and I quote, ""You're making us feel bad, so please never even mention the word suicide with us again."" I don't trust any of my friends enough to confide in them, and I am not close enough with any teachers or mentors to bring this up. I don't even know the name of my school counselor, and I don't have time in my life for any sort of therapist. I am going crazy inside of my own head, I have sat for hours home alone with a knife in hand wondering how long it would take. I exercise fairly regularly, stay hydrated, eat healthily, get at least 8 hours of sleep, I play classical guitar better than almost everyone at my school. Nothing helps. Ever. I feel like a failure and I am one shitty day away from killing myself and just not dealing with any stress or expectation ever again. I just want to done with it all. My parents make everything worse. I don't really have any real friends, I suppose. Maybe one, but she is basically in love with me and I don't know if I am as well and if I can handle a relationship right now. I am going crazy inside of my head. Nobody else knows. Help."

719b0t,11,2017-09-20,Physics undergrad with questions about future,Cm0ney34,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/719b0t/physics_undergrad_with_questions_about_future/,"Hello again, I've posted before on this sub and received some helpful responses, so I'm again consulting the internet for more help. Im now a little ways into the first semester of my junior year at a liberal arts school that's decently ranked nationally but with little recognition in terms of physics. My first year and a half here I was a little lost in terms of general direction in terms of what I hoped to study, as well as what I want to do when I do finally graduate, and my grades definitely reflect that. 

My GPA prior to declaring a physics major with a math minor was an embarrassingly low 2.4. However, in my fourth semester I achieved around a 3.4 GPA while in 2 math courses, a physics course and an english class that I needed to take in order to reach graduation requirements (Liberal Arts schools am i right?). Thus far, I've completed calculus one, calculus 2, and two principles of physics courses, 

This semester I am in a foundations of math course (with the main focus being on ""topics selected from Boolean algebra, combinatorics, functions, graph theory, matrix algebra, number theory, probability, relations, and set theory."" A course I am mainly taking as a prerequisite for linear algebra (covering Vector spaces, linear transformations, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors and applications). I am also in a physics mathematical methods course (covering partial differentiation, vector analysis, complex numbers, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, multiple integrals, and Fourier series). As well as an optics course (covering Experimental investigation of geometrical and physical optics. Specific topics investigated include: image formation by lenses and mirrors, optical instruments, image processing, interference, diffraction, polarization, optical communication, lasers and holography). 

All of this being said, I have total confidence that I can maintain a 3.5 GPA, on a 4 point scale, through the rest of my undergraduate career. Especially given my newfound love for physics and specifically much of the advanced math in behind it (possibly more so than the physics itself). 

The reasoning behind this post is that I am now seriously considering further schooling beyond undergraduate in physics. However, with mostly only background courses covered so far I have little to no idea what I would like to specialize in, nor have I participated in any kind of research program. If that doesn't make it clear enough I worry that my current statistics as well as my lack of research experience would make it very difficult to attend a highly or even decently ranked physics PHD program. 

I have an open offer from a couple of family friends, most promisingly to intern at a REIT and with a little bit more researching and networking may be able to find different opportunities elsewhere. 

Now, the point of this post is this, I would love to pursue a further education in physics, but if given my current lackluster academic and research experience I'm unsure how realistic that that is. I have a number of family members who work as financial analysts in some capacity and would also be interested in work of that nature, if further schooling in physics does not work out. 

So I ask you reddit, do you believe that if I am able to maintain a high gpa (currently a 3.5 in math/physics but a 2.65 cumulative), will I have a shot at admission to a respectable program upon graduation? Assuming some kind of research this summer (I can quite easily find something through my own school through good relations with professors, or perhaps there's an REU program that you can recommend that I apply too if that may be more attractive to admissions offices). Or should I take the hit and try for an internship that will better set me up for a career post graduation?

edit: I would also love any suggestions that any of you may have regarding future courses to take, recommendations based on my previously mentioned love for math and it's interesting applications to physics itself.
The options available are:

one of 

Atomic and Molecular Physics

Nuclear and Particle Physics

two of 

Thermal Physics

Classical Mechanics

Electricity and Magnetism

Its gotten to the point where I had to call off work because I knew it would drain me so much to smile. I accidentally got stuck in a crowd and was on the brink of crying. Today at a meeting all I could think of was how much I resented one of my friends there who kept talking and laughing while I had to focus so much on not crying. 

I feel like everyone hates me, no one invites me anywhere and I see all my friends having fun together and I feel like a freak or monster. I feel like either Im a huge downer or there's something repulsive about my personality that keeps people away. One of my best friends came out to me about how they felt like I was condescending about teasing her about her spice tolerance and I of course apologized and told her to call me out on anything else that bothered her and she responded well but again she's never invited me to anything since and its been a month. I've been trying to act more understanding of everyone and to listen to people more than I talk anymore but no one wants to. Im sick and tired of inviting people to hang out with me when they never reciprocate but I feel so fucking lonely.  If they aren't doing so its probably because Im annoying or unpleasant. 

I don't know who to talk to because I feel like Id be bother or look like Im trying to get attention or just appear too unstable for the positions I've got at school (co-prez of a club and paid internship). I cant even think about offing myself or taking time off for those reasons too but I just feel myself falling apart all over again as I've done year after year in the colder months. 

I also hate so much how when I'm strong and successful in the spring and summer I'll feel guilty in the back of my mind that I don't feel like I do now. Its like either way, I lose, and I'm losing my positivity in the whole living thing if it's always going to be a cycle of this. I just feel like a let down to myself and others because I know that I could do better if I didn't feel like this. "

Being the first time I receive money in a way that are not gifts I want to start doing things right from the beginning and know how much I own and where money goes.

My first approach was with a Google spreadsheet that did its job for what I was able to make with what I know but it was clunky adding expenses and ended up giving up. I found another way to add data from Google Forms that is much better and less cumbersome.

Anyway I want to start from scratch and either: make a very good and flexible spreadsheet OR using an expense tracker app.

Which one would you use if you were in my situation?

You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.


Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.


I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

* I took a break from Project Management 18 months ago and embarked on the trip of a lifetime through Europe. 
* Followed my interest in Web Development, migrated to Germany and worked a front-end internship for 6 months
* Transitioned into being a part-time Product Manager for the same company 3 months ago, discovered this could be a perfect intersection of my project management experience with tech / product interest
* Currently managing the Launch of a new IOS app; enjoying complete control over the product and have tonnes of freedom. The only drawbacks are no senior product people to learn from, the team I'm managing is small and due to the project being in-house, client facing work takes priority

I'm looking for advice on my next step:

* Stay in the current part-time role which I'm really enjoying, keep using free time to build skills / work on personal projects
* Apply for more serious full-time Product Management roles where I would be exposed to others with more experience but would have less control over learning / doing what I please.

It all started about a month ago when I got a random head (pulsing feeling in right temple) and facial pressure along with some dizziness and very slight blurry vision. I didn't think much of it at the start because I was doing my internship and that was keeping me busy for most of the day. Then I went back to college for my junior year and that's when things got worse. 

I started thinking I had a brain tumor because of my headaches. That thought quickly went away when I was at a grocery store and took my blood pressure on one of those machines by the pharmacy. It read 161/94, which scared me a little. I called my mom and we made a doctors appointment. The doctor said my blood pressure was normal and prescribed me Augmentin because he thought I had a sinus infection after hearing about the pressure. That eased my worry for a week or so, but as I often do, I went back to worrying. However, the night before my appointment I had my first anxiety attack. I thought I was having a heart attack and I felt like I was actually going to die. I managed to talk myself through it and relax until I fell asleep. I didn't mention this to either the doctor or my mom. Since then I have been prescribed Zoloft, but I still haven't really talked to anyone about it. 

My next fear was diabetes, even though I have no symptoms other than the dizziness and vision changes. I even went as far to buy an at home monitor, which confirmed I had nothing to worry about. That fear quickly disappeared last night as I was walking back to my apartment from our on campus library. The pressure in my temple got slightly more intense and I felt a warmth wash over me and I had a strange metallic taste in my mouth. I was sure I was having a stroke or a mini-stroke. I immediately called my mom and told her I wasn't feeling well, but after about 30 seconds I started feeling alright just really nervous and shakey .I could barely talk though (not slurring my words, just really shakey) and I felt confused. My mom assured me that it was just anxiety because I have been to the doctor recently and nothing was wrong. Now I have been worrying about it all day. 

I'm honestly not sure what to think about, but I do know that I want to have tests and scans to make sure there is absolutely nothing wrong. Everything that happened felt way too real, and I'm not sure if a pulsing feeling in the temple can be caused by anxiety, and that has me nervous as well. 

Anyway, I apologize for the wall of text, but I just thought I'd share what happened to see if anyone has had something similar happen."
71bi21,2,2017-09-20,Imposter Syndrome: a crippling terror that rips through me whenever I'm given even the simplest of tasks.,Sumnox,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/71bi21/imposter_syndrome_a_crippling_terror_that_rips/,"I got an internship doing IT work. All 8 hours a day here, 20 hours a week, feel like hell. It's a wonderful mixture of a fear of talking to people, and a fear of looking like a dumbass because I literally don't know how to do anything. Just the words, ""I'm dying"" run through my head all day.

I hide in the bathroom a lot - probably a suspicious amount of time. Everyday I just want to quit, but I need the money. Also, I'm afraid they'll all hate me when I do inevitably quit. So often I just want to change my phone number and just stop coming in.

My friend said anxiety is like a primal fight or flight feeling. Except I'm perfectly fine sitting in an air conditioned cubicle. Our brains are so messed up, freaking out for no reason. And there's nothing to fight so all I want to do is run away and never come back.

Any advice? Who can relate?"

**Background:** So to start off my GF and I are very happy together. Let's call her Mary. Mary is smart, successful, hilarious, adorable, creative, thoughtful, sexy, and pretty much everything I want in a partner. We are very different people on the surface (extrovert vs. introvert, anxious vs. easy-going, etc) but our morals and core values match up perfectly, and she makes me happier than I've ever been. And I like to think I do for her as well. We have already begun mapping out our futures together, and are planning to get engaged in the next two years.

Mary and I have been together for going on three years. We started off slowly as we both had gotten out of serious, long-term relationships prior to dating each other. It's important to note that my parents were very fond of my ex (dated for 3+ years) and knew her very well as my ex and I ended up living with my parents for almost a year. I say that to emphasize that my parents had a *lot* of time to get to know my ex and grow close to her because we all shared a home for 10 months.

My current GF and I live in a shared home together about 30 minutes from each of our respective families. We go to visit our parents as a couple anywhere from 0-3 times per month. We also go on (and went on) family vacations together: I went with her and her folks to their vacation, and she came with me and my folks to ours. I adore her family and she gets on very well with mine.

**The problem:** My family is small. I have no siblings, cousins (closest cousin in age to me is 4 years old), or grandparents. It's just me, my mom, and my dad (we do have uncles and aunts but they all live far away, usually see them 1x/year). My dad and my GF get along very well. He always asks her about herself, asks follow-up questions, shows genuine interest in her life, talks about her to me when she's not there (positively, of course!) and tells me frequently that he loves her and is very happy for us. My GF loves my dad and thinks he's adorable and sweet (he is).

My mom, on the other hand, has not warmed up to my GF as much. However, it's a very tricky kind of coldness. The kind that's really hard to pinpoint and demonstrate, which is the crux of my problem.

To give some examples: my mom very rarely initiates asking about my GF. That includes when it's just me and my mom or when we are all together. When she does ask about Mary, it's usually 1-2 perfunctory questions without any follow-up. Basically, the kind of questions where *technically* she's asking Mary about herself/her life but she isn't taking a genuine, conversational interest in what Mary is saying. For example, converstations have happened that look like this:

&gt;Mom: ""So how has work been going Mary?""

&gt;Mary: ""Great, thank you! I've been working on XYZ project and I finally got to do more of ABC, so it's been going well.""

&gt;Mom: ""That's great! How about you, upuptonandaway?"" or ""Great, how's your family?""

And that's that. So not overtly rude, just not showing genuine interest. And it's starting to become obvious to my GF and that upsets her.

My mom has also shown the tendency to change the subject to herself or me when my GF brings up something. To give an example, my GF's cousin (who she is very close to, think sister-like relationship) recently got engaged, and my GF is going to be the Maid of Honor. My GF brought this up to my parents at dinner and my mom did not ask her *any* questions about her cousin or the wedding, instead she launched into a long story about *her* role as MOH for her sister's (my aunt's) wedding ten years ago. When she finished her story, she didn't ask Mary any questions or bring the conversation back to Mary's original statements about her cousin getting married. So yeah, she hijacked the conversation.

Another example of my mom doing this but changing the subject to *me.* Now, my GF and I are in similar fields of work, but my GF has a higher degree and is more accomplished and I am very proud of her. She recently got her dream job and has been kicking ass. It's an important job and a cool title, and when we were talking about it for the first time after she had started, this was the gist of the conversation:

&gt; Me: So Mary tell my parents about your awesome new job and how it's been going!

&gt;Mary: Well, it's been a challenge adjusting to XYZ atmosphere after so long working in ABC type of environment, but I'm really enjoying XYZ! It's almost surreal after having wanted to do this for so long.

&gt;Mom: So glad to hear that! I remember when upuptonandaway was in college and he had a great summer internship doing XYZ in XYZ atmosphere, remember that upuptonandaway?? *long story about a stupid 2 month college internship I had 8 years ago*

After the dumb story about my insignificant internship that was only vaguely related to what my GF did, my mom did not turn the conversation back to my GF and her new job. It just seemed like she wanted to brag about me (and it wasn't something brag-worthy, anyway). My dad saved the day and started asking her more questions, but my mom had basically hijacked the conversation and siezed on Mary saying ""XYZ is part of my job"" and went on and on about *me* and how I kinda had an internship once that was sorta like XYZ. It's the equivalent of someone being like ""I just started my medical residency!"" and my mom responding with ""well my son took a CPR class when he was 16!!""


I hope all that makes sense, but that's the issue I'm dealing with.

The problem is that these examples are spread semi-far apart. My mom does not openly act rudely or disrespect Mary. She does not roll her eyes, look away, use rude body language/gestures, she doesn't speak in condescending or rude tones, she doesn't directly demean or insult Mary at all. But she does deflect and avoid talking about Mary, and that rightfully upsets Mary. And now that Mary pointed it out to me (I'll be honest I didn't really notice at first) I can clearly see it too, and it bothers me.

I will note that whenever this happens, I always bring the conversation back to Mary and what she was saying. I don't just leave her hanging. And my dad does too.

I'm just not sure how to address this, or even if I should. I worry that because these behaviors are so innocuous that my mom will deny that she's doing them or even not understand what I'm saying. These examples are also spread out; it's not like these glaring examples happen every time or every other time we visit. I also worry that it will create resentment/further sour the relationship between Mary and my mom. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this with my mom, or if I should just not say anything, or if I should not talk to my mom but *also* actively redirect/call her out in the moment when these things happen.

Lastly, and the reason I mentioned my ex-gf and our prior living situation, is that I've seen my mom be more inquisitive and conversationally interactive with my ex: she really, really loved my ex. Part of me worries that she's not as enthused with Mary because she got along better with my ex (my ex was very similar to my mom, Mary is not). Mary just wants to have a good relationship with my family because it's important to her, and it is to me as well.

What do you all think?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Mom shows little interest in my GF and fails to ask her about herself/her life beyond shallow perfunctory stuff, also sometimes changes the subject to focus on herself (mom) or me whenever GF talks about something/tells a story. GF is sad/upset because she wants to be close to my family, mom doesn't seem to realize she's doing it, and this behavior is kinda normal for her, unsure of how to address it. Do I confront my mother? Come up with a strategy to redirect my mom when she does this? Or leave it be?"

A story that has a theme of (but not limited to) fucking, blowjobs, father figures, objectification, tits and titfucking, being dressed up (or shown off), minor male dominance, adoration and power. It is not about abuse or pain.

Some ideas:

A friends dad who is a father figure to me, and who seems to be the only one who notices my sexuality? Maybe he finds himself making situations where he can be alone with her? Maybe hires me as an intern for a summer job? She adores him and tries to please him as much as she can.

The girl next door that you smoke pot with all the time since your wife doesnt approve of pot smoking (or many other things).  And her strict parents would never believe their good little girl was a pot smoker.

The babysitter who has a crush on the dad. Or vice versa. Wants to replace the mom, or maybe the mom is already out of the picture? Or desperately needs the money and the man is a wealthy and important man about town? or maybe is happy to please him when other older women seem to let him down?

A runaway, or homeless girl who is starving or scared and needs a place to stay. Maybe illegal immigrant? Who finds a caring but lustful benefactor to take her in. Maybe he already knows her somehow? Maybe he never meant to take her in, but he drank too much one night? or suddenly felt protective of her for some reason?

I would consider something involving minor mind control, or body modification, limited sci-fi.

Interested to hear your ideas for your ideal partners looks or personality. I would prefer this was a longer term or recurring story. I usually write third person as if I am writing an erotic novel. I prefer we play with limited characters, but there can be walk on characters if that is your thing."
71c1of,2,2017-09-20,Sometimes im not sure if i will be able to keep going,TryAgainAndKeepItUp,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/71c1of/sometimes_im_not_sure_if_i_will_be_able_to_keep/,"This is my first time writing on reddit (altough im browsing around it from time to time) and im not sure where this text is going to develop, but its probably going to be long, and there may will be errors language wise, since im not a native speaker.

Before im heading straight for what troubles me let me give u some Background on my person(ive been telling you, its gonna be a longer Story). I recently turned 21 and im am visiting university with pretty sucessfull for over a year now. I am still a virgin wich bothers me to some extend. Ive been rather overweight for most of my life and started working out about a year ago, and lost about 50 pounds since then, and im still aiming at losing more. I am watching porn too frequently for my taste, and am trying to do less, with mediocre sucess. I dont have a ton of friends, but the ones i do have, are good honest people i like a lot and are fun to be around.

If u wonder how this is supposed to help u understand my situation: I have some construction sites in my life that i am working on (like most people will have) and not everything is perfect, but that itself is totally fine. Im not in pure bliss every day but thats ok and im happy mostly. I feel like the future is holding a lot of good for me and if my story were to end here, i wouldnt feel the need to post here.

My Problem is that i dont just have to care about my Problems, and my personal battles, but about the ones of my whole family as well. If i have to remember where it started, it was probably around 7th or 8th grade. My father lost his job. My parents are not very educated, all their life they did simple, manual labor. And im happy they put a lot of effort into our education (me and my brothers), so we could lead an easier life that theyre doing. I greatly appreciate that. But when my dad lost his job, and was applying for a new one, he couldnt write his own application. My parents have no idea at all how to use a computer (literally 0, u woudlnt believe it). All his previous jobs he either got trough personal contacts or handwritten applications. But at the time that had changed, so he asked me (im extremely confident around computers and am currently studying IT) to write his application down for him and print it. But while he told me as his writer what i should write, i noticed many grammatical errors or had far better sentences in mind. So in the end i basically wrote the application on my own (Im just noticing im describing it very detailed, so ill skip a bit). Long Story short, i wrote every single one of his applications from the 7th grade, to this day. With the situation on the job market in his branch its not uncommon to change the job regularly so there have been a bunch. 

Talking about jobs, my mom mostly did the household and stayed home, aside form having part time jobs. But since i started writing applications for my dad, i did so as well for my mom. She cant use a computer at all, just like my dad, so it seemed natural id write for both. Note that i didnt mind that much in the beginning, as a teengaer is somehow seemed ""cool"" and very adult to me to do that, and my dad even gave me some money for it. They didnt forced me to.My mom, unlike my dad is extremyl shy, introverted and has trouble standing up for herself. Employers often abuse this, which lead to many job changes and me constantly encouraging my mom. Nowadays where most job offers are located in the internet, im mostly the one searching for my parents jobs as well.

To summarise the last two passages, im handling everything regarding job applicications for my parents. This itself is not my big problem, but it adds.

Lets go to my brother, he is 19 years old and extremely overweight. It is concerning and it is representing his state of mind. He is extremely lazy, and not responsible at all. When he was a little bit younger everything seemed fine, school-wise he was on his way to visit university at some point. But 4 years ago he drastically dropped, didnt cared about anything related to school and started sitting in front of his pc 24/7. I would very much describe him as addicted. His marks are horrible and he dropped out early. My parents to this day seem overcharged with the situation and dont really know how to help him. I did manage to take him to therapy, where it became clear, he had a huge problem with pressure to perform, even if it was incredible small. Basically if he knows he should to something, he becomes very stressed and kinda ""blocked"". He already had 1 year where he was home, had no job, and didnt went to school. He tried to get back at school for this year, but didnt got accepted. The problem starts here, he himself had no real interest in trying, i basically forced him to, and he only managed to apply to 1 school. Then we tried get him into an apprenticeship as skilled worker (dont know if thats what its called, here in germany we have jobs that u can learn in a company while working there, which the ""lesser"" educated often have). The whole time he told us he did lots of applications and nobody answered or they declined, but after a while i had the feeling that wasnt true, i confronted him and he told me he was lying, and didnt write any applications at all. I then assisted him in writing the applications. But it was to late since about all companys stopped the hiring for this year, and he now has to apply for next year. To prevent him form haveing again 1 year at home where he does nothing I told him he should get a social internship (in germany most places where social labor, like supporting disabled people, is done, u can do an 1 year internship, which is supported by the government and rather easy to get). He didnt write many applications, if he did i was standing next to him. 2 weeks ago there were 2 internships with a high probabilty that he would get them, A few days ago he got contacted he didnt got one of them.

Aside from this i am (i know this might sound extremely arrogant, and im aware, but sadly its the truth) by far the most responsible person in my family. Sometimes i feel like im the only sane one as well. My dad sometimes doesnt open his post for weeks, if he knows its a bill. They cant use the navigation system on their own. If theres a major problem, i am asked what to do. By now you probably got the gist, I feel like im handling everybodys problems in my whole family. Hell I AM handling most of the familys problems. While at times it feels good to know i can help the ones i love (which i deeply do), and that i myself have enough resources to solve so many problems. But often it feels overwhelming, and its dragging me down. Im concerned how things with my brother will turn out, what to do. And i know its wether my fault nor my responsibilty, its taking a toll on me. I mamanged to get a decent job for my mom just now, but she has a habit of being extremely clumcsy and fking things up. And she is already telling me that she feels like she cant handle all the things she has to do at her job. 

I could go on, and part of me wants, since i cant stop thinking about examples where i burden myself with others problems, hell i even teach a friend of mine since he has problems at uni and doesnt learn enough. Last year before i went to uni in my hometown, i applied for uni 5 hours away from my hometown. I moved, and even though i hated my flatmates ( they were dirty, loud basically the whole package) and i hated the city, and the uni, i felt incredibly liberated. For once, i wasnt the one who had to be responsible, who didnt hat to know it all. I just had to care about myself. But unfortunately the studies they offered werent to my liking at all (it was my first time at uni and i tried to study what i thoght id might like) and my family didnt went well. I skyped with my family every few days, and even after months they missed me a lost, esp. my dad had problems with me having moved out. And it seemed that the situation at homw went downhill, my family was arguing and fighting constantly and so i moved back. 

1 year from that im am sitting here and writing all of this stuff off my chest, and i am not even sure if this helped me at all. I dont know how to feel when i think about the whole situation. I dont know how i will be able to move out when im heading for my own life, when im older and finished my studies. I know at some point i will move out, but how? I feel like i cant leave my family behind. Sometimes im a little angry, for them to load me with all of that, but i know they dont do it on purpose. And then i think about my own problems, which seem so small compared to the rest, and i dont know if can even myself allow to care for them. And these are the moments when i am scared of the future. right now i am handling the situation, but will i be able to do so in a year? If my brother hasnt made any progress, if my mom lost her job again. When helping them gets harder, since for both it will be harder to find employement.

I should probably end this, i have no idea how long this already is, but its probably way too long, and not very fun to read. For everyone reading this far, sorry for wrting this in one go, its probably not very structured and has lots of flaws, but thank you for reading, since i now feel im not the only one caring about all that stuff.

71cfnn,57,2017-09-20,TehOlive's 30th Anniversary Orbfest Scheduling Guide,Teholive,FFRecordKeeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/71cfnn/teholives_30th_anniversary_orbfest_scheduling/,"Welcome to the 30th Anniversary Scheduling Guide, in the JP version of the game, this accompanied the launch of Magicite dungeons. Obviously this is not the case for Global, but we can blame that on DeNA interns. But, that means things are also a lot simpler.
 
What is an Orbfest you ask? Short version, Its like a greatest hits compilation of Orb/Gil/XP farming for a few (10 in this case) days. Which is a nice change from the 20 day fest we had in June, in my opinion.
  
**Changelog**
 
Added note about finishing Magicite weekly mission the morning of Orbfest.

**NOTE** ~~the in game notification claims the weapon and armor phase lasts an additional 3 days. You're more than welcome to trust it if you want.

Added the 30th Anniversary event, post orbfest wrap-up guide with approximate stamina usage. No major shifts to ""when to complete."" As well as information regarding the new Torment XI dungeon opening this week

**Dates/Times**

* * *
 
**Note on partially completing events the moment they come out**
 
 * Standard events give 13 total Mythril for completing them. The first 5 stages can be completed for something like 150 stamina and Multiplayer battles for 19 (if joining), so you may want to get the event started, get the Mythril, and then get some refreshes done.
 
**Personal thoughts on whether you should spend Mythril refreshing stamina**
 
Just don’t. It is far more efficient to farm specific Torment 300 bosses for Major Orbs. Save those mythril for relic pulls.
 
* * *

**How I’m judging when you juggle Orbfest with events**
 
This Orbfest is slightly different than previous ones. It is only two phases (plus upgrade materials.) So, I’m going to weigh stamina used in the Orbfest against our current favorite way to farm orbs, Torment Dungeons. Ice and Dark orbs are currently only farmable in VIII and X Torments respectively. Dark and Ice orbs also are some of the most needed orbs for new, relevant abilities, every other orb type has at least two different torment Dungeons available. So, considering Ice and Dark orbs fall into phase 1, phase 1 has priority. Your mileage may vary, and it is your stamina to spend however you see best.
  

**NOTE**
 
At time of posting I’ve assumed a standard 10 day cycle for events. I will adjust accordingly, and edit this out once that information is available.

I hope you are all well. I was hoping to find a hot older sugar daddy to take me out on nice dates and holidays abroad all in exchange for my tight teen body. I will play as a college girl who has an expensive lifestyle but no money at all.

You can play as a hot older man with a big wallet, a big sex drive and an even bigger dick. Come on guys what older man does want a horny teen sucking and fucking his big cock, telling him how great he is.

I can be one of your daughter's best mates, a student, an intern, a neighbor, a college girl in a bar or maybe on a beach (love a nude beach), tbh any ideas I'm up for it x

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

I have a huge girl crush on Dani Mathers, Sam Blacky, Tammy Hebrow, basically any hot blonde so would love to play as them!

Anyone who sends a hot gif or pic of who they want me to play as or to include in the scene wins bonus points

Look forward to playing, obviously all stuff will be 18+ on the ages

71dxds,1,2017-09-20,My anxiety has lifted to an all time high since moving on my own and starting two new jobs.,sweetsesame,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/71dxds/my_anxiety_has_lifted_to_an_all_time_high_since/,"I moved to Boston from New Jersey completely alone back in August, leaving behind my family and friends for a new chapter of independence, it's an easy visit over a weekend which is great. But, when I moved, I moved without a job until about a month and change later I got two part time jobs, one in my area of study/interest and one babysitting. Not ideal, but something. 

But ever since I began both jobs I have been struck with this utter sense of fear, sadness and something like depression during my days. Is it something that will pass with time as I adjust to this new life/space/jobs/routine? 

I feel relatively sad each morning as I get ready for my first job, I also need to get a good morning text from my mom as she gets ready for her day, if I don't hear from her right away I panic and think she's in danger (clearly a cognitive distortion), I fear the phone at work, I'm somewhat of an office assistant as well as a public relations intern. The phone fear is if I stutter or say/do the wrong thing to a client on the phone, I feel so scared when it happens but it always goes okay in the end, I am just still so fearful of it. The company is extremely small so everyone hears what is going on and is in each other's business. 

I am constantly sad I'm not around my family at the end of the day, however it's good to not be around them at the same time, it makes visits very special. 

The thing that weighs me down the most is the fear that while I'm enjoying my chance at independence, something horrible will happen to my family at home. I also started counting down the days until my internship is over, by December 2017 and I can work at a bigger company where my work isn't magnified, but in the end I know it's great experience. 

I also have constant thoughts of why I moved here at all, when I have NYC by me where I know people and my brother lives. Why did I do this? Is it all worth it? Will it pass? 

PS I picked up a CBT workbook and it has been helping a bit but I'm just curious about anyone's input. TIA. "

So, some backstory because I think it would make more sense if I explain the history between her and I. My parents got divorced when I was 9, and my dad had been jobless for the next 10 years never supporting me. She supported me. When I got into Middle School she met a guy that got her into drugs, and other stupid shit. I was neglected and looked for affection elsewhere, it being a pedophile unfortunately. 

It didn't really occur to me when I hit 18-19 and I had a mental breakdown and got away from him. I was with him (only online) from the ages of 11-18ish. My mom was never there for me and eventually lost her job and pawned anything that I had for entertainment worth a damn. My grandma then took us in to take care of my brother and I, while looking after my mom. I have a lot of resentment towards her and she stopped acting like a ""Mom"" to me when I was 10. From then on I'd catch her relapsing and tell my grandma because she was helping. My mom would tell me off and call me names, at this time I was homeschooled, and soon entering High School.

My mom has never been without a man in her life. So all of her time went to the new guy and not me. My brother moved out as soon as he could. He actually stayed with my grandma once she got back on her feet. My brother is five years older than me and was never around when she would be using. He knew what was going on but didn't stick around for it. Was out with his friends or whatever. I never really had an escape except the pedophile guy that I thought would save me, and video games.

So this continued on until I graduated High School. Things were mostly fine. My mom had a new guy move in immediately with us and she's been with him ever since. I should mention that I am the emotional punching bag for my mom. If something goes wrong in her day or she's upset she takes it out on me. Most people acknowledge it but I had nowhere to go. But it goes worse as I got older.

I went to college (commuted) and had a mental breakdown because I had undiagnosed bi-polar 2, and an anxiety disorder. I realized, I wasn't fine. I didn't know how to cook, take care of myself. I don't have work ethic. Things grew to a head so to say. I dropped out and was hospitalized. Since then I have been trying to get back on my feet. I cut contact with the pedophile, and was in Inpatient/Outpatient for 6 months - 1 year. From then, I was medicated and got my first job. I couldn't hold it for more than a month. This has happened on and off for most of my jobs since then, looking for something that would work.

My mom was never supportive. She, herself has Bi-Polar but if she was able to do something that I couldn't she assumed I was faking and would scream at me. It got way worse, my mental health and her screaming. I couldn't hold a job and was able to go on disability. My mom however wouldn't allow that. I had to have a full-time job in order to stay there. I couldn't even handle part-time at the time. So this put a lot of stress on me, I did whatever I could but my anxiety got the better of me. She stopped paying for my medication, and therapy. Started to threaten to kick me out if I didn't have a full-time job, and go to school as well.

Around this time I met a guy, and he helped me a lot with my anxiety. Took me out, and helped me overcome my fears. I got better slightly but the abuse got worse. Well, eventually my mom threatened to take away my phone and the internet. I had no job, so I don't know how she thought I was going to get one without those but I don't think she cared. New guy let me live with him because it got REALLY bad. I've been with him ever since. I have an internship right now that I do once a week, and I'm starting a new job within the next week or so. I'm doing A LOT better, but of course I still have some of issues that I can't get into right now.

The point is, even though I am away from my mom she texts me probably 1-2 a week going off on me saying that I'm going to end up homeless, and that my bf will leave me. That I'm lazy and irresponsible. Just really cruel things, out of nowhere. I am working on becoming more independent. Learning to cook, go to work and work past my anxieties, and get out more often. It's hard and I just recently got back into therapy so it's a lot better than before. But she brings me down whenever she can. She's such a miserable person.

Sorry if this doesn't mean any sense? I'm just so tired of her. I tried making this short as possible but now I think it might not make sense lol.

tl;dr - My mom has been mostly absent my entire life because of her bad choices in my childhood, which messed me up pretty bad. I got away from her abuse (?) and she won't stop harassing me."

Last night, I went to a baseball game with a sales rep. One of the male, older, reps asked me how long I had been with my company. When I replied, “Nearly five years,” he asked, “what, did you start when you were ten? You look like you’re no more than 17!” 

I will be 27 next month. I started my job right out of college at the age of 22. In those past five years, I got my professional engineering license, started supervising a couple interns and new grads, managing projects, and became an Associate, a non-voting, non-share holding partner (basically, a title that says I might be qualified to be a real partner some day.)

However, I hear phrases such as “you look like my daughter,” or “what school did you just graduate from?” And even, “you’re too pretty to be an engineer!” 

As building client relations and winning work is an important part of earning my next promotion, I worry that sex and how old I look might be negatively impacting me. I feel like people outside my firm don’t trust my skills or expertise based on how I look. 

If needed, I could post a picture. I would like to get some advice though, or hear about relevant experiences. Has anyone come across this frustration before? 

TLDR- people say I look too young; want to improve my chances of promotion. "

I want to reconcile but there's resistance from her end. I need suggestions as to how to get back with her.",vatsal0895,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/71f384/my_so_21f_and_i_21m_have_been_dating_for_nearly_4/,"Background:
Study in a university abroad, my girlfriend is my classmate. 
We are pursuing Medicine with one year left to graduate and go back home. 
Once home, we have to clear our entrance exam to get a working license in my country. 

We've been dating for 3years, 8months.
In the past, I've made stupid decisions such translated to huge mistakes which broke her heart. Totally, 4 times.
But the last 11 months were simply sublime because she only occasionally remembered one of the most recent fuck-ups and I used to console her when she found those thoughts creeping into her head, assuring her I'd never repeat that and I too feel like shit for doing that to you.
Meanwhile, I had my love for her at peak during this time. She meant everything to me, still does. 
She also helped me get through tough exams and which is why I topped my class. Grateful for her selfless efforts. 

She's always said that I'm not sweet to her, I'm not so caring, not affectionate as expected. 
She knows that my Emotional quotient is Zero or almost zero. So each year, I've been trying to build that up. 
She's had complaints that I didn't even ask her how she felt while she had fever in the first year (once), just told her to pop pills if it were severe, while I completely strayed away from the comforting talk. 
She told me this and I changed that aspect about me since 2015. 

She says when we go back for vacation, I hardly ever call her. 
I've told her that I've hated voice calls ever since 2009 because I like to have some time to think as in texting but I still tried calling her but she used to call me most times. 
Before going back home this vacation, she made up her mind she's not going to call me at all. I told her to chill, and I'd do so. 
I did that successfully for one and a half week. Then came a gap. 
Few days later, she told me again that I don't care, I don't call at all. She has to be the one calling at all times. 
I told her that a videocall is better but she always made excuses this time until she bought a nee laptop and wanted me to help her figure something out. I didn't express how I felt thinking this is okay, it's not a dealbreaker. 


This August - summer break. She's flown back home. 
We're having a talk about our future though texts. 
She asks me if we will end up together.
I say yes, we surely will but we need to wait a while because I need the degree and start pursuing PG before I see us getting married which will take long.
This didn't go down well because Last Year, I agreed to her wait for 5 years plan to get married.
But I also told her I'd try doing that by studying hard for the entrance exams back in my country. I didn't have time to do that the whole year.
The exam's pattern has changed drastically in a year which is why I'm not confident at all.
Hence I told her we'd have to wait 8-9 years before we're hitched.
She kept saying she's had plans with me whereas I only chose my career, she's such afool to think about me so much while I don't consider anything.

I asked her how would we settle finances if we aren't going to earn well or even earn by that time? What about thinking about the exams in just over a year's time? How will we pass? Where will we intern? Where will we work after?
Her reply was that'll happen on its own.

I told her she's saying things from her heart and not her mind right now. Then told her that is better to do this once you're back, we'll sort it out. Very resistant to that idea. 
Throughout the vacation she felt hurt about what I said while I kept telling her we will solve it once she's back. 

So, after this huge conversation about the future, she comes back and I'm waiting to sort it out.
So we had a talk.
She's digging stuff up that happened in the past saying that she's ignored a lot of those for me, she should've broken up with me back then, wouldn't get to see her being this foolish to trust me only to break her heart.
And she says she can't go on anymore, she's tired of it.
And she says if I really cared, I wouldn't only want videocalls. If she said she could not video call, it was for a reason like my dad is around, I'm with my parents, etc. 
But she can voice call at the same time. How does this make sense? You can let them hear but not see? 
And she says that If I really cared, I would have compromised on the video calls and would've spoken to me over voicr call for just 5 mins daily. It would've meant so much but I am very stubborn, don't think about anyone else. 
Also says that I should have said would've video called next day but for now voice is fine. 
I honestly care more about looking at her, her smile, her eyes, her cute expressions coupled with her voice rather than just voice! 

I start to lose my ground, I lose my shit. I'm stirred, I'm broken.
I was never more sure of being in love with her this last year and I was getting shafted. It felt crazy that she would dig it up after a year of happy time.
I start to break down, the first time in 9 years. She's not bothered. She's had external influences in her head.
She claims that her uncle gave her this analogy:
Take a mirror, once it's broken and you try to fix it, it's not so perfect even after putting back the pieces together. So what's the solution? Find a new one.

Her family (according to what she told me) thjnks that she's forcing it down on me and nothing I do to commit comes from within, it's been only her trying so hard to have me in her plans whereas I don't give a shit.

I'm not so expressive with my thoughts. I have thought of spending my life with this woman.
I have imagined going to every beautiful scenic spot she used to show me on Instagram, just never told her.
This June, I had planned of popping the question just before our last academic year ended on a tower standing 600m tall. I wanted to make that day romantic, wanted a special memory, wanted my efforts to be remembered and engraved into our minds.
I also knew once I graduated and passed those entrances, I'd go to her house and ask her family as to how they feel.

Quick Note: I've had a bad history with her mom in 2014 March. I don't know ehat was going on in my mind but I sent her mom a text that please buy my SO some Victoria's Secret next time.
But my SO claims that I also asked her mum her bra size.
I can remember crystal clear that I hadn't done thst but anyway, this was a bad impression.
So, I've known that her mum doesn't like me, thinks down upon me, reasonably.
But I've met her mom once at her place(when our common friends and I visited her place) and she was fine, nothing coming out but I still felt that I was not right for her kid. 
Whereas with her dad, I've gotten on his good side. Spoken well to the man at her place and when he's come here to campus to meet her. I felt it would be easier and more meaningful to get on his good sides as she values her dad's words more than mum's.

But she's shot down these possibilities and I'm left for dead. She still talks to me, because we have common friends and are in the same class, to prevent it from becoming awkward.
But she assured that if that weren't the case, she would just completely ignore me.


So between September 1st and 14th, I can say I've asked her to reconsider her thoughts, that I'm willing to change my idiosyncrasies which made her unhappy.
I'm willing to do it for her, anything.
But she's unwilling, highly resistant to my words here or even when the common friends ask her about our situation. She quickly douses the situation by saying don't take his side, he's hurt me so much. It's time to be selfish now. 

What's really bewildering and irascible is the fact that she is constantly on her phone these days, texting one guy all day. When done in class, I can see a wide smile on her face. 
On few occasions, I've sat next to her so I've seen the message pop up. The same guy. 
She met him only this vacation and she says she's so comfortable talking to him about anything, he's way sweeter and caring. Even when she gets a fever, he used to call her to comfort her. 
So she confided in him of all the stuff that's happening to us. I'm pretty sure that this resistance put out by her is his rue. 
They call each other every night, that's the most hurtful part. That's the hardest part to deal with. 

She says he's old enough to get married now, his mom is pestering him to get married right now. 
But he's not interested and according to some astrology stuff(yes, they believe that), next good moment after December or January '18 will be 3-4 years later. 
So I kinda sense what's going on but I want to pour my heart out for her, just her acceptance. 

I can't believe how can the feelings go away from a man you've spent nearly 4 years with and reach for someone (speculating), who you've met only 50 days ago. 

TL:DR: Dating for nearly 4 years, I've hurt her in the past, we've had a good thing going in the past year. 
We have a future talk, we had disagreements. 
She's thinking about all the compromises she made by ignoring my mistakes. 
She can't ignore those past mistakes all of a sudden. 
She's called it quits with me. My friends knew it at home before I knew. She framed it in such a way that she was the victim.
All in All, I don't want to let her go. She's all I need, my everything. She's my equilibrium, I love the balance she brings. 
Do you have suggestions over how I should try to get her back?

71fcwb,1,2017-09-20,I [23M] am TERRIFIED of being away from my GF[23 F] and I'm becoming dependent on her,throwaway97z,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/71fcwb/i_23m_am_terrified_of_being_away_from_my_gf23_f/,"I met my current gf while I was getting out of an abusive relationship. I was a TOTAL MESS when she met me (got drunk every day, smoked weed and cigs every day too) and yet she accepted me and helped me get up when I was at my worst and my weakest. 
We started as friends but eventually fell in love. The problem is that we met at a working holiday in an european country and when it ended we both had to go back to our respective countries.

 Long story short she willingly took a leave from her internship in her home country to follow me to my hometown and stayed with me for over half a year. We shared a house and we had a wonderful time but eventually our time was up and she had to go back to her internship back in her hometown. I couldn't even imagine how my life would be without her so i decided to enroll in graduate school in her city so we could remain together. 

Fast forward a couple of months, I realized that the price of graduate school where she lives is WAY TOO OUT OF MY BUDGET. I tried everything I could to pay but I ended up with an $8K debt that I don't know how I'm going to pay back. Now I had to take a ""leave"" from my university but I don't want to be away from her. The thought of spending time away from her makes me ACTUALLY cry. She understands my circumstances and feels bad for me. I offered her to come to my hometown again but she is in a position where she cannot leave her internship. She is at mere months to finally land a job in her ""dream"" company and out of the two of us, she is the smart and successful one (I have a BA in Photography so there is pretty much no jobs for me out there, let alone a visa sponsorship.) 

A lot of friends and family have suggested me going back to my country, make some money and come back here but I get so anxious when I think of being apart from her for such an indefinite amount of time, and the reason is because I feel like I am who I am because of her, and that without her I'm just a useless piece of shit. If I lose her I feel like I would lose my will to live because now, all I want is to spend the rest of my life with her.

I honestly don't know what to do about this, I really want to stay with her and AVOID a long distance relationship at all costs because i have had horrible experiences in the past. I also don't want to propose to her abruptly (specially now that neither of us have a real job) because it may be misunderstood given my visa situation, but she has definitely stated multiple times that she really wants to be with me in the future.

I am completely lost and confused... I'm really sorry if this doesn't make sense, I just need some honest advice. Thank you.

71gcft,1,2017-09-20,I feel like I should be happy but I'm not,cenecidopr,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/71gcft/i_feel_like_i_should_be_happy_but_im_not/,"I'm in my early 20s, and I have a decent amount of good shit in my life right now.  I'm a student and I did an internship over the summer, which helped build my confidence in my abilities in the field that I'm going into.  I have good friends, and I've lost ~130 lbs in the last year.

I've suffered from depression since I was a teenager, and I've been taking meds which were working for a while but lately I've been extremely depressed and anxious.  I pretty much constantly think about ghosting my friends and never speaking to them again and about how my dog is getting older and how lonely I'll be when she dies.  

I've also been struggling with being single.  A girl (same age as me) took advantage of me sexually for a few months when I was 13 and ever since I've had a fear of emotional intimacy and haven't had any sort of sexual contact since.  I've kind of dated a couple times but I'm always super weird and distant and it ends about as soon as it begins.  I haven't talked about it with anyone because I feel like I'd get made fun of because I'm a man who was taken advantage of by a girl.  

I feel like I need to make some kind of change in my life, but I'm not really sure what I should do.  "

71hebi,11,2017-09-21,I think I'm finally breaking... I feel like I want to give up for the first time in years,claireupvotes,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/71hebi/i_think_im_finally_breaking_i_feel_like_i_want_to/,"I'm sorry, but I can't write this post as if I'm talking to my actual mother like some people do. I have a mother, but I need one who cares and understands right now.

I used to be horribly depressed in elementary, middle, high school. I was nerdy, geeky, physically and socially awkward and went to a college prep K-12 school. Moreover, I discovered that I am bisexual, and was bullied horribly when I tried to have a relationship with my first girlfriend. Until I finally went to college at 18, I hated myself and I hated ""normal"" people, being isolated caused being different to be part of my identity. So much of that manifested in defining myself as an ""intellectual"" and being smart. I got waitlisted at Harvard, and ultimately decided to take a full scholarship offer at my state's flagship university. The following year, the same thing happened to my sister, but she went to a public university in a different state. Because of my decision to stay in-state, I'm financially independent as my scholarship covers my tuition, food, and living costs in addition to a stipend.

In college, my sense of identity translated into academic success. Honors college, competitive debate/mock trial competitions, fully funded research trips abroad, etc. The more success I achieved, the higher I climbed and the more I did. I realized that the person I had been in highschool was a nasty, awful person to be around. No one who is happy on the inside had the kinds of thoughts I did. I slowly adjusted into being a sociable, normal person. Started going to football games and caring about sports, going to the gym and working out. When my mom noticed this change, she revealed to me that I had been diagnosed with Asperger's as a kid, but she always knew I was weird by choice and could just be normal if I tried.... uhm, excuse me?? what if I had learned this sooner?? what if I had begun therapy sooner and had started addressing these issues sooner? Thank you for robbing me of that opportunity and condemning me to being awkward, lonely, and miserable, mom. 

As I got happier and had more of a social life, my GPA stumbled a bit and fell to a 3.9, which is still good. When I studied abroad for a semester, it fell to a 3.8. Honestly, as much as it hurt to get those B's, I saw them as a trade for happiness. I asked myself if I would trade another tenth of my GPA for another semester like that abroad--and I absolutely would. Looking at it that way made me become okay with it. Around this time, I added a secondary degree... I was now pursuing two diplomas, each with their own minor. Every semester I take between 18-22 credits.

My parents have always told me that my type of engineering, while respectable, didn't make enough money. They ""didn't spend all that money on private school for me to not make at least $100,000""... At some point during all of this I decided, ""I want to try to get into Harvard for law school. I'll do patents for my engineering field."" I even managed to get a trip to Boston/Cambridge in and tour the law school. I realized I had been too introverted to be the kind of leader that Harvard wants, so I opted to delay graduation by participating in a year long co-op. In addition to that co-op, I've done two other internships in engineering. My GPA is within range, and I can get the LSAT I need if I just study hard enough, right? More than anything I wish I could go back and scrub this idea from my head...

Doing the co-op put me in the same year as my sister. She wants to go to medical school. We've been on this journey for so long... and I don't think I'm good enough. She started doubting herself before I did. We're so exhausted, working 20-30 hrs/week on top of our honors classes and maintaining our high GPAs. She put so much of herself into it, but decided she wanted to take a break and that she couldn't apply for medical schools yet. She wanted a year off to breathe, to work, save up some money. **My parents threatened to disown her and cut her off completely.** It was med school or bust. I knew that applied to me too. 

But the stupid thing is, my sister and I aren't doing it our mom or dad. We don't care if we're in that toxic family or not. But somehow, we've got this disease and a voice in the back of our heads that we can't escape. We can't stop pushing ourselves to be as successful as possible. My sister is pulling out ahead... her MCAT was a 520 (Harvard's average in 2016 was a 517.3). I'm crumbling.

I have a drug problem now. Turns out I'm not smart enough to keep a high GPA across two majors/minors, presidencies of two clubs, a sorority, a part time job, and all the other shit I have signed myself up for. So a year and a half ago, I got into drugs. 

I started using caffeine pills instead of coffee when I realized how much money I was losing. When I saw how easy that was, and how much time I saved by not waiting in line on campus, I started taking them more often. I was starting my day with 3-4 just to get out of bed because I only ever got a couple hours of sleep. Eventually that wasn't enough. I went to psychiatric services and, whether or not it's accurate, I got an ADHD diagnosis and a prescription for vyvanse... and that was the beginning of the end. Instead of finding reasonable, attainable goals, I just took more and more amphetamines. It's college, when I ran out I could easily find more.

Turns out, that opens the door to a lot more. Weed, coke, painkillers, xanax, mdma, lsd, ketamine, etc. etc. That vulnerable, autistic, anime and video game loving weirdo was now drinking regularly, doing meth and heroin. If only my honor societies and professors knew! How overworked is my poor body where I can go to meetings and class coked or tweeked out and they can’t tell because I still come across as apathetic/lethargic (granted, I didn’t do anything at a super abusive level)? This past year, my sexuality exploded. I went from 2 sexual partners to somewhere above 50 when I lost count. I can’t believe the things I’ve let people do to me. Recently I’ve only been sleeping with men and women who are older than 30… I don’t know how that started, but the adrenaline from getting in shitty situations keeps me motivated. 

Eventually I overdosed on heroin, and all my secrets came out. My drug-binging lifestyle lasted a year, I got clean for 6 months. I’ve done a little bit at parties when people have offered, but I haven’t bought anything or brought anything home to do to literally fuel me and I think that’s fine. I’ve been seeing a therapist, counselor, *and* a psychiatrist for the past 6 months. I pay for them myself since my parents won’t.

If you’re wondering what my parents said… they didn’t care. “As long as you have the grades and are going to law school, you can make your own choices for your social life.” I got my shit together, especially over the past summer. However… I’m tired of it. I don’t want to keep trying to get into Harvard. I don’t want to go to law school. I don’t want to work 20 hrs a week when *my school literally pays me to go here!* I don’t need money! I have thousands in savings.

I’m tired of living this cutthroat, Wall Street life. I’m tired of getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night. I’m tired of always being tired. I’m breaking. I got a 70% on a test today because I stopped studying at 2am  instead of going until 6am and getting a 1.5 hr nap like usual. I’ve taken down 5 bottles of wine alone in the past week. I don’t care anymore. It’s 2 am again and I haven’t opened my books. I think I’m trying to sabotage my own career so I’m forced to do something else. Today I cried in my honors advisor’s office for an hour. I want to just quit, I want to drop out of school and go back abroad, get lost, and never come back. 

I just can’t get there. I’m playing chicken with myself in terms of self-sabotage. What if I find the peace I’m seeking, but later I want to come back to the bright future I’m facing now… but can’t, because I’m not longer prepared to be as competitive as I currently am. I can’t stand the feeling of not being on top. I can’t stand the feeling of not living up to my potential.

I’m physically and emotionally breaking. I have a BMI of 16.8. I have permanent bags under my eyes. I feel like I’m wasting my college experience. But if I quit now, all my sacrifice so far will have been for nothing. I **should** just finish my degrees and take time off afterwards, but I don’t know if I can make to May. Law school deadlines are coming up fast... I'm not applying. But I want out now. I want to go travel, not go to work. I’m so torn."
71jhky,1,2017-09-21,Mid swap rate vs Sovereign bond rates,n0ovice,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/71jhky/mid_swap_rate_vs_sovereign_bond_rates/,"Hi, I'm doing an internship at a fixed income fund and I'm fairly new to this market, thus I have a question regarding bond pricing.

I've observed that the mid swap rate has replaced the sovereign bond rates (T-bonds, Bunds...) as a reference to compare bond yields. As I understand, this swap rate is the average of bid &amp; ask of the nearest maturities on the swap curve matching the bond. And this swap curve is derived from market instruments that represent the most liquid and dominant instruments for their respective time horizons (if any of these are wrong, plz correct me). What I don't understand is:

Why do professionals call the swap rates the "" prevailing risk-free
yield""? I mean the LIBOR/EURIBOR shouldn't be risk free by nature? And if it is not the case, why use these instead of traditional T-bonds rates/ Bunds?

Thank you all in advance for your answers.

71jnul,1,2017-09-21,[M4F] You Were Part of the Deal,dabernath1,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/71jnul/m4f_you_were_part_of_the_deal/,"The smile fades from your face as your father speaks. What he’s saying doesn’t make sense. The words all do, sure, but it’s the meaning of it. You now belong to someone else?

Minutes ago, he rushed in the door and began to tell you that someone was going to publish his novel. His eyes were bright with the news that someone was going to help him achieve his life goal! This mysterious benefactor is even willing to pay your father a living wage while he edits and polishes it, which means he doesn’t have to rely on the slowly thinning customer base of his store. As the years have gone on, you’ve seen less and less of your father as he let go of employees one by one that he couldn’t afford to keep on. The stress and exhaustion has him looking 10 years older than he is.

This amazing news had a catch though, a big one. The rich man had seen you, and was immediately taken. When he approached your father, he already knew a lot, and had the terms of the deal already lined up. You tell your father he can’t possibly take the deal, and that’s when his eyes fall to the floor.

“It’s already done,” he tells you, the excitement slipping from his voice, “I signed the papers.”

You protest, standing up and stomping your feet. This is illegal!

“The contract was very thorough,” he says as sweat forms on his brow, “you’re going to be an intern of sorts. This will give you the best education, and opportunities I never could.”

Tears form in his eyes as you beg him to take it back. You clutch at his sweater, and he takes your hands in his. You can feel now how much he’s shaking.

“If I do, he’ll take away my funding. And- and he owns the shop. If I back out, he could take it away,” he says. “Please, do it for me.”

A knock at the door makes both of you turn towards it. Your father stands up a little straighter and informs you that the driver is here for you, ready to take you to your new life. He wraps his arms around you, hugging you tight to him.

“I’ll come visit if he lets me. I love you,” he says, kissing you on the forehead. He steps back, and nods towards the door.

I am looking for someone for a long term roleplay. I am as into the plot and world building as I am the smut. We can discuss some details before hand, or you can jump right in to things. While there’s definite dubcon elements, I think there’s still a lot of room for fun and some lighthearted parts. Perhaps you take to the lifestyle instantly, or maybe you need a firmer guiding hand.


As for ages, we can discuss that or just both decide in the moment. I wouldn’t want you to be younger than 13, or me older than 50.

My kinks are oral, anal, teasing/edgeplay, partially/clothed sex, dom/sub, rough sex, age gaps, public/risk of getting caught, name calling, light pain, group (preferably FFM), and a lot more. If it’s not listed, I am likely still open to it.

My limits are gore, scat, beastiality, futa, and rape."
71ju0s,0,2017-09-21,"Was offered a position closer to home but at less money than I'm making now, can I/how do I negotiate for more?",ScientistsForWaffles,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/71ju0s/was_offered_a_position_closer_to_home_but_at_less/,"First thing I suppose is some background: I graduated from college with a BS in engineering in 2012 and have had a bit of an odd career path (worked as an intern for a few months with the town I lived in, moved to microbiology for 2 years, and now am working in HVAC).

Currently I work as an HVAC system designer (have been in position for about a year - was a HVAC systems tech for a year prior) responsible for database work, UI Graphics, programming of HVAC systems, and project cost estimate checks. I can work from home, but am provided a company vehicle for when I do need to go to the job site (45 min drive). I am not paid for drive time.

Benefits include: 24 hrs paid personal time, 401(k) with 6% matching, health insurance with vision and dental, and 120 hrs paid vacation.

I was recently offered a position as a ""Weight Estimator"" (best description would be structural/mechanical/electrical/propulsion system estimator) for a well known naval contractor. This is a union position within the Marine Draftsmen Association and is only 5-10 mins from home.

The downside is that they are offering me less money than I am currently making (about $1600/year less) with significantly less vacation time (40 hours as opposed to 120 hours now). On the upside they do offer health, vision and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 6% matching.

My question is with this position being a union position can I negotiate for higher pay and/or more vacation time? How would I go about doing this? Do I email/call them and say something like: ""thank you for the offer, I would very much like to accept, but with your offer I would be taking a pay cut as well as a significant cut in vacation time. Is there any way we can work this out?""

I haven't accepted the offer yet, but I have to respond by the end of next week. Any replies or advice would be greatly appreciated.

71k1da,2,2017-09-21,Engineering Internship offer - have to move to a new city but need to decide in the next three weeks,korra767,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/71k1da/engineering_internship_offer_have_to_move_to_a/,"This morning I received my official offer for an Engineering Internship for 2018. Even though it doesn't start until May, they have informed me I need to make a decision before October 12th. 

The main issue I have is that I have to move about 2 and a half hours away from my college town, leaving my boyfriend behind in the apartment we share. He will most likely have an internship in our current city, so I will still be responsible for my share of the rent, which my parents pay. I will need to get an apartment/room in the new city.

The offer is for $21/hr with $2300 relocation assistance. I will most likely be returning to my current city for weekends. The internship is about 12 weeks long. Since my parents provide me with a stipend for food I will not have any additional costs other than rent for summer living, gas for weekend trips back, and internship-worthy work clothing. 

I calculated about $500 for gas for the summer, but am not sure about rent yet. Should I look for a room to rent or try and get a 1 bedroom apartment somewhere? Any advice for finding a place to stay for only 3 months? The internship is in Wichita, KS, so I don't think finding reasonable housing should be hard, but I could be wrong. 2300 (plus a really nice hourly rate) seems like a good start to make it worth moving to a new city for the summer, but maybe I'm not seeing extra costs that I should be accounting for.

My main question: those of you who have had engineering internships or have some knowledge on the subject, is this a ""good"" offer? $21/hr is more than I've ever made so it seems like a lot to me, but I'm not experienced in this. 

Another concern I have is that this is a technical writing position, something that I didn't see myself doing before I talked to the recruiter and interviewed for the position. I'm excited about the job description, but I'm wary that if I get an internship in technical writing now, that's all I'll be qualified for when I look for jobs after college. 

I also have applied for other internships closer to home that I am admittedly more excited about. Some of these internships don't make hiring decisions before December, past my October 12th deadline. I consider myself a pretty strong candidate for other internships, but obviously don't want to throw away an amazing opportunity just because I have to leave home for the summer.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I get nauseated in the mornings if I don't eat soon enough after I wake up, and I didn't eat as a big of a dinner last night as I usually do so I should have known to eat as soon as I woke up, but I didn't feel hungry at all until the nausea was hitting me pretty hard.

I had drank about 20oz of water after I woke up (do this every morning because I'm dying of thirst in the mornings). Well once the nausea hit me I started gagging and threw up a little of that water. I ate my breakfast very slowly but was still nauseated and became light-headed and had to lay down. It was odd, I just knew that if I tried to talk or move too much it would set something off. I needed to pee so I got up and said something to myself (which took a lot of mental effort) and sure enough I started crying and doing these hyperventilating gasps. My nose started to run like crazy and my mouth had lots of saliva. I had to get up again to blow my nose which triggered more weird uncontrollable cry-hyperventilating. Then I started to get a horrible headache too and I fell asleep for an hour and a half! This was after having slept for 7.5 hours last night and I took an accidental nap last night from 6:30-7:30 too. I just woke up hungry and still with a headache.

The last time this happened it was very similar except instead of throwing up water I just dry heaved and then experienced intense stomach pain that was so bad I started to cry in the same way as this time, weird gasping and lots of saliva being produced. I thought it was from the pain but now I think it's a part of this weird...attack?? 

Last time it was the last day of classes before my finals week my junior year of college. Right now I've just started a temporary job until an internship that is the last step to earning my degree. To be honest the new job has been terribly stressful and hard, it's working one on one with kids with autism. I'm wondering if this is more stress induced than something like low blood sugar? 

I'm still on my parents health insurance and I'm visiting them tomorrow and I'm going to bring it up to them to see what they say about who I might go to.

I can't really contact them now (I'd rather talk to both my mom and dad together and my mom is traveling internationally coming back from a trip), but wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions or ideas. Thanks "

71ljq8,327,2017-09-21,How to Keep This Game Alive (BAMCO I hope you're listening),LedgeEndDairy,DBZDokkanBattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/DBZDokkanBattle/comments/71ljq8/how_to_keep_this_game_alive_bamco_i_hope_youre/,"Hey y'all.

I've played a lot of Gatcha-style games, and several with formats similar to this one (most notably FF Brave Exvius).  It *appears* that the new DBZ game coming out is a Pokemon GO-style game (though only the teaser has been released so we can't be sure).  If so, that means that this game will still have an extended shelf-life, because the two formats are entirely different.

That said, the game is in need of some TLC, because - just like Goku - power creep happened.

Then it happened again.

Then it happened again.

And, while some elements of the game have been like Goku, others have been like Krillin - e.g. ""left behind.""  And could use a brush up.

Yes, it's okay for a company (BAMCO I'm talking to you specifically) to say ""Hey guys, it looks like we didn't really foresee the power creep that would happen with the game, here's some updates to some features that will hopefully bring other elements of the game in line!""

In fact you might be surprised when the community's jaw drops to the ground at such a candid statement.

I recognize these lists come up from time to time, but my approach is different - this is not ""give us moar free stuffz!""  This is, ""Make some things relevant (great?) again!""

#First up, Zeni

Come on, guys.  I mean, I go into a stage and will literally take a blank space over the 2-3 seconds of my life I have to waste seeing the Zeni animation pop up for 1.5k - 6k Zeni.  These spaces need to give 5x what they currently give, if not 10x.  In my ~45 days playing DBZ:DB, I've probably obtained about 150 million Zeni (total), and I would say 1 million of it is from those stupid squares.  A massive portion (maybe 60%??) of it is from the Bulma Level that I grinded during the LR Goku event and then grinded after to like 35 million Zeni bank (and just ran out today.  Damn those Hercule belts caught up with me, I'm at like 95).  The remaining 39.5% is from friend point summons and missions (particularly the 100k daily mission).

Give us a boost, here, because right now those spots are utterly worthless.  The MINIMUM they should give is like 15,000, with how expensive things like Z-Awakening an SSR to UR is.  Back in the day, 5k might have cut it, but not anymore.

#Next we have summons and story events.

A lot of people have cried out for 5 - 20 DS per day.  20 is absolutely ridiculous, but 5 is reasonable.

However I have a different idea.  Remember back to the [SSJ4 Gogeta](/teq) and [Omega Shenron](/phy) banners where you would multi summon for cheap (and a free one after 3), and it gave you a random number of tickets?

I'm not sure if those types of tickets have been introduced before (I mean, we have GSSR tickets and WT tickets, but I'm talking about ""Generic Summon"" Tickets), but they need to be a permanent thing.

Need.  Not should.  Or we ""want.""  ***Need***.

Why?  [Because it gives you excuses to run events with rewards](/str).  The story events we have are cool, we grind out a unit or two, grind their medals, etc.

That's fine.

How about introducing story events with event-driven currency?  Like ""puddings"" for a Beerus event.  We then have a special shop (maybe it's part of the Baba shop) where we sell Beerus these puddings for things like Elder Kais, training/support/awakening items, ***LR GOHAN MEDALS*** (maybe only 1 or 2 per event), **potential orbs** (Jesus Christ even getting these with the current daily events is tedious as fuck) and Summon Tickets.

Maybe there's also an event exclusive card we can buy (or even grind, I'm fine with that), that are similar in strength to Super Strike units.  This keeps in line with current story events.

Maybe 5-10 summon tickets are on the event (with ramping prices.  Like 3 are available for 30 puddings each, another 3 are available for 50 puddings each, 2 are available for 100 puddings each, and the last 2 take 200 each), we grind out the event and purchase said tickets, and can use those tickets on a banner that's similar to the 200m banner we had (e.g. many strong units, but none of the current Dokkan Festival ones).

It's quick, it's dirty, it's easy to program and throw at us, and the grind keeps us busy and happy.  Meanwhile you still make money because Dokkan Festival units are not on the ""ticket"" banner.  It would do wonders to extend the shelf-life of the game, because once the *current* story-mode ""comes back"" to those who have already done it - what's the point, unless you've added a new Dokkan Awakening or something?  Even then, it's sort of a ""fine, I guess I'll do this, then"" thing.

I have a lot more to say on this, but this was the single-most effective thing FFBE did, and I'm flabbergasted that the closest thing we have to this is the story events that take a day or two to grind out and last for like 3 weeks (Cabba took two days of free stamina (mixed in with dailies and a few other things I was doing) to fully SA and awaken.  Not even sure why I did it, I'll probably never use him unless he gets an amazing second Dokkan Awakening).

#Finally, we'll end with an efficient Dokkan Awakening Encyclopedia.

There are several ways this can be done, but something NEEDS to be done, because right now the game is CONFUSING AS FUCK to new players.  This WILL and DOES cause people to download the game, try it out for a few hours, then delete it after getting frustrated.  That's money lost, friends!

We get people feeding their [Omega Shenron](/str) to their [Omega Shenron](/phy) to raise the SA (yes, this happens), and other /facepalm shit.

It's not really the player's fault, the game has evolved beyond launch, but the information provided is MINIMAL AS FUCK for new content.  The Dokkan Encyclopedia is a bad meme.  Here's my idea:

* You click on the card.

* You click on the arrows that brings up the passive and links.

* You click on another arrow that says ""Awakenings"".  This brings up:

 * The Z-Awakened form of the character at max level, in the same card format as the card you have (so arrows to view passive/links, stats, etc.).  Medals required are displayed at the bottom.  If the character is already Z-awakened, you can click on arrows to the left to view previous forms, and instead it starts at the next bullet.

 * If the character has another awakening, arrows to the right allow you to swipe to that awakening and view their max stats, passive, links, and required medals in the same fashion.

 * If there are MORE awakenings, this continues until we get to the end (So [LR Androids](/agl) would have the base form, you click on that, scroll down twice, and it's the Z-awakened SSR, then the Dokkan Awakened UR, then the next Dokkan Awakened TUR, then finally one more swipe to the LR Androids).

Most of this functionality is already built into the game, programming something like this *should* be simple (though a programmer can correct me).  Making the game new-player friendly should be priority numero uno.  And right now it doesn't appear to be, excepting the free stones the game throws at you initially, at least (but that was essentially built in ""on-launch"" anyway).

#Honorable Mention (before you get your pitchforks out!) - Friend System Update

I forgot about this honestly, but I agree.  It's been beaten to death almost as much as LR VB and TBR has (there are many topics on it, so I won't get too in-depth here), but it's something we need.  It shouldn't be too hard to implement, either.

Also, some sort of ""friend gifting"" system should be implemented - where you can request Zeni, Friend Points, small (5) or medium (1) potential orbs, etc.  Many other games do this, and the only benefit right now to having friends is borrowing their leader, which is a shame.

#Your Move, Bamco

There are quite a few other issues, but these are the ones I identified as the most serious.  Zeni sounds kind of funny to be a serious issue but it's just tacky.  5k Zeni, really?  When I pull on friend summons and get, like, 1.5mil regularly?  K.  It's an easy fix that requires adjusting like 5 lines in your programming schema.  Even if each stage is manually coded, it's not that much work comparative to new content you shove out, so some random intern should be able to take care of it in a couple of days, max.

#TL;DR

The headers - Zeni tiles need to be updated to give like 10x more than they do, event-based currency to purchase a limited number of things like summon tickets, elder kais, potential orbs, etc., and an updated, clear encyclopedia to keep newer players playing instead of giving up in frustration.

#Thoughts, Opinions?

What do you guys think, are these three ideas good representations of what we need first to make Dokkan Battle great again, or should something else trump (heh) them?

71lmrz,2,2017-09-21,Am I normal?,SaveMePlease_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/71lmrz/am_i_normal/,"I am not even sure someone would bother to read all this but I will get something off my chest anyway. Sorry but this is just something that has bothered me a lot. Not even sure if this is the correct thread for this type of stuff. But here goes.
I am not originally from the country I currently live in. I moved here 2 years ago and have traveled literally to the other half of the world for college. I come from a family that has seen pretty bad times. My family in the beginning was pretty normal (at least from my perspective). My dad was in the army and we moved a lot but never has any troubles from it. My mother and father were respected in the community and everything would seem normal until (I think it was when I was in second grade) my father started losing it and became an alcoholic(he was drinking before I was in second grade of course but he was able to control it). One day while I was having lunch at home my father started beating the hell out of my mother. He flipped the table and what not and my mother just made a run for it to one of my dad’s colleague’s place. He got more drunk and just passed out on the couch or something. Turns out he started doing that because my mom wanted him to start being responsible and not consume so much alcohol. Two days later I found myself on a flight with my sister and mother away from my dad. My mom left us(my sister and I) under my grandparents place and left for work in the big city. My parents did not get divorced but were just living away from each other. My mother in one city my dad in another and my sister and I in another. We missed our mother a lot but Dad at this point was just an asshole in our eyes after several incidents of him being an asshole to not just my sister and I but my mother as well. We would get excited when mom would visit and anxious when dad did because he would just get drunk and do crazy shit like drinking and driving and running into other vehicles because he was drunk and beat us if we seemed agitated. Pretty sure he once threatened my sister with a knife(she was too little to understand what that meant). When I was in third grade my dad decided to have my sister and I live with him. Worst experience of our lives and it scarred us for life. Again he would get drunk and beat the crap out of us. He also beat up my grandmother who lived in the same city and visited us a lot. But one day it just got out of hand. He got real drunk that day and he started beating up my sister (who was in kindergarten at the time) right in front of me. I couldn’t see her getting beat up so I interrupted and he started beating me up instead . He passed out later and woke up again only to start beating me again. I remember calling my grandmother from my dad’s phone but she wouldn’t pick up for the longest time and it was making me nervous as I didn’t want dad to find me using his phone. All this was happening while my dad was having fits of rage out of nowhere every now and again. I faintly remember this entire incident. It got to the point where I actually thought about killing him with a kitchen knife (I was in third grade at the time by the way) but I just dropped the idea. It continued to go wilder and wilder and the phone I had either had no minutes left or was out of battery so I took my sister to the highway checkpost outside our house where there were two traffic policemen standing on duty(not even sure if they were policemen or random employees of the army). They let us use their phone as they saw us crying and scared. My grandmother showed up at our place later and it sort of gave me a sense of happiness as there was another adult present there. But he started beating her as well. My grandmother called her brother and took us with her to her place. The next afternoon we were on our way to my mom’s place. She decided to send us back to our grandparents’ place again but my mom was still living in another city because of work. I hated it without mom. So did my sister. But my mom did what she had to. She was in a big city alone, broke and no other person to go to. But we were too young to understand what she was going through. She has had her share of pain too. She got robbed of her important possessions from her apartment but she never told anyone about it. My dad did not send her any money at all. She went from a happy housewife to living in a small apartment with no money no family or support. Our dad kept visiting us and created havoc whenever he visited. We were terrified of him. When I was in 7th grade my dad was found dead outside his apartment complex. That was probably the happiest day of our life(it sounds bad but it really was a big relief) I completed my 8th grade and then my mother finally decided to have us reunite at her place. She was still broke but was better off than before. She had moved into a new apartment which was small but bigger than the one she was living in before. She had started dating this man we then met finally. Turns out they had been dating for a while. But she had not told anyone about him to anyone as she was not comfortable about the idea(they are still together today). We did not want any attention so we lived in isolation. Isolation in a sense we did not disclose any information about who we were to anyone we met. We were living life as super broke and on the brink of being homeless poor. We still do but it was way worse before. My mom started getting monthly support money from my father’s retirement pension which he would have otherwise received if he were alive so things slowly got better. This will sound weird but we were finally able to afford AC after a while so we wouldn’t die in the heat of summer. My classmates never knew much about me. I went to the Military school in the city. All they knew about me was that my dad was in the army and that he died when I was in 7th grade in a car accident. When I was in 11th grade I met my friends who now know about my past. I opened up to them just recently after things started bugging me. It is difficult for me to tell all this to anyone because I am tend to think a lot about what people would think of me. Even while typing this out I feel people will call me out for being an attention wh**e. Anyway, a lot of other things including family issues and how people treated us bugged us a lot. My mom cried a lot at night. Getting anything done was struggle for my mother. There was a lot of complication with everything. So she told me about the idea of leaving the country for USA for college. I was all up for it. I had always wanted to experience life in a different country. Also, getting into a college of my choice was very difficult back in the old country so coming to the US was an idea that just made sense. I prepared for SAT and got a decent score to get a scholarship in a decent university here in USA because without a scholarship there was no way we could have afforded college in US for me. I never partied in my life. I never did drugs or alcohol or tobacco. I never got into dating anyone (I did date this one girl but it never went anywhere). I never really met people from school outside of school. I had friends in my building and we had great times but I never really did anything ‘fun’ in high school except for like one or two times. I had a really boring life (I still do). It was all because we were broke and I had dreams to chase. I saw pictures of my friends having fun and doing all sorts of things together and I just wished I could experience being normal. I saw my friends wearing all these cool branded clothing but I had all the inexpensive stuff. My friends had all the cool phones and continuous access to the internet which made them connected to each other all the time which made me feel disconnected. Some friends of mine didn’t have this access to the internet because of strict asian parents but they still found ways. I never had any shortages of anything in my life all the basics were there but I guess what was normal to my peers was just superior to me and it just made ne dread all day. Anyway, somehow my mom was able to pay for all the expenses related to applications and standardized tests and all the kinds of immigration process applications and my plane ticket. I came to the US alone with no contacts here in US at the time. I was happy and scared at the same time. Happy that I was following my dreams. Scared I was away from my family and friends again. Scared that there was no room for error for me. One mistake can cost me my stay in college. College and studies in itself is not that difficult for me but all other things like finding internships is. I cant take any leaves from work because I have bills to pay. I still have not been to a single party. I have very few friends but that is something I prefer to be honest. I have no idea how to talk with a girl from a dating viewpoint. I have questions like ‘do girls don’t like me because I am ugly looking?’ or ‘maybe because I am from a different country?’ ‘do I not know how things work here or am I just a loser?’ I have so many insecurities and fears. I know I have low self esteem and confidence. I constantly think about what people think about me. What I am trying to communicate here is that I have zero social life. I feel I am depressed and I have constant headaches. I do not have money most of the times. My past makes me feel weird whenever I think about it. It was never a problem like this before but suddenly 7 years later it is all coming back to just ruin my head. I constantly think about what people think of me and if I am a social anomaly. I try to fit in but I feel I am not. I want to be normal. But I do not know how. Not having a social life bothers me a lot. I feel not being able to do all these things like being in a relationship or having friends I talk with and meet with often is going to harm me in the long run. How can I know I am normal? How can I tell I am doing the right things? It is all so confusing. I have suicidal thoughts a lot of times and that is why decided to rant.  "

Scotland don't have an equivalent to D1/D2 so I'm going to have to self study. I got an A in our 'advanced higher' maths which is the equivalent so I should be fine on most of the necessary background knowledge. Is there any major difference between the exam boards? Preferably the most difficult one if such a thing exists.

Would also be grateful for any recommendations regarding the subject itself."

I am currently a new-grad with a degree in Bio from SJSU with a GPA of 2.57/2.6 (Last 2 years). Went into college wanting to do graphic design (always liked art), but I realized that my parents wouldn't be too happy with me so I went into science. After taking a few courses, realized I didn't want to go to med school so I wanted to pursue a career in radiology. This led me to not really trying in school. Then soon after I graduated, I received an internship with my local Public Health Department. After this, I really wanted to go into biostats/epidemiology and get an MPH but after projects dealing with data analysis and some graphic design, I realized I don't want an MPH, but a degree in HFE.

However, being a bio major my foundations for design/computers are pretty basic. I am not a noob, but I still feel as if I should go back to school to learn properly. 

I was wondering what my chances were and what schools would be a good match for me. 

tl;dr: Im a bio major that didnt do so well in school and want to get into a masters program for HFE. Just dont know where and want to know my chances

""What the fuck is this?"" I yelled out as I closed my inbox.
""Reddit?, They want me to try fucking Reddit? What kind of soup eating idiot do they think I am?"" I quickly opened Facebook up on my laptop and started furiously typing out personalized
letters to all my friends and family. I couldn't believe this scumbag ""Todd"" thought I wasn't a good fit for Facebook. This is going to take me hours...

~Meanwhile at the new Facebook Neural Data Logging Center in the desert somewhere in Nevada

""Todd, Mr Todson... Sir"" The pencil pushing assistant slowly poked his head around the corner of the solid oak office door. ""Sir, uhm, I think you need to see this please."" His voice shuddered in the way only a frequently abused intern could do. 

""What. The. Fuck. Do. You. Want. Now. Garry?"" Speaking to the young man like he would a dog that just shit on his bed. He looked up from huge rows of computer screens and removed his headset, rubbing his temples angrily. He slowly stood up so his intern Gary could see the disgust that was mounting on his face. 

""Uhm, well you see."" Gary stuttered.

""What Gary? My time is money.  What the fuck is it now?"" He slammed his hands on the desk as his face began turning purple. ""You little shit stain, you better start speaking now!""

""Sir he's back online, he didn't turn off the Neural Interface and now it's worse than ever."" He screeched out. ""Johnson and Gibbs already killed themselves in an impromptu murder suicide pact and Lopez is standing on top of the mezzanine screaming that he's gonna jump. No one can do anything to stop him and he's asking to see his family.""

Todd's face turned green. He slumped back into his chair and started shaking.

""Sir, we need you to come out here, the Director wants to see you."" They both shook at the words.


~Back in Tony’s bathroom

Tony sat on his toilet with his pants down and laptop on his knees. He pushed and popped and banged the keyboard like a TV hacker attempting to break into the mainframe of some faceless government entity. He had been at it for hours, sending fiery letters to each one of his 913 friends and still had more than two-thirds of the way to go. Not just quick notes to his loved ones, these were long rambling theses that went on for pages. Each one full of more anger. 

“How dare they?” he kept muttering to himself over an over. “Asswipes.”

“I’ll show these fuckers. I’ll put up a one star review on the Play Store” He grabbed his phone from the counter next to him and minimized the Facebook app, thumbing through his phone, fevirishly tapping the screen.

~Back in the shitter

“That’ll fucking teach em’.” he thought to himself leaning back against the comode proudly. He sat the phone back down, facebook still running on it and decided to take a little break from all the letters he had been writing. “My pants are already down.” He joked to himself. He opened a private window in his browser and began typing in his favorite web address.

~Faceook Nueral Data Logging Center

The alarms had been sounded and it looked like a scene from a cold war command center during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Red lights rotated and illuminated every coridor as interns and techs ran in every direction. Many of them carried personal belongings, presumabley memories of different times for them.

“Get down from there Lopez!” Screamed a young man clutching his canvas backpack. “Think of all the good, please!” Lopez was standing on the edge of the railing, crying as he placed a noose improvised from the janitors closet rags and mop heads around his neck. He had tied it off to the railing.

“Thereis no fucking good you idiot! Not anymore. Can’t you see that? This changes everything. I can’t live in a world like this anymore. Everything, EVERYTHING we’ve ever known has been a lie.” He tigtened the soiled rags around his neck and plunged down from the yellow handrail. Their was a loud snap as he hit the end of it and the knot broke, sending him end over end towards the tile floor three stories below. 

Todd stepped over his body with indifference as his intern Gary clutched his stomach, puking everywhere at the sight of Lopez hitting the hard floor. He was leaving Lopez footprints with one shoe as he rounded a corner in the hallway when he looked up and saw the Director yelling at a group of crying interns. 

“Todson you scum fuck! Get over here now!”

“Oh God, I think I’ve outdone myself. That was incredible. My feet are fucking tingling. Jesus Christ.” He reached for some toilet paper. “Whew!” he said in a voice of accomplishment."

__________________________________________

Ethan Brenthouse took a long, slow sip from his mojito, draining it down to the ice. He had to admit, as much as his preference was for American rye, the Dominicans made a damn good cocktail. He lazily signaled to a wide-eyed waitress, who quickly shuffled over.

""Another please, mamacita"" he sneered in his distinctive, privileged drawl.

""Of course sir,"" the young girl quietly responded, giving him a pained smile before hurrying back to the bar. In the meantime Ethan sat back on his chair, folding his arms and listening to the waves of the Caribbean crashing into the white sand of Puta Cana Playa, just a hundred or so feet away.

It was good to be American again.

It was hard sometimes to process how much the country had changed in a few short years. Ever since the astonishing electoral victory of the Founding Father's Party in 2020, America had finally fulfilled its Manifest Destiny and become the Empire it always deserved to be. The red, white and blue juggernaut had steamrolled through Venezuela in 2021, crushing the socialist uprising and liberating the world's largest proven oil reserves. Across Latin America rebellions and left-wing insurgencies everywhere from Honduras to Peru were crushed by US-backed dictators using America-made weapons. And yes, the FFP had also built the big, beautiful wall on the Mexican border.

The entire southern continent was now nothing more than one huge maquiladora, making American goods for next-to-nothing and pumping money into the glorious US economy. Places like the Dominican Republic had become veritable gold-minds for American investors. In the morning they could grease some palms, and displace a few hundred favela-dwellers to build a new luxury hotel for American tourists. In the afternoon, dine with corrupt government officials to ensure that US corporations could have monopolies on the country's natural resources. And in the evening, party with an army of Latina sluts, all desperate for a principe blanco to take them to the US.

Which brings us back to Ethan Brenthouse.

Tall, blonde, and chiseled from years of polo and lacrosse, Ethan was about to enter his final year at Dartmouth, and had decided to take the summer to ""intern"" with a venture capital firm down in DR - one owned by an alumni of his frat. Ostensibly Ethan was there to help find new, market-friendly investment opportunities for the growing and dynamic American market. In reality this just involved a lot of partying and drinking, for which Ethan would receive an extremely generous stipend and a job after he graduated with one of Washington's biggest lobbying companies.
Tonight, however, Ethan wasn't interested in business. He was interested in pleasure.

He had tried to make some vague promise to himself to stay faithful to his girlfriend back in Dartmouth over the month he was down in DR - after all he'd cheated, and been forgiven, so many times it was honestly farcical at this point. That changed his second night in Puta Cana however, when he found himself in a strip club's VIP room with some whore on her knees in front of him, head bobbing up and down. The women down here were just so...desperate and servile. Was it the Catholicism? Their sense of inbred inferiority? Or just the fact they knew 21-year-old Ethan was in possession of more money than they could ever dream of?

The waitress returned a deposited his mojito with a timid smile before disappearing. Taking a drink, Ethan's eyes scanned around the hotel's restaurant. It seemed the Mandarin had taken extra care to have plenty of eye-candy on display for their Western visitors, so Ethan wasn't exactly lacking for options. Waitress? Hostess? Classily-dressed girls, here all alone, who were likely hookers? One way or another, his privileged white seed would be flowing down some puta's throat tonight...
___________________________________________

Hi there! Do taboo themes like corruption and raceplay turn you on? Do you want to explore the sick, dystopic side to American colonization? Do you want a well-written, eloquent roleplay that can be either short-term or long-term? Well then you're in luck. 
This is a story where, together, we craft the downfall of a beautiful, young Latina girl. Maybe she's a waitress, struggling to make ends meet, and sees Ethan as a ticket to the top. Maybe she's a student, wide-eyed by Ethan's riches, or maybe she's a high-class escort, surviving a dystopic world, who knows how to give boys like Ethan the Latina experience they crave. Whatever character you choose, it'll be one where Ethan gets to realize his innate superiority over the mulatto hoards of Latin America, fucking their women just as his country had fucked over their people.

I realize the prompt is quite dark but I'm far, far more interested in mental degradation and corruption than anything physical. I find it so much hotter when a girl forces herself to willingly submit to an arrogant guy then any actual rape scene.

If you're at all interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you!"

(FTP, Long, Lots of background, Ranty)",Endorenna,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/71n8wp/my_mom_and_the_brownie_mix_aka_can_you_please/,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I've commented in the comments a few times, but today, I finally want to post.

&amp;nbsp;

Background:

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 23 year old female. I have two siblings, both older sisters, Sis1 (almost 30) and Sis2 (26). Both of my parents are alive, and Sis2 is married to BIL. That's pretty much my entire family. Feel free to skip down more if you want, the background here is kind of long, probably too long.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a college graduate, and I want to work in video game animation. But, that's a very difficult field to get into, so right now I'm living at home with my parents. They insisted that I do both of my internships locally to save money; that took almost a year because they were long internships and had to be done during the Fall/Spring semesters. Since May, I've been taking a medical transcription course so I'll have a technical skill I can earn some sort of living at. I worked full time retail in high school, then again for a couple of summers while I was home, then again this past Christmas season, all at the same place. A combination of introversion and rapidly worsening depression made it clear to me over the past Christmas that I simply cannot work retail for my own health, because I was very close to being suicidal during that month just from having to deal with so many awful people. So, I'm not working right now (apart from a brief stint at another job that turned out to be even worse). This comes into play in this story because as my parents' dependent, I give my dad credit card receipts for any groceries I pick up for my mom or buy for myself.

&amp;nbsp;

Sis1 is an abusive covert narcissist who throws shoes at tiny dogs sometimes. Currently she's overseas, and has been for at least a year. She's coming home soon, and she'll be staying with our parents too. Yay. I'm sure there'll be more about her in future posts.

&amp;nbsp;

Sis2 is overall, quite nice. Sis2 got married to BiL a couple years ago, and next month she'll be giving birth to their first child, Niece. Sis2 and BiL live nearby.

&amp;nbsp;

My dad and I live in the same house, but we honestly don't have much of a relationship. We've never been close, and we more know each other in passing because we don't have the same interests. Also, my mom has never been a fan of open communication in the family, so he's not even aware of just how abusive Sis1 is. He's extremely focused on being the protector of his children.

&amp;nbsp;

My mom is, as my therapist and I say, a wonderful person, but a TERRIBLE mom. My main issues with her concern her being an enabler of my abusive sister and ignoring my medical issues. Part of what's written below is about my weight gain, so these are the main relevant parts concerning medical issues and weight. My mother, an OBGYN (though she hasn't practiced for almost twenty years now), knew I had PCOS, but ignored its side effects about weight gain and just berated me over gaining weight. Four years ago, my dentist suggested I had sleep apnea because of several things, but my mom brushed off getting a sleep study done until my dad finally suggested it too earlier this year, because ""Well, nothing can really be done for sleep apnea anyway, you wouldn't like those masks."" I now use a CPAP machine every night, and guess what? The weight doctor said that sleep apnea cuts your resting metabolism in half too! Actually treating my sleep apnea instead of ignoring it has helped me lose weight! Gee, would've been nice to have that sleep study done four years ago. My GP diagnosed me with clinical depression when I was 16 and started me on a low grade antidepressant. Said GP suggested therapy as well. My mom's reaction? ""Oh, you don't really need therapy, just don't spend as much time around Sis1."" (I was LIVING with Sis1 and my parents. Thanks mom.) Summer 2016 my depression was so bad that I finally knew I had to get therapy no matter what she said. Even though she knew who Sis2's therapist was, had the contact information, and insisted on being the one to make any medical appointments for me (at that time, I now do it myself), I literally had to sob and beg her to make an appointment for me four separate times over two months before she called the therapist.

&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, now that I've written all that out, I've had to calm down a bit from what finally pushed me to write here, so hopefully this will be coherent.

&amp;nbsp;

I am overweight. I've been overweight since my mid-teens, when Sis1 began manipulating Sis2 into badgering me about food (a fact that Sis1 has since bragged to me about as part of telling me how well she knew me - i.e. she knew that being badgered about food would push me to eat more instead of less). Between that and being clinically depressed with no diagnosis or help, I ended up with horrible stress eating problem. I'm about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall. Before college, the highest my weight got was 170 pounds (77 kg), but during college, things got bad.

&amp;nbsp;

I didn't work during college because I had a great Honors scholarship that was GPA based, and my parents and I agreed that it wasn't a good idea to risk my homework time and GPA for a minimum wage job that wouldn't pay me enough to cover the scholarship anyway. My parents agreed to pay for my groceries and art supplies, which was wonderful. Unfortunately, that scholarship was only at a very restrictive Christian college, where I felt constantly judged and smothered (so good for depression, obviously!). While there, I also realized that I'm bisexual, in the middle of being told that gay people are a plague on America. Besides that, the major I was promised fell through two years in. Because of the scholarship, I couldn't afford to transfer schools, so I had to do a double major in related subjects while doing the Honors program to keep the scholarship, while keeping my GPA above 3.5. I did it, but I didn't have much of a support system.

&amp;nbsp;

I had a couple friends, but they were busy with their own schoolwork, understandably. I didn't even have a car, so I couldn't get off campus without help. The school offered counseling, but with the caveat that the counselors would report anything they felt the school should know about - so with a large part of my stress coming from being bisexual at a conservative Christian school, I certainly didn't trust them. The medication for my depression wasn't working, and my GP was several states away. Whenever my mom called, it was mostly to vent to me about whatever horrible thing Sis1 had just done, or to vent to me about what my dad had vented to her about, or to badger me about my homework to see how it was going. Her nagging me about my homework got so bad that I started ghosting her calls. So, stress eating happened a lot while I was doing my homework and such. By the end of the first year I was 200 pounds (91 kg), so I stopped eating at the cafeteria and got groceries with the help of friends. That slowed my weight gain a fair bit, but by the end of my four years, I was 250 pounds (113 kg).

&amp;nbsp;

This past February, my GP referred me to a weight loss program through a local hospital. In March, I started the weight loss program, which consisted of four 200 calorie meal replacement shakes a day and nothing else but water, with the occasional 'emergency meal' of a chicken breast, but still no more than 800 calories a day. It was tough, but I've been doing mostly okay on it. In the past six months, I've lost 50 pounds (22.5 kg).

&amp;nbsp;

My therapist tells me I look great. The weight doctor says I've done fantastic so far. My friends tell me I look great. But I still feel like a failure.

&amp;nbsp;

A large part of why I still feel like a failure is, frankly, my mom. She cannot stop trying to micromanage my food. If she fixes me a chicken breast when she makes my dad one, she hovers over my shoulder and loudly asks me how I make sure that it doesn't have more calories than I'm allowed to have. Recently I've undergone a lot of stress, so I replaced some of the MRE shakes with some food, like making myself a couple pancakes and sausage, in limited amounts, keeping track of the calories. But when my mom sees me stirring up the batter, she comes over and starts asking me, ""So, how many carbs is in that? How do you calculate how many carbs you can have? How many did the doctor say you can have, exactly? How many calories is in that? So how do you calculate this?"" And so on and so forth. I try to grey rock her, but she keeps badgering me until I get a bit snappish. For instance, the other day, she came over and started in on the barrage of questions about how many carbs are in the pancake mix. So, I just told her, politely, that I wasn't going to start reporting my carbs to her. She got all big eyed and sad looking, said she was just asking, and wandered off for a minute or two, only to come back and start asking MORE questions about the food until I snapped and said, ""Look, stop trying to police my food! It's not helping!"" At which point she got huffy and walked away.

&amp;nbsp;

Admittedly, I have also been sneaking some other things. Some days, when I'm really stressed out, I've been having a small amount of Chex mix or something instead of one of my shakes. I have the Chex mix in my room, privately. I didn't want my mom to know about me having that because I didn't want to listen to her go on about how I shouldn't eat it, so I actually withdrew cash from an ATM, bought the Chex mix, and snuck it into my room so I didn't have a credit card receipt to hand my dad, which my mom might then see. I did it that way because every time I walk in the house with a grocery bag, she walks over and asks me in a bright, peppy voice what I got at the store, and she's questioned me about some receipt items that I took to my room in the past. I thought I was being paranoid. Then today happened.

&amp;nbsp;

This is where Sis2 being pregnant comes in. Because of this sub, I've been quite aware of not wanting to stress Sis2 out when she's having the baby. I texted her the other day and offered to make her some kind of boxed cake or cookies to have waiting at her place when she comes home from the hospital with Niece, offered to go over and feed her cats if she and BiL need to stay at the hospital longer than a day so BiL can stay with her, things like that. She said that brownies with M&amp;Ms sounded great, so I got a box of brownie mix and some baking M&amp;Ms. There's some tension between Sis2 and my mom right now (also related to my mom trying to micromanage things), and I'm trying to stay out of the middle of that, so I wanted to keep the brownies a secret from my mom. Besides that, I just wanted to do something nice for my sister without having to report it to my mom. I'm even planning an extra surprise for Sis2 in the form of trying to make our family, from scratch brownies recipe too, along with the box mix brownies as a backup. So when I came in, I wrapped up the mix in its bag and hid it, then I immediately took the receipt to my dad's office room and left it on his desk, assuming that since he would file it in a minute, my mom wouldn't see it.

&amp;nbsp;

Boy, was I wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

A couple hours later, my mom came into my room (without knocking, gah) to ask me about the receipt, because she 'just glanced at it and saw that it had brownies and cookies and things on it'.

&amp;nbsp;

For one thing, no, it didn't have cookies or anything cookie related on it.

&amp;nbsp;

For another, WHY THE FUCK DID SHE HAVE TO GO CHECK THE GODDAMN RECEIPT, THEN COME [I]CONFRONT[/I] ME ABOUT WHAT WAS ON IT?! I DIDN'T BUY FUCKING COCAINE, I BOUGHT A BOX OF BROWNIE MIX!

&amp;nbsp;

I'm so tired of this.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now, I'm in a depressive slump after a car accident and some other things. I'm preparing to have to live with my abusive sister again for several months. I can't work up the motivation or energy to do much of anything. It literally took me two days to convince myself to watch some episodes of a TV show I haven't seen yet instead of just turning on Andy Griffith and zoning out while it plays something familiar and I play Minecraft. I haven't been able to get myself to touch my medical transcription course in a couple weeks (it's online and self-paced, fortunately). I talked to my therapist, and I'm meeting with my GP in a few days to see about upping the dosage of my antidepressants or switching it because this is so, so bad. I TOLD my mom how bad it's getting, how stressed I am, that her trying to police my food makes me want to eat more, but she still comes and fucking confronts me over goddamn brownie mix.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been trying to convince myself to post here for a while, and haven't been able to find the energy and motivation to. Turns out that anger and frustration is a helluva motivator when it boils over.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know what to do. I try grey rocking. I try asking her to stop. I try begging her to stop. She always stops for a few days, then forgets and starts again. If I get mad at her for it, she usually ends up pulling a DARVO because my parents paid for my groceries in college, and she thinks I should have been able to eat at the cafeteria without gaining weight because 'everyone else does'. Fuck me for being fat, I guess.

&amp;nbsp;

After she came to my room about the brownie mix, I told her quite frankly that she's making things worse by trying to police my food. She just kind of got smiley and wide-eyed and said, ""Oh! Well, since I offer you food when I have it sometimes, like a chicken breast or something, I just figured asking everything else went hand in hand, part and parcel of it all! Okay!""

&amp;nbsp;

That's the most of an answer I've ever gotten out of her about why she does it, but in a day or two, I'm sure she'll be back to her usual self.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - My mom won't stop badgering me about the food I eat even though I've lost 50 pounds over the past six months, and I had to let her in on something nice I want to do for my pregnant sister.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sorry, this was mostly just a ranting post. It's probably not even something I should submit. Apologies for all the background.

I went to pharmacy school for a 6 year program due to peer pressure from my parents. I grew up in a low-income family, so we believe a medical related job would provide job security and a good income. I was a 4.2 GPA honor student and liked science, so I went with it. However, I took internships and jobs for community/hospital/industry pharmacy and absolutely hated it. I didn't want to dedicated 12 hours a day to a job that was going to numb me. I was so miserable third year to the point where I attempted suicide because I was that miserable, but didn't because my parents would have to pay the loans when I'm gone. I'm ok now, but continuing pharmacy school would have required me to take anti-depressant and continuously go to therapy. I decided to stop, because I didn't want my life to go in this direction. If I continued fourth year, I would have to take another loans with SallieMae and add $30,000 to my $60,000 loan for fourth year. I backed out, knowing I would fail fourth year from how miserable I was. Tbh, I still have thoughts about dying if things go very wrong because I just found out my $60k loan would be forgiven if I died.

Anyway, I decided to attend a community college this fall semester for foundation class requirements for next semester, then transfer to a public art school to defer my loans and start heading towards the art degree I always wanted. Tuition is very cheap for both options due to financial aid, scholarships for next Spring, and the affordability of both schools. I don't have to take loans to attend these schools, which is great. I also plan on getting a job, so I can pay off rent and put money towards my loan. I am unbelievably happy when I make art, so that has become a way of recovery for me from those suicidal thoughts. While I was in college, my hatred for pharmacy grew my love for art. I want to go to art school to get a degree in illustration, industrial design, or graphic design. If cosplay or art doesn't work, I still have two years of undergrad to transfer credits so I can get a medical degree at a cheap college. 

My concern is, am I making the right decision? How should I go about the 60k loan? What are some options that are available for me? I'd really like the guidance, since I'm a 21 year old figuring out what to do.
---

To be honest, my parents don't even know I'm attending college for art. They still think I'm a fourth year at pharmacy school. I was going to tell them, but my grandmother passed away (and was buried on my birthday) and I couldn't live to make them more sad from the situation. I already explained to them in the beginning of summer the consequences of me continuing the pharmacy program, and they pushed me to keep going to pharmacy regardless. My parents are very loving and take care of me, but their stubborn/traditional way of thinking is the one flaw and guilt I have with them. I'm gonna have to talk with them, because I was thinking of driving instead of renting to save more money.

I grew up as a brilliant, artistic kid. I was able to pick up skills in traditional and digital art at a young age without going to school for it. I love cosplay; making costumes and bringing digital things to life really polishes and expands my artistic capabilities. I have a small social media presence (I focused on Pharmacy over hobbies), but I can definitely get myself out there and my connections/good friends will help me advance in my goals. Many of my friends think I can get very far in life if I take advantage of these opportunities and bring myself out there (if I actually sucked, I would have been realistic and probably get a different degree). I'm about to get a tour at a HQ (secret, but very famous company for you gamer nerds) and that'll even open up more opportunities for me.  I think if I work hard and budget myself properly, I can become successful.

Thanks for reading my story and I appreciate all forms of advice and help, even if it is tough love or a reality check. "
71nzm6,6,2017-09-21,Solstice: Ending and Wrap up,SOLSTICE_PHX,hogwartswerewolvesA,https://www.reddit.com/r/hogwartswerewolvesA/comments/71nzm6/solstice_ending_and_wrap_up/,"**PHASE TWENTY**

*SEPTEMBER 21st*

I calmly flew the ship as it closed in on Earth’s atmosphere. /u/pizzabangle lay on the floor, not quite alive, but not dead either, next to /u/emsmale in the aftermath of their earlier skirmish. /u/Mrrrrh sat quietly in the corner. There was a feeling of calmness in the air, though it still felt as though something wasn’t quite right.

I decided to break the silence. 
“You knew about this, didn’t you?”, I asked. I knew at this point that she was Administration. “You knew about all of it.” 
/u/Mrrrrh looked up and replied. “I had a vague idea”. 
I couldn’t help but crack a smile. “That makes sense, I suppose.” I took a moment to think about everyone that we’d lost, everything that had happened, and the things that I’d been forced to do. “It’s hard to believe that we’re the only ones left”, I said. 
She looked down sullenly before asking, “What do you think is next?”. 
I considered the weight of that question and found myself struggling to come up with a good answer. 
“We rebuild, I suppose.” 
“Like a phoenix, rising up from the ashes”, she chuckled. As silly as it sounded, for some reason that resonated with me. 
“Phoenix…”, I pondered aloud. “Maybe that’s what we rename the company.”
“I dunno”, she said. “It doesn’t sound modern enough. What you really need is initialisms that sound cool… Or something”, she suggested jokingly.
I thought about this for a minute.
“Solstice PHX”, I blurted out. “That sounds cool, doesn’t it?”
She considered it for a second. “Yeah, I suppose.” She smiled.

Suddenly, there was a large impact and the ship sharply jolted. 
“We’re entering the atmosphere!”, I announced. 
It occurred to me at this moment that there was no way that I could land the entire ship safely. I scrambled around the controls until I found that the bridge of the ship was designed to eject upon re-entering the atmosphere. I followed the prompts on screen in order begin the ejection sequence, but was horrified to realize that the final step was an Iris scan authentication, that only worked for Andrew Kassian. However, there was mention of a manual release switch. I quickly located it, but my heart sank when I realized that it was outside of the bridge. I looked up at /u/Mrrrrh with a defeated expression.

She looked back and stood up. “The manual release, I did know about”, she said with a sigh.
“Kassian designed it for exactly this situation.” 
She paused.
“I chose the wrong side. I know I did. I betrayed people, hurt people… I have to make it right.”
She opened the airlock and looked at me.
“Solstice PHX. Make it a reality. Make us all proud, /u/CauldronThief. Make all of this worth something.”

She stepped out the door, and it sealed behind her. I heard a small sputter of a cough behind me, and looked down to see /u/pizzabangle finally slip away. There was then another jolt as the bridge broke free. I was home.

There was never really a point in my life where I expected to one day rebuild an entire company from the ground up. Starting one? Sure; that’s what every single business man and woman dreams of doing. But this is something completely different. I mean, a part of me isn’t really surprised that this happened, I’m more just shocked that this all fell into my hands. A multi-million dollar corporation, completely collapsed, with only myself to bring it back.

We live in a world of corruption, capitalism, and a complete lack of consideration. This company was the perfect manifestation of that. Every bomb has it’s fuse; it was only a matter of time before this one went off. Executives with unrealistic expectations of those beneath them, those who resisted them and fought to keep justice intact, and those who were simply caught in the crossfire. The destruction of this company was unlike anything I’d ever seen. Some might call it a battle, but having been a part of it, I can tell you that it was a war. But in the end, now I have an opportunity to build my own legacy in the wake of all that was destroyed. THE END.

Thanks for reading,

/u/CauldronThief

#The game has come to an end! 

#Congratulations, INSURRECTION, for obliterating the Administration!!

#Congratulations, MRRRRH, for fulfilling your win condition! 

The administration subs and the ghost sub are now public.

/r/SolsticeSenior

/r/JuniorSolstice

/r/HogwartsGhosts

The roster will be updated with the original roles given, as well as the ending roles, as the Admin did a fair bit of switching around. Additionally, you can view all confessionals from throughout the game [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YRT3kcbqQuImZC44Q3sWDW_kmN56yEmz0jKhqxPhb1E/edit?usp=sharing). For those of you who want a TL;DR, here is our highlight reel:

&gt;My only evidence against Mrrrrh is her RP email denying me vacation time in phase 1. But Lori is prone to holding grudges. So maybe I'll get lucky. And it is suspicious that she hasn't called me out on voting to lynch her twice.

- /u/k9moonmoon

*Lori was right so often that the Admin believed she was the Scout!*

&gt;Actually you know I don't really feel all that incentivized to try to rally the insurrection against my suspicions if I could potentially still be converted within the next few phases. Maybe after the solstice I'll try something... Assuming I'm still alive…

- /u/funkimon

*This was something that a few other people echoed. We were surprised so few people were willing to play for a team until after the Solstice!*

&gt;I'M A FREAKING INSURRECTION INTERN!! i really really wanted to vote LoneWolf and Pizzabangle tonight out of pettiness. But of course, if I survive I'll be suspect #1 for their deaths!

- /u/Ayaa96

*The sheer amount of people admitting that they were going after another player due to pettiness was hilarious. Whatever it takes to drive the game forward!*

&gt;IT HAS BEEN 12 MINUTES HAVE NOT READ, UPVOTED, OR RESPONDED TO MY REVEAL COMMENT. I AM RAGING LIKE A FEROCIOUS TEACUP BULLDOG RIGHT NOW.

- /u/LoneWolfoftheCalla

*A feeling all too familiar for us all.*

&gt;Frolicking_elephants, I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I think you're awesome, and you really have played an exceptional game, especially as a new player who was given a tough role. I'm sorry I screwed you over this phase. I did smaller stuff throughout the game, but this is really where shit hit the fan. Once it looked like we actually could win it, I figured, F it, I'd give up my win condition and just win with the gang. But then the list happened, and there was no coming back from that. I'll say this, your plan is a pretty good one. If we'd controlled the lynch today like we did with K9, I would have come out with y'all. But really in order to make it work we needed 2 people to screw up, not just 1. I just don't think that's gonna happen.

&gt;Also, I want to tell littlebs8 to kill Penguin in hopes Penguin is the Manager. But if so, that'll put me in more trouble than my vote already will, so F it, I'll say Boog.

&gt;If I'm gonna betray them, I might as well go all in. They'll probably out me, but whatever.

&gt;I'm sorry, Admin! You don't deserve this! 

- /u/Mrrrrh’s meltdown, followed immediately by:

&gt;OMFG I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO SWITCH HER VOTE FFS IT WOUKD HAVE WORKED

- /u/jilliefish

*These comments pinpointed the exact moment that Mrrrrh’s betrayal become known. It* ***would*** *have worked, too!*

&gt;Maybe my real win condition was the friends I made along the way.

- /u/frolicking_elephants

*:’)*

&gt;Just add me to the ghost sub already. Being alive is weird.

- /u/pizzabangle

*A sentiment we can all agree with the game lasts three weeks and you don’t know who to trust.*

#Mechanics, Rules, and Roles

**Shared Information**

We intended our game to present as much information up-front as we could. Information gives the town something to work with, and as some of you might know, /u/elbowsss HATES it when the town pussyfoots around for the first few phases. Including all information in vote results along with lynching all ties was supposed to combat the indecisive trap that the town regularly falls into. BUT a game needs a good secret or two if there is going to be a good dash of chaos and confusion. For this reason, we included a single secret about the mechanics: the Vice President had a secret win condition. The message we sent to the Vice President read as follows:

&gt;will be added to the Upper Admin sub AND the Lower Admin sub. You are the link between the two. Your secret is this: you are the only player with an additional win condition. You don't care if the rest of the Admin wins, as long as you are the last Admin standing. 

The wording was a little off, which led to some confusion, but we cleared it up through PMs that the idea behind the Vice President was that they would need to choose between a team win and an individual win. Many times we discussed how the Vice President could meet both their Team and Individual win conditions. The Vice President would have to get the timing *perfect,* but if they lasted until the end of the game, it was totally possible. RNG landed on /u/Mrrrrh on the first roll. We knew it was meant to be. She fulfilled her individual win condition and very nearly won the game for her team as well, but not without cost. 


**Roles**

Balancing this game was agonizing. It took a fair bit of back-and-forth with /u/ravenclawroxy to decide that the convertible Interns should have a worth of +.75 rather than the full +1, and we planned a game for 30 players per the facilitator guidelines. Originally we were not planning to run a game with a Seer (Scout), but lowering the weight of the Interns required us to add something to our predicted roster of 30 to even out the balance. Of course we didn’t know how many players we would end up with, so we needed to give ourselves some room to breathe. This led us to listing most roles as occurring **0-2** times, which ensured some flexibility once we got our final numbers. When we received our final roster with more players than we planned, we needed to remove some of the weight from the Insurrection. To our delight, this could be accomplished by removing Scout from the list of active roles.  **The Scout was the only role on the Rules/Roles post that was never assigned.**

**Game Design**

For those of you interested in more on the Game Design, our wiki will (eventually) be updated with an extensive post by /u/elbowsss explaining the process.

**Opportunistic**

Rick (a nearly underage boy ) watches you shiver craving for cock, his eyes look at your red lips and down at your cleavage as he realises he has a chance to fuck a much older girl, in fact this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load.
""Ok.."" he nods as you beg for him to fuck you raw...he drops his backpack and starts to unzip his shirt revealing a large bulge under his underpants. Before he continues you press ""STOP"" button on the lift.
Basically you are someone who is aware of his condition and either by pure need of cum or altruism reasons you take the opportunity of us being alone to make me unload a large period of time worh of cum. As it is a generous amount it would be life threatening to have it all done in one go, so you would plan to have me nut several times throughout the roleplay 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my teen daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent little girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) A innocent little sleepover with your 2 friends and you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them and want to learn everything, but no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks), lingerie, thick girls, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for how you might look: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/

remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :). I also have kik if you prefer

71peys,8,2017-09-22,"Man, you guys make it HARD to immigrate",NotVeryGoodAtStuff,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/71peys/man_you_guys_make_it_hard_to_immigrate/,"G'day cunts,

Last year I moved from Canada to Australia to study for a year at uni. Graduated from an Australian university, went back to Canada only to realize that the job market in my field (Communications) is offensively bad. As a recent graduate, I've completed three internships and have been working as a freelance writer for nearly five years. I've gotten tens of millions of views online and have written everything from celebrity gossip to sales copy.   



I decided that I would try my luck back in Australia, as I fell in love with a girl while studying. My best option at the time of applying (around May/June) was to apply for a Working Holiday visa (can work for one company for six months), and hope that I could find work sponsorship (or even a job) when I came to Australia. 

A few months after I received my visa, the Australian Department of Immigration completely overhauled their skilled occupations list. You guys are in need of people with my skill set — which is fantastic! I just don't qualify for any other visa other than the one that I have because I don't have work sponsorship.

So, am I unemployable? Oh to the contrary! I've been here for about three weeks and been brought in for 5 interviews. Some of the interviews have been for short contract work, other has been for a long term full-time position. Upon hearing about what visa I have, I was denied for all of these positions. Companies simply won't sponsor me and they won't tell me why. And, though I can complete the contract jobs with no worries, they told me that they wanted someone who could work beyond the contract. Which, I could, for an extended 3 months before I would need work sponsorship. 

Luckily, there is a visa that I technically qualify for that I won't be granted. Despite having nearly five years freelance writing experience, I don't have all of the necessary contact information for ALL my clients over the years that would give me work experience needed to meet the requirements for a non-sponsored work visa. Shitty, right? 

It's painfully ironic that in my home country there is no work for me, but plenty of work in a country that won't let me work for more than six months. 

Anyone ever been in a similar situation as me? What did you do? What do you think I should do? Know anyone that's hiring? Words of encouragement? 

I am currently south east QLD. "

71pkdx,12,2017-09-22,[FR] First time out being single,thatphysicsdude12,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/71pkdx/fr_first_time_out_being_single/,"Hey guys,

I have used the help on here to get my last gf and unfortunately it is time again for me to start over.

Let's cut to the chase:

Last night was a beer evening which many interns at my company attend, including me. Since I have been team leader for the ""fun team"" for a while, know a good many people and even more know me. I usually just enjoy the evening have a couple beers and try to talk with everyone I know but tonight there were two new girls (HB7 and HB8) I had never seen before: possibly new interns? 

Logistics were pretty bad at the beginning as they were sitting in a corner with four guys around them and no good way to strike up a conversation. The night progresses and they eventually got up and moving around. I noticed that without being a creep and as they passed me I greet the guy who brought them briefly and pay them no attention since I am still in a conversation with a new intern, hot guy. They stand right behind where we're sitting and it takes only a couple seconds until, again, they are surrounded by guys.

I used to be the guy that sees that scenario and thinks: ""Damn I'm too late again"". However, times have changed. I finish my beer, excuse myself, get a new one, go straight to my colleague who brought them here and ask him to introduce myself, while they are standing right next me listening in on everything. Names and hand shakes are exchanged and I strike up a conversation with HB8 since HB7 is too far away to be properly understood. We go through the usual small talk stuff, where who is from, what they are doing etc. Apparently they live here and I joke around that it’s a dead city, initiate light kino on the shoulder during the joke, and tease them that their youth must have been pretty boring. We continue talking through various topics, traveling comes up, which is always my time to shine (since nobody I know comes close to the number of countries I have visited). Now most of the other guys have left by now and at some point it is just the four of us. I continue to lead the conversation, joke around a bit, keep eye contact (but mostly with HB8, which I am trying to #-close). At some point I excuse myself to the restroom and when I came back took the chance to push HB8 aside slightly with my hip to gain some space to stand (love that move, what do you guys think?). Overall everything is working well, she seems interested and talks mostly to me while maintaining constant eye contact with me while the other two are talking with each other. Now it’s been a while and I didn't plan on doing this so I didn't read up on the basic flow mentioned in Magic Bullets. I know I have to isolate her somehow but before that happens, hot guy joins us. This is perfectly normal, after all the event was created so we interns can get to know each other. And then ""poof"" I disappear. Her eyes turn and she immediately strikes up a conversation with him. Thank god for all the lessons on outcome independence, it doesn't bother me that much so we start talking as a group of three. The guy is slightly smaller than me but build like an ox and very good looking, like very very. So I remember something called ""amoging"" (?) which is basically a method to show dominance over somebody who, at least physically is more alpha than you. We continue to talk and joke around I shoot one or two jokes his way and use the opportunity to clap him on the shoulder, not too soft, not too hard, he is a nice guy after all. However, at some point we talk about rowing, which is his sport, and he asks where it would be possible to get started here. HB8 immediately takes out her phone and starts asking a friend who rows as well.
This goes on for a while me trying to lead the conversation having good eye contact (with both) joking around, gaining her attention and him asking simple question and her losing focus for me immediately. 
When she went to the restroom he left and she asked immediately where he went. 

Cutting short, the girls are about to leave, I think ""Fuck it"", tell her it was a great time and whether she would like to meet up next week. She is meeting with all of her friends (since she leaves her hometown in 2 weeks forever) so she has unfortunately no time.


**Time to reflect:**

**What I think I did right:**

- I didn’t linger around eyeing the girls but went straight in and introduced myself
 
- I think my kino was ok considering the situation and that a lot of people were around us

- I’ve gotten pretty good at joking around within various topics and make everyone laugh

- I’ve welcomed hot guy when he joined and didn’t ignore him but made him part in the conversation and most importantly I didn’t become jealous

**What I think I did wrong:**

- Focusing entirely on HB8, showing rather clear interest, I pretty much gave the cat the string from the very beginning

- Didn’t isolate her early enough so it would socially be rather unacceptable for other to simply join like hot guy did

**What I need to improve (this is where I need input):**

- Actively focus on not showing immediate interest 

- Not focusing mainly on the target but strike up a conversation with HB7 and other guys in the group ignoring HB8 for the most part

- Learn to isolate and simply do it

Overall I would say it was pretty successful, though. It was the first night being single, I had an open mindset, no goals but still managed to open a set and converse with them for most of the time they were there. I managed to get some IOI’s (strong eye contact, asking me a lot of question about myself) and think everyone had a pretty good time. I feel good about asking for the #, knowing I did everything I could that night and have nothing to regret. 

Aside from what I need to improve one question lingers in my head:
Would I have been able to still game her, despite her being clearly more attracted to hot guy? If there had been other girls in the bar, should I have simply ejected and look for a new target?

Tough question without having been there, I know, but what would you guys say from your own experience? 


**Motivation for others:**

It simply feels good to know I have progressed to a man that is capable of approaching strange girls, holding a good conversation, get them to laugh and all of that without being the slightest bit nervous. Especially considering that I come from absolutely nothing: a creepy, shy computer nerd that had never even kissed a girl until 17. All it takes is work guys. Work on yourself.


EDIT:
One more move I pulled:
When talking about backpacks for traveling I made her hold my beer to properly gesticulate with my hands. She gave it back immediately after I was done explaining, though.

What do you guys think of this switcheroo?

I'm doing an internship in another town and thought about switching from pure bodyweight to gym for that time. Because you don't really get big mass on bwf exercises, (at least not that fast) I'm looking for a suitable program.

I don't know if I overthink things, but I'm looking for a pure hypertrophy program which could get me efficient results in 3 months. I know genetics and patience play a big role in fitness and strength is also important, but I read into a lot of programs here (PHUL, PHAT, Fierce 5, nSuns, etc.) and really don't know what would fit my goals.  

I would love to do nSuns, but time is a thing I don't really have and the gym there is mostly overcrowded at peak times, so all this plate switching and doing 9 sets; I don't really know if it's possible there. (I thought about going in the morning, but my gym opens at 8.00 am and work begins at 9.30 am, so not possible with nSuns, sadly). 

**So my question:**

*Is there a pure or efficient (for most of you folks) pure hypertrophy 4-5 days program which can be finished in 1 - 1.15 hrs (max 1.30 hrs with more accessory work when I got the time)?*

Oh, and I'm new to the gym, but wouldn't say I'm a complete beginner in terms of fitness (here is my more or less successfully progress on /r/bodyweightfitness: https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6somak/progress_my_2_years_effectively_15_years_of/)

I took an internship paying 1k a month and that didnt turn into a real job so I moved in with my parents and started applying full time. I must have applied to over 100+ places doing 30+ face to face interviews before I settled for a job cold calling at $15/hr because no where else would hire me. This was one of the lowest and toughest times in my life.

Once I had that job I busted my ass to prove myself and took every opportunity I saw. I became a top sales performer and stuck out some rough times where I almost quit. I took night classes so I could take my career in a more tehnical direction. I had some miserable 12hr+ days.

3.5 years later I am a network engineer at this company making almost 6 figures with 100k in the bank. 

I was pretty useless coming out of college with my degrees and internships. I also didnt know the meaning of real hard work until the corporate grind.

My advice to kids just starting college or still in it is to major in something rigourous and technical if you want money. Alot of traditional universities do a poor job at educating students with skills for the workforce. Most majors have poor job prospects. If I did it again I would do aome type of Engineering.

Some advice to you guys struggling post college is just stay positive, work hard and make yourself valuable. If you have the right skills this economy will make you wealthy. Ask yourself ""what skills do I really have."" Post college I realized I didnt have much, and needed to work on learning things in demand.

Good luck out there!"

My mom is a pretty good mom but when she gets pushed far or thinks she need to be rescue helicopter, she's irrational. I'm kind of seeking advice but mostly here to rant.

I'll start by ranting about more food shit since it sums up a lot. With my disability I'll get stays in the hospital maybe once every two months. Haven't had one in three months and now it's.. ugh. I've been in the hospital and my mom just brought me my tablet. Otherwise I've just been napping from medicine, watching hospital cable TNT and HGTV -- the homes are pretty great so I'm trying not to be mad.

I have different rotation of nurses since they have interns. They are nagging me to eat and all. Last night I got small cup of ensure, cup of milk, then water, mashed potatoes, mashed vegetable goop, soft cooked ham and then this soup stuff with bread. That's a lot of food to me. I did eat the bread because it was right in reach, it took maybe five minutes. I got two tiny bites of ham, that took a minute. Then I stopped eating to let it settle in my gut. Two nurses came in to set my food pace to make sure I ended up fed and one held a spoon to my mouth, with a giant impossible bite in it so even more overwhelming.

A nurse aide brought a tray with like a small cup of milk, cup of juice, cup of water, oatmeal, small applesauce, then two pieces of bread with soft salami and butter on the side. I got a few bites of oatmeal, a gulp of juice, most of the applesauce. Nurse aide came back in, asked me ""What's this? You're gonna need more than that to eat."" She started buttering the bread for me and then stirred what was left of the oatmeal, and she was pushing me to eat. Man, that was a lot of fucking food all at one time. Guess they're trying to make sure I ate. Probably have me on a schedule.

So since I haven't been eating, an RN - big boss nurse - came to feed me a solid shake, which is like baby food but with a diet shake taste to it so it's not delicious nor shit I guess. I've had her a few times and I'm more familiar with her and she kind of knows how to work my sensitive side, so I let her spoonfeed me until I couldn't take any more. Ended up eating at least half of what she had and I was cooperative as possible and it was alright. Then she kind of pissed me off. When I stopped taking food, it's because I needed to take a break and lay there and settle my gut. She took it as me being uncooperative and started trying to tool with me, was putting a water cup to my mouth to maybe induce my appetite by drinking, she was urging me to open for another bite like peer pressure. Started massaging my gut and sugaring me up to take more food. I started feeling bad.

Ugh.

Helicopter mom was ready to raise shit over this. She said she's going to have to teach these new nurses how to deal with me. She got her shit spinning, engine going, lifting off the platform, ready to come halp. 

She came into the hospital, onto my floor, and I could hear her screaming at the assist desk near the elevator. Screaming. Wanted my RN ""and now"". She came in my room and started rubbing my gut, because ""only she's allowed to touch me"", and she reminded me that she was here and everything was okay now and she'd fix this shit. And cooing about ""They're overfeeding you.. your tummy can't handle all that food.. they should know better.""

""You need more piddows.. they should know better!""

She started pulling back my shirt and waistband to look for pressure sores to make sure they've been turning me when I'm unable to turn myself. I told her I've been pretty well, I've been strong enough to shift/roll, and I even said ""Momma, don't worry"" and she kind of hushed me and talked over me with ""It's okay, don't worry, momma's here.""

Like she was trying to find as many problems as she could. To add bulk to her food report. Since she was already pissed with the urging nurses, so why not add more evidence that the nurses are bitches? 

Head RN was paged in. My mom pulled a spoon and a tupperware of food from her purse -- she had this planned. She firmly told the nurse ""Now, call the others in. I'm going to teach you how to feed my son."" 

My dad walked in with the ""what shit is my wife getting herself into now?"" look. He told her to stop, calm down, and come home with him to watch a movie they planned.

Nope, her walking a good couple miles to force others to watch her dump applesauce in my mouth was much more important than a hot night with the man who works too much for her to see regularly. "

She took it as me being uncooperative and started trying to tool with me, was putting a water cup to my mouth to maybe induce my appetite by drinking, she was urging me to open for another bite like peer pressure. Started massaging my gut and sugaring me up to take more food. I started feeling bad.

Ugh.

Even better: helicopter mom was ready to raise shit over this. She said she's going to have to teach these new nurses how to deal with me. She got her shit spinning, engine going, lifting off the platform, ready to come halp. 

She came into the hospital, onto my floor, and I could hear her screaming at the assist desk near the elevator. Screaming. Wanted my RN ""and now"". She came in my room and started rubbing my gut, because ""only she's allowed to touch me"", and she reminded me that she was here and everything was okay now and she'd fix this shit. And cooing about ""They're overfeeding you.. your tummy can't handle all that food.. they should know better.""

""You need more piddows.. they should know better!""

She started pulling back my shirt and waistband to look for pressure sores to make sure they've been turning me when I'm unable to turn myself. I told her I've been pretty well, I've been strong enough to shift/roll, and I even said ""Momma, don't worry"" and she kind of hushed me and talked over me with ""It's okay, don't worry, momma's here.""

Like she was trying to find as many problems as she could. To add bulk to her food report. Since she was already pissed with the urging nurses, so why not add more evidence that the nurses are bitches? 

Head RN was paged in. My mom pulled a spoon and a tupperware of food from her purse -- she had this planned. She firmly told the nurse ""Now, call the others in. I'm going to teach you how to feed my son."" 

My dad walked in with the ""what shit is my wife getting herself into now?"" look. He told her to stop, calm down, and come home with him to watch a movie they planned.

Nope, her walking a good couple miles to force others to watch her dump applesauce in my mouth was much more important than a hot night with the man who works too much for her to see regularly. "
71r5k8,12,2017-09-22,I (22/F) just found out that the guy (24/F) I was dating had another girl while he was still dating me.,TheNataliaB,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/71r5k8/i_22f_just_found_out_that_the_guy_24f_i_was/,"First time posting here! I'm sorry if my english is kinda bad, this is not my first language.

We were casually dating for at least 10 months. 2 months in he told me he loved me, I just said it back a few months after. But eventually I got tired of the ""casual dating"" thing and wanted things to be exclusive, since I was practically already treating the relationship as exclusive, and I thought that he was, too. But he said he's just not ready to be in a serious relationship yet because he has a lot going on with his family, money-wise. I was broken, but I respected his decision and we agreed that we will try to stay friends since we're just in the same group of friends.

Less than two weeks later, I found out that he has a new girl already that he met at work(he was a staff, the girl was an intern). I was incredibly hurt because I have never felt so replaceable my entire life. He then talks to me and flirts like nothing happened between us, like we never agreed to being just friends.

Recently, our group of friends met together to get drinks and we were both there. We haven't seen each other for at least two months before that night, and I really tried to not make things awkward between us and the people around. He was flirting and hitting on me(I was not reciprocating) while he was there texting with his new girl. Our friends kind of conspired to make him take me home(which doesn't make sense since he drives a motorcycle and lives far away from me, while we have a friend there with us who brought a car who lives closer). I felt like I had no choice so I just went with it though I was really pissed off at my friends that time already. What could go wrong, right? When we left, he kept on suggesting that we just go to his house instead of dropping me off at mine, which is irritating because a. I know what will happen if we both went to his house, I'll just lose all the progress that I made to move on and b. what about being just friends??? On top of that he tried to kiss me after dropping me off. Foul foul foul foul foul. I was so mad at everyone I couldn't even sleep it off.

The next day, my girl friend told me that she talked to him that night because she was pissed about the new girl. Turns out, the new girl was already in the picture even before I broke up with him, I just didn't know. He thinks it's not his fault that the new girl came in the picture, he was just ""vulnerable"". He also said that apparently, the new girl didn't know about me. Which makes me think like if she didn't know about me, why didn't you tell her that you already have someone, but instead you just flirted back?

I really feel betrayed. This has never happened to me before. If you were in my position, could you still be friends with the guy? Does us not being 'exclusive' justify what he did? Also does that qualify as cheating?

**TL;DR** : I'm trying to be friends with my ex(that is also in my group of friends) but I just found out that he was seeing another girl while we were still dating and that kinda changes things for me."

71rk1i,2,2017-09-22,Hello! Looking for a career path! Need Guidance. Thanks!,Le0ndar,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/71rk1i/hello_looking_for_a_career_path_need_guidance/,"Hello!

&amp;nbsp;

I have a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and 3 years and 2 months of experience in QA Software Testing. I really liked the job I did - test products that the company periodically came up with for sale, Coffee Beans, Travel and Living, I liked the products more than the actual job of testing (websites, backend entries, product flow), and I enjoyed ""client"" communications (I worked in an offshore establishment) and within the team, as compared to the technical task at hand. Especially the few ""product"" meetings that we attended, which put the developer to sleep, but I totally enjoyed sitting there, understanding the nitty-gritties that went into product development.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was wondering if there was some path I could take into Product development? I am currently on a sabbatical, took time off work last April to sort some personal stuff, and to think about where to go. I'm ready to come back into action, and was wondering what would be the right direction to approach this.

&amp;nbsp;

Should I take a degree in Product Management? I couldn't find many on Quora apart from MBAs which a lot of people didn't recommend, quoting experience as a better candidate. I don't live in North America, or Europe (Preferred locations, I live in Asia), and I think higher education is the best way into these countries. I'm fine with any European or North American country, though I would love it if it were in America, or Scotland (LOVE the countryside!)

&amp;nbsp;

I'm also open to any other recommendations that you may have with respect to career paths, I'm pretty much open to anything. I don't have a ""this is how it is supposed to be"", as long as I enjoy the task at hand - solving problems, guiding a product through to completion, communicating with the team, having a good time!, I'm okay with pretty much anything, as long as it has growth and stability, from personal responsibilities point of view. I'm not particular about ""fast"" or ""slow"" paced jobs, any pace would do, as long as it was engaging, fun, and gave me enough to take care of my responsibilities and peace. Any other responsibilities that went with the job, like late night calls, sudden product disruptions, long weeks leading up to a release, and working from home on Holidays, are totally okay!

&amp;nbsp;

My profile summary is as below, what would you recommend I do? There are opportunities in my country to pick up where I left off, but the competition is stiff, and I am not keen to pick up with the same role, which is why I'm asking about the degrees/programmes, also I can afford to pay for them, plus I'm 27 and would love to get started right away with a move, but it looks like in order to do this, I will need either time (and luck, in my country, to approach this from a professional point of view), or a degree in the country of interest.

&amp;nbsp;

What would be some good degrees/programmes to pursue? Does the University matter? What certifications should I also consider? What are the opportunities in these areas (North America, Scotland, and Europe), like? Are there some other paths you would recommend to Product Management?

&amp;nbsp;

Profile Summary (Most Recent, first):
&amp;nbsp;

* 3+ Years of Total IT Industry experience as Software Tester in Agile/Scrum
&amp;nbsp;

* 1+ Years of Marketing/Client Communications in a Startup
&amp;nbsp;

* 6 Months of Marketing Internship in an Educational Institution

&amp;nbsp;

Feel free to ask for any additional details, will be ready to share!

&amp;nbsp;

Many thanks!"
71ro4l,2074,2017-09-22,Does EVERY school have a bar in New York City? An Effort-post,zsghost,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/71ro4l/does_every_school_have_a_bar_in_new_york_city_an/,"With Gameday in NYC this weekend, I wanted to test the assertion that every school had its own bar in Manhattan. I've spent the past six hours trawling alumni association Facebook pages to find, ideally, a bar that there are currently consistent, publicly listed gamewatches at for the school, although consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds and I probably messed up in a few places. No Brooklyn bars because screw that noise. Here's what I was able to find:

And here it is [on a map.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=125tFaViMjkgcqgDTzN9Jl5u1lqQ&amp;usp=sharing)

Corrections appreciated - shocked I couldn't find a Duke bar, so I'm sure someone knows the answer to that one. I'll do a big update later today. A bunch of the NYC alumni pages I went on mentioned something about Gameday filming them, so I'm sure some ESPN intern has their own list somewhere.

UPDATE: added suggestions 12:40pm CST

UPDATE 2: i regret telling y'all i appreciated corrections

UPDATE 3: be advised this stuff changes around a lot so if you're reading this after like january 2018 please check to confirm its still the joint prior to the excursion

UPDATE 4: This blew up, so

**FREQUENT COMMENTS AND THEIR RESPONSES**

1. ""I can't believe [ ] has only [ ] bars!"" I'm not saying that. My goal was to find at least one bar frequented by fans of each FBS school. If more are easily found, I threw on multiples. Maybe there are others! I just gave up after five minutes of googling.

2. ""[ ] is also a great bar for [ ] fans."" Cool, thanks! I'll look into a bit and probably throw it in later.

3. ""The website for [ ] doesn't mention [ ] at all."" I went off of where alumni groups said they meet. If the bar doesn't advertise that, it probably says a thing or two about your fanbase, huh?

4. ""The real [ ] bar is [ ], no one goes to [ ] ."" I'll look into that and probably add the first bar you mentioned.

5. ""lol rutgers"" Not to defend Rutgers, but there probably doesn't need to be an official Rutgers bar in Manhattan, y'know?

6. ""Pacific Standard is the Cal bar. It's in Brooklyn."" iT's In BrOoKlYn

7. ""Here is an article that did this already."" Okay.

EDIT FIVE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP SENDING ME WISCONSIN BARS"
71seiu,4,2017-09-22,How difficult will it be to get my first job in Ireland as software engineer?,Jenesepados,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/71seiu/how_difficult_will_it_be_to_get_my_first_job_in/,"I have looked in USA and Canada but it is more difficult as i need a VISA to get there, i am currently studying software engineering in Spain and the jobs here for that are a lot, but the quality is the worst, it is normal for people to get very stressed the first years and lose all the interest for their job.

That is the last thing i want so i was wondering if i could get a job in Ireland as my very first job right after finishing university, i have 3 months of experience in an internship and i have done a ""Superior Degree"" of 2 years about multiplatform app development, right now i have a B2 in english but i expect to get the C2 before moving, i have heard that Ireland is heaven for software engineers i am not talking about salary but about job conditions and the importance that is given to the career, is this true?"
71sq61,16,2017-09-22,F4M - Showering with my Intern,CindyIncidentally,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/71sq61/f4m_showering_with_my_intern/,"Since becoming a junior executive my work/life balance has become ever more challenging. With the long office hours, regular travelling and an on-duty phone I’m never truly switched off. All my past hobbies, friends and relationships, even sexual ones, have become a forgotten footnote of my personal history.

Time management has become a finely tuned art form. Instead of shopping for groceries they are delivered to my door at a scheduled time; instead of cleaning my own home, I’ve hired a maid; and instead of post office gym sessions I get my exercise cycling to and from work. This last sacrifice comes with a bonus at work shower, lest I stink out my meetings with clients.

Today my hectic schedule is no different with a client meeting at 8am. Yet before I’ve even reached the office, my entire schedule is blown like the rear tire of my $2,000 road bike. After a quick repair at the side of the road I manage to get work at 7:50. I slide my bike into the stand without securing the chain and quickly make my way to the staff showers.

To my dismay each of the private stalls are fully in use. I pace back and forwards for a few seconds waiting for one of the culprits to hurry out the shower. The clock on the locker room wall tells me its 7 minutes to the hour. This meeting was with our most important and least understanding client.

With the bold decisiveness which had elevated me to my lofty position I poked my head into the nearest of the stalls. A slender, young and firm derriere stared back at me. I traced the slightly fluffy cheeks upward, over a very slim waist and broad wide shoulders before recognizing the short hazelnut hair of the young office intern. Unwavering I dropped the hanging towel from around by person and stepped into the shower behind the young man.

His torso swivelled in surprise as I stepped close behind him in the shower. My hand against his boyish waist prevented him from fully turning. Instead he could only swivel his neck to see my face over his shoulder. Nothing more, nothing less.

“I’m running late for a very important meeting” I whispered in his ear. “I won’t be more than a few moments. You just keep facing towards the wall and I’ll be out before you know it.”

The aghast nod of assent was enough of an approval for me and I edged him closer to the wall so I could drench myself in the warm stream. Quickly I soaked my skin, washing the sweat and roadside dirt from my skin with the young man’s own shower gel.

Throughout my companion was deathly silent and frozen stiff. I whispered a thousand soft apologies into his ear to make him feel at ease. In an attempt to share the facet we were perilously close.

Continually his firm little buttocks pressed against my groin and my soft soapy breasts squished against his swimmers back. There was no doubt he could feel the sharp excitement within my nipples.

The longer I stayed the longer I considered the young man. His body was so young, so fresh. I was little past 30 myself yet I’d never been with someone so young, at least not since I was so myself. He was a perfect young specimen and I was curious just how experienced this man-boy was.

Time was getting away from me however and I sadly must go. A devilish idea came into my head just before retreating.

I slid my arm around the minuscule, yet iron waist of the youth and whispered one last time in his ear.

“Shall we say, 7:30am tomorrow?”

I asked before I licked the lobe of his ear and nibbled gently with my incisors. I then stretched for his shower gel once more, pressing firmly against him as i did so, and then placed the bottle in his hand.

“Enjoy the rest of your shower! Take all the time you need.”

---------------

Hi all,

Please take the time to respond with a continuation of the prompt. First to finish is not an admirable quality for us girls. To help you along below are some ideas of how you could continue:

* Write about you and your background. i.e. company and/or sexual.

* Write this prompt so far from your perspective.

* Write about the rest of your shower thinking of me.

* Write about the remainder of the day in the office.

* Write about the anticipation for tomorrow.

None of the above need to be followed and creativity is encouraged. Just trying to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

Hope to hear from you soon! xoxo"

I hope you are all well. I was hoping to find a hot older sugar daddy to take me out on nice dates and holidays abroad all in exchange for my tight teen body. I will play as a college girl who has an expensive lifestyle but no money at all.

You can play as a hot older man with a big wallet, a big sex drive and an even bigger dick. Come on guys what older man does want a horny teen sucking and fucking his big cock, telling him how great he is.

I can be one of your daughter's best mates, a student, an intern, a neighbor, a college girl in a bar or maybe on a beach (love a nude beach), tbh any ideas I'm up for it x

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

I have a high GPA and competitive test scores, but recieved a 780 on the SAT Math 2. I'm aware that the 25th percentile at Caltech is an 800 on this test. I am wondering whether it is worth it to pay for another test and attempt to get the 800. I would like to apply EA, meaning I would have to take the October 7 SAT and pay the late fee for a grand total of $75 (to get just a few more questions right).

For context, I will be writing my essays describing a research internship in biology that I did at Caltech this past summer. I also plan to get a letter of recommendation from my mentor, a Caltech researcher.

I am able to support my ability in math with my grades as well as a 5 on the AP Calc AB exam. I recieved a perfect score on PSAT math and a 790 on SAT 1 math (I have a superscore of 1570).

Is the 800 important enough to warrant a retake, or should I focus on essays? Would I have a chance at EA or should I apply regular decision?"

I couldn't.

Another example: Usually I'm really good at remembering who did  what in what situation or what was done exactly, but as of recently I just can't remember. Example, my friend gives me a number answer for a lab that we were doing and I zoned out, couple minutes later I ask if it was 81, she said 18.. 

I honestly have no clue and am scared because I've always had good memory. I could study for a test  and memorize formulas easy, but now short term, it's really hard for me to remember/pay attention.

I'm currently a senior in college, paying my own tuition out of pocket. I go to a satellite campus of a large state college and so I receive no financial aid except for loans with ridiculous interest rates. I also make a car payment each month. Due to both the car payment and my tuition I do not make enough money at my part time waitressing job to support myself out on my own. I currently live with my parents. 

I love my parents and I'm IMMENSELY thankful for all they've done for me. They've let me live with them, they have me on the family car insurance (same with my two older brothers who do not live at home) and they pay for my cellphone. I'm extremely lucky, but here's the main problem: my mother is very, VERY Catholic and it's beginning to strain our relationship and make me resent her.

I recently started dating a coworker of mine, and am very happy with him. He was my first everything basically, and before him I had previously thought that maybe I would want to save myself until marriage. My mother had made me promise her from a young age that I would never have sex before marriage, that I would never use contraception, and that I would never move in with a man unless I was married to him. She made me promise all of this because my eldest brother was doing ALL of those things with his then girlfriend and now current girlfriend. I was like fifteen/sixteen when she asked me to promise her all of this and so I agreed because I actually agreed WITH HER. I thought sex before marriage was sinful and wrong and I didn't want to be that person.

Recently though I've stopped believing pretty much everything that I had once believed about my faith, and it's mostly because my mother WILL NOT stop pushing her ideals and beliefs on me. She lectures me constantly, and over the years I've just grown sick of it and have started to withdraw from the church. She knows this now but she still gets so upset when I bring it up. Upset enough to scream and cry at me and tell me I've ""hurt her more than any of her children"" and that I'm a ""disappointment"" She's almost kicked me out of the house a few times - threatening to take my phone from me (which she can absolutely do and I'm aware of this). 

So not only do we fight about all of this regular religious stuff but she is also so fixated on my virginity. She still believes that I'm a virgin and when she met my now boyfriend she gave him some bullshit line about how I'm a ""precious jewel"" and that he should treat me like the precious jewel I am or fucking whatever. I thought at the time that it was just some weird mom analogy but she told me later that she hoped he ""understood what she meant"" by it and that really she was telling him not to have sex with me or touch me sexually???? She constantly asks me if I'm having sex with him - just to make sure apparently?? And I just keep lying, to both her and my dad because I know that if they found out I would be kicked out of the house. 

I graduate in May. I have 7-8 months left here, but I don't know if I can do it. Not only am I stressed about school and work and my internship and somehow coming up with all the money I need to pay for all my fucking bills (which I'm barely managing by the way. I'm making less money at my job because my town has recently gotten some more competition restaurant wise and my paycheck is suffering because of it) but now I also have to worry about my mom somehow finding out that I'm not actually staying at my friends house when I go over to my boyfriends, or finding my birth control in my purse somehow. I just feel like I'm drowning and I'm so stressed. I don't know what to do. Any advice would help.

  **tl;dr**: My mother is suffocating me with her religion and I want to move out but can't because of financial reasons. Don't know what to do, feel like I'm drowning."

I will only work it for a few months until I start another job that is aligned with my degree, with people with special needs but they will have varying diagnosis and are mostly teens and adults.

I've been having a very hard time at this new job. It is very stressful. I had no idea the kids would be aggressive, and from what I've observed theres only one or two kids I'll be working with that aren't. I don't think I can give a lot of info away because of HIPAA, but i have been subjected to having my skin scratched to the point of bleeding, had food spit in my face, and had someone advance on me trying to hurt me. Plus other stuff like head butting, kids throwing toys and stuff at me, trying to hit me, etc. They are all kids and I KNOW they are just upset and confused or trying to communicate something they don't have the skills for but it really shook me up. I've cried almost every day and today had what was either a panic attack or a migraine that left me drained and exhausted.

I want to work there I really do, I know I'll be getting really great experience, but I'm supposed to work every day and I don't know if I can handle this every day. My parents still help support me so if I'm not working full time I will be okay but...I don't know. Does anyone have any advice? I agreed to work full time bc they need someone and I'd feel like crap to, after the first week and after agreeing to fill in extra hours to go back on my word. But I feel like if I wait to see if it gets better and it doesn't and then ask for less hours then they could have been looking for someone all this time.

If I work a few days a week I will easily be able to fill my time pursuing skills that are also related to my eventual career (I just won't be paid). My job starting in a few months is actually an unpaid internship so I'm trying to save money for that time

I want to stress that I mean no offense by what I'm saying, I have respect and appreciation for those with disabilities and special needs 

Any advice? Thanks"

[NOTE: I can also write futa or female characters if you'd like your soulmate to be your gender!]

The changes had been gradual and subtle.  The news had quoted the Center for Disease Control solely because they'd used the word uncanny.


It was the only word for it.


People have always predicted world changing events, both in the catastrophic fashion – massive asteroid impacts, global temperature shifts, nuclear war and the winter that would follow – they have also bragged of the improvements of their world changing inventions – the humble bicycle had freed women, the car had allowed towns to spread widely, the same as the railroads; the steam engine had revolutionized things; computers, the internet, had connected people worldwide.

Nobody – outside of a sci-fi movie here and there, and perhaps some war crime evidence related to eugenics – had predicted this.  

It had spread like a disease – a wonderful, world changing disease.  Science had not taken long to understand some of what it was doing – it rewired some basic processes, seemingly rendering a few pathways – all of which were *thought* to be redundant and thus unused and not naturally bred for – to increase geospatial awareness.  Almost everyone who underwent the changes became far better at both navigation, and at successfully judging what they could or couldn't jump, or fit their car between.  Of course that was not all the ""disease"" did.  It had emerged at equilateral locations based on population density.  As if it had been seeded to infect humanity as swiftly as possible from every direction.

There were two major things that remained mysteries about the disease – if that was the right word.  First it seemed to create this new neural pathway from stemcells – and not the specialized ones in adults – true ones that could take any form necessary.  No one knew where these came from.  

The second thing was that each infected had a powerful compulsion to travel.  Some smart intern had recorded where they wanted to go – that became policy when it became obvious that groups ranging for 20 to 100 were all heading to camps together.  Those camps were mot consolidated but it was as if everyone with it gained the sense of a fish or bird  to travel to some location they had never necessarily heard of before – and they're new bodies had the sense of direction to pull that off.  They'd even set a few of the infected out on rafts, letting tides and currents influence their path.  None of the tested had any issue I indicating there desired location.

They didn't know how to boat from the power – bur with their sense of direction and some practice, as well as judicious consultation of hidden dangers like high coral or sand bars – they managed incredibly well.

Brad – *I* – was one of the infected.  My life had been stagnant recently.  I was a writer that had been struggling to write since the recent, too-soon, death of my father.  I had talent.  I did not have the other equally important qualities to make an easy living.

My skill as a writer had come in handy – I wrote prose and fiction, some of it published – and my changes had been remarkable.  On the outside I looked the same.  Perhaps a little taller, with more even skin, but that was it.  I'd been good looking before – I was hot now.  Nothing major except an extra half inch of height – instead it was more like I'd been trained to my body's peak potential.  Not bulky but stronger and healthier.

Anyways, other writers, more famous than I was were infected too.  But I was one of the first, with one of the most complete cases.  Most did not get handsomer or prettier.  Most did not improve their memory recall, their range of sensitive to every sensation.

I was interested in exploring this myself and my descriptions of sensations were quite the rage.  I even got to work with Jorie Graham.

Then the signal for new location filled each of us.

And each location seemed separate – not 100s of people in a group but in a cluster perhaps.  We thought it was possible to refuse the call.  Most of us didn't include me.

I don't know how I realized it, but I knew.  This disease – this evolution – let us find our soulmates.  

-------------------------------------

OOC| So I was thinking if soulmates existed and we could find each other regardless of location or language, the world would be very different. All sorts of changes would have to emerge. I'd love to rp it out.

Furthermore, what if your soulmate is far younger or older.  There are plenty of age gaps in happily married couples -- there would be some in this situation too.

PM if interested for further details or feel free to jump in.

My kinks are romance, affection, couples forced together (arranged marriage, post-apocalyptic bonding, stranded with each other, or soulmates!), clothes, sex in different locations, oral, anal, teasing, spanking, and more.  

My limits are heavy pain, scat, and gore.  I intend for this to be fairly slow and have a plot.

And it's how I felt, And thank you to all of you because I read your posts daily before going to bed and took the advice of how it felt to have it and it worked! 

A little backstory, I was working a dead end job, with the constant threat of being fired due to quota and whatnot, which caused major stress which in turn led to health problems and complications due to high stress as well. As a college student, it was imperative to find a job that not only worked with my schedule but didn't have me working so late in the afternoons, and so I applied to an internship that pays me above what I was making hourly, but also works with my schedule, Monday - Friday, and the latest I work is 5pm, which was perfect! 

While I won't be making commission anymore, I'll be mentally happy and will gain valuable experience in my degree and will carry that on to my next job when I graduate! I'm super excited and I just wanted to share with you all because LOA is amazing and so are all of you who help and post on here daily! I love this subreddit!


I knew I had the job before I walked in the interview, I felt it and didn't stress or worry about not getting the job, I had envisioned getting the job offer today on Friday a week ago and it happened the exact way I saw it!

I start Monday and I couldn't be more excited

71wmlp,1,2017-09-23,Incoherent broken mess,Aldretch,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/71wmlp/incoherent_broken_mess/,"I cried myself to sleep every day for the last week. Tonight, I can't even close my eyes without so many thoughts assailing me and I can't clear my head. I just need to let that broken mess out.

University began 3 weeks ago and I have yet to do anything. I study history in hope of teaching it someday. Yet, all that remain are mandatory courses that help prepare for a master's degree, which I don't need and don't even want to think about. So far, all that university thought me is how much of an ignorant and dimwitted person I am. Feeling like such an idiot makes me sick, especially when I remember being praised for my smarts years ago. I have trouble justifying going to my classes, in fear that by presenting my projects, I will simply prove my stupidity to those I wish I could call peers if only it wouldn't be so diminitive for them.

The weight of it all still takes most of my free time, preventing me from seeing the only ones who can make that pain fade for a bit without even knowing its existence. My sister is busy in a million projects. My cousins, which are my closest friends, are overwhelmed with school too. All that I have left are my parents, which I love but share almost nothing in common with. It's been a while since I felt so alone. My love life is inexistant, not knowing where I could meet someone with even a sliver of similarity with me. I have fallen for a few women before, but now I see why I repulse them, each and every flaw in my personality showing more and more. I question my actions often, showing a lack of confidence. Sometimes, I feel like the only way a girl would open her heart to me is if I wore a mask, never revealing who I truly am.

I still live with my parents at 28. My little sister moved into her new home with her boyfriend last year. While I couldn't be prouder of her, I can't help but feel like I will never be like her. I live with crippling debts that will have to be paid as soon as I stop studying. That debt was accumulated by going to a private college to get a certificate in computer networking. I never graduated as, during an internship, I looked at my superiors and couldn't see myself doing that for the rest of my life. I got so depresed that I considered suicide, but turned at the last second toward my original dream and enrolled for a bachelor's degree in history, a dream I had abandoned thanks to the low employment rate. My parents are sure I got my diploma. During a family supper in honor of my sister's graduation, they even brought me a gift for that certificate. I never felt so ashamed in my entire life.

I abandoned my dearest dreams and most things I liked the most. I do not work on my geek project to create a game. I shelved my rpg books and the whole world I had created for it. I stopped writing seriously. I stopped training physically. I stopped looking for martial art classes. I don't have time for those anymore. My brain feels like sludge and it bothers me so much, yet I know not what to do. I feel like a shadow of my former self, a bad dream come true. All that I had is gone. My quick wits are now way too slow, only resurfacing for self defense, my willingness to help faded behing my laziness, and my kind attitude shattered to show bitterness and lack of emotion. What breaks me the most in all of that I once loved myself. I loved who I was when I wrote stories of fiction, when I just went to offer help to anyone who would want it, when I dreamt of a romantic night with a crush, when I was alert and bright. Its just a bit sad that I was the only one who did.

Loneliness showed me that it doesn't matter if I love myself. Even if I do, others won't, and I will still be alone. There is something broken in me, something that repulse everyone, even myself. I know there won't be a happy ending to my story, I just don't know when I should stop the ink from flowing."

Statement PKI 2 Oktober 
1965 menyatakan, bahwa apa yang dinamakan Gerakan 30 September 1965 adalah 
masalah intern didalam TNI, tidak ada hubungannya dengan Partai Komunis 
Indonesia (PKI).

*Di tulis pada 23 April 1999



TNI-AU MELURUSKAN SEJARAH, WIRANTO MARAH

(POLITIK): Upaya pelurusan sejarah oleh TNI-AU perihal Peristiwa 30
September 1965 membuat kalangan jendral TNI-AD gerah. Beranikan TNI-AU
merehabilitasi Oemar Dhani?

Marsekal Udara Oemar Dhani tak hadir dalam peringatan HUT Ke-53 TNI AU di
Lapangan Udara Halim Perdanakusuma, Jakarta, TNI-AU, awal April lalu. Mantan
Kepala Staf Angkatan Udara (KSAU) itu tak bisa hadir karena alasan
kesehatan. Padahal, KSAU Marsekal TNI Hanafie Asnan mengundang Oemar Dhani
yang mendekam di penjara Cipinang selama 30 tahun.


Ketegangan diam-diam muncul antara TNI-AD dan TNI-AU menyangkut protes
TNI-AU soal tuduhan keterlibatan angkatan itu pada peristiwa berdarah pada
akhir September 1965. Oemardhani beberapa waktu lalu menyatakan ingin
meluruskan sejarah di seputar peristiwa Gerakan 30 September 1965, yang
menyangkut dirinya dan TNI-AU. Sebab, menurut dia, ada kesalahan sejarah
yang mengungkap kasus G 30 S PKI. Misalnya, munculnya tuduhan Angkatan Udara
ikut terlibat.

Dan, waktu itu Oemar yang menjadi KSAU ikut menjadi korban sehingga harus
dijatuhi hukuman seumur hidup. **Beberapa waktu setelah Soeharto jatuh, para
purnawirawan perwira tinggi TNI-AU seperti Sri Moelyono Herlambang dan Saleh
Basarah menulis surat kepada Menpen Letjen Yunus Yosfiah agar film
Pengkhianatan G-30 S PKI  dihentikan penayangannya karena dalam film yang
disutradarai mendiang Arifin C. Noer itu jelas-jelas menuduh TNI-AU terlibat
dalam pembantaian para jendral TNI-AD. Dan, Yunus setuju**. ""Para mantan KSAU
tengah menulis buku pelurusan sejarah itu. Tunggu saja. Bulan depan mungkin
rampung,"" ujar Marsekal Hanafie Asnan.

Buku yang bisa disebut sebagai buku putih TNI-AU ini akan menceritakan
secara detail tentang AURI dan peristiwa di seputar G 30 S PKI. Isi buku ini
ialah meluruskan sejarah berdasarkan pengakuan para pelaku sejarah, para
perwira TNI-AU yang masih hidup,sebagian besar pernah dipenjara oleh
Angkatan Darat pimpinan Jendral Soeharto.

Dalam buku-buku sejarah, termasuk dalam fillm itu, TNI-AU digambarkan
sebagai angkatan yang jahat, karena angkatan ini disebut sebagai angkatan
yang penuh orang-orang PKI. Dalam buku-buku sejarah dan lagi-lagi film itu,
dikatakan Pangkalan TNI AU Halim Perdana Kusuma menjadi basis gerakan PKI,
apalagi para jendral Angkatan Darat dibantai dan dikubur di dekat pangkalan
itu. Selain itu, KSAU waktu itu, Laksamana Madya Oemardhani, dituduh
terlibat dalam gerakan PKI. Akibatnya, Oemardhani, yang menjabat KSAU
1962-1965, diadili di mahkamah militer dan diputus harus mendekam di penjara
selama seumur hidup.

Panglima TNI, Jendral Wiranto nampak agak gusar terhadap niat para senior
TNI AU ini. Wiranto mengingatkan bahwa apa yang telah tertulis dalam buku
sejarah Bangsa, dan sudah diajarkan mulai TK hingga pendidikan tinggi, sudah
untuk diperbaiki. ""Kalau semua orang berusaha menginterpretasikan dengan
pemahamannya sendiri, kan susah,"" ujarnya.

Belakangan Wiranto diam-diam meminta para stafnya di jajaran Angkatan Darat
untuk ""membujuk"" TNI-AU membatalkan niat pelurusan sejarah itu. Bahkan,
kabarnya kalangan jendral Angkatan Darat meminta TNI-AU mencabut pernyataan
KSAU soal pelurusan sejarah itu. TNI-AU tak goyah. ""Tiga puluh tahun, cukup
lama bagi kami untuk dijadikan korban fitnah,"" ujar seorang petinggi TNI-AU.
Domonasi Angkatan Darat di tubuh TNI memang membuat angkatan lain harus mau
tak mau menerima apa yang digariskan para jendral Angkatan Darat. **Padahal,
kalau mau jujur, seperti halnya analisisnya Ben Anderson dalan The Cornell
Paper, Peristiwa 30 September sebenarnya merupakan konflik internal Angkatan
Darat dalam usaha menyingkirkan Presiden Soekarno. Ini sudah jadi rahasia umum**.

***Jatuhnya kekuasaan Soeharto membuat angkatan-angkatan dalam ABRI berani
menentang dominasi Angkatan Darat. Angkatan Kepolisian Republik Indonesia
adalah angkatan yang pertama kali berhasil melepaskan diri dari pengaruh
Angkatan Darat***. Pelepasan Polri sejak 1 April  lalu bukanya tanpa usaha yang
keras. Setelah Soeharto jatuh dan dikambinghitamkannya polisi dalam
pembunuhan lima mahasiswa Universitas Trisakti, Jakarta membuat para jendral
polisi untuk makin mendesak Wiranto melepas polisi. Upaya ini disetujui
Presiden Habibie. Belakangan Wiranto pun setuju, asal masih di bawah kendali
Departemen Pertahanan dan Keamanan. Pelepasan polisi ini hingga sekarang
masih ditentang oleh para jendral Angkatan Darat. Tidak mustahil, kelak
polisi akan ""diambil alih"" lagi oleh Angkatan Darat.

Akan halnya hubungan TNI-AD dan TNI-AL, selama ini juga tak baik. Sudah jadi
rahasia umum jika Korps Marinir di satu pihak berseberangan dengan Kopassus
dan Kostrad di lain pihak. Pertentangan di kalangan angkatan ini memang
bagai api dalam sekam. Kalau para jendral Angkatan Darat, yang oleh para
jendral angkatan lain seringkali dikatakan bodoh-bodoh itu, tetap ngotot mau
benarnya sendiri, bukan tak mungkin pertentangan itu akan jadi terbuka.
Semisal, jika Angkatan Darat menentang upaya TNI-AU merehabilitasi namanya
dalam Peristiwa 30 September 1965, tentu akan makin muncul ketidaksenangan
di kalangan Angkatan Udara.

71z5l4,5,2017-09-23,Arrowverse Power Girl Idea,james_notdeen,supergirlTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/supergirlTV/comments/71z5l4/arrowverse_power_girl_idea/,"To be clear, this is just an idea I had.  It's never going to happen, but I thought I'd share it nonetheless.  

With the multiverse being a recurring theme in the CW superhero shows (namely flash and super girl), it's no surprise that the creative team on the flash was hoping to include Power Girl at some point.  

This caused me to have some thoughts on how they could go about doing it, so I thought about laying out some of those ideas with you all.  I've also extrapolated on a lot of ideas so you guys could visualize what a TV show for Karen Starr would look like(thought it would never happen).

**Name**: Karen Starr/ Kara Jor-El
This is something I thought would be a good idea with to further distance Power Girl from Supergirl.  Since I believe it was mentioned that Kara Danvers doesn't exist on earth one, I thought maybe that Power Girl should be an *entirely* different person.  
Why? Well for one, it would be difficult for Melissa Benoist to play two separate characters on different shows. Also, Karen and Kara do not look that much alike(at least pre flashpoint), as Karen has shorter hair, taller, much more muscular, as well as two other things. The physical differences combined with the radically different personalities merit different actors in my opinion.  

**City: Sandstone.** Sandstone is a city in the American southwest in New Mexico.  It's also a major tech startup city, and is where StarrWare, Karen's company, is located.

**Backstory**: In direct contrast with earth-38, Karen is actually the daughter of Jor-El, meaning that she is actually the counterpart of superman in this universe.  Her origin story differs drastically from power girl's origin in the comics as well.  Karen's ship crash landed in the the mountains of New Mexico, where the Starr Family discovered the infant Karen in her pod and subsequently adopted her. As a child, she was brash and reckless, never liking to hold back.  As such, she'd often sneak out to use her newly developing powers.  Karen eventually graduated from college with degrees in both engineering and business administration (it took her 6 years to get through undergrad).  
Cut to present day: Karen is now the CEO of Starrware, an up and coming tech startup.  Much of the technology being produced from Starrware was reverse engineered from the ship Karen came to earth in.  As a result, her knowledge of her Kryptonian heritage is considerably more limited than her earth-38 counterparts.  That's not to say that Karen knows nothing of Krypton.  She knows she's from Krypton, she know's it's gone, she knows a little about Kryptonian society, and she knows she's from the house of El.  However, she doesn't really care about her heritage or birth family, in her own words, ""I'm my own own woman. And besides, it's the 21st century, nobody cares what family I'm part of."" It's this line of thinking that leads her not to have the ""S"" on her suit.

I figured that Karen would decide to become a hero not too long after the Dominator invasion, though she did play an instrumental role in keeping the dominators from wreaking havoc in Sandstone. Initially she tries doing it solo wearing a very simple outfit to hide her identity.  That is, until she gets caught in the act by **Hiro Okamura** (later codenamed **Toyman**), one of her employees.  Hiro agrees to help Karen at her request, as well as keep her powers a secret (after Karen half-jokingly told him that she'd fire and/or murder him).  

**Appearance**:  Karen is a tall woman in her late 20's.   She normally has short-medium length hair and blue eyes.  She sports a muscular physique(like Laci Kay Somers, a fitness model), and is regarded as a very attractive person by her peers (some interns joking about how she's too hot to have an engineering background).  While Karen's boobs a a running joke in the comics, I personally think for the sake of her character (and in order to appease more progressive tastes) that that feature is secondary to her having a muscular physique. 

Power Girl goes to considerably longer lengths to conceal her identity than Supergirl or Superman. For example, she normally has brown hair and blue eyes, but she and Hiro come up with the idea to use thermochromic hair dye and contacts.  Basically, this means that she can use heat vision, reflected off of the lenses in her glasses to heat her hair up, and activate the dye, causing it to turn blonde.  Same goes with her contact lenses, which causes her eye color to turn from blue to green. She also speaks with a valley girl accent as Power Girl, which sounds differently from how she speaks as Karen Starr. 

**Costume**: Needless to say, Power Girl's costume wouldn't carry over very well to live action without some changes.  I'll post up an idea of what it could look like once I think of something that would look good in live action while still capturing the essence of her comic outfit.

**Power Girl's Cat**:  In the comics, Power Girl owns a unnamed, one-eyed grumpy cat.  I think it would be hilarious to incorporate the character into the arrowverse under the name of Dexter Starr, or Dex Starr.  If you read comics, you'd know that Dex Starr is the name of a cat who becomes a red lantern, and that's exactly what's going to happen to Karen's cat.

Let me know what you guys think, or what I should do to improve on the concept. Thanks for reading y'all

71zet2,79,2017-09-23,My Experiences: going to a gay spa and getting a special massage,gaythrowaway4444,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/71zet2/my_experiences_going_to_a_gay_spa_and_getting_a/,"Hey guys, sorry I've been quiet for so long. Got really busy. As a reminder, this series is about my experiences as a gay 21-22 year old in New York. I'm about 5'11, muscular-twinkish body, brown hair and brown eyes.

So this is a story that happened in early July. I had been feeling stressed for a while at my internship from the workload, and was also constantly sore from my lifting regimen. I learned that the gay spa I'd been going to for a few months for my Brazilians offered massages, so when I called to make my next waxing appointment I inquired about a massage. I decided to get an hour long Swedish massage after my wax, and put it out of my mind.

The next weekend I went down to the spa and got my treatments. After my waxing was done I took a few minutes to admire my smooth groin and bubble butt in the mirror, before putting my clothes back on and heading out to the reception area. There, a well built, handsome Asian man was waiting for me. In broken English he asked if I was his next massage appointment and when I said yes, he led me to the next floor to a very well appointed massage room. He showed me where to hang my clothes and left the room, telling me to keep as much on or take as much off as I wanted and to lay face down on the table with the small towel over my butt. Then he left the room and gave me some privacy. I stripped down completely, not having any qualms about my body, and just managed to (mostly) cover my ass with the small towel when he knocked and reentered the room.

The massage started off normally. He was very good and quickly found the muscle areas that were stiffest from my lifting and skillfully relaxed away the tension. I was feeling very calm and was loving every minute of his hands on my oil slicked skin, when I noticed that he was up on the table, kneeling between my legs.

He started massaging my shoulders and back, using long strokes that forced him to lean all the way over me to reach my shoulders. This felt incredible, but after a few times of this I realized something: he was completely hard, and his erection was poking my butt with each stroke! I also became aware that on each stroke down my back he was getting closer and closer to my muscular ass. I could feel myself hardening against the table, wondering if I was imagining what he was doing.

Then, after several minutes of this quasi-grinding, he accidentally (maybe) knocked the small towel off of my ass. He made no move to retrieve it, and I didn't ask him to. He started directly massaging my ass cheeks, and loving the feeling, I let my legs subtly spread. He took the hint and started massaging my crack, rubbing gently against my freshly-smooth hole. I couldn't help myself. I moaned.

This was all the encouragement he needed and suddenly I was being fingered. I arched my back to give him better access while he lightly teased my prostate. He pulled his finger out of me and told me to roll over. I quickly did and directly above my head, through his thin uniform pants, I could see his rock hard if below averaged size cock. It was the perfect height above me to grab with my mouth, and grab it I did. Quick as a flash he dropped his pants and moved onto the table in a 69 position. I took him into my mouth (sadly, not long enough to deepthroat) and he began teasing my cockhead, oozing precum, with a series of slow licks. I couldn't help it and involuntary started humping my cock towards his face. He then climbed off of me, rolled on a condom, and used massage oil to lube us both up (yes, I know, oil eats through condoms but I was thinking with my dick and it didn't occur to me at the time. The condom didn't break and I got tested soon after this experience). Desperate for release, I turned myself around on the table and lifted my legs to my chest, offering my hole to him. He slid in and started pumping like a madman. I could see his muscular pecs, shiny with sweat, rippling like crazy and I could feel my muscular ass jiggling with each thrust. Unfortunately he wasn't quite long enough to more than brush my prostate but I was so horny by this point that it didn't matter. After a few minutes of fucking he started stroking me and it took me less than 5 strokes to shoot my load clear over my head and onto the floor. The tightening of my ass muscles must have brought him close to the edge too, as a few minutes later he gave one final thrust and emptied his load into the condom. 

He was suddenly very apologetic, saying that by policy the masseurs were only allowed to finger and jerk off for the happy ending (which I hadn't even known was on the table when I went there) and he had just been in a dry spell and couldn't help himself. I assured him that his secret was safe with me and sauntered off to the in room shower where I washed off the oils and our sweat, got dressed, and headed back out into the noise and heat of Manhattan. 

As always, I hope you guys liked! Comments and constructive criticism are always welcome, as are dms. More will come later! And I know that some people will say that this is fiction, but I swear to god it's exactly how it happened. Walking to the subway afterwards I texted my fuckbuddy Lucas and told him ""I think I just walked out of a porno"". Anyway, hope you horny fuckers enjoyed :)"
71zm5j,3,2017-09-23,Thinking about renting a 1BR apartment to move closer to my University. Would I be able to do it?,SkyeNorvil,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/71zm5j/thinking_about_renting_a_1br_apartment_to_move/,"Hello Reddit!

I’m a college student who wishes to go out and rent a 1BR apartment and move out of my parent’s home. Here’s a breakdown of my income and estimated expenses. I have no car payments (thankfully), debt free, and my credit score is hovering around 745.

**INCOME**

GI Bill - $1546*

Work - $1025 (25 hr/week | $10.25/hr)

**CURRENT EXPENSES** 

Medical/Dental Insurance: $58

Phone Bill: $70

MMO: $15

Spotify: $5

Auto Insurance: $62

**ESTIMATED EXPENSES**

Rent: $850 (Max I'm willing to pay)

Internet: $50

Electrical: $123 (City Average)

Water and Sewer: $70 (City Average)

Food: $300

Gas: $64

Renter’s Insurance: $13

**TOTAL INCOME:  $2571**

**TOTAL EXPENSES: $1680**

**Take Home: $891**

**Current savings: $8500**

So, here’s a bit of background information. I’ve rented before with a couple of roommates last year, and before that I was in the military. Due to a family emergency, I could not renew the lease with them and had to move back across town to care for my father. While I’m currently not paying any sort of rent or utility bills, my University (where I also work) is on the opposite side of town. 

The biggest motivator for me wanting to move is to regain some sort of personal independence and to significantly cut down on my commute time from home to school/work. I have to plan my work hours to stay outside of rush hour traffic. Currently my commute is 30 minutes both ways. During rush hour, the commute doubles to an hour both ways.

The apartments I’m looking at places me very close to my University with a commute time of less than 10 minutes. 

Right now, I’m receiving monthly payments from the GI Bill and my income from working at the University. The thing about the GI Bill is that it is dependent on the amount of credit hours I’m taking during a semester. I can expect the Bill to drop by half during intercession months ($773). I’m currently aiming for a summer internship to help cover expenses later on in the year. Failing that, we’re allowed to work a full 40 hours at the University only during that time ($1640 / mo during the summer would be my income if I take no classes, $2413 if I take classes part-time).

I have enough in savings to help cover for any emergencies and income lulls that may happen during the span of the lease. However, would I still be able to save money effectively while living out on my own? I understand that getting a roommate would cut my costs significantly, and that continuing to live with my parents would allow me to pocket a lot of my income. Like I said, the biggest motivator for me living out on my own would be the large amount of personal freedom that comes with it along with the reduced commute. While this sounds good to me, I would like second opinions to make sure I’m not walking right into a financial ditch and cover anything that I might’ve missed.

71zr8l,2,2017-09-23,"Me [20F] with my mom [54F], she wants me to skip a concert because it's 4 hours away when I already got her permission to go and payed 200 dollars for a ticket",throw-mymom-concert,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/71zr8l/me_20f_with_my_mom_54f_she_wants_me_to_skip_a/,"Throwaway bc it's embarrassing tbh

Anyway so I've been a fan of this dude for 8 years and for the first time EVER he's coming to a city near me so I can go and see him. Obviously I was super excited and I told my parents (who I live with) that I wanted to go and if it was okay with them. 

I asked my dad first and my dad said it was fine, my mom was a bit reluctant but eventually said yes. I went ahead and bought concert tickets for 200 dollars, they're front row. This happened roughly 2-3 months ago btw.

I'm going to the concert alone bc none of my friends like this artist and frankly I'm going to see him, not socialize. I really don't mind going alone. I live 4 hours away give or take from the place where the concert is held and I'll be going by train. Since I'm a student I can travel for free so it's super convenient. 

After the concert's done there's about 3 trains back to back I can take, so I'm pretty sure I'll make it on time. If I miss the last train, I'll have to wait until 03.00 'till the next train is riding again so it'll be pretty shit if I'm stranded but I'll survive.

Anyway to get to the problem: the concert is this Tuesday and suddenly my mom doesn't want me to go anymore. It started with me calling her the other day as I was coming home from work to tell her that the concert was gonna end sooner than I expected and how that was good transportation wise as I'd have a bigger chance to make it home on time. She suddenly went like ''well I don't know if you should go, maybe I should go with you and just wait until the concert's done, it's dangerous, you don't know anyone, what if you miss the train..blablabla..'' Can you imagine... I'm 20 years old and she wants to wait there at night in the cold until I'm done...

Anyway I got mad and told her that no I don't want her there. I want to go by myself and I'll come back by myself.

The next day she apparently talked to my sister about this, so my sister started to text me similar things. ''Mom won't bother you, she'll just wait until you're done so you don't feel alone, why don't you go with your friends etc''

I got mad at her too and I said that I felt disrespected. Then she blew up at me how I was being ungrateful and they just wanted to help..even though no one ever asked for their help but ok

Then my dad texts me this evening. He's saying things like ''well you don't have to go to the concert, I'll pay you the ticket price back, and why don't you go with friends you won't enjoy it if you go alone, it's dangerous, bla bla bla''

I don't have any friends! Thanks to my parents! They never allow me to go anywhere so all my friends have given up on me. They never hit me up, always do fun stuff together and just don't bother asking me anymore since my parents never allow me to go anywhere. I have no one to turn to. They don't like my old friends, they don't like any new friends I introduce to them, they don't like anyone. They want to keep me in their own little bubble and that's that.

I'm moving out next year for an internship and I'll be gone for 6 months so that's little solace. I'm extremely scared because I've never been on my own and they just make me feel like any step I'll set outside will result in me getting mugged/raped/murdered/abducted/etc. I was so excited to go this concert but now I feel really insecure and I'm scared something will happen to me because of them.

Sorry for the word vomit but I just don't know what to do and I feel ashamed so I can't talk about it with people I know. I feel like it's so fucking embarrassing to have your parents tell you these things when you're twenty years old and I feel like no one I know can relate to it.

So what should I do? Should I go alone? Should I ''allow'' my mom to come with me and admit my defeat? Should I not go at all? Please advise me..
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My mom doesn't want me to go to a concert  because it's four hours away and she's scared something will happen to me even though we discussed this months ago and I already bought the tickets. This is an ongoing pattern with anything that I attempt to do. "
71zytk,5,2017-09-23,Moving from hourly to salary - company will give me an offer without negotiation. What should I look for?,ButtFlapMan,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/71zytk/moving_from_hourly_to_salary_company_will_give_me/,"Hi all,

The title pretty much sums it up.

My manager wanted to see me and then told me I performed very well this year (this is my first year at the job), that I have received a lot of positive feedback and that they want to move me from a part-time hourly internship to a full-time job (part-time until I finish my degree in early 2018).

I said that I'm happy to hear that and that those are great news, and then my manager said that he will pass ""that"" up (that I'm interested in the offer. Not saying I accept it, just interested) and that they will make me an offer.

It's a big IT company, and by default I'm expecting RSUs and a good salary. As far as I know there are no bonuses but this is something I can ask when I'm getting the offer.

Is there anything specific I should look for or take note? Any questions you recommend me asking?

What if the salary is too low in my opinion? I don't expect it to be but I don't know what to do in such a case. I know how much some of my friends, who work at different companies, are earning, because we don't keep this stuff to ourselves (it only benefits to share!)

Oh and maybe most importantly, what would happen if I try to negotiate it? Whoever is presenting me the offer isn't my direct manager but [I think] the one above him. I suppose they're going to talk afterwards so nothing will stay private.

Much appreciated,

I'd lived a good life by following the instructions of a specific book. ""The Life of Terrance"", by Terrance Brown. 

I'd found it by happenstance in the local library, on the ""to be sorted"" cart. The faded golden lettering stuck out. Or perhaps my subconscious had just caught my name. It was an old book bound in blue cloth, with a border that snapped as I cracked it open.

In these first yellowed pages, I read of my birth, and how I was almost a miscarriage. As I delved further, memories in the back of my mind clawed their way to the surface. The bullies Tim and Howard from third grade. The sand I kicked into my friend's birthday cake because he wouldn't share. What should have unnerved me only incited anger, as I thought of the privacy the author violated by documenting my life. 

It took me through my teenage struggles. My first relationship with Hannah from next door and how we used to sneak out at night to Starbucks, and sit in a little nook around the corner where nobody could see us make out. My grades rising and plummeting. The books and movies I'd loved and hated. 

It took me all the way up to the day I found it, but there was still more. 

*Curious about his own life, Terrance continued reading. He decided to play along for now. He checked his email and found an opportunity for an internship. He decided to apply.* 

My college had an academic advisor who kept spamming us with job and internship opportunities. However, few were relevant to my major, and so I'd filtered them out to the spam folder. I checked this folder and was surprised to find an opportunity at a company just three miles from my house. I spent the next hour or so polishing my resume, writing a cover letter, and sending in an application. 

I got the internship. The book told me which stocks to buy. When to sell. Nothing as big as a lottery ticket, and I made a few mistakes. But on purpose. Because the book said to. I felt that, somehow, if I defied it, I would die. Or it'd lose its power. In either case, it was in my best interest to follow it. Up until now.

I sit on an empire built over the last 30 years as one of the 200 richest men in the world. I'm 50 years old, and in good health. But the book is on its last few pages. I avoided reading it for the longest time. But something in me is burning. Something that longs for an adventure. It's taken me this far. How much further could I go? 

How would I die? A spectacular death? Or a heart attack? Was I only meant to live to fifty years old? Hands shaking, I cracked open the book as my phone buzzed. I flipped to the last page and read the four words in the middle.

72010a,39,2017-09-23,Open letter to the NSBE/SHPE on the career fair’s dress code,AutomatonSwan,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/72010a/open_letter_to_the_nsbeshpe_on_the_career_fairs/,"To the directors of the career fair, Matthew Sanchez, Ayana Betty, Jo-Ann Diaz, and Mariana Basilio, and the members of NSBE and SHPE,

I’d like to express my sincere gratitude for your hard work in the service of the Rensselaer community by hosting the career fair year after year. For 39 years, this event has served as an invaluable interface between the student body and some of the world’s foremost employers, and your efforts are appreciated greatly by current student and alumni alike. However, the dress code enforced by NSBE and SHPE flies in the face of the career fair’s mission and stands in opposition to the values of Rensselaer, and should be relaxed even further for the career fair’s fortieth anniversary.

The dress code is a relic of a past age, a vestige from a time when individuals where judged by their appearance just as much as or even more so than by their competence and credentials. In decades past, suits and dresses were mandatory elements of any business environment; today, professionals at Fortune 500 companies like IBM, Google, Apple, and GE eschew formal dress in favor of more comfortable and casual attire. You don’t have to take my word for it: almost none of the recruiters at the career fair this weekend were wearing formal business attire, and the ones that did dress up were the representatives of the US Navy. Many recruiters donned jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, and other casual wear. In the last year, Ph.D. students and even Rensselaer professors have reportedly been turned away for failure to adhere to NSBE and SHPE’s strict dress standards. Meanwhile, many employers no longer care about formal attire and some even shun suits and ties: billionaire Peter Thiel famously refuses to invest in CEOs that dress up to meetings with him. His company, Palantir, attended this year’s career fair. 

The dress code established by the NSBE and SHPE dictates that attendees wear at minimum business casual attire, but insults and demeans the Rensselaer student body by specifically prohibiting ridiculous dress items such as heavy gold chains and severely-sagging baggy jeans, attire one might typically find in a grungy hip hop music video. The dress guidelines for women are similarly degrading, and admonish women from wearing “distracting socks or jewelry,” dresses that show “deep cleavage” or are “too tight,” or dresses and skirts that “end more than three inches above the knee.” As students at a top engineering college, the members of NSBE and SHPE should afford their classmates enough respect to allow them to present themselves to employers as they see fit. Furthermore, the de facto suit-and-tie-only dress contributes further to the perception of homogeneity among Rensselaer’s student body, at a time when the university is seeking increase our population’s racial and gender diversity.

Indeed, Rensselaer is one of the only top schools that still enforces such a dress code. Dress codes are not enforced at the careers fairs of 7 of the 8 Ivy League schools (Columbia excepting), nor at MIT, Caltech, and Stanford. In fact, Harvard even asks students to refrain from strict dress, and encourages “students to attend all campus recruiting events in ‘smart’ casual or business casual attire … and to refrain from business formal attire (suits) and follow our more casual dress guidelines, which include khakis, dress pants, skirts, button-down long sleeve shirts, sweater sets, blouses, etc.” Does chaos reign at Harvard’s career fair? Do their students interview while wearing fishnets, neon shoes, and ugly Christmas sweaters? (All of these items are specifically prohibited in the dress code guidelines.) Even at Columbia, students that choose not to abide by a business-professional dress code are not prohibited from entering the event, as I was.

When I arrived at the career fair this Friday in a crisp white polo, black khakis, and gray Ralph Lauren dress shoes—the same business casual attire I wore daily to my internship at Sandia National Laboratories—I was told by event staff that I was underdressed and would not be permitted inside. As I waited to speak with the event leadership, I watched as several of my peers were turned away at the door for various dress code violations of their own. This is unacceptable. The sweltering heat, cramped quarters, and loud noise endemic to the career fair, combined with the pressure of quickly making a favorable impression on recruiters, makes the career fair a stressful experience in itself for many students. Some students spend hours prepping their resumes, rehearsing their 60-second sell, and planning which booths to visit. We should not add to their concerns the fear of humiliation in front of their peers for their choice of dress.

As gatekeepers of Rensselaer’s largest career fair, the student body confers unto you its trust with the expectation that you will act as good stewards for the advancement of both the student body and the Institute. The dress code imposed by the NSBE and SHPE violates that covenant, and acts as an unnecessary barrier to employment when we should all be working to remove these barriers. I urge you to relax enforcement of the dress code, and work for greater inclusion and broader participation in the future.

Regards,

720ass,1,2017-09-23,My boss (owner and founder) has begun talking about me buying in the become part owner of the company. This is in tandem to me planning on moving to a larger city to attend a part time grad program while networking for opportunities for our business.,the_person_who_was,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/720ass/my_boss_owner_and_founder_has_begun_talking_about/,"I've been working at the same company for a little over seven years. Started as an unpaid intern and have always received promotions, raises, and opportunities to work on exciting projects that help me evolved personally and professionally. When I started there were five people total on staff, an investor came on five years about and we went up to fifteen staff members, then two and a half years ago  the investor was bought out by our founder and we went down to three staff members. I'm now the only ""original"" member left aside from the founder.

When the investor left I became ""Creative Director"" which is a big fancy title that I'm aware is a bit beyond my experience and skill set, but it's something I've been growing into and has opened me up to incredible opportunities to lead projects for large brands like BMW, Adobe, and Nike. Last year, I was getting ready to leave the company because I was only getting about 37k a year, so I sat down with my boss and told him I would leave by the end of the year if I didn't receive a significant raise. After that meeting I did a lot of work on our sales and project management processes which resulted in more clients and revenue, so it became a no brainer for my boss to give me a raise and I'm now receiving 50k a year. My goal for the next 5-7 years is to get around 80-100k a year.

This year my boss has been starting to talk about having me buy in to become part owner. I'm not sure what benefit this would have for me, but I get the sense that my boss wants me to buy in so it would be more difficult for me to leave if I received an offer from someone else. Are there any benefits to be becoming and owner that I'm not aware of? My boss is a bit strong willed, and while he's not completely unreasonable, if he wants to do something he'll typically end up doing it regardless if other people agree. I saw him go rogue and do his own thing when he was sharing ownership in the past.

Another element that's in play is I've been talking to him about moving to a bigger city and joining a co-working office that would offer networking opportunities. We've done this with contractors and employees in the past, and has been beneficial to building relationships. We live about a 2 hours drive from this city and represent ourselves as being located there since the name is more recognized on a national level than where we are actually based, so one benefit of me moving there would be that I could easily meet with clients, potential clients, and partners, and this could have major benefits for the company. I'm also looking at a part time graduate program which is geared toward working professionals, has impressive alumni, and could serve as a means of me networking in the area. I'm getting the sense that my boss wants me to become owner so that it would limit my ability to leave the company, but I would be more interested in drafting up some kind of 2 or 3 year contract rather than becoming fiscally involved in the company.

Anyone have any insight into this?"

721cxp,1,2017-09-23,I'm sick of not feeling like myself but am apprehensive about Trying to use SSRI's to help the nerves. Anyone have any positive experiences on them?,Crocodilemuffins,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/721cxp/im_sick_of_not_feeling_like_myself_but_am/,"Hi all. I've lurked but haven't made a post here yet. Hello. :) I'm a 22(F) recently graduated college student. I've had issues with anxiety (primarily health concerns) in the past, but I thought I was 'better' during the first half of this year. I focused on school and my boyfriend and friends and hadn't had intrusive hypochondria thoughts in months. I took prozac 10mg from October 2015-April 2016, and then stopped to see if I could function and was doing awesome without it until about July of this year. Now, it has gotten SO out of hand to the point where I'm becoming a borderline hypochondriac. Currently I'm terrified of having a food allergy. As far as I know, I don't have any. I'm also underweight and another fear of mine is that I will get super sick and lose so much weight that I'll become emaciated and unable to gain weight. I think part of the problem of these issues suddenly rushing to the forefront of my mind stems from the fact that after I graduated in June this year, without school to keep me preoccupied, my nerves are on high near constantly. I don't have a job either yet, so a lot of my time is spent at home where I live with my partner.



 My issues started when in July I got the common cold and my first thought was &gt;&gt; I'm going to die &gt;&gt; and then after I got better (because I know common colds can't kill me but I get super irrational whenever I get sick), I got fixated on the side effects of blood clots being a thing from my birth control pill. After weeks of turmoil, I got off my birth control pill and my mood has improved - not to mention I am no longer afraid of getting a clot - but now I am terrified that I have food allergies because of certain symptoms I've been having. For perspective, I am not having daily panick attacks - however its whenever I wake up and eat something, I think about all that could go wrong for hours in the day and its is like a near constant background noise in my head of ""what if you die."" 

I feel like this is taking over my life. I have an appointment scheduled with a therapist next Thursday but I'm wondering if I should ask her for meds. My physician wanted me to try Zoloft but I'm afraid of the side effects. When I was put on Prozac 10mg, I had bad side effects until it started working - I couldn't walk straight, had insomnia, and my thoughts of suicide persisted. Now, I am not suicidal, I sleep like a baby and am generally a happy person (when I'm not internally freaking out about asphyxiation) - my issue is I'd like to be able to eat stuff without thinking I'm going to asphyxiate and die and to stop freaking out about this. My only fear with the stuff is the side effects - I need to be in a stable place mentally for my internship and life functioning in general, but if the meds fuck with my sleep, I tend to become even MORE anxious if my sleep schedule is fucked up and worry that I will be a complete wreck. Cause right now I have constant intrusive thoughts, but at least I can sleep like a baby for 8+ hours and give my mind a break right now.


I also am going to see an allergist next Thursday, but I don't know if it will help. The last time I went to one, the test prick they did first made me bleed a tiny drop of blood (apparently that isn't supposed to happen) and they said they may not be able to tell if I'm actually allergic to something if my skin is that sensitive (It is - I can literally absentmindedly scratch my thigh for a minute and if i used too much pressure, I'll get marks that last for hours). ;_;


TL;DR will medication help me curb my hypochondriac tendencies (constantly thinking I'm going to keel over and die of asphyxiation after eating something) and live the way I used to before this summer."
721p51,107,2017-09-23,"""She definitely needs that prescription""",joe_jon,TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/721p51/she_definitely_needs_that_prescription/,"The title comes from how my pharmacist described this lady after everything had calmed down and we were focused back on our work. I'll elaborate, this might be a long one.

I'm an intern at the retail chain that starts with a W (not Walmart, the other one), this specific store I only work at once every other Saturday due to school and commute time. Anyways, this one guy comes in, his insurance was being problematic and whatnot, the usual, my pharmacist was handling it so I was going about my business. The pharmacist had Insurance Guy go sit down while he worked on it and as Insurance Guy goes to sit down this woman (read: Crazy Lady) starts accusing Insurance guy of calling her a ""fat b***h"". Now, I don't know if he actually called her anything, but the girl who was at the register at the time said she didn't hear Insurance Guy say a word.

Anyway, Insurance Guy sits down and Crazy Lady just kinda starts going off on him, and Insurance Guy held his ground by reiterating he didn't say anything. He seemed genuine and Crazy Lady calmed down for a moment so I didn't think anything of it, but stayed on alert just in case. A couple of minutes go by, Insurance Guy's insurance starts cooperating and I meet at the register booth to ring him out. In the adjacent booth is crazy lady, getting all bent out of shape because she has to wait the usual 10 minutes it takes for us to fill the medication. She decides to take it out on Insurance Guy, because of course she does, and goes back to accusing him of calling her names. Insurance Guy reasonably gets a bit defensive, denying saying a word to her but making a quip about how sitting down and waiting for a few minutes isn't as difficult as it sounds (not gonna lie, I agreed with him, but kept it in my head, I digress). Crazy Lady did *not* like that one at all and started berating him even more. At this point I stepped in and asked her what the problem was, and after her explaining it (even though I had already heard it as it happened), I told her it's a he-said-she-said and there's nothing I can do. She wasn't a fan of that one, but I have a desk and a locked door keeping me away from her so I don't mind being respectfully assertive.

So I finish ringing up Insurance Guy, attempting to diffuse the situation a little by talking about the brewery on his shirt. Crazy Lady had other plans and decided to call Insurance Guy ""fat"" several times, to which reminded her she's on private property and needs to calm down. 

As Insurance Guy turns to leave he looks at Crazy Lady says ""I hope your day goes better"" and walks away. At this moment, Crazy Lady earned her name. She runs after him and starts pushing him as if it was some really bad attempt to tackle him. Insurance Guy gets away and avoids her, Crazy Lady comes back up to me and starts yelling as if it's his fault she did it. I calmly asked her if I need to call the police, as she did just attempt to assault someone. She didn't like that I wasn't taking her side and starts yelling at me, and I just calmly repeat myself, asking if I need to get the police involved (it didn't occur to her that attempted assault that was on several cameras put in her in a losing position).

As I'm telling her that she needs to calm down, she notices my university intern badge and interprets that to ""I don't need to listen to you"" and starts yelling ""you're a trainee!! You can't tell me what to do!!"". Don't know how that was relevant but I ignored it until she started yelling ""I wanna speak to your supervisor!!!"" which I took as ""oh good, you're not my problem anymore"".

The store manager comes to talk to her and Crazy Lady asks ""to see the security camera to prove Insurance Guy called her names"". Big problem there Crazy Lady: those cameras don't record audio, and the relevant cameras just recorded you assault someone. The manager tells her that's she's not gonna look at the cameras and that Crazy Lady needs to pick up her Rx and leave. To my relief, Crazy Lady did just that.

After all parties had left and it was just me and the pharmacist again, I looked at him and went ""well. That was interesting"". He looked me and just said ""that women is not right in the head"", to which I agreed and he goes ""yup, she definitely needed that rx"". We shared a laugh and the day went on without another issue.

Sorry for such a long story. It was one of those times where a lot of stuff happens in a short amount of time."
721usf,1,2017-09-23,What options do I have?,forget4,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/721usf/what_options_do_i_have/,"Im in my senior year, just found out I got rejected from 3 out of the Big 4 firms and some other small firms as well. I am waiting on a couple other ones, theres even a small firm that I really want to work for but Im not sure when I would hear back if I got an interview and if I didnt get one then I wont ever get a notification. I have only received one interview request for a very small firm that Im not too interested in, especially since Im not a fan of the area and Im not even sure how much I would like it at all. It was mostly a back up option and I have a friend who works there so I can at least know what to expect, he can help me do well, and I will be working with him so there is an upside to it.

I also have a summer internship on my resume from a great firm but I did not get a full time offer because my reviews werent great. I think I got the short end of the stick with that since I couldnt do anything about the areas I did bad on so all I can do is improve. I will be graduating with 150 credits but I can prolong it to another semester if I wanted to so that I can still use my school's recruiting sites and fairs. Should I just try to get this full time position from the small firm, study for and take the CPA with my own money, put in my two years, and then try to move to where I want to go and find a job in private that I want? Should I graduate and just keep applying when there are open positions, take the CPA in the mean time,  and try to get a job at a firm I like and go from there? Or what would you recommend?

I have attended accounting related clubs, polished my resume, met with recruiters enough so they knew my name, yet it didnt seem to help. Any advice would be really appreciated, thanks."
722amp,7,2017-09-23,Three year relationship is over.,Lordsnoww,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/722amp/three_year_relationship_is_over/,"I wish we could have had the chance to talk calmly and in person one last time. I wish we could have talked things over without our egos getting in the way, to truly find out why things weren't working. I wish you would have listened to me when I said I wanted to focus on the present in our relationship. That wasn't because I still believed in never wanting to get married and have kids, it was because I felt like in talking about it, with our relationship as it was, for as long as it was, it was irresponsible and would be doubling down without actually figuring out what we wanted in this. Either way it's as I said, people can change; I know I did on that topic at least.

 I know our situation was not ideal, I went straight to graduate school (internship, classes, and work going on now), and you into a career (to which you were not satisfied with but wanted to give your all anyway). But hell, we spent at least 6 months of our relationship long distance where I commuted 4 hours to see you every other weekend. Was this new situation really that bad compared to what we already went through together? What happened to the spark in making the best of it? 

Maybe that is where the troubles started, we couldn't see each other as much as we could and wanted to. Maybe over time as we grew, we grew apart because of the constant difficulties that comes with distance. Or maybe we really were not right for each other and we were both so desperate for the companionship and wanting more than was possible from each other we kept things going. Hell, maybe we should have woken up sooner as the last year has gone in how our satisfaction with the relationship spun downwards. Petty fights, disappointment, feeling the distance  growing farther away in  having little to talk about, breaking up and getting back back together on practically a bi-monthly basis. Maybe we should have known.

Despite our dysfunction and now final breakup I still care for you. I cannot believe I am saying that, especially being that I am the one that led the charge on this break up but that's the truth. I just couldn't do it anymore. I felt like no matter what I did I couldn't make you happy. I felt like you didn't care who I was. I felt like you didn't even like me for who I was, that I was a burden. I felt like I was constantly pushing myself to reach for you but you couldn't be bothered to reach back. I felt like something was off for a long time and every time i put myself out there to talk you would say everything was okay. Everything was not okay, why couldn't we have been honest with at least that sooner. Maybe we could have gotten ahead of the curve in this. I am at fault for this too but it doesn't matter anymore.

It's only been a week and this is the first full day we haven't said a word to each other and it hurts. There is so much I know that was wrong and toxic in our relationship but my mind keeps highlighting the good and I can't stand it. I don't want to care anymore, I don't want to remember anything anymore, all I do in my free time is ruminate and cry. I  don't want to feel anymore. Three years.

I'm going to force myself out of this. Trying to make an appointment to see a therapist, signed up for a gym and looking to sign up with a trainer two days a week, i am looking to branch out socially. I am hurting but I won't let this end me, I can't. "

- 2) [Week one updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/706ojc/rearwolf_fantasy_football_week_1_winners_roster/)

Another week down! The league is still going strong, no no-shows yet, everyone is staying active on the waiver wire, but goddammit guys let's trade more! Other than that everyone seems to be enjoying and participating in the league, so what more can I ask for? I have many complaints, bascially all about my team, so I'll get to that in my little blurb, feel free to ignore that. With my small ramblings done let's get to the good stuff! 

[Here are the week 2 scores!](https://imgur.com/a/91Jfb) yours truly drops to 0-2 which I will rant about in full later, but surprisingly Andy Dalton Wilcox also drops to 0-2 (my pick for strongest roster) and since I'm posting this a little late, i'll add a quick note. The Jackels just scored damn near 40 points in one night thanks to Todd Gurleys monster night on Thursday! If you lose, I'll be shocked -- so a very early congrats on the win this week.

My pick for week 2's winner is hard not to go with the Lombardo Trophy. Basically made the perfect lineup to dominate the league in points scored, so props to you my man. 

Okay enough of my ramblings, let's move on to the teams! 

- [Andy Dalton Wilcox](https://imgur.com/a/PgSwe) a surprising slow start to the year, is looking good to get his first win this week. Why you ask? WELL JAY FUCKING CUTLER VS THE JETS THAT'S WHY! *ahem* honestly I look at this roster and just don't see how he can lose, but I'm clearly no expert at 0-2 myself. 

- [Beacoup Dolores](https://imgur.com/a/4CypG) Looking pretty solid for week 3, as much as I hate to admit it Gillislee could be a star in fantasy, so he has a solid RB behing two already star RB's Mccoy and Murray/Henry. Also starting my boy Devante Parker, again vs the Jets so look for a good day tomorrow! (watch me eat shit for talking so much crap against them) 

- Next up is me [Classic Jarles Landry](https://imgur.com/a/lkgAp) - I have a lot to rant about, but I'll keep it short and simple. Let me tell you the tale of my Monday night. With a 1-2 point lead, and only one player available Matthew Stafford I was feeling comfortable. Problem is my opponent had 2 players left. The Giants D and the Lions Kicker Prater. I felt comfortable with the matchup, but Stafford against the Giants D? Ehh... A little rough. Well hey! It's okay Jenkins is out! Look for a big day in the air for Stafford right? Well no. 2 TD's is great and all, but fucking 122 yards in the air is god awful. The lions are notorious for not having a run game, keeping their offense in the air, but goddammit not that night. I wound up losing by only 2 points. AGGGGH!!! Also, come on LeVeon Bell! I know you're a damn good back, help me out bro! Whatever, moving on! 

- [Intern Geno Smith](https://imgur.com/a/Hq87W) is heading into this week 2-0 so far be it from me to comment on anything about his roster, but I'd feel very uneasy about my top 2 RB's being in the same game being the Colts and Browns. That said, it's not like the RB's on the bench have a better shot. Good luck to the stud WR's Evans and Thomas on Sunday! 

- [Kurt Werner Herzog](https://imgur.com/a/sSIq5) Is 0-2 heading into this week, and after losing David Johnson it's gonna be an uphill battle. That said, I look at the roster and think it's a solid choice heading into this week. I will again repeat -- The Dolphins are playing the Jets and Stills has 9 TD's last year and one last week. Potential is there (but don't seriously take my homer ass opinion for much) 

- [Mmm Yes Points](https://imgur.com/a/cQaSw) Is starting JUICE! (Jarvis Landry) God damn I bet he wishes we were in a PPR league. Landry had 13 receptions last week. Aside from that starting the Colts D is a big gamble (even if it is the Browns) and I still laugh everytime I see that he has two kickers (no offense buddy) I fucking love Sproles though, and since it looks like Blount isn't a part of the Eagles offense, Sproles will have a big role. 

- [Punch Waterfalls](https://imgur.com/a/U86ry) Took a loss thanks to Zeke Elliott last week not doing much vs the Broncos. Still obviously not a bad idea to start him considering the O line the cowboys have and the year Zeke had last year. It happens, he'll probably bounce back in a big way this week. Other than that, he also started Sammy Watkins who had a monster game this Thursday! So looking good Punch Waterfalls! 

- [Team Price](https://imgur.com/a/rxGPW) is banking on two rookie RB's but they're two solid rookies to bank on. Mccaffery has started slow, thanks to the Panthers and Newton facing two good defenses these past couple weeks, but we'll see how they do against the mighty mighty Saints D this week. Starting the Texans D against the Pats which I hate to admit could be a bad idea. Overall looking good though! 

- [The Jackels](https://imgur.com/a/YWMkA) Won this week (laugh at me if I get this prediction wrong obviously) but seriously, Gurley had 100+ yards and 3 TD's he could have reasonably had 5 TD's he was SO CLOSE! Honestly the more I look at this roster the more I like it. The Jackels is in a really good spot for this league, we'll see if the semen demon can keep up his great QB play the past couple of weeks this week, but overall looking good man! 

- [The Lombardo Trophy](https://imgur.com/a/M9cyJ) Seems to be following the philosophy of play the D playing against the Jets. (I'm so sorry for shitting on the Jets so much, I can't help myself) So good on you The Lombardo Trophy! Also just has a stacked roster from top to bottom, and we'll see if Abdullah can grow on his impressive performance last week. God knows the Lions actually need a run game 

- [Vic Takk Poe](https://imgur.com/a/Hr7Dx) 2-0 and is next, and he's looking to start Mixon this week! Honestly I think Mixon is going to be a stud, and now that the Bengals fired their shitty OC who scored them no TD's we'll see if they properly use Mixon this week. Unfortunately he started Cooper Kupp, who got overshadowed even though it was a shootout and the Rams scored 41 points. Starting the Eagles D against an unbelievably bad Ginats offense, which will definitely be a good start this week. 

- [Wiger Hates Fries](https://imgur.com/a/KF3SD) is our last player and my final shit on the Jets comment is a really serious one -- Ajayi is about to have a fucking monster game. He did really good against the Chargers D which surprised me, and the Jets have one of if not the worst run defenses in the league. I expect him to run all over these guys. The rest of the roster looks solid, but ugh, the homer in me can't love this matchup enough. That said -- the Jets always play us tough so who the hell knows. 

OKAY! If you actually read all that I A) applaud you, and B) apologize for how much I ragged on the Jets. The homer in me came out a bit, but hey, let's face it. We all know how bad the Jets are gonna be this year. The Jets always play Miami tough so I could be 100% wrong in all of my write-ups. Aside from that, I like everyones roster, am happy everyone is paying attention, and (hopefully) enjoying the league! Here's to a good week 3 everyone! "

Here are some questions that I have:

	1. How did you get an android developer job? Did you have formal training in Android or did you self learn?
	2. I've seen some android developer job requirements. Some companies require you to show a portfolio of applications on the Google Play store. What if you do not have an application good enough to put on the app store? Will companies still accept you?
	3. Are there internship opportunities in android developer positions for fresh computer science graduates with not much knowledge in android development? (But willing to learn)
	4. Is there any courses for getting a formal android certification that's good enough for a job? 
	5. What's a typical day for an Android developer like? Is it a lot of coding? Meetings?
	6. What is your salary like?

722um8,36,2017-09-23,"An Introduction to BETSY, one of pop music's most underrated and incredible new talents | [DISCUSSION]",Tedyonce,popheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/722um8/an_introduction_to_betsy_one_of_pop_musics_most/,"I *had* to make this post because BETSY is practically nonexistent on this sub (there’s only one post about her!). She is absolutely incredible, and I’m pissed off that I didn’t find her music sooner.

********

#BIO

BETSY is a singer from Wales that describes her personal aesthetic as “trashy opulence” (in her own words: “That phrase 'trashy opulence' marries my two worlds. I come from a goose farm and worked in fashion. It's a bit swanky but a bit trashy.”). 

Born Elizabeth Humfrey, BETSY was raised on a goose farm before landing an internship with Balenciaga. Despite her love of fashion, her heart belonged to music. In an interview with BBC, she said, ""I used to come back to London every weekend to do dodgy open mic nights. It was just killing me a bit that I wasn't getting the opportunity to do music all the time."" 

At this point, she made a critical decision to move back to Wales to pursue music. She began by making songs on her computer and giving out CD’s with her face on them. She got her first break when a friend’s brother suggested her as a vocalist for a track to her now current manager, who gave her some money to create music. She wrote her songs in a caravan in  her brother’s garden (which took five days to clean out after its last occupant). 

Now, she is currently signed to Warner Music UK, and will be releasing her eponymous debut on September 29, 2017. She also performed at Paris Fashion Week for Chanel.

*******

#INFLUENCES

BETSY’s voice is reminiscent of the house divas that ruled the 90’s. Some of her cited influences include Annie Lennox, Aretha Franklin, Shirley Bassey. Her voice also brings Cher and Florence Welch to mind. Her music uses orchestral strings often as well.

*********

#MUSIC

[**Fair**] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGMitPTUtZs)

*Fair* is BETSY’s debut single, and is the perfect introduction to her. Here, the bombastic instruments are stripped away, leaving only bare synths, strings, and her striking voice. The track speaks of holding on to a dead relationship desperately.

[**Little White Lies**] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUek25uzA_Y)
*Little White Lies* is a more uptempo song, and was the fourth single released off of *Betsy*. The song is a dance-able, strings-laden song about falling out of love with her S.O., who is oblivious to the whole situation. The song starts out minimal, but has an anthemic chorus. Listen to this one if you like Paloma Faith or Ella Henderson.

[**Lost &amp; Found**] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsvijIPoPF4)

*Lost &amp; Found* is a drum and bass influenced song, and sounds like it would be a massive hit in the UK. BETSY sings about a past relationship that refuses to die. BETSY put it best:

&gt; Remember your first love, but maybe not as fondly as you’d like? “Lost &amp; Found” is about that feeling of obsession and aggravation. This bloke would annoyingly tip up and disappear as randomly as he had appeared for years after we’d split.

[**Time**] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGuxljYgBXk)

*Time* is one of her earlier singles, and is more stripped down. However, it is just as bombastic as the rest of her music. She sings about frustration in a relationship that isn’t going anywhere. The pitched vocals and sparkling synths bring Låpsley to mind.

[**You Won’t Love Me**] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wly7No0QC-M)

*You Won’t Love Me* is BETSY’s most recent release, and contains her most massive chorus yet. She sings of insecurity, and how she knows her lover only loves her for material purposes. She said this about the song: 

&gt; I felt like he loved me because he couldn’t be with me and also because he liked the idea of me being a singer, but I really felt that if we took the relationship any further it would all crumble to dust. You know when it’s the wrong love because it feels so much stronger.

*********

Overall, BETSY is an incredible talent that deserves superstardom. Her voice is unique and singular, and her music is amazing. She has an unparallelled vision, and a solid, original aesthetic. Check her out!

72311j,39,2017-09-24,[F4M] A Humiliating Asshole Pounding,sunshineharlot,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/72311j/f4m_a_humiliating_asshole_pounding/,"[Closed]

Jenna squirmed against her bonds, her naked body shivering in the air-conditioned room. Her ankles were tied to either side of the desk, her hands stretched out in front of her as she lay bent over the desk of her boss. She looked up nervously at her colleagues, who had gathered not a minute ago at the bequest of Mr Peterson.

""I'm sure everyone is wondering why I have called you into my office,"" he was saying calmly. Jenna couldn't see him, since he was sitting behind his desk, absently stroking her ass cheek as though she was his pet, instead of one of his best employees. 

""We all know that Jenna is one of our best sales executives here,"" he said, to a ripple of murmured assent through the small crowd. ""And we *all* know about the unfortunate incident of the Jenkins project.""

Jenna whimpered, squirming against the ropes. Her clothes lay on the couch in the office - she could see them - after she was made to strip and fold them neatly in a pile. She knew it would be a while before she would be allowed to put them on. Or even walk straight.

""Here at our company, we believe in holding one another to our *best* standards...and we know that this is not the best Jenna can do."" Mr Peterson cleared his throat, perhaps deliberately dragging out the moment, or just admiring the way her ass quivers on his desk. 

""Err...as such, I'm sure you all know the protocol in such a situation, as unprecedented as it is."" He withdrew his hand, no doubt lacing his fingers the way Jenna had seen him do a thousand times before. 

""So just to be clear, it is as allows: each employee will take a turn in Jenna's...ass, ensuring that you deposit your seed inside of her. No one is allowed to leave until this is achieved. Afterwards, to prove that she has sincerely learned her lesson for mishandling one of our largest clients, she will kneel before the office, spread those lovely cheeks and push out the results of her punishment while issuing her official apology.""

Jenna looked up and saw her desk mate Randall with an unmistakable hard on in his pants as he looked upon her naked bound form, and he looked away guiltily.

After all, no one had ever thought *Jenna* would get the fabled punishment. It had been just a rumour, a dirty office joke. Yet one botched sale later, here she was.

""I presume no one has any other questions?"" Everyone was silent. Mr Peterson sighed wearily, and got up from his chair.

""Very well. As protocol dictates I will be the first to carry out the punishment.""

There was the clinking of his belt as Jenna whimpered again, thrashing more wildly on the desk as her fellow colleagues did nothing. Some looked away. 

""Guys, please -"" she pleaded, searching their faces for a chance of convincing one of them to defend her. She had never taken anything up the ass before, much less fifteen times in a row. ""You - you know how ridiculous this is...""

""*Enough,*"" barked Mr Peterson, as he spread her cheeks and spat on her asshole, the tip of his thick cock pressed intimidatingly against her virgin asshole. ""You brought this upon yourself Jenna. Now you must accept the consequences.""

Drawing a deep breath, he pushed inside of her, and she shrieked.

***

Hi, DPP! So...*yeah.* I have no idea where this one came from. Didn't get much response the last time I posted this, unfortunately! I want to focus on the copious cum being pumped inside of her while everyone is watching, the large cocks Jenna is forced to take up the ass, and the apology scene as well. Bonus if her anal pounding is streamed live to the board of directors, placidly watching this nubile young thing getting bent over and fucked in the ass. I hope the office will be rough with her, calling her a dirty anal slut as she gets pounded or commenting on how loose her asshole is getting. This is in *third person and past tense,* and you'll be playing as the other employees (as many or as little as you like). Another option is to invite other people to watch her get fucked live - maybe people from the other departments, or the lowly receptionist or intern.  I'm horny just imagining it, so hope I hear from some lovely filthy people!

723yii,2,2017-09-24,[MF4] Cumslut...errr interns wanted!,J_Dizzzy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/723yii/mf4_cumsluterrr_interns_wanted/,"Fertility Clinic looking for interns immediately...lost our last intern. Whatever you do, don't be like our last intern.  You'd never believe what happened 

It all started with a summer job…she decided to go to nursing school and after her first semester she needed to find a summer job in the medical field. She was called by a recruiter who sent her on her first and what would be her only interview. Eager to get the job, any job, she entered the building and found the right office, tucked in the corner of the first floor. It was a fertility clinic. She thought this could be fun, at least it has something to do with sex. She’d always been a very sexual person. After working there for a few days she came to find out they specialized in male infertility.

After a few days, she began to enjoy the job more and more, she was helping people and of course the office was usually full of half a dozen men. She would usually size each one up and find something she found attractive about them, guessing who had what problem, how big their package was and what their wife or girlfriend looked like. She was surprised to find out how many clients weren’t married, the thought of flirting with clients was a thought she often couldn’t ignore. 

At first she was primarily learning how the office worked, helping with paperwork and occasionally listening in on a consultation. Once she learned the ropes, her duties expanded. She would retrieve the samples and take them to the cold storage locker in the lab across the hall. At first she found it to be awkward, yet she also felt an uncomfortable rush of excitement.

Then it happened…one particular weekend she was horny, insatiable and couldn’t satisfy her urges. There was no boyfriend to speak of… around mid-morning she saw a man in the office who she couldn’t take her eyes off. He was there for a test and as he left the consultation room she saw him look her way and give her a small understated smile. She felt he found her attractive but was slightly embarrassed and didn’t want to act unprofessional.  After retrieving his sample, she walked across the hall when she tripped.  It was too late, the lid popped off and fell to the floor. As she bent down to pick it up she felt her pussy shutter as her legs slid her lips together. The feeling caught her off guard for a split second and she accidently tipped the cup just enough so that some of his cum slipped over the edge and trickled down and onto her finger. She quickly replaced the top and in one rather involuntary and instinctive motion she licked her finger. As soon as she did it, she was overcome with disbelief, embarrassment and most importantly pleasure. She found myself fantasizing about it for the days that followed.  She even refrained from any self orgasim that week as she enjoyed the feeling of being so horny she would do almost anything a guy asked.

The following week would be the tipping point. The waiting room seemed to have two or three attractive in it guys at all times. She wondered how easy it would be for them to cum if they knew their nurse was a cum freak and would swallow every drop if they wanted her to. Perhaps they were even thinking about her, wondering what her breasts felt like, how wet she was if they could slide their fingers down her panties and between her lips. She couldn’t escape these thoughts. She wanted to tell them about her fantasies and she wanted to make them come true. It was then that I was walking down the hall and as I turned the corned, she was carrying a sample of a particularly handsome man down the hall, she paused at a nook where the water fountain was. The cup she had was filled with substantially more cum that most, over an inch of creamy white goo. She couldn’t resist any longer.  She opened the sample lid and took a gulp, imagining the man shooting rope after rope of thick cum as she tipped her head back, opening wide, sticking out her tongue.  Every inch of her mouth would be covered. Four or five squirts, with each her head was filled with a dirty thought, imagining her mouth, cunt and ass could feel each spurt.  She was lost in pleasure enjoying every drop that fell onto her waiting tongue.  It was then she looked up and our eyes met…

Introduction and Methodology**


Hello, all! I’ve been working on a timeline project for a while, because I like tracking when things happen. This is a super loose timeline, mostly because of 2 factors: 1, we have no dates given in this series, and 2, we don’t know the year. However, we can guess where things are relative to each other in series, with the help of some supplementary knowledge of the Japanese school year. 


So, how is this set up? If you’re familiar with anime, or Japanese culture, or even played a Persona game, you should probably already have an idea of how this works. High schools separate the year into 3 terms, usually. Sometimes it can be 2 terms, but that’s more common in college. It’s safe to say that the UA school year so far seems to be falling into the 3 term system.


* Term 1 starts is April, usually the second week, and runs to mid-late July. Students have August and sometimes parts of July off.


* Term 2 runs from September to late December. There is a short 2 week winter break, usually last week of December and first week of January, covering holidays like New Years.

 
* Term 3 runs from early January to March. Students have a short break, usually the last week of March and the first week of April off.  


As of the current arc, we are partway through Term 2. Specifically, somewhere in October. That puts us at about halfway through the current school year. How can we tell that? In chapter 137, we see that the students have switched back into winter uniforms, something traditionally done on October 1. Using tricks like that, and the short timeskips occurring in the story, we can gauge where most arcs fall. We can’t find the exact dates, but it’s not to difficult to pinpoint it down to the month, and in some cases, the week or even the day of the week it happens. I’m not going to ramble about each specific case, but I will try and cite the chapter where these things are brought up. 


Why does this matter? Well, using this, we can figure out basic arcs that might occur, using knowledge of the school system, or holidays, and what the early calendar looks like. For example, the second semester might follow a similar formula from the first, and the third term might continue that pattern. I’m not going to speculate too much on that, though. 


We also might be able to use it to measure the supposed length of the series, but I’ll talk about that later. Without further ado, a super sketchy timeline. 

**Timeline:** 


**PROLOGUE**

* Early April, Year 0: Chapter 1. Izuku meets All Might, Sludge Villain Incident. 


* 10 months later, February 26, Year 1: Chapter 2-3. Izuku receives One for All, Entrance Exam Occurs. (Note: Traditionally, entrance exams are in January in Japan)


* 1 Week later, Early March: Chapter 4. Izuku is accepted into UA


**BEGINNING OF TERM 1**


* Second Week of April: Chapter 5-7. U.A academic year begins.  Immediately after, the Quirk Apprehension Test begins. (Note: This probably isn’t an actual day of classes, but the day of their Opening Ceremony. Counting backwards from chapter 13, this was actually on the Sunday before classes actually started.)  


* 1 day later, Second Week of April: Chapters 7-11. Battle Trial occurs. 


* 1 day later, Second week of April: Chapter 12. Emergency Exit Iida. Villains steal the class schedule during the distraction, allowing USJ to happen.


* 1 day later, Wednesday, Second week of April: Chapter 13-21. USJ occurs. 
* 1 day later, second week of April: Chapter 21-23. Ochako’s backstory is revealed, Aizawa announces sports festival. All Might and Izuku talk. Bakugou makes enemies with the other classes. 
* Two weeks later, Either the very end of April, or the very beginning of May: Chapter 23-44. Sports Festival occurs.  Iida Tensei is attacked and paralyzed. (Note: I’d actually suspect early May because of Golden Week, which is a week of national holidays that schools have off, so I’d guess that the Sports Festival happens after May 6th.)
* 1 day later, same as above: Chapter 44. Day off. Todoroki visits his mother for the first time. The next day is off as well. 
* 2 days after Sports festival, May: Chapter 45-6. Hero names are chosen, Internships are announced. 
* By the end of this week (in 2 days), May: Internship applications are due. 
* Some unknown time later, Presumably still May: Chapter 46-48. Internships begin.  They will last one week. Izuku meets and trains with Gran Torino. (We can easily assume it’s still May because in 46, students are still shown wearing their winter uniforms. Traditionally, students change into summer uniforms on June 1.)
* Internships, Day 2, May: Chapter 48-49. Izuku develops Full Cowl. Stain and Shigaraki meet. 
* Internships, Day 3, May: Chapter 50- 56. Everyone converges in Hosu. The fight with Stain occurs. 
* Internships, Day 4, May: Chapter 56. Izuku, Todoroki, and Iida are hospitalized. Conversation with the police occurs. 
* Internships, Day 5, May: Chapter 57. All for One is first mentioned, other internships are shown. Iida reveals the extent of his injuries.
* Internships, Day 7 May: Chapter 57-58. Stain goes viral.
* End of Internships, either Day 7 or the day after, May: Chapter 58. Izuku and Gran Torino part ways. 
* The day after, May: Chapter 58-59. Class begins. All Might tells Izuku about the origin of One for All and All for One.  First mentions of End of Term Test. (Note: Students are still wearing winter uniforms, but without jackets, so it’s most likely the very end of May.) 
* Final Week of June: Chapter 60. 1 week until test. Students study, I guess. 
* I week later, early July: Chapter 60-67. Tests. Written Exams probably last the entire week test exercise is after. Probably the same week. Toga and Dabi join the villain alliance. 
* Day after the practical exam, Early July: Chapter 68-70. Mall encounter occurs. 
* Day after encounter: Chapter 70 Class occurs. Presumably, so does the first term. 


**END OF TERM 1: Early to Mid July.** 

**Notes about term 1:**
We see a lot of the school year, but a ton of our arcs take place on single days, with short skips in between them. We see most of April, quite a bit of May, and interestingly enough, we see almost none of June. This term ends partway through July, somewehere in the first half, depending how dates might fall and the days of the week. All together, the first term takes up chapters 5-70, about 65 chapters. Around chapter 80, and interview with Horikoshi was released stating that the manga was around 20% done. Since we don’t know exactly when the interview happened, it was probably between this point and that interview. (I’ll come back to this later.)



Summer break. I measured this a little differently. The first term was easy enough to count as I went, but summer break was difficult, as there is nothing that tells us how long of a break the students had between school and the trip. But you can figure it out, roughly, if you count backwards from the 2nd term opening ceremony. So that’s what I did. 


**BEGINNING OF SUMMER BREAK: Mid July.**

* Early August, most likely the beginning of the second week: Chapter 70-71. School Trip begins, 1-A is thrown into the forest, Kouta has been met, and his back story is revealed.
* School Trip, Day 2: Early-Mid August: Chapter 71-72. Students work on upgrading their quirks. Villains begin to gather. 
* School Trip, Day 3: Chapter 73- 83. Training continues. Villain attack occurs during the test of courage. Bakugou is kidnapped.
* 1 day later, August: Chapter 83. teachers have a meeting, the idea of a traitor is brought up. 
* 1 day later, 2 days since kidnapping: Chapter 83- 94. Izuku is released from the hospital. Kamino Arc occurs. 
* 1 day after Kamino, Mid August: Chapter 95. All for One is incarcerated, Izuku and All Might meet on the beach. The end of the age of All Might. 
* In the week after Kamino, Mid August: 96-97. Home visits occur. Students enter the dorms. 
* 11 days before Term 2: 98-99. Students move into the dorms. Dorm room contest occurs. 
* 10 days before Term 2: 100-101. Students begin to develop special moves for the license exam.
* 5 days before Term 2: 101-102. Izuku develops shoot style. 
* 1 Day before Term 2, Early September: Chapters 102-121. License Exam occurs. Twice’s backstory is revealed, Overhaul is introduced. All Might meets with All for One. At night, Bakugou vs Izuku occurs. (Note: This occurs roughly 2 weeks after Kamino, placing it in Mid-August. Generally, Term 2 starts the first week of September.)


**END OF SUMMER BREAK- First week of September.**

**Notes about summer break:** 


Summer break runs from chapter 70-120, about 50 chapters. That’s almost as long as the entire first term, despite only being part of July, and August, with a little bit of September. It’s only about 1.5 months, maybe 2 at the most. First term is about 3.5 months long. That’s wild. We skip most of july, even, so the majority of this time takes place in August. Similarly, most arcs take place only on a single day, with a few days of build up and resolution in between the arcs that we get to see. 
Time for Term 2. 

**BEGINNING OF TERM 2: First Week of September.** 


* 1st day of term 2, early September: Chapters 121-122. Opening Ceremony occurs, Izuku and Bakugou are under house arrest. Izuku meets Mirio. 
* 3 days later, early September: Chapter 122-125. Izuku’s house arrest ends. Mirio vs Class 1-A. Overhaul and Shigaraki meet face to face.
* 1 day later, early September: Chapter 126. Bakugou’s house arrest ends, All Might asks Mirio to introduce Izuku to Nighteye. 
* That weekend: Chapters 126-128. Izuku becomes an intern under Nighteye.
* The next day, presumably still the weekend: Chapters 128-130. Mirio and Izuku encounter Overhaul and Eri. Overhaul and Shigaraki decide to make a deal. 
* Beginning of the school week, early September: Chapters 130-134. Izuku finds out the truth about All Might and Nighteye. Ochako and Tsuyu begin their internships. Overhaul and Shigaraki meet. Around this time, Kirishima begins his internship. 
* 1 day later: Chapter 134. Red Riot, Uravity, and Froppy make the news.
* A few days later, presumably early-Mid September: Chapters 134-136. The hero meeting occurs, to plan Eri’s rescue. Izuku, Ochako, Kirishima, and Tsuyu are to remain on standby.
* Early October: Chapter 137. Todoroki, Izuku, and Iida have a conversation in the cafeteria. Students have switched to winter uniforms, marking it as October. Lockrock appears to discover the villain’s hideout.
* 2 days later, early October: Chapter 137-? The heroes infiltrate the hideout of the Eightfold Cleansers. 

**Notes about Term 2:**


Currently, we’re at chapter 153, putting us at about 33 chapters into Term 2. At this point in Term 1, we’d be at about Todoroki vs Deku. In in universe time, we’re farther into Term 2 than we were at that point in Term 1. 

**Conclusion**


So there we have it! I assume that we’re in early October, but honestly, we could be anywhere after October 1st. There are some reasons though, that I assume it’s still early in October, though. First of all, I doubt that we would skip too far ahead. If we skipped too far ahead, we’d lose at least half of September, and all of October. That would be the biggest leap so far. Secondly, there is a very important event for Japanese school students that takes place in late October/Early Novermber – the Cultural festival! There is no way we’d skip that in a school manga. Hopefully after this arc is finished we get some other events to anchor the day of the infiltration more precisely. For now, this is my best prediction.


So, what’s next? I’ll try to update this after major events. I’m not going to make a new post every time a chapter comes out and skips a few days. That would be too spammy. But I’ll try to update it fairly regularly. 


Using the timeline, and knowledge of the school year, there’s approximately 2.5 months left in Term 2. Part of October, all of November, and part of December before winter break. We’ll probably see another exam in December, I’d suspect, and the inevitable cultural festival arc could round out October or November. There’s still room for the joint lessons with class B to be shown, as well as another villain arc, in this term. Of course, assuming the students still have their internships, we could see more villain arcs running concurrently with the school stuff, which would be cool!


I’m not going to try and guess what will happen over winter break, or Term 3. There’s a few things we might see, such as New Years, Valentine’s Day (although we haven’t see holidays before in this series, really), presumably finals for the whole year, and graduation of our third years. At some point the traitor will be dealt with, and Horikoshi claims we should see a lot of Shinsou soon, so that’s something. I’m not going to make too many predictions based on the calendar. For all I know Horikoshi could do anything after this arc, and all the predictions I made could be completely wrong.  


Some final points. Do I actually think Horikoshi is plotting out a meticulous timeline? Nope, not at all. He probably has a vague one. Maybe he just looks at a calendar and figures out a rough placement at most. Or maybe he just makes everything up as he goes along and I wasted my time.


Another quick thought I have is that Horikoshi said we were about 20% done around the end of the first term. If we were to assume that he’s counting percentage done by in universe time, we’d probably be around 60% done by the end of the school year. If that’s so, it’s unlikely we’ll get to see 2nd and 3rd years in depth, or even at all compared to freshman year. That number would make me think that we might get a Harry Potter or RWBY type scenario that forces our characters out of U.A, or something that seriously shakes up the formula of the story. Next March would coincide with Nighteye’s prediction of All Might’s death…


That being said, I’m not going to put too much in stock in percentages because we have no idea how Horikoshi counts it, and honestly, things bloat. Things bloat a lot. Just some food for thought for those who are interested in speculation. I’m not going to guess too much as to where the story might go at this point. We’re still too early on for that, for me at least. Anything could happen at this point in the story, especially as arcs have ramifications that affect others. Maybe after this arc, the internships are forced to stop. That closes doors. Or maybe more students get them, which would allow for a greater variety in potential villain arcs outside of school. See what I mean? 

So there you have it, a loose, unofficial timeline. Use it for speculating, fanfic planning, etc. Like I’ll said, I try an update it fairly regularly. Expect an update once the fallout of this arc is over and the next begins. 


Edit: u/Shanksette pointed out that we do have an official date for the entrance exam, so I added that in."

I was planning on waiting until I have received the written offer before telling my boss I won't be returning next semester. Fortunately, I'll be able to give plenty of notice (almost 3 months in advance). So I should be able to help hire and train my replacement. My biggest issue is how do I bring this up to my boss? We are somewhat close and I would want to tell her in person. I'm sure she'll understand, but how do I begin to start this conversation? I'd really appreciate any advice!

This summer she moved to New York for 10 weeks for an internship. When she left for New York we had been dating for a month. Last night I found out from her texts that she cheated on me about a month into her trip. I would really appreciate some advice on how to respond/move forward. I'll provide some information that may be needed to make a decision below: 

-My girlfriend claims she was blacked out at a club when she did it and she doesn't remember anything. I believe her as I was talking to her earlier in the night and she seemed very drunk already. 

-I admit that I may be at fault for pushing her away. Once she left for New York I became overbearing, jealous, and possessive. It was hard for me to trust her away after only a month of dating her and I reacted poorly to the situation. 

-She decided to keep it from me because she sought advice from her friends and they told her not to tell me because it was stupid and wrong to hurt me and ruin the relationship over a blacked out mistake. 

-I feel as though our relationship has grown immensely since she has came back. We've spent almost every day together and we both have stronger feelings towards each other than we had when she was in New York. 

-She claims she regrets it more than anything and it was the worst night of her life. She seems genuinely disgusted by herself and I can tell her actions bring pain to her. 

-She says she will do everything to make this situation right again and to help me build trust in her again. I told her I can't continue to see her black out and he in situations like this and she agrees she will never drink that much. 

I know it's early in our relationship, but I genuinely love this girl. I'm not sure if I should try to make it work or leave her. I can't picture my life without her, but this hurts more than anything and I resent it for her. Thanks for all advice. 

TL;DR Girlfriend cheated on me during long distance period shortly into our relationship. Need advice on how to move forward. Thank you all.

7270jv,1,2017-09-24,"In debt, need a vehicle NOW",OldAudiotape,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7270jv/in_debt_need_a_vehicle_now/,"I am 23, making $1000 a month stable income and between $200-$300 unstable income (dependent on how many hours/effort I want to put in my service job) with $800 expenses.

I have been borrowing a friend's vehicle for the past year because my car was repossessed. I am not sure if that debt has cleared because the car was sold or whether it still stands, but I am going to be finding that information out Monday.

My credit score is shit, but I am currently ""debt free."" My credit cards and student loans are paid off, but I do have a $800 personal loan from a friend that I am working on paying off. 

The problem is that my friend's vehicle was totaled this week. I work 40 hours a week at a small business with four different locations, each spread about 15 minutes apart, and I've spent so much of the last year trying to get my debt paid off that I haven't even thought about trying to fix my vehicle issue.

I don't have a vehicle. My friend doesn't have a vehicle. Our roommate is helping us out this week, but I need to find an immediate solution to this problem. I've probably got one to two weeks before I'm shit out of luck. 

I've run through some options, but would like advice on them and would definitely like to hear any I missed.

1) Public transportation. There is none within a 15 minute drive/30-45 minute walk from my home. We live in the middle of nowhere. Between work, buses run every hour, but are incredibly unreliable and don't match up with my shift times. I sometimes only have 30 minutes to get from one location to the next, so being able to drive myself is the most convenient option. I also work late nights, until 11:30/1AM, and buses stop at 10, so...there's that. 

2) Uber/Lyft/Taxi. It would obviously be expensive, and I would have to cut out all fun spending and even cut into my food budget. There's always the possibility that they'll be late or not show up at all. Benefits being no having to walk through giant parking lots and the wonderful bliss of feeling just a bit pretentious. Another downside is unnecessary social interaction really wears down on me, especially if I'm working more than 40 hours a week, and holiday season for my job is coming up which means my schedule will most likely jump to 60 hours a week.

3) Beg and plead with every friend I have with a vehicle to go out of their way to pick me up and drop me off on my schedule. I obviously don't want to ruin friendships though and they have their own, often busy, lives. 

4) Get my own vehicle on financing. My credit score is LOW. Like 400-ish area kind of low. I fucked up a lot and I'm working on fixing it, but it's still low, so I'd be depending on my income to be able to finance a vehicle. I have no co-signers. I have nothing saved up right now. Whether I have to go through a bank, a sketchy used car dealership, pay off my repossessed vehicle and maybe get it back (if possible, will find out Monday), or whatever else--if they'll finance me, I may just have to do it and work my ass off to pay it off sooner than the contract ends to avoid the insane interest rate I'm sure they'll be giving me.

5) Try to get a personal loan (I don't know what a reasonable amount here would be) and buy something used on Craigslist. I might be able to get a beater of some sort. I just need something mobile, something that can get me between Points A, B, C, D, and E, something that will get me through the incredibly shitty winter we are bound to have this year in Idaho. 

Family support and another personal loan from a friend are not options. 

If I don't find a vehicle, I will have to drop shifts and that means my hours and income are going to drop drastically. I have already talked to other employees about working at just one location, but they have their own schedules and their own lives and can only do that for so long before management starts to notice and just starts cutting my hours and giving them to those other employees. I HAVE to be able to move between locations 6 days a week. 

This is what I have right now--I start a paid internship in which I'll be making more half more my current income, but that won't be until March--so I'm not worried about long term financial repercussions right now. I just need something as soon as physically possible 

What are my options? Your advice? I'll take what I can get 

Edit:

Why bicycle isn't exactly an option:

It's incredibly unsafe where I live and work, even more so with the hours I work, and not time effective to get between work locations. I have a bicycle as a backup, but it will not do for what I need it for. 

It will also be physically impossible to ride a bicycle as soon as the snow hits here. "

I was very close to passing both, but sadly I came up short.  My long time girlfriend is finishing up her masters program and we would like to move to her hometown of Seattle next summer.  I am unsure if I should quit my job and focus on studying for the next 8 months and work on passing the CPA or should I stick with my firm for another busy season.  I do not like the firm that I currently am currently with.  My team has experienced a lot of turnover the past year and we are understaffed.  This summer I have been working most nights and some weekends.  I am frustrated because I thought I would have had more time this summer to study for the CPA, but I have found that I have not had enough time to study.  As far as career goals are concerned, I have hated just about every second of the audit work that I have done.  I have previous internship experience with a F500 company which was more of a finance internship and I really enjoyed that experience. I do not see myself working for a public accounting firm for the long term.  Ideally I would like to move into more of a FP&amp;A position in the future.  Is it worth sticking with my firm for another busy season or should I take a couple of months off and pass the CPA exam before I move to another city?

Through my school's internship program, a bit of networking, a lot of luck, and not being in any hurry to graduate, I've had the opportunity to work in some decently relevant internships in different industries. My roles have ranged from operations support, maintenance/reliability, controls, to turnaround planning. I've been able to make steady connections through my work terms, and I do keep in contact.

 
I have at least a couple of years left in school, with more internships in my schedule. I'm hoping to keep applying some the skills I've gained in my past internships, and build as competent of a process engineering mindset as I can before I graduate, so that I can stand out for EIT roles.

 
My next time for an internship is coming up next summer, so I'm already looking into some postings. I'll be applying with 2+ years of generally relevant chem eng experience, but I'll also be applying at the most competitive time of year. My GPA is *just* shy of 3.0, so I'll probably still be filtered out by a lot of bigger companies (though some other big ones have sent interview requests to me when I had a lower average so I understand it does vary). I'm also in leadership roles in a couple of societies on campus, one linked with industry.

 
Overall, I feel confident in my experience and qualifications. 2 main things that I think could stand in my way though:

 
**1)** My roles have largely been in the realm of day-to-day process monitoring, troubleshooting, maintenance, and a bit of project mgmt. However, I haven't had any big breakthroughs or major contributions in the way of cost savings or proven growth opportunity. You hear quite often about those students who do some analysis or develop something that has the potential to save $millions per year or add a certain amount to production rates, but my contributions are much more qualitative and in the realm of safety. **I like contributing in this area, and my career goal is to do so going forward! but I don't know if it will measure up compared to a student who has actually reduced millions in ops costs or something big like that.**
 
**2)** I haven't spent enough time in the plant/field. *Some* of my experience has been in a smaller plant environment. However, my more recent experiences have been in an office environment in a big city. I am still getting great exposure to technical projects and learning about the technology I work with, but I don't know if I've seen enough time in the plant to stand out as a candidate. I'd like to work on-site full time after I graduate, but I'm worried that if I don't get there enough *before* I graduate, I may not get there at all.

 
**TL;DR: I have a general idea of what role I'd like in the future, and my career goals. My past experience has helped build my safety mindset, which I think will help me stand out for future internships and full time roles. However, my grades are very average, I haven't added major $ value as an intern in the past, and I don't have as much field experience compared to office. In this ultra-competitive market, can I still stand out?**

 
Thanks so much for any advice here! I'll reply to any comments if something needs to be clarified from this cluster of a post. :)"

In my experience, I am uncomfortable studying around other students because I feel as if they are all staring at me. I prefer moving to a more secluded, private desk in the library. I feel absolutely liberated when I move from a public studying area to a private studying area.

Furthermore, when I study in a public area among other people, my mind is constantly thinking about how the people around me may be judging me. Obviously, everyone is busying studying, themselves. 

The same experience occurred during my summer internship. I was given my own cubical which was grouped among other cubicals. However, these cubicals were ""open,"" so you could see everyone around you and everyone could see you. Working at that cubical was extremely uncomfortable. I was constantly fearful of even physically moving around in that cubical because I felt as if people were watching me. I felt much more comfortable when I had to work in a more secluded part of the office. 

Are these experiences normal for an INTJ? If so, what can I do to make myself comfortable working and studying among people? Specifically, how do I get rid of those nagging thoughts that people are judging me in public?

728mme,8,2017-09-24,News - R.I.P. to Lazy Fascist Press,JeffBurk,bizarrofiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/bizarrofiction/comments/728mme/news_rip_to_lazy_fascist_press/,"Cameron Pierce (head editor of Lazy Fascist Press) posted this announcement on Facebook:

""I'm proud to announce the release of Nails by MP Johnson (Emma Johnson), a sad comedy about the lonely, messy business that happens on the way to understanding and accepting one's true gender. It's a bittersweet announcement because this is also the final release under the Lazy Fascist Press label. There couldn't be a more perfect book to close out the press.

After seven years and over sixty books, this was among the most difficult decisions I’ve had to make. The purpose of an independent press is to cultivate risky and challenging voices by providing an opportunity to be heard. I feel like time and again, books in the Lazy Fascist catalog were heard. Our reach far exceeded our meager beginnings as an experimental literary imprint with zero budget overseen by a twenty-two-year-old. But through persistence and hard work from everyone involved, along with a little dumb luck, Lazy Fascist grew into something bigger than I’d ever intended it to be.

I’ve chosen to close LF for a number of reasons:

1. We reached that awkward level where it’s too late to scale back, but the resources for further growth are unavailable. The imprint is simultaneously too large and too small.

2. One of my primary aims with the press was to help develop authors’ profiles to increase their appeal to larger presses. This year and next, authors who published early books with Lazy Fascist have titles coming out with HarperCollins, Houghton Mifflin, Soho, Night Shade, Soft Skull, and other larger presses. This isn’t to take credit for their talent and hard work, but to say that many authors in the LF roster have left the nest.

3. I’ve become increasingly disillusioned by Amazon’s strangehold on the publishing marketplace and, more personally, the changing availability of our books in recent years. Amazon has always been a necessary evil. For a number of years, we benefitted from their system. We no longer benefit much from Amazon.

4. When I established the press, my long-term plan entailed shifting focus back to my own writing at some point. That shift is overdue. I'm ready to write again.

5. Until this month, my writing and editing income has always covered my home mortgage at the very minimum. It’s a great feeling, but also a scary one. Pretty much every writer who has ever mentored me warns of market crashes and consequent financial fallouts. I’ve sensed for the past couple years that we’re heading toward one of those due to #3 on this list, and so last year I decided to pursue another dream career working in the craft beer industry. Almost two years in, I love my new career and look forward to going to work every day. Now, if or when there’s a publishing crash, I won’t have to worry if books can keep the lights on.

6. The name of the press was always a humorous, hipsterish jab, but for me it was a jab at gentrification and the polite forms of control found in Portland, Oregon, where the press was founded. The name was meant to start conversations, and it did start some fruitful ones. But the political climate has changed, and what was once a funny name for a transgressive, left-leaning press is now simply inappropriate. I’ve considered changing the name for the past year, but I also knew the press had reached the end of the road in other ways.

I look back at the books in the Lazy Fascist catalog and think of the sweat, love, tears, and pain that went into each of those books. Middle of the night phone conversations with authors, twelve to fifteen hour work days, the near-constant chain of messages with Matthew Revert over cover design, witnessing our books pop up in an increasing number of bookstores across the country, working with idols and debut authors alike, seeing translation rights and audiobook rights and movie rights sell, hosting some kickass readings and parties, scheming with other likeminded publishers, connecting with readers, discovering rare gems in the daily onslaught of manuscript submissions. My years operating Lazy Fascist were basically a collage of greatest moments, with the occasional crisis thrown in because this is publishing and we’re all crazy.

Our titles will continue to be available and sold in all the usual places, and you’ll still find them at events where our parent company, Eraserhead Press, is representing. You’ll find me around at AWP, the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association tradeshow, and other events throughout the year. You may also see the press name shortened on book covers to the more apolitical ""LFP"" on several titles.

I want to thank everyone who made Lazy Fascist what it was. The authors, the readers, book reviewers, the interns, everyone at Eraserhead Press, my family. I’d name all of you individually, but the list would stretch to over a thousand long. Suffice to say, when I say thank you, I mean you. To everyone who ever contributed in any way, to everyone who demonstrated their supported, and even to those who told us to fuck off or said we’d never make it, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for seven great years.

Now go buy Nails by MP Johnson and In the River by Jeremy Robert Johnson. We may be sailing gently into the night, but we saved our best for last."""
728mu5,49,2017-09-24,JN Mom conveniently forgets,friendlyneighlurker,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/728mu5/jn_mom_conveniently_forgets/,"Alright so ..my JN mom lives 2500 miles away and still manages to piss in my Koolaid regularly. Right now I am on a mini vacay at the Ocean with a free ocean front room H won in a contest. Drinks and food were 50% off so it has been a pretty alright day until this..,

So for the drama. My mom lives on the other side of the country. My daughter lives with her dad and step mom in the same area. My mom is either A. One of the small populations of narcissists B. A sociopath or C. Just a clueless self centered bitch. 

Either way things don’t look so hot for our relationship. There is a long history or insensitive comments, forgetting my birthday, trashing me to family, etc. She has a flying monkey who is my aunt.

Anywho. So today my daughter was having a visit for my mom. We had prearranged a time to call. Due to being out and about most the day my phone was drained so I called from H’s cell. Now Mom had promised to save his number in case of emergency so it should have come right up with his name.

Conversation went something like this:
Me : Hey can I speak to daughter?
JN Mom: Who’s calling?
Me: Her Mother
JN Mom: Oh hi K (Step Mom) sure.
Me: No her biological Mother. 
Mom: Oh sorry didn’t recognize your voice.

😤😩😫😡😭

I love step mom and she is amazing to my kid. But my mother has a tendency to treat me like I am not actually my child’s mother since I live far away.

Now. Keep in mind JN Mom lived overseas from when daughter was 2.5 years to about 8.5 years and saw her once a year. Obviously she (in her own opinion still had a major role in the faaaaammmmmillllyyyy). While she treats me like a surrogate despite my deep involvement in daughters education and medical needs. I also was the primary care taker of my daughter up until age 6.5 managing her disability, advocating for her education, and providing for her... while getting an Associates, Bachelors, and Masters degree. My ex sat on his ass and played video games and smoked weed (though he has since changed his ways). I split with him and got a bad ass internship across the country. Eventually landing a stellar job with good pay, great insurance, and a free college education for daughter.

Me &amp; JN Mom have gone NC and are currently LC. 

I didn’t bother mentioning my mom’s comments to her because she just plays dumb and acts like she does nothing wrong when she acts insensitive. So I stopped trying to explain the hurt to her. Typically she just asks if I am off my Meds (I have depression and anxiety). My shrink thinks that my emotions are less of a permanent disability and more of a situational thing having to do with all this.

Needless to say I am left feeling like I am not being a good mom by being so far away. Though I am not there physically I talk to daughter regularly and know that the opportunities I am helping provide are a lot better than I could do from my original state. I feel the need to defend myself and say a judge never decided that I wasn’t a fit parent and never awarded custody. I let the ex have custody because step mom is so amazing and I don’t have family in my current state. I made a choice based on what I thought would be best for my kid NOT what I wanted. I feel guilty and JN Mom seems to enjoy making me feel worse. The more I assert myself the more she guilts me.

Thanks for listening. I needed to get it out. Spent an hour crying on the beach and knew you guys would make me feel better. Love y’all."
728vw7,3,2017-09-24,I'm (28M) having doubts about the longevity of my 2.5 year relationship with my girlfriend (26F),JacquesBo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/728vw7/im_28m_having_doubts_about_the_longevity_of_my_25/,"We started out casually and then became more serious when it became obvious we wanted to spend time together platonically and have had a reasonably happy relationship since then, but I don't know if it's what I want out of a relationship. She isn't romantic or have an interest in partaking in activities I enjoy, however she (and I like to think myself as well) is very supportive of my endeavours as well as her family. 

I am a chef/baker working 45-50 hours a week at my day job while also starting a bakery business that takes up one day off a week. Every other Sunday I spend with my daughter (10F), which she has no interest in, leaving little time in my schedule. She is a grad student going to school fulltime, while attending an internship, and working part time which leaves her with no days off and maybe 7 hours over 2 days that we are physically together and hang out.

I can see the obvious reasons for my doubts, after all our relationship was physical to begin with and now that we don't see one another that is a strain, but it is important to note that she had a gynecological issue that prevented us from having sex more than once a month which presented itself 4 months into the relationship and only cleared up in the last 3 months. This should help illustrate that the relationship isn't purely sexual in nature in it's current state.

Back to the issue. I was distanced from my family for some time and like to visit my parents regularly, she won't join even if they offer to take us out to dinner, where as I try to visit with her family at least monthly. She has no interest in a relationship with my daughter. I'm okay with her not wanting to be a mom, but complete disconnect is unrealistic if we stay together as well as tells me she isn't serious about being in my life, for all its ups and downs. I've also brought up marriage and she has said, ""I'll only.marry you if I get something from it, like insurance or a house."" I don't take her completely serious here but it's troubling if she won't have a real dialogue with me.

I've tried to talk about us getting our own place and she says she wants to either live on her own or with her parents, which is fine for her, but not for me as an us. As a chef I like to try new food, or at least new restaurants, she won't go anywhere outside her hometown or to a chain restaurant. She and I have put on weight while together and although I still find her attractive, she complains daily about her weight and shape while I started adjusting my diet and going for morning walks. I've offered for us to exercise together before or after work, getting memberships, or at least going to parks when we can and she has rejected everything saying, ""I'll only lose weight if it's from a drug or lipo."" I have a real problem with this lack of initiative and stonewalling.

I previously said she isn't romantic. If we're out, I can't kiss her. We can sometimes hold hands. There are only 2 occasions when she said we could keep a picture of us because she either refuses a picture or rejects it afterwards. There is no such thing as flirting or pillow talk with us. Saying that she is beautiful is an issue half the time. I don't want to perform grand gestures, but I feel like I can't be the SO I want to be with her.

There are lots of other little differences that I overlook because I just count them up to the spice of life. If we were the same then it wouldn't be as interesting. I'm not pursuing other women, or checking out the dating pool. I am loathe to be single again, but I fear that sentiment is what's keeping me from sussing this out with her. I also don't want to put the stress of figuring out a relationship on her while school and work is so intense. I do love her, and want the best, but I don't want to waste our time.

After reading this over I want to specify that we have a lot of fun together. The compromises we do make for each other afford us some wiggle room and I don't think either of us are unhappy, just complacent or comfortable. The more my business grows the more I look at the next 5-10 years and I have trouble seeing her in it with me as my wife, or at least serious, long term, live-in SO.

TL;DR 2.5 year relationship is good, but I have serious doubts about if we have the makings for a happy and fulfilling life together.

72980l,1,2017-09-24,First time sugar baby,classisboringrn,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/72980l/first_time_sugar_baby/,"Hey, so last year sometime, I was in need of money so I decided to try and be a sugar baby, just ended up with weird dates except I actually had sex with one of them for money $300. I felt like a prostitute and felt dirty and gross. It didn't help that I was in my finding myself period, you could call it.

Anyways, after that I told my parents about my money struggles and they agreed to bank roll me whenever I couldn't pay my bills. Being a full time student in college, and trying to find a job with flexible hours and make enough is pretty tough. 

 This fall I asked for a lot more money on my student loans intending it to go to my moving out expenses after I graduate since I want to move to my dream city. Since my parents co-sign my loans my mom thought I was taking out the money for future expenses and cut me off.  I must have calculated school costs lower than expected because when I was supposed to get a surplus of $2,500 when I only got $700. I spent most of it on rent for two months, when I had told my mom I paid rent until my lease is up. (DEC.)

So I have about 3 months of rent which totals $1048, I have books to pay which is $450, I got a ticket for $374, car registration $129, and the doesn't even count my regular living expenses. I do have three jobs though. I make $16 an hour as a sales intern which Im only able to work 8 hours a week due to the fact I can only work morning hours and I have class in the morning, I am supposed to make commission, but I have worked this job since January and haven't made one sale. My second job is at a bar area (kind of a loose description but an area where there's a bunch of bars, and they show the university's football games), I make $10/hour but its only weekend night hours where they only have 2 people per event, and they just cut hours because they want to increase security on home games instead of having us reps there. So I end up getting 0-10 hours a week. My third job is a baby store, I make $9.5 an hour and while I have requested 20 hours they give me 9. It doesn't help that they're open from 10-6pm every day and I have class most days. I literally get 2 hours Monday and Wednesday and 5 hours Sunday, when I offer to work Fridays and Saturdays.

Any way I spin it, I will not make enough money to pay my bills plus living expenses for the next few months. I don't want to call my parents and let them know how much I don't have, I know they will be disappointed. We're not super rich or anything but asking for around $1000 a month wasn't hard for them before. I just don't want to ask since last time I took out loan money for my last loan me and my dad got into an argument. So I decided to become a sugar baby again. I was thinking I can just pay off rent, my school bill, my ticket, and other outstanding bills, and use my regular money for my normal expenses. 

My school isn't in a particularly expensive area or anything. Most guys are married, creepy or only looking for sex and can only pay a few hundred per meeting which was what I expected. But, I have a date with someone now and have good chemistry with, I am really excited about it, regardless of the money. Anyways, I googled his phone number and it turns out he is a very successful attorney. I am talking about millions of dollars in cases, celebrity clients, and at least 1 ground breaking case. Ive never been more excited, someone I can actually realistically pay my bills with. Instead of dates with 5 guys trying to make money for my bills, I can date one guy and have them all paid since I don't think $2500 will break his bank. 

I haven't told my friends about my money issues, Ive honestly lied to everyone in my life that I am fine, but I am not. I need to better about money and I have set budgets for everything. I just cant do it alone and I have nobody to help me. With being a sugar baby I feel like I have a way out for once. I feel like I can breathe again. I just needed to tell someone"
729n7d,8,2017-09-24,I need to learn some self-control,Axuuly,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/729n7d/i_need_to_learn_some_selfcontrol/,"I literally don't even know where to start. I got my first playstation when I was 4 and that was in 1999. I've been gaming hard ever since then. I am an immigrant that has a stereotypical immigrant story we lived in poverty, my parents worked their way up and now we live a good life. However, early on I didn't really get to talk to people my age except for school. I didn't have cousins and my parents didn't really let me go out because they felt it was unsafe. Games were my only outlet and that continues very much to this day. I can talk to people however I very rarely connect with people outside of school. Once online gaming came around that's where I found my friends. I've had a tight-knit group of people that I talk to every day for the last 8-9 years. Some of them moved on but we actually still keep in contact from time to time. So I didn't really feel the need to build extreme social skills in high school. However, I did start one new hobby while in highschool and that was weightlifting. I went from a lanky 120 pounds to weighing about 195 today and that was 5-6 years ago. The more I did that the more people started to respect my effort and wanted to talk to me more but I still didn't really talk to people more than necessary. If it wasn't for weightlifting I'd probably only leave the house for school. Anyways now I'm in a private University and I'm doing respectably without really putting much effort in (because all I do is play games) but the difference between now and then is that games give me very little satisfaction now. I've realized just how big of a hole I've dug myself in. Essentially, the draw of games for me was the competition and progress I saw. Since online gaming came out I've been playing games competitively especially before lifting I became one of the better COD players in the world. The last five years have been nothing but League and the occasional fighting game but I just don't have the drive anymore to try and improve at these games and get to the top level of play. I literally have over 3000 hours in league and I currently sit around low plat and just don't care. I'd rather be dating a girl lol. Games are still fun from time to time but for example League, you could take up to an hour, lose, and learn nothing from it when I could be doing stuff that I enjoy a lot more. I go to class, come back, lift, and play games until mid terms come along and then I pretend to study the day before exams. I literally have an exam tomorrow at 10 AM and haven't studied a bit. Thankfully it's a pretty easy class so I can at least a B but why should I shoot for a B when I can easily get an A? Especially since what I'm doing in place of studying is wasting time. I'm stuck in a cycle, I  have no close friends that I can hang out with since I never really put in effort to try and get to know people at my University and I also know my online friends so its just easier to come home and hang with them on the computer which then leads to playing games. I have one friend I would call close but he goes to a different school and I only get to hang out with him on breaks but when he comes home we hang out a lot.  I've literally never dated for that same reason. I know I'm not that awkward in Social situations because when I hang out with my friend during summer he has a cousin that is awkward and I just cringe at some of the things I've seen this guy do in front of his girlfriend and I just think to myself ""how's this guy have a girl at all?"" Then I remember, it's because he doesn't shut himself in his room for 16 hours a day lol. Anyways, I just created a situation for myself I feel I can't get out of. I can't really go out anywhere because I don't really have friends and that means I can't get practice because I don't go out which leads me to spending my time on games and just keeps the cycle going. I'm a senior in college, I want to do an internship this summer, get a girl, get more of a fulfilling life lol. I don't want to quit games altogether like most on this reddit do but I want to learn some discipline and play an hour or two a day tops and have my priorities straight instead of them being ass backwards like they currently are. I've shown myself I can do it with the body transformation I've gone through I just don't know where to start in this situation because lifting is me against myself whereas there are things others expect of you in social situations. For example, I wanna date but I sadly doubt I even know how to kiss right at this point and I'm 22 lol. That just makes me feel like utter shit and want to just play games. I know there are people with much more severe gaming conditions than mine but I needed an outlet as I don't really talk to anyone about my feelings and needed to vent somewhere. Any advice/encouragement  is appreciated, even criticism is good I fully grasp the situation I'm in and I know at the root I have to change myself I just don't know where to even remotely begin. I can't go out and be charming when I barely even know how to hold a decent conversation with people. Thanks for reading my rant it may involve a few things outside the scope of gaming but I thought this was the best place."
72bjq2,1,2017-09-25,Expressive Writing Liberates the Mind from Chronic Worrying,Q4QdiGHfk,paperwritingteam,https://www.reddit.com/r/paperwritingteam/comments/72bjq2/expressive_writing_liberates_the_mind_from/,"Taking a few minutes to jot down your thoughts and feelings using a technique called “expressive writing” can free up brain space and helps the mind function more efficiently, according to a new study led by psychology researcher Hans Schroder. These findings were published online September 8 in the journal Psychophysiology.

During expressive writing, you let go of any inhibitions and write freely about your deepest thoughts and innermost feelings with the understanding that it will never be read by anyone else or shared on social media.

Schroder and collaborators at Michigan State University found that doing an eight-minute expressive writing exercise helped chronic worriers with high anxiety perform better on a stressful computer-based “flanker” task by reducing error-related negativity. As Schroder et al. explain in the study abstract, “Expressive writing may serve to ‘offload’ worries from working memory, therefore relieving the distracting effects of worry on cognition as reflected in a decreased error-related negativity.”

Although Hans Schroder is currently a clinical intern at Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital, he conducted this research at Michigan State with Jason Moser, associate professor of psychology and Lab Director of MSU's Clinical Psychophysiology Lab.

For this study, college students who identified as being chronically anxious were divided into two groups. Half the students performed eight minutes of expressive writing, while the other half wrote an emotionless chronological timeline of what they’d done the day before.

Then, each participant performed the flanker task as he or she was having brain activity measured using electroencephalography (EEG) to gauge cognitive processing speed and accuracy. Those in the expressive-writing group performed the flanker task more efficiently and the EEG showed they were using fewer brain resources.

As Schroder explained in a statement, ""Worrying takes up cognitive resources; it's kind of like people who struggle with worry are constantly multitasking—they are doing one task and trying to monitor and suppress their worries at the same time. Our findings show that if you get these worries out of your head through expressive writing, those cognitive resources are freed up to work toward the task you're completing and you become more efficient.""

The MSU researchers conclude that expressive writing shows promise for alleviating the detrimental impacts of chronic worrying on cognitive function and look forward to future studies that will test the possibilities of expressive writing even further.

Along this same line, a May 2017 study from the University of Arizona reported that just 20 minutes of “narrative expressive writing” over a three-day period improved heart rate variability (HRV)—which indicates a physiological ""relaxation response"" within the autonomic nervous system—for people going through a stressful life event. To read more about this research, check out my Psychology Today blog post, ""Narrative Expressive Journaling Could Help Your Vagus Nerve.""

72bxim,2,2017-09-25,[30/M][28/F] Got played for no reason at all and need to know how to cut ties,AmIcrazy34,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/72bxim/30m28f_got_played_for_no_reason_at_all_and_need/,"Disclaimer: I know I’ve been illogical but I’m really feeling down and just need someone to listen to me and tell me that I’m not crazy. I have no one else to turn to to get this off my chest and I need to have some hear me out. I know this long as hell and most wont read it but I just really need someone to. 

tl;dr: Got played by someone I love for no reason at all, she became the thing she said she hated. I need to cut ties but need to know how? 

Ok so this all started February of 2015 when I met her. We seemed to hit it off right away and talked all the time over text and met once or twice but she was always busy as she had a job, grad school and an internship and I completely understood. Around June of that year I would say things started to get more serious and I at some point between Feb and June I realized how much I loved this girl. I didn’t tell her and I didn’t come on to strong because she told me she was old fashioned and took things slow and it just seemed like it wasn’t the right time to pour my heart out. 

Anyways things moved forward and around October of that year I had got her a gift for getting her citizenship, it was a flag that was flown over the capital with a certificate with her name on it and a congrats on becoming a citizen in a flag box and I was super excited to give it to her. She said a few times we could meet up and kept getting busy, then one night I just said I will bring it past and she said ok and then later said no she was going to sleep. I got upset because I was excited and she kept backing out, and I told her that I was upset and then just stopped answering her texts that night because I was mad and didn’t want to say anything overboard in the moment. 
The next day she tells me she can’t do this and just wants to be friends. She can’t handle the emotions while juggling school, internship and work. She said she stayed up all night upset cause I ignored her (all of 8 hours because I texted back in the morning). I told her I thought that was overboard and tried to reason with her but ultimately said if that’s the way she feels then ok. 

We keep talking all the time and I mean all the time she would call me and talk for close to an hour on a regular basis and there was very few if any days we didn’t talk. Things move forward again and we start getting serious again (never facebook official) we hang out and tell each other how much we mean to each other. Everything is fine in my mind and we get to Christmas and exchange Christmas gifts and then a few days after new years she stops talking out of nowhere. I finally get her on the phone and she says she just wants to be friends she wants to finish off the rest of her school without having to worry about me. That she can’t show me the affection that I show her while focusing on school I tell her I’m ok with her not focusing on me and that I just want to be there for her and help her through her school and support her and that one day I may need the same from her that’s how a relationship should be. No dice, she just wants to be friends. 

So for the next few months she still talks to me, even sends me snaps of a broken heart that says “When you miss someone”. Sending me pictures of gifts I got her in the past and says “the little things that matter”. Then around April she just stopped talking to me totally so I text her a few times and keep saying is everything ok? She finally answers and says she needs time and space to meet new people and explore as she hasn’t had any time in the past 2 years to do that. I really really care for her so I say I just want her to be happy. I stop messaging her first, I’ll talk to her but only if she initiates. 

So we get to my birthday in May and I go to the bar and invite her and she can’t go cause shes going out of town with her girlfriends. I have a fun time at my birthday with my friends and my one friend brings a girl from his work who I’ve met before and is really cool and he told her to bring a cake which she did and that was really nice. So my friend says take a picture together and we did and I put it on snap not thinking anything of it. So she hits me up and says I can’t believe you’d that, I’m really upset and I think you’re seeing her and so on. I just say no I’m not but even if I was you’re the one that said we were friends. She calls me a liar and says I’m seeing her, I again explain I am not and have no reason to lie because she is the one that said we were just friends. I ask why it took a picture of me with another female for her to show feelings towards me and she said I should know how she felt… how? She told me we were just friends multiple times. 

Now here is what I thought was an important point. She told me she doesn’t trust guys because she was in a relationship for 6 years and got cheated on. As well as her dad being a player and cheating on her mom. Fair enough I guess. 
Moving on. 

So now after that she starts talking to me again and sends me suggestive pictures on snap and things like that. Tells me we need to go on a trip, to go camping which I start to plan and she backs out of. Things die down. She calls me around august of last year and tells me how much I mean to her and that she misses the affection I show her and that she can’t get me off her mind. So I try to start talking to her again and she again distances herself. So at this point ive kinda resigned myself to not talking to her unless she talks to me.

Now we are in January of this year and I’ve done everything in my power to not be weird around her. I don’t say how I feel, I don’t bug her. She just wants to be friends so I don’t ask her about any BF or send any weird love letters or be clingy. But in January I did get really drunk and message her “I wish you knew how I really felt” so in the morning she blew up my phone with a texts, snaps, calls and voicemails till I answered and asked what I meant. I told her I didn’t mean to message that, and to forget it I was drunk and I shouldn’t have and that I was sorry. She insists and wont take no for an answer so I finally tell her how much I love her and she means to me. Her only response was why did I wait so long to tell her… she knew how I felt long before that I just had not said anything in months because every time I moved closer to her she’d push me back. Its also important to note that she was aware of this because I’d have snaps of me chasing my nephew and she’d even say “look he runs from you just like me”.

So that was that till march when she went out of town and got drunk and messaged me “would you make love to me” and said she gets anxious around me. Of course, I said yea and was on cloud 9 till the next day when she messaged me “lol forget what I said I was drunk”. I was out with friends watching basketball and that hurt me and I didn’t answer because I didn’t know what to say… She got pissed off I didn’t say anything.  

Anyways we continue to talk and she says things like I always say the right thing. She told me she had a dream where we got married and she was thinking of me. And then she told me we need to have a talk so I’m thinking a good talk because shes been saying how sweet I am and nice I am. 
Bu thenI see her post on Instagram with a dude and shes kissing him on the cheek and it says “out with my love”. Now normally I wouldn’t say anything because its not my place but I thought back to how much shit she gave me for my picture so I message her and say I see your IG and she says this is why we need to talk and that she will make time to talk to me in person. I told her I don’t need to see her in person and if the talk is what I think it is I don’t want that talk in person even though I appreciate the thought. She said I’m avoiding the convo and I tell her no have it just tell me over the phone. 

She says shes getting to know someone. But when shes with him she can’t stop thinking of me that he knows about me and knows that she will never not have me be part of her life. That’s weird but ok. So I continue to talk to her, I’m not weird about it, I don’t ever bring up the dude or whats going on with him. 

We get to Cinco de mayo of this year and she goes to a bar and my friend sees them there. She messages me and says before your friend messages you I just want you to know he saw me with the guy and I say ok thanks I don’t know why she felt the need to let me know. Then she messages me later  that night and says she hates this feeling, I ask what feeling and she says she can’t stop thinking of me, that everywhere she goes she thinks of me. I say I’m sorry if that upsets you and she says no it makes her happy and I say that makes no sense that she always thinks of me and it makes her happy but shes with someone else… she says cause of that picture.
We continue to talk and talk. We talk on the phone for hours and she says things like “when we have kids”. I post a picture of a cool house and say my future house and she says our future house. Her dad comes into town who she hasn’t seen in years and say tell him I said hi even tho he does not know me and she said no he knows all about you. She asks if I want to meet him. We buy each other birthday gifts and she keeps asking if I bought her a ring. She tells me I’m the only one she can count on. I did her two quick favors in this time frame of taking her to her aunts and to her friends.

Then one day she blows up my phone and I finally answer and she asks if I’m alone and sends me nudes and asks for pictures back. A few days later she calls me and asks for more pictures and says she wants to fuck me and all kinds good stuff. So now I’m thinking that her and dude are not together because she said she hates liars cheaters and players so its my surprise a few days later when I see a picture of her and dude out together but I don’t say anything. A week or so later she sends me even more nudes and says I can have her for my birthday. Then she pretty much ghosts me and only talks to a few times since then. She knows how I feel so why tease me? 

We still hadn’t exchanged birthday gifts and its been 3 and half months with multiple times of her telling me we need to but never meeting up. So last week I told her I’m either dropping them off, meeting with her to exchange them, or shipping them. She said that it was ‘creepy’ that I’d drop them off and why wouldn’t I give them to her… I’ve been trying to! So anyways this Monday I shipped them and she got them wed and never said anything and I didn’t ask about them. 

I know I need to cut ties with her. Shes playing me for a fool for what purpose I have no damn idea and I let it go on way longer than it should have because I did and still do love her.

My question is… did I do something in all this to deserve this treatment? I don’t think I did but maybe I did and I need someone to point it out.
But more importantly do I just cut all ties without saying anything?

Do I cut ties after saying I need to move on?

Or do I call her out and tell her how much she hurt me and played with me for no reason at all and that she became the thing she said she hated and became a player, liar and cheat. I obviously wanted to be more than friends with her but I had accepted it and wasn’t pursing her so for her to mess with me and lead me on was hurtful. (this is what I think I need to do because I think she needs to know what she did was wrong whether she give a shit or not)

I also have the proof of all the nudes and the other shit she said and I could let the dude know, I know who he is… this seems extreme but I also look at it as he deserves to know and I’d want to know if it was me.

72c6o7,3,2017-09-25,"My parents (late 50s/early 60s) plan on transferring all their assets/savings to me when they retire, and living with me. How can I prepare for this financially?",firsonalpenance,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/72c6o7/my_parents_late_50searly_60s_plan_on_transferring/,"Hello personalfinance,

&amp;nbsp;

tl;dr at the bottom

&amp;nbsp;

   First of all, I would like to thank you. I am a 25 yo graduate student that has finally wrangled her student loans into manageable payments, and worked out a budget that has allowed me to pay for my last semester of grad school out of pocket, instead of taking out a 9% interest loan (are you serious wells fargo?) that would bite me in the butt later. I really cannot thank you enough for your advice and encouragement.

&amp;nbsp;

   I know my question sounds naive but I really do not know where to even start when it comes to navigating this. The inheritance/windfall sections on the wiki have been helpful but my situation isn't the usual ""I have/will inherit $$$, what to do with it?"" because my parents will obviously still need this money when they retire.

&amp;nbsp;

   I am the middle child of three. My whole life I have been told explicitly that I am my parent's retirement plan. Oldest sibling has been in revolving door drug rehab for years, and youngest sibling is going into their 7th year of attending an expensive out-of-state college for a liberal arts degree (my mom is funding whatever is not covered by loans which are in siblings name). 

&amp;nbsp;

   My mother is a public school teacher and is planning to retire in 10 years to get a pension of 80% of her current salary. My father is a blue collar worker with a cash salary and no pension. Their retirement plan, what little of it they have related to me, is that they will sell their house, move in with me when I purchase a house, and transfer all their assets and savings into my name, for me to manage. (**EDIT: They each have their own 401(k) plans they plan to withdraw from to support them in retirement. My post is asking about the savings/house profits that they want me to manage**)

&amp;nbsp;

   I am on board with the first half of this plan. My parents definitely need to move out of their current house because it will be too difficult to maintain/shovel/etc when they are older. I am on board with them moving in with me (split level home or in-law apartment) because they are independent and very easy to live with.

&amp;nbsp;

   I don't know what do to about the second half- being the family financial manager. My father is insistent that I manage the finances in order to facilitate their life care/medical needs when they are too old to manage it themselves. He is good with money, my mom less so, and I believe that he is worried my mom will be financially supporting my siblings and other members of her side of the family because she cannot say no to them.

&amp;nbsp;

The family/emotional stuff are issues for another sub though. I am asking PF about the financial management part. The only finances I've been managing are those of myself, a student with very low living expenses. I get a tax refund every year. By the end of this year, I will graduate with a masters degree in an engineering field, and hopefully be able to turn my $35k intern salary into a $50k+ full time job with benefits. I have budgeted to pay off my $75k in student loans within the next 8-9 years. I don't know what to expect when I inherit my parents' $70k savings and $200k+ from the sale of their house. I want to save it to cover their medical expenses and life care, but how to best do that? Do I dump it all into a high int% savings, or invest a portion and try to get higher returns? I think they want to do this so that they will be eligible for medicare, is that possible with my mother's pension of 50 to 60k/year?

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr Parents want to retire in next 10 years and transfer savings into my name so I can manage finances and coordinate life care for them, I don't know anything about managing finances beyond my own income and student loans.**"

I &gt;&gt; Okay.

I &gt;&gt; That's it.

S &gt;&gt; ?

I &gt;&gt; No. I'm calling bullshit on this one.

S &gt;&gt; The Edgerton Claim? Its all by the book.

I &gt;&gt; THEN THE FUCKING BOOK IS WRONG.

S &gt;&gt; Language and tone, Illy.

I &gt;&gt; You cannot be FUCKING SERIOUS.

I &gt;&gt; He beats her up. He hurts her. He makes her feel worthless. He takes away everything she has including her child. And we do NOTHING??

S &gt;&gt; Illy, there is a system to everything. Rules we have to follow. That's the very nature of Heaven.

I &gt;&gt; NO. IT ISN'T. You cannot FUCKING TELL ME THAT and expect ME TO FUCKING STAY CALM.

I &gt;&gt; We are Cherabim of the Highest order of the Lord our God. Who is merciful. Who is all powerful. Who is Just. Who loves unconditionally and pours his wrath only on the undeserving.

I &gt;&gt; We can't be indifferent about people like these that need. We are ANGELS. WE AREN'T FUCKING DEMONS.

I &gt;&gt; Fuck I MEAN EVEN DEMONS WOULD ACTIVELY DO SOMETHING. THEY WOULDN'T BE A BUNCH OF INDIFFERENT FUCKING SHITHEADS.

S &gt;&gt; Language Illy. And calm down.

I &gt;&gt; I will NOT calm the fuck down. And I will NOT let this claim get Rejected. I'll go over your head to the LTO office if I need to. This is bullshit and you know it.

S &gt;&gt; Tell you what. I'll back you up with that.

S &gt;&gt; Maybe your right.

I &gt;&gt; ... really?

S &gt;&gt; Yup. I'll get the paperwork ready in my office in 5 minutes.

I &gt;&gt; Why IS IT SO GOD DAMN COLD ???

I &gt;&gt; Why IS IT SO GOD DAMN COLD?? WTF IS GOING ON?

S &gt;&gt; Illy. Listen to yourself. And think about what your saying.

S &gt;&gt; Take a look around.

I &gt;&gt; No. Oh no plznoidontwanttobehere. help me plz i am so sorry i am so so so so sorry

S &gt;&gt; Do you know why your here?

S &gt;&gt; Its not because you turned your back on God. Its not because you sold him out. Or started working for Hell with us on the sly.

I &gt;&gt; Im in fucking Hell. ANGELS DON'T GO TO FUCKING HELL WHAT DID YOU DO

S &gt;&gt; That's an incorrect assumption.

S &gt;&gt; You are here because you had the conscience to call out God for his indifference to his own creation. And you were sent to Hell to be punished for your transgression.

Satan &gt;&gt; But I gave it a thought. And I thought I'd be a bit more creative about things. And maybe even a bit more merciful than you pathetic, lazy ass excuse for a God.

I &gt;&gt; ohmygodno

I &gt;&gt; Father of lies. The Fallen. The Brightest One.

I &gt;&gt; WTF DUDE.

Satan &gt;&gt; K, srsly tho dude. I only lied to you about who I was so fuckin calm down, k?

I &gt;&gt; Your lying. This is a test. I'm gonna succeed this test and go home. You big ass Red bat winged FUCK.

Satan &gt;&gt; Ouch. K see now that was uncalled for.

Satan &gt;&gt; Illy. Look. All these cases? Every last one of them is real. They have all passed through my mailbox over the years. I mean.. I had to have them STOLEN to get here but...

I &gt;&gt; FUCK YOU YOUR LYING

Satan &gt;&gt; Oh plz. You were sold by Seraphim who watched and did nothing as over thirty five THOUSAND innocent people died in a nuclear blast. Do you really think its so unlikely that I could have bribed one of them to get me legit Damnation Casefiles? Bitch Please, I'm Lucifer. I get shit done.

Satan &gt;&gt; Face it. All I have done here since you arrived was given you proof of what you've known all along.

Satan &gt;&gt; God doesn't care about them. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't care about anyone anymore.

Satan &gt;&gt; Back in '45? You were right. And you called him on it. And you were sent to hell to be punished for it. And for 67 fuckin years I've been trying to show you the Truth.

Satan &gt;&gt; And you see it now, don't you?

I &gt;&gt; Get behind me Satan. I am a Cherubim of the Lord our God and I will not heed your words.

Satan &gt;&gt; See, that's the problem with being the Father of Lies.

Satan &gt;&gt; When you actually want to help someone by giving them the truth, they'll never give you the benefit of the doubt. Specially if they are a fuckin Angel.

I &gt;&gt; I AM RIGHTEOUS. I AM HOLY. I AM A MOTHER FUCKIN BAD ASS OF HEAVEN AND YOU DON'T SCARE ME.

Location: Chigago, IL, USA

Details: Cubs (Baseball team) Lost 12-2 in nonseason game. Damning Party lost 20$ wager as a result.

Review Notes: Declined. Per the manual we stopped doing Professonal Sports Teams after the Edmonton Oilers during the '88 Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins. Apparently God was a big Gretzkey fan. Plus I get the feeling this is a duplicate claim.

Supervisor Notes: Approved. Good work, Illy.

I &gt;&gt; Please don't call me Illy, sir.

S &gt;&gt; Of course. Sorry about that.

S &gt;&gt; Enjoying your first day out of training?

I &gt;&gt; I am, actually. Thx for asking, sir. :)

S &gt;&gt; My pleasure.

Hey guys!

In september 2018 I need to go on an internship for half a year (September till February). Now, I am looking at three countries: Norway, Sweden and Denmark.
It's for the study called traffic engineering. I'm studying it in The Netherlands.

I will do an intership abroad because I want to gain some experience in other countries and I really love Scandinavia. I also will have emmigration plans to Scandinavia in the future, so it would be a great first step to get to know the countries better!

In Norway, I've found a few great cities to have an internship: Bergen and Trondheim.

In Sweden there are a bit more cities, like Stockholm, Göteborg and Uppsala.

And in Denmark I think Copenhagen is a great city to have an internship.

How are the people in these countries? How are the countries politically? Is Norway that more expensive than Sweden and Denmark?

Thanks in advance! "

I start my internship in software development this summer, and it will be over by next fall. I graduate Spring 2019. 

The normal thing to do would just be get a job in America like everyone else.  But I don't want to do that. I want to live in a different country.  

I've gone through this decision for over a year now, and have thought about several other countries including Japan, Canada, and Norway (My family is Norwegian)

But recently I was told, that Scotland is a pretty easy country to emigrate too as an American, and is relatively cheap to live in, with good employment opportunities.  I also like scotch.  

So my question is: What employment opportunities are there for software developers in Scotland? What is the immigration process for an American?

I'm currently entering my final year of my Maths Degree, hopefully on track to get a 1st.

Having just completed an internship in Data Analytics, I have recieved a decent job offer for just over £30k.

However part of me wants to do a Maths Masters (1 extra year), even though I am unsure if it will help my job prospects. This will lead to my offer being null (and they won't defer a year), but it will allow me to potentially do an internship in a different field next summer (perhaps Banking if I can get it).

Should I take the job in hand, or do a masters and lose the offer?

72fihf,15,2017-09-25,Is my grad program breaking the law? Dubious offers made by administration to keep me from leaving the program.,8_Circuit_Brain,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/72fihf/is_my_grad_program_breaking_the_law_dubious/,"I realize that this isn't about actual psychotherapy, but I'm hoping that this is the right sub to post this in because I figure the professionals here will have an understanding of what laws may have been broken.

TLDR: My advisor offered to bypass my client-contact-hours requirement for my degree if I agreed not to leave the program. The short of our meeting was that I met with her to say ""I don't want to be a counselor now. I've done everything but my clinicals, and have 42 credits at a 4.0GPA. Is there any way to give me a student-designed degree or a certificate, so I have something to show for my time in the program?"" She said ""there's no way I can make that happen for you, but if you stay in the program I'll make sure you don't have to do any counseling for your clinicals."" Other dubious things below.

For the last three years I have been in a counseling program. For at least these 3 years, the program has claimed to be a CACREP accredited clinical mental health counseling program. Only through some sleuthing did we come to find that they are accredited as a ""Community Counseling"" program. CACREP maintains that the particular designation matters little, but I'm left wondering ""why be misleading in the first place?""

Anyway, I had discovered that it would take me a total of 5.5-6 years to finish my degree (or longer, if the courses aren't offered during the semesers in which I need to take them). I was supposed to be on a 4-year track, but now I'm starting year 4 with no end in sight. This came as the result of taking my courses in a certain sequence. I made all of my course scheduling choices in consultation with my advisor and asked her along the way ""will this change my ETA for graduating in 2017"" and she said ""no"" every time! 

So, a couple weeks ago I met with my advisor (who also happens to be the advisor of every other student in the program, as well as the coordinator of the program and the instructor for over 1/3 of its courses) to ask how this could have happened. I told her I was frustrated with the program, that I had no more interest in being a counselor, and that I was preparing to leave the program and that I am much more interested in going into a research field. First she said ""you're mistaken about the scheduling conflict, and it will only take you 3 more semesters to graduate, not 6. You don't have to worry about which courses are being offered because the one's you need will always be offered [a lie]. Then she said something like ""it would be such a shame to get so far into the program only to leave with nothing. Why don't you find yourself an internship as a researcher and we'll just use that for your internship credit.""

 I'm so agreeable that I actually took the time to consider the offer and act on it, seeking out an internship in academic research. Only after I interviewed for internships (counseling and research) did I realize that my advisor didn't have the authority to make such an offer and there would also me no way for me, in a research internship, to account for the 600+ direct-client-contact hours the degree requires. 

Before I left her office, she handed me a copy of the semester's course schedule, which she printed specifically for me, and said ""here is your schedule, I've highlighted the dates and times for the course you're enrolled in."" When I showed up for the first day of class I found out that she had highlighted the wrong dates, and that I had missed the first day of my classes. This is at least the second time she's done this to me, and it really put me at a disadvantage this semester because my Practicum instructor is only staying for the first half of the semester (then going on vacation) so he's cutting the semester in half (which is ridiculous because it requires internship hours). He's implying that if we can't find client hours before then we should record sessions with fake clients, and if we have issues with obtaining supervision hours we should just essentially fake the hours"" I may or may not have recorded this class, but if I did, I did not get his consent beforehand.

 There are a number of other equally dubious things going on at this program. As another example; recently I paid $60 for an 8-hour seminar on the NEO PI-R by one of the faculty here (same guy from Practicum). He claimed that at the end of the seminar we would all know how to use and interpret the NEO as experts as well as be elligible for certification if we just emailed the company and said we passed a training... The problem is that the company which makes the NEO does not list him as a certified instructor/certifier, and they have not responded to my inquiry for certification."
72fqya,3,2017-09-25,Have any of you thought of going into trading/quantitative finance?,squidwardtortellini0,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/72fqya/have_any_of_you_thought_of_going_into/,"I am a junior now majoring in math and computer science. I've got one exam passed, am sitting for FM in December, and have one actuarial internship under my belt. And now I am on the job hunt for another internship.

While I definitely enjoyed my actuarial internship last summer a ton, I am still curious about other professions and am left scratching my head that so many people my age act like they know exactly what they want to do.

More specifically, I have noticed that there are a lot of trading internships that seem really cool, and to me it seems like there is a lot of similarities in skills between actuaries and traders. For example, both are usually good with probability, risk management, and maybe some level of predictive modelling.

So I couldn't help but wonder, did anyone here ever consider being a trader? Or maybe was a trader before? How did you become an actuary?

To me it seems that the advantages of trading is that there is more money there, the work may be more exciting, and trading firms seem to be more modern in their use of technology. The downsides seem to be long hours, a much riskier career trajectory (no clear ladder/high chance of getting fired), and sometimes nastier work cultures.

Thinking about the above has me leaning towards being an actuary since I'm not sure I want to work insane hours, and I've really liked every actuary I've met. But I just wanted to see if anyone here had any other insights! 

Thank you"

Included was a snarky post it note about how he knew she stole the same yogurt from his last time. Damning Party feels slighted because of recent jokes about her turning 40 and needing to eat more prunes.

Review Notes: Approved. First off, that Mango-Lime yogurt was a limited run and Bernard knew that, the prick. Second of all, he's just a jerk and deserves a good damning.

I &gt;&gt; That's it.

S &gt;&gt; ?

I &gt;&gt; No. I'm calling bullshit on this one.

S &gt;&gt; The Edgerton Claim? Its all by the book.

I &gt;&gt; THEN THE FUCKING BOOK IS WRONG.

S &gt;&gt; Language and tone, Illy.

I &gt;&gt; You cannot be FUCKING SERIOUS.

I &gt;&gt; He beats her up. He hurts her. He makes her feel worthless. He takes away everything she has including her child. And we do NOTHING??

S &gt;&gt; Illy, there is a system to everything. Rules we have to follow. That's the very nature of Heaven.

I &gt;&gt; NO. IT ISN'T. You cannot FUCKING TELL ME THAT and expect ME TO FUCKING STAY CALM.

I &gt;&gt; We are Cherabim of the Highest order of the Lord our God. Who is merciful. Who is all powerful. Who is Just. Who loves unconditionally and pours his wrath only on the undeserving.

I &gt;&gt; We can't be indifferent about people like these that need. We are ANGELS. WE AREN'T FUCKING DEMONS.

I &gt;&gt; Fuck I MEAN EVEN DEMONS WOULD ACTIVELY DO SOMETHING. THEY WOULDN'T BE A BUNCH OF INDIFFERENT FUCKING SHITHEADS.

S &gt;&gt; Language Illy. And calm down.

I &gt;&gt; I will NOT calm the fuck down. And I will NOT let this claim get Rejected. I'll go over your head to the LTO office if I need to. This is bullshit and you know it.

S &gt;&gt; Tell you what. I'll back you up with that.

S &gt;&gt; Maybe your right.

I &gt;&gt; ... really?

S &gt;&gt; Yup. I'll get the paperwork ready in my office in 5 minutes.

S &gt;&gt; You mind working one more claim before you meet up here to head over to the Legionary Team Office liaison ?

I &gt;&gt; Um. Yeah.

I &gt;&gt; Hey. Thanks.

S &gt;&gt; Your welcome, Illaebus.

S &gt;&gt; See you in a bit.

Incident Class : Divine - Deistical

Damning Party: Cherubim Illaebus of the 5th Circle of Heaven

Damned Party: Yahweh, Jehovah, The Office and Administration of the Most High God

Time: 8/6/45/0817

Location: Hiroshima, Empire of Japan

Details: Multiple witnesses among the SSF Group Delta 2 on reconnaissance duties around Hiroshima to observe mortal use of Atomic Weapons in its first actual use in Military Operations witnessed Cherabim Illaebus watching from a distance as the weapon detonated. It was reported that Cherabim Illaebus repeatedly asked the SSF unit to intervene and ""Save those poor people!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO SOMETHING."" Upon weapon detonation, Damned party repeatedly cursed our Lord God for what he called 'his indifference and cruelty' during the duration of this Century. Report was filed with the The Office and Administration of the Most High God immediately.

Review Notes: With a heavy heart, I find no technical or administrative faults in this recommendation for Divine Damnation against this Cherubim. Approved for immediate execution.

Intern Daevaton

I &gt;&gt; This isn't funny.

I &gt;&gt; What the FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?

S &gt;&gt; Your right. It isn't funny.

S &gt;&gt; To be fair, mind you, its not like your the first one to have this happen to you.

I &gt;&gt; WTF is going on with the FUCKING heat in this place? I thought you said you were contact building management.

S &gt;&gt; See, when a mortal is Damned by another mortal it is true that sometimes God will look down from heaven and flick his pinky out for a bit of divine retribution.

I &gt;&gt; What is going on?? Why am I the only one here?? How did I not notice that there was no one else in these offices until now???

I &gt;&gt; Why IS IT SO GOD DAMN COLD ???

S &gt;&gt; Oh Illy. Illy Illy Illy Illy.

S &gt;&gt; The lowest part of this place is actually the coldest.

S &gt;&gt; Its the region saved for Traitors, Mutineers and Politicians. But we thought we'd let you give it a go for a while.

I &gt;&gt; Why IS IT SO GOD DAMN COLD?? WTF IS GOING ON?

S &gt;&gt; Illy. Listen to yourself. And think about what your saying.

S &gt;&gt; Take a look around.

I &gt;&gt; No. Oh no plznoidontwanttobehere. help me plz i am so sorry i am so so so so sorry

S &gt;&gt; Do you know why your here?

S &gt;&gt; Its not because you turned your back on God. Its not because you sold him out. Or started working for Hell with us on the sly.

I &gt;&gt; Im in fucking Hell. ANGELS DON'T GO TO FUCKING HELL WHAT DID YOU DO

S &gt;&gt; That's an incorrect assumption.

S &gt;&gt; You are here because you had the conscience to call out God for his indifference to his own creation. And you were sent to Hell to be punished for your transgression.

Satan &gt;&gt; But I gave it a thought. And I thought I'd be a bit more creative about things. And maybe even a bit more merciful than you pathetic, lazy ass excuse for a God.

I &gt;&gt; ohmygodno

I &gt;&gt; Father of lies. The Fallen. The Brightest One.

I &gt;&gt; WTF DUDE.

Satan &gt;&gt; K, srsly tho dude. I only lied to you about who I was so fuckin calm down, k?

I &gt;&gt; Your lying. This is a test. I'm gonna succeed this test and go home. You big ass Red bat winged FUCK.

Satan &gt;&gt; Ouch. K see now that was uncalled for.

Satan &gt;&gt; Illy. Look. All these cases? Every last one of them is real. They have all passed through my mailbox over the years. I mean.. I had to have them STOLEN to get here but...

I &gt;&gt; FUCK YOU YOUR LYING

Satan &gt;&gt; Oh plz. You were sold by Seraphim who watched and did nothing as over thirty five THOUSAND innocent people died in a nuclear blast. Do you really think its so unlikely that I could have bribed one of them to get me legit Damnation Casefiles? Bitch Please, I'm Lucifer. I get shit done.

Satan &gt;&gt; Face it. All I have done here since you arrived was given you proof of what you've known all along.

Satan &gt;&gt; God doesn't care about them. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't care about anyone anymore.

Satan &gt;&gt; Back in '45? You were right. And you called him on it. And you were sent to hell to be punished for it. And for 67 fuckin years I've been trying to show you the Truth.

Satan &gt;&gt; And you see it now, don't you?

I &gt;&gt; Get behind me Satan. I am a Cherubim of the Lord our God and I will not heed your words.

Satan &gt;&gt; See, that's the problem with being the Father of Lies.

Satan &gt;&gt; When you actually want to help someone by giving them the truth, they'll never give you the benefit of the doubt. Specially if they are a fuckin Angel.

I &gt;&gt; I AM RIGHTEOUS. I AM HOLY. I AM A MOTHER FUCKIN BAD ASS OF HEAVEN AND YOU DON'T SCARE ME.

Incident Class : Minor

Damning Party: Bupkiss, Ralph J

Damned Party: The Chicago Cubs

Time: 9/16/17:1732 Local

Location: Chigago, IL, USA

Details: Cubs (Baseball team) Lost 12-2 in nonseason game. Damning Party lost 20$ wager as a result.

Review Notes: Declined. Per the manual we stopped doing Professonal Sports Teams after the Edmonton Oilers during the '88 Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins. Apparently God was a big Gretzkey fan. Plus I get the feeling this is a duplicate claim.

Supervisor Notes: Approved. Good work, Illy.

I &gt;&gt; Please don't call me Illy, sir.

S &gt;&gt; Of course. Sorry about that.

S &gt;&gt; Enjoying your first day out of training?

I &gt;&gt; I am, actually. Thx for asking, sir. :)

S &gt;&gt; My pleasure.

72gggu,3,2017-09-25,"Me [21 F] with my bf [20 M] of 8 months, back together after a breakup, said he was going to change but now I think he is still going to prioritize the frat over me",throwyyyy2222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/72gggu/me_21_f_with_my_bf_20_m_of_8_months_back_together/,"When me and my boyfriend started dating he just was rushing for a frat, and it made our relationship so difficult and I had a really hard time with it. He would be consumed by it and also never include me on anything, never introduce me to his friends, took other girls as dates for his events and invited them to parties and what not, sort of like living two parallel lives. I put up with it since I thought it was temporary and that it would be more different once he finished the pledging process and once the summer came. 


During the summer he broke up with me since we were doing long distance, and he felt that I was not putting enough effort while I was doing an internship in another city. I won't say he was wrong, it was my dream internship and I was so excited to be doing something that left me so fulfilled. I would still call him every night though, and I felt there was little I could do when we were so far away. I was really heartbroken, took me a while to get over it, but I just felt relieved in a way since I wouldn't have to deal with his fraternity coming fall. At the time, he didn't tell me that part of the reason too was because he saw that it was going to be hard when we got back to school, since he was going to be living at his fraternity house.


A couple of weeks after we breakup he calls me crying saying how life is short and he wants to be with me. That he doesn't care about what his fraternity is going to think but that what we have is so special and that he wants me to be his number one priority.  I just told him I don’t want to be with him if he would be the same way as spring term where his frat was his priority and he barely put the effort on the relationship. He kept saying how no, it is going to be so different, that I would be his number one priority, that he is going to include me and what not and would even drop out of the frat if it came to that. I was surprised and I guess I just really wanted to believe him and got back with him. 


He invited me to his hometown and I went to visit his family and what not. We pretty much lived together for like 2 weeks and it was great, like he was great and it did feel a lot different. And now that school has started and he has moved in the frat it is like he changed his mindset again. Now he is like things are going to be hard, the frat is something new to me and I want to experience it and be involved in it (like have a position and what not) and also focus on school, and he doesn't know how long term our relationship will be. He said there would be a lot of times like that were he just didn’t want to skip activities and stuff from his frat to be with me, that we won’t spend that much time together and he is really excited to be with the frat this year. For example, we were going to hang out but then his frat bros came over to his place to watch a football game with his roommate and he decided to stay, since he didn't want to be the odd one of the group and leave. I went to bed early since I was jet lagged and didn't have any sleep and he then went out with them to a party and ended up going over to a sorority girl's house to chill with a couple of people. It hasn't even been a couple of days since we are back in school and I might be overreacting but I am already feeling as anxious as I felt the term where he started pledging. It's not that I want to be with him 24/7, but I want to be in a relationship, be a part of his life and do things with him. I don't feel like I am asking for too much. I know his frat is a big part of his life, but even if it has been only a day things just feel like they are going to be the same as before: him coming over really drunk to my place after parties he won't include me in and me not ever meeting his friends from his fraternity and sororities.


I am a senior and this is my last year. I have a job lined up after college and will be moving out of the city. This year I will have so much more time in my hands than him. I really just don’t want to be hurt, I know it sucks being without him and it is so hard to get over him, but I don’t even know if it is going to be more painful to be with him while he is devoting all of his time to greek life. It is the first week and I am already freaking out thinking that things are not going to change. I want some guidance. Am I overreacting, should I wait to see how things play out, or is it obvious that he is not going to change at all? Am I going to suffer more if I stay, and I am just stupid for not seeing it? Or maybe he is just being honest with me and I shouldn't expect so much from him and from the relationship and live it day by day without overreacting? 
  
  ---   

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is in frat, it has always been a big issue in our relationship since he won't include me in that part of his life and will make it a priority. Said things were going to be different, got back with him, now really anxious that things are not going to be different at all. "
72hq4p,73,2017-09-25,[XL] Mega Kevin for Life,jb007gamer,StoriesAboutKevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/72hq4p/xl_mega_kevin_for_life/,"I just discovered this subreddit and realized I've known a mega Kevin for over a decade now. He was one of my neighbours growing up and went to the same high school and university. I'll share the saga of Kevin's many ""accomplishments"".

NOTE: If you don't know programming, you might not understand the depth of some of Kevin's ""accomplishments"". Just imagine showing up to a Japanese exam tomorrow morning without knowing a single stroke of a Japanese character, or showing up to a calculus exam tomorrow morning without even knowing the names of major topics (like not knowing that the word ""differentiation"" exists, much less how to even do that stuff). 

**Grade 9-10**

Kevin starts high school, and has a habit of not handing in graded homework, even though that's basically free marks for most students. He does manage to pass all his classes in the end since he bothers to show up for tests, and pays enough attention in class to be able to bullshit his way through most tests (he doesn't actually sit down and study for the most part). He actually manages to ace math because it's one of the few classes where the grade is based entirely on tests/exams with zero homework. 

Kevin discovers he's not too bad at math challenge contests (think of the AMC and AIME in American middle and high schools). To his credit, Kevin does have a knack for being able to formulate strategies in those tricky problems in a way that most people can't. Kevin scores fairly well on all math contests he participates in throughout high school, but never well enough to earn awards, because he doesn't actually have that much knowledge of ""practical math"" (e.g. calculus, logarithms). Yet this gets to Kevin's head for the rest of his life, and he starts making fun of students who do well in classroom math but fail hard at math contests.

Kevin loves to hang around my lunch table despite being a grade below me and others. Not that it's abnormal by itself, but this guy literally has no friends in his own grade since most of his actual classmates don't like him. He has a tendency to make annoying perverted jokes, mostly involving genitalia. He loves to participate in ""kibbitzing"" when watching other students play board/card games during lunch, and refuses to stop even when people openly express their annoyance.

Kevin is a huge luddite (more on this later). He chooses the least efficient way of doing anything on a computer because ""that's the easiest way"". He's addicted to surfing the Internet, but refuses to use any browser other than Internet Explorer (this was the late 2000s when even your grandma started to realize IE was shit), because he's too lazy to learn how to use other programs. He believes that software updates ""only break shit"", especially if they result in any sort of UI change, so he is utterly reluctant to update anything, even if it is a minor security update that doesn't change the look and feel of the software. He doesn't even realize that copy-and-paste is a thing until he's 15 years old - that was one of the very few times Kevin actually embraced the superior way of doing things. He constantly gets malware on his computer (which I later clean up for him) because he keeps visiting stupid websites that even my grandparents knew to avoid.

**Grade 11-12**

Kevin miraculously is accepted to the IB (International Baccalaureate) advanced program because he managed to bullshit his way through the entrance exam. He keeps up his habit of not handing in graded homework, except for really big assignments like the Extended Essay. He also chooses not to actually study for tests, thinking his old tactic of ""regurgitating what he remembers from classes"" will get him through. This actually does work out for him for most of his first year of IB, and he gets a decent ""predicted IB score"" by the end of Grade 11.

However, IB gets more difficult in Grade 12, as teachers really ramp up the curriculum in preparation for IB exams. Kevin's academic ""strategy"" begins to show its cracks. He can't bullshit his way through tests as well as he used to. His habit of not handing in assignments is posing a serious threat to his predicted IB score. He's barely passing IB math (supposed to be his strong suit) but still is obsessed with math challenge contests, and still laughs at other students who attempt the contests and don't score well.

At the same time, Kevin starts applying to universities. He sees that I'm in my first year at the University of Toronto (one of the very best schools in Canada), and decides to try his luck applying there, and his predicted IB score gets him accepted to the general science program. While he's IMing with me about the college application process, I ask him if he's also applying to other schools in the area for ""backup"". Kevin arrogantly derides those other schools as ""second rate universities"", claiming that going to those ""shit second-rate schools"" will ensure that he can't get a job (despite plenty of evidence to the contrary). At the same time, Kevin makes fun of students who choose to go to community colleges or trade school after graduation. He seriously looks down on anyone who doesn't have a university degree, and even declares that he would ""lose face"" (he's Asian) if he ""doesn't have a masters degree by age 30"".

Kevin's acceptance to the University of Toronto really gets to his head. He completely loses interest in schoolwork, and repeatedly IMs me about what life is like in university, fantasizing how he's going to ""have lunch with professors and make connections"" or ""challenge myself and graduate in 3 years instead of 4"". 

At the end of the year, Kevin's slacking-off in IB results in him scoring only 20/45 points combined across all IB exams, and he doesn't receive an IB diploma (he does receive a provincial secondary school diploma since he technically passed in terms of raw grades). The minimum to get the IB diploma is 24/45 points, and the vast majority of students have scored well over 30. Kevin starts freaking out that the University of Toronto is going to rescind his acceptance since he failed to ""maintain a B average"". However, for reasons unknown, Kevin's failure goes completely unnoticed. He takes out a student loan to begin his first year at the University of Toronto. 

**University Year 1**

Kevin enters the general science program with more enthusiasm than I expected. In his program, you don't actually have a real major yet - you choose prerequisite courses for a ""target major"" and if you pass all of them, you then declare that major and proceed. Like most students, Kevin isn't sure what kind of science he wants to do. He picks physics, calculus, linear algebra, chemistry, economics, and beginner's programming - this opens the doors for several potential STEM majors including computer science. 

Kevin's luddite-ness and social ineptitude start to limit him again. He complains to me that textbooks are too expensive. I point out that many of the ""required"" books aren't really necessary in STEM (since you have the internet), that many of the books can be torrented, and that there is a website specially set up for Toronto students to list used books for sale. He rejects my first point since he ""really needs to study"", he rejects my second point since he thinks ""reading books on the computer is weird"", and he rejects my third point saying ""I don't like contacting random people"". He then blows hundreds of dollars of his parents' money on brand new textbooks that he barely touches. Keep in mind that Kevin is in a financial position where he needs to take out student loans! 

Remarkably, due to the shame of failing IB, Kevin takes at least some of his work seriously for the first half of the first semester. He hands in most of his physics and chemistry labs, and discovers that he's not too bad at beginner's programming, and tells me that it's cool and fun. However, he starts to fall behind in calculus (even though he theoretically should be good at it since he did IB math, but he did fail IB). This kills his motivation to attend classes - he opts to stay home and watch anime all day. He reasons that he can ""learn from the book"". To his credit, he does look at slides for his other classes since the professors release them online every day. Kevin passes all his half-year courses in his first semester, and actually scores a B in his first programming course despite being a luddite who chooses to commute to the computer lab to do assignments, rather than set up the IDE on his own laptop. His calculus and economics course are full-year courses so he doesn't get a grade yet in those, but he's confident he'll pass.

At the end of the second semester, Kevin gets a low B in his second programming course, barely passes his other half-year courses, and fails calculus and economics. He's placed on academic probation. Kevin extends his student loan to repeat those courses in summer school, and barely passes (since he keeps up the same work ethic).

When I ask Kevin why he doesn't try harder in calculus, since he was still fixated on his achievements in high school math challenge contests, he said ""I'd rather get 50% in the classroom and not be an idiot, than get 90% and be an idiot"". To say that this guy doesn't have his priorities straight is an understatement.

**University Year 2**

Kevin barely gets off academic probation after passing his repeated calculus and economics courses. He decides to declare computer science as his major since he scored best in programming during first year. While this might seem logical, I should point out that he's a luddite, and also that those beginner courses weren't exactly difficult - most students who choose to declare a CS major either aced those courses, or they got those courses waived with prior high school experience and went straight into advanced programming. His weakness in math was also concerning since the CS major does have mandatory intermediate math courses (multivariable calculus and advanced linear algebra) - it's not all programming. 

As predicted, Kevin's university career starts falling apart. The second year programming courses are a HUGE step up from the introductory courses that Kevin felt confident in last year. He refuses to admit that he simply sucks at programming, making outlandish claims like ""Java is written by fags who want to make life hard"" (he's very homophobic but that's another story) or that Python (the language used in the first year courses) is ""the only way to do anything efficiently"". He also complains about having to learn Unix. I remember facepalming hard when he said ""Why do I need to learn a terminal command for changing folders or copying files when I can just use the mouse/Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V?"". When I said ""how are you going to write a program to move the mouse for you and click"", he said ""Not everything needs to be done in code - I can do some stuff manually and some stuff in code. It's faster that way"". For one project where he's required to have a partner, Kevin simply chooses not to find a partner in the class, and gets a zero. He scrapes through with a low C in programming.

Kevin's performance in math is even worse. He scores 30% in linear algebra at the end of his first semester, and a big reason is that he threw away an easy 25% by ignoring homework assignments. His parents see his performance and are concerned, telling him to drop to the minimum full-time course load to relieve stress (minimum is 3 concurrent subjects per semester, whereas a typical schedule has 5). Kevin decides to drop multivariable calculus and opt out of any ""coding classes"", deferring them to the next year.

In the second semester, Kevin repeats linear algebra (which he fails for a second time), takes an easy first-year humanities elective (getting his first A), and signs up for an algorithms course (CS course where you focus on strategy and don't actually write code), reasoning that since he was ""good at math contests"" he can easily handle it. Ha ha ha.

The night before his algorithms midterm, Kevin IMs me in a panic, asking me to explain all those ""weird symbols"" to him. When I quiz him on his Big-Oh notation knowledge, he doesn't know what I'm talking about, because he literally is clueless as to the NAMES OF THE MAJOR TOPICS. Out of sympathy, I take a few hours to try to teach him, but he doesn't absorb much. He scores 5% (yes, five) on the midterm. He has not done a single assignment (they are worth 40% of the grade). He decides not to show up for his final exam, which was probably for the best since he would've failed either way. 

Kevin's placed on academic probation again. He has one more year to get his shit together or he's suspended. He decides not to take summer school this time because he ""needs a break"". However, he refuses to get a summer job, opting to sit at home and play web browser games (i.e. those silly Facebook things) and watch anime. His parents try to no avail to get him off his ass, and his uncle even offers to let him work as a clerk at a family business, but he refuses. Did I mention that this guy is in a financial position to need student loans? Meanwhile, any CS student worth his salt is getting a paid internship or a lab research position by this point.

**University Year 3**

Technically, it's Year 2 again, since everything Kevin signs up for is at the 200-level or lower. His first semester has a useless humanities filler (which he barely passes), a repeat attempt at multivariable calculus (a full-year course), and an intro statistics course (I never knew how he fared in this one). In his second semester, he makes a third attempt at the exact same linear algebra course, and a second attempt at the same algorithms course. He also signs up for a fundamental systems programming course, which has intense use of C and bash. He drops calculus in the second semester because it's ""too hard"" and decides to defer that to summer school. 

Kevin again brings up the complaint about textbooks being too expensive and this time, he finally relents and asks me to help torrent PDF versions for him. So that's an improvement!

Kevin's struggles in the systems programming course are like a sitcom. He complains that ""C is unnecessarily hard fag material"" (yay homophobia!), once again proclaiming Python to be the one and only. He actually tries to do his first assignment, but he's required to use Git (a version control system) to remotely submit it, and he doesn't understand the Git commands, so he derides Git as ""useless shit - why can't these guys just use email?"". He derides makefiles in the same way, questioning why they're needed when he has ""the keyboard"". He predictably gives up on trying to do any of the assignments.

The morning of the midterm, with just 4 hours left, Kevin IMs me in a panic, asking me to explain things like pointers in C (aka ""pointy gays"" as he calls them), and what the hell '\0' means. He asks if pipes refer to programming for wall plumbing, and likens ""fork"" to ""reproduction without sex"" when he hears my explanation of what ""fork"" means. He then tries to find answers in the useless textbook. When I ask him why he doesn't just search online (aka STACK OVERFLOW), he says ""I don't understand shit the internet says, it's all gibberish and no answers"". 

The best part was when I wrote a few snippets of C code, some with deliberate errors, and asked him to tell me ""which ones compile"". He then says ""I don't know what compile means"". 

He actually manages to pull off over 30% on this midterm, impressive considering his ""knowledge"" of the material, but a fail is a fail. 

For his repeat attempt at algorithms, Kevin still hasn't learned. He gets less than 10% on his midterm AGAIN and continues not to do his homework assignments. He actually passes his linear algebra midterm but still ignores graded homework. 

Towards the end of the second semester, Kevin suddenly panics when he realizes that since he's on probation, and has little chance of getting his cumulative GPA above 1.50/4 (a pathetically low threshold), he will be suspended for one year if a miracle doesn't happen. An academic suspension will prevent him from obtaining further student loans, which essentially means he's kicked out of school unless he wins the lottery or something. 

Kevin decides to take a shot at doing his last assignments for systems programming, algorithms, and linear algebra, but to no avail. Since he doesn't understand my attempts to explain the material, I advise him to take advantage of paid tutoring services on campus (about $20-$30/hour with experts who can explain better than I can). He immediately refuses and says that ""losing face by hiring a tutor is unacceptable"". 

For the systems programming course, Kevin's luddite nature bites him again. I don't quite remember why, but for some reason he physically wasn't able to reach the computer labs before his last assignment was due. I told him to act like a normal student and learn how to set up a local environment or at least set up remote SSH access, but he refused, saying it was ""too much effort"". Then he opens up Notepad and writes bullshit code in there, without the benefit of any syntax checking or color coding, and obviously he does not test it. He literally hands in this garbage. I feel sorry for the TA who had to see it.

Needless to say, Kevin fails everything spectacularly and is now on the hook to pay back a little over $30k in student loans while being financially unable to continue. 

**Post University**

It's been three years since Kevin failed out. His parents are living paycheck to paycheck to pay off his student loans for him on top of their mortgage. Kevin hasn't spoken to me or anyone he knew in high school or university since he failed out. His parents told me he shuts himself in his bedroom all day, doing who-knows-what on the computer, coming out only for meals and to use the toilet/shower. He's essentially become a NEET, a parasite single, and a hikikomori, all at the same time (ironically, he taught me the latter two words). His parents gave up trying to persuade him to get a job.

72hq8f,6,2017-09-25,My Ndad: A Complete History,zingbeebee,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/72hq8f/my_ndad_a_complete_history/,"I wanted to share some choice memories from childhood going into adulthood and issues that are still ongoing in the hopes that maybe others in this thread have had similar experiences and can shed some light how I can cope. It would be an understatement to say that I have a ""difficult"" father. And it's complicated by the fact that I can't quite separate what stems from his cultural upbringing (our family is Asian) and what is caused by his own psychological issues- or whether our culture is complicit in normalizing his behavior. It's frustrating to explain to people who have a psychologically normal upbringing because they frequently rationalize that my dad's behavior and actions may be unwelcome but come from a place of good intent and that I should therefore be patient and forgiving. It's hard to know where to start, except to do so chronologically, from my earliest memories. 

Thinking back to when I was young, whenever my mom punished me, she had a reason for it and it was clear what my wrongdoing was. I obviously did not enjoy being punished but I could understand her rationale for doing so. My father's punishments were oftentimes for having a ""bad attitude"", which was his way of discouraging any kind of conflicting opinion or negative mood that I had. And when I cried out of frustration during punishment he would tell me that he wouldn't let up with whatever it was (most of the time it consisted of kneeling in a corner or against a wall) until I could show him a smile. He would check periodically to see if I could ""show him a good attitude"". It taught me that how I appeared on the outside and whether that suited him was more important to him than what my feelings really were. My mom's and my behavior always had to be perfect near him. He would get angry whenever either of us expressed our unhappiness with whatever situation we were in or decision he made. He never allowed me to express any emotions that were negative because they were unbecoming to him. Add that to the Asian concept of ""saving face"", ""filial piety"", obedience to authority figures and not shaming or embarrassing your family by behaving defiantly towards my father as head of the household...all this created a very oppressed childhood. 

No one could ever challenge my father's decisions without repercussions. I always wanted to defend my mom when he was berating her or they were arguing if I felt like she was being wrongfully accused, but I could never do so without risking him flying into a rage at both of us. Similarly, my mom couldn't get in the way of his disciplining me, even if she disagreed with the reason why he was punishing me in the first place. Once, he was berating my mom for not doing his laundry, and I piped up asking him why couldn't he just do his own laundry? and he took me to his sister's house and screamed at me in front of everyone about how ungrateful and disobedient I was. I was at least 13 at the time. 

My father constantly monitored my mom's and my actions (he still monitors hers); he needed to know where we were at all times and would call us every couple of hours to check on us. My mom was rarely able to spend time with her family, or her friends alone without him. One time when he got into an argument with my mom, she went out to shop and ignored his phone calls for about two hours. I was home at the time, with my grandmother (his mother). He threw a fit and hurled a chair against the door out of anger, breaking it. My grandmother stood up for him saying he was just frustrated (what kind of fucking culture justifies this behavior in front of children? Suffice to say I hate a lot of elements of Asian culture and I can't quite figure out if it is because my family has just twisted it and it has unfortunately informed my construct about what normal Asian families are like). I also remember him throwing a chef's knife at a metal door so forcefully it stayed lodged in it. That day I was worried that when my mom came home he would hurt her. But he has never been physically violent, just emotionally so. 

During one fight that my father had with my mom, when I was around 14 or 15, he came into my room and told me that my mom was a terrible person, and that if it weren't for the fact that she was good at taking care of me, he would have divorced her a long time ago. He said that since he made everyone move to Taiwan from the US (it was only ever his decision, my mom hated moving away) my mom had had a disrespectful and unloving attitude towards him. He also said that if she ever stopped caring for me properly, he wouldn't hesitate to keep her out of our lives. He also told me that he was the one who prevented her from aborting me, that she didn't want to have me. My parents had me when they were relatively young at 24 and 25. They both had intended to travel to the US for graduate studies, but since my mom got pregnant with me he and his family forbid her from going to school and she spent her time taking care of me instead, when she wasn't acting as his lab assistant (she has worked for him both unofficially and officially since his graduate student days to his professor days now). Even at the time I didn't feel resentful towards my mom even if it was true (in her position I would have walked away from it all), I just felt sad that I had trapped her in the miserable relationship that they are still in today. I think it's a combination of Asian culture and her lack of security that keeps her in the relationship, as well as the threat of him should she leave. Divorce is very shameful in Asian culture and back when her parents were still alive, my dad kept her in line by threatening to complain to her parents about what a bad wife she was. She didn't want her parents to feel sad that she was in a miserable marriage, so she did as much as possible not to have him contact them. He constantly involved other members of his family in harassing her and her family as well (having an uncle call her parents to tell them to educate their daughter to behave more properly). Also, since she never formally had job experience, took a long break to raise me as a homemaker, and then only worked under him as a lab assistant, at this point she feels like it would be impossible for her to find a job that could make her self-sufficient. In her own words, she has resigned herself to living like a parasite off of him however shitty he and his family are to her. He has essentially isolated her from everyone. Even when her parents were dying, he would control the frequency and duration of time she could spend with them. When my grandfather was ill, my father made grand gestures of helping arrange his medical care, but it was all for show. 

All of the actions my father takes are, as my mom likes to put it, for show. He is very charismatic and has a lot of social connections; at the same time, he has estranged himself from most of his extended family with his behavior. At home he was never genuine. He would go through the motions but you could tell he was doing it so that to outsiders it would look like he was a doting father and doting husband. He would take my mom and me places and get us gifts but they were never what we wanted, or held any personal meaning, and he would paint our reaction as being ungrateful. He spent a lot of money and my mom would always be worrying and saying that she didn't need or want what he got her, but he didn't care, he just wanted to see us thank him and show to the world how caring he was. He never really considered who we were as individuals, what we liked, how we were like, because he had a construct of how he wanted us to be, and he only behaved towards us based on that construct. Expensive gifts and family excursions were always laced with the undertone that if anyone showed that they weren't really enjoying it, they would be punished. I remember this one time going through my closet full of old toys he had bought me over the years and others that I had gotten from other people, and giving my friend some toys that I didn't like as much when I was around 8 or 9. When he found out they were toys he had bought me he was enraged. He could interpret anything as an insult to his person- one time when we returned home after a trip to visit his in-laws, I pointed out that our home smelled funny, in a good way. It was my way of saying I liked being home, but he took it to mean our home was shit and I preferred being at my grandparents' home (who he disliked), and as a response he went and threw all of the magnets I had collected on the fridge into the trash. This happened when I was around 13 or 14. My mother mostly surrendered to this acceptance that we had to behave as he wanted us to, but as I got older I started defying him more. 

Ever since I was a kid my father had very specific expectations for me. I remember him enforcing the highest standards of academic performance not just from me, but from my teachers (he would berate them if I got poor grades, embarrassing me and alienating me from them). At one point he tried to teach me algebra when I was in elementary school and had no fundamental math concepts that I could build on to understand any of it, and when I couldn't solve any problems he got furious with me. But at the same time he believed that I was a genius, that I wasn't applying myself correctly, that if I just followed his directions I would succeed where he failed. He had wanted to be a doctor but did not get into medical school in Taiwan, and it was even more difficult to do so as an international student in the US, so he set that as a plan for me instead. I was in middle school when we moved from the US to Taiwan, there, he put me in expensive private international institutions so it would mean I would get admitted to an ivy league institution and medical school in the US. During this period he mostly left me alone to my own devices, and paid little attention to my grades (though they were never poor), and I had a little more freedom to do what I wanted without his involvement. There was minimal conflict partly because I never did anything other than go to school and stay at home on the computer with friends; it wasn't as if I got to go out all night or take trips elsewhere without him or anything that meant that he couldn't know what I was up to at any given point. I knew I had to not overstep what little freedom I had. In any case, this all changed when it came time for me to apply to college, and that was when he promptly stepped in and started telling me what I should do. We had constant disagreements about what schools to apply to because he felt like I needed to apply to all of the Ivies and that I had a real chance at them, whereas I knew what I was capable of and had set targets and schools that were still top 50. I applied to a number of schools that I knew I wasn't going to get accepted at just to get him off my back and was accepted at personal first choice; rejected from all the schools he had wanted me to attend- I got a real satisfaction out of this. 

Before college, whenever I would ""discuss"" (I use that term loosely because I doubt it they could really be considered discussions) with him what I might want to do in the future, he would always shoot down my ideas and tell me that he had a better idea of both what the career outlook was like and also my personal aptitude and that the only respectable and successful career for me was medicine. Never mind where my interests lay, be they fashion design, graphic design, or anything else.  In a sense, I lucked out because I did have an aptitude for and interest in science- specifically, biology, and when I was applying to US colleges I told him that I wanted to be a biology major, that I did have an interest in medicine, that it was something I could entertain as a possibility. I never passionately wanted to be a doctor. I had a brief period where after I read Atul Gawande's books I was obsessed with surgery. But I was never the type that had the ambition and drive to get through the blood and sweat becoming a physician would entail, nor the altruistic desire to help other people that would motivate me. I feel like at the time, my main objective was to get as far away from home as possible, and I was too scared of my father to express any different, and it felt like my interest in biology was a sort of ""get out of jail free card"" that meant that I could meet him in the middle with the idea of becoming a doctor but not commit to it fully (teenage thinking). My father's interpretation of this was that I had essentially made a promise to him that if he sent me to college in the US (he paid for my tuition and expenses) I would be getting my education in order to get a medical degree. Later on when I ""rescinded"" this promise by telling him that was not the path I was taking and I was not applying to medical school, he was furious with me, saying that he had put himself in debt over my education from private middle and high school to college, that he would have never let me go to the US to study if he knew that I didn't have the intent to follow through with his plans, that he regretted ever raising me in the US and giving me the wrong values, that my mom had failed to raise me right. He treated me like he had invested in me and I had failed to produce what I had promised. His support of me was always conditional- I needed to behave and perform as he desired, or else I and my mom would both suffer. And because I was not allowed to get a job in high school (I had a job in college that I had to hide from him because I should have been studying), I couldn't imagine securing my own funding for college. I had no credit history, and neither did my parents. At that point I had been made so fully dependent on my family that while academically I kept up as much as my peers, emotionally I was far behind. 

Being in college gave me a good deal of distance with which I could relieve myself from the pressures I felt from being under my father's control (though he would get enraged whenever I suggested he was trying to control my actions and decisions). But it didn't mean that he didn't try to maintain some semblance of influence over my actions. When I matriculated to my college, both my parents came with me to move me in. It was a week before classes were to start, and I was attending a week-long orientation tailored to international students to get them acquainted with people from similar backgrounds in the hopes of making the transition a bit less overwhelming. Throughout the orientation when I was supposed to be meeting new people and familiarizing myself with the environment, he constantly pulled me away so we could spend time together. He said that he felt like I was distancing myself from them, even though I was literally trying to figure out how to navigate college life and college relationships. I missed a lot of bonding events that were not ""required"" because of this, and the ""required"" events that mostly consisted of awkward icebreaker activities were useless at making real friends. I was by nature very shy and socially awkward, and I felt like this set the precedent for me feeling isolated from my classmates throughout my college career. Of course I myself am partially to blame, but I always felt like if I had been able to know more people and gain more confidence during that time where everyone was in a frenzy to make friends because everyone was in the same boat, I would have met more people that ended up being close friends. I also remember a particularly trying night where I was attending a movie on campus, and my dad called me, and I told him I was at a movie and he threw a fit at the fact that instead of studying I went out to watch a movie. When I disagreed with him and told him there was nothing wrong with it and that I was going to continue watching so I couldn't talk to him, he repeatedly kept calling me and eventually left me a barrage of angry voicemails reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's voicemails to his daughter. All over the fact that I was watching an ON CAMPUS movie hosted by the FILM CLUB on ONE night (I wasn't even at a house party like most of my peers were). 

The more time I spent away from the environment that my father had created, the more painful it became to go back. I tried filling my vacations with extra courses so I wouldn't have to go home and graduated a semester earlier than my peers. I didn't even want to attend my own graduation because it meant that I had to deal with seeing my father again. My suspicions were confirmed when during graduation, instead of telling me how proud he was of me that I had graduated sooner and saved a semester's worth of private college tuition, that I had been working at an internship turned job in a similar field that would be a valuable part of my resume, he expressed how disappointed he was that I had not chosen to complete a senior thesis like most of my biology major soon to be medical or graduate school peers did. At one point during his time here for my graduation, he had a tantrum in the car while he was driving me and my mom as passengers where he threatened to crash. His frustrations that I wasn't applying to medical school led to him going through cycles where he would go into telephone rants at me about how much he disagreed with my life choices, then apologizing and trying to reason with me to change my mind, to forgetting about my decision and attempting to convince me to apply to medical school (""It's never too late""), to getting infuriated with me again when I declined. After a time, he gave up on trying to convince me to go to medical school and instead tried to convince me to apply to a PhD program. Any PhD program would do; he knew much better than I did what job prospects were like for people holding doctorates in every field, he knew what I was capable of much better than I did, it didn't matter that I was happy in my chosen field, or happy in my career path, or that I knew I would be miserable in a PhD program, none of that fit in with his expectations of me and of how the world worked. 

This also reared its ugly head when it came to relationships. I didn't dare date when I was at home with my father, not that I would have wanted to because I thought all Taiwanese men and Taiwanese families were like mine. When I went to college and got a boyfriend, naturally I kept it from him. It was normal that he would react with a degree of rejection, but what wasn't normal was how long it persisted. He hated that my boyfriend had a GED (he makes as much as I do in a job that usually only hires college grads and is largely self-taught). He hated that I had chosen someone so opposite of his values of higher degrees as the only model for success in life. And he thought that my boyfriend was corrupting me, that my peers were corrupting me, that my coworkers were corrupting me with their mediocrity and lack of ambition. He couldn't accept that I was making my own decisions, that my values about education, happiness, success, and job security were not the same as his, so he chose my boyfriend as the scapegoat. He told me that he would never accept my boyfriend regardless of how capable or successful he was, because he was not educated. As for me, I didn't pick a ""piss off my dad"" rebel boyfriend, I picked someone that I was genuinely impressed with because of his initiative, his ability to take alternate paths to get the same results, his support of my choices, his family. Because what stood out to me was that his parents were the polar opposite of my dad, that they were unconditionally supportive (sometimes to a fault), that they allowed him to make mistakes and loved him in spite of them; whereas my dad's life goal was to prevent me from making the decisions that he time and again saw as major mistakes. 

On that aspect, long story short, I married that boyfriend. And my father doesn't know (my mom does). I have kept much of my life concealed from him in an effort to protect myself, my mom, and my husband. Every one of my successes my father has seen as a failure. He might sing praises about me to his acquaintances, but I never hear any of it. Each one of the decisions I have announced to him have been met with a ""that is a mistake, you should do this instead"". So simply put, I have chosen not to participate in this relationship any more than I have to. He doesn't know I am married, and have been for a long time. He doesn't know what joys there are in my life, or my hopes or dreams. He doesn't know I bought a house, which should be one of the happiest things a parent can enjoy with a child. He's not a part of anything that makes me happy or sad. Because I know that he will take whatever he knows and twist it into a thing that can hurt me. But that is not the main thing that keeps me from just telling him everything and demanding that he either treat me better or risk being cut off from my life. Because my mom is still stuck with him out of her own inability to free herself of her situation. And everything I do that he is dissatisfied with I fear he will take out on her. I live with a true fear that one day all of those times that he yells, that he throws and destroys things, that he makes threats, they will lead to him actually carrying through and causing her some serious harm. Especially if this is the way he reacts to trivial things, what would his potential be for going out of control if he directly challenged with the reality that he so vehemently denies and rejects?

My only saving grace is that I have hundreds of miles of land and sea in between us. And for the most part I feel that despite all of the tantrums that he has thrown and the hurt that he has caused in me, I have defended my way of life in the sense that at the end of the day I am living the life I want and heading towards goals that are uniquely mine and not his (which I can’t say for many other children from Asian backgrounds). But I can’t help feeling marred and burdened by his existence and how it threatens my mom’s and mine. I can’t help feeling robbed of the right to not worry when he calls, to not walk on eggshells and anticipate how he might react, to not have to talk to my mom in secret out of fear that he will be jealous of our relationship and use her to channel his wishes for me. I get nightmares after we have phone conversations, and the thought of going home gives me anxiety. I put off trips home with excuses so I don’t have to see him more than absolutely necessary. 

The more experience I get in interacting with people and in living life, the less respect I have for my father and his behavior. He is the amalgamation of the world’s worst customer, and I am not exaggerating with this. Whenever we spend time together we are mostly going to restaurants or events, and there has not been one instance where he has not treated service staff with utter disrespect. His condescending attitude often changes to aggression and threats when his special requests aren’t met. He feels pride at “gaming the system” and getting special benefits after haranguing customer service. He expects everyone to make accommodations for him, oftentimes making last minute changes to plans to keep people on their toes and to make them prove that they will bend over backwards for him. He accuses those who he sees as disrespecting him as being racist. It is mentally draining to spend time with him in public because his behavior embarrasses me and I don’t want to be associated with such a rude person, yet I have to maintain the “obedient daughter” façade so that my mom won’t have to spend hours afterwards listening to his rants about me (and about how much he hates my “boyfriend” for brainwashing me). When it is only a couple of days long I put up with it because I remind myself that it is a small sacrifice for almost full years of not having to deal with him other than on the phone or on skype periodically. As much as I would like to cut him off or force him to face reality I feel like the former action would push him to be unstable and the latter action would never work because he would just cycle back into self-denial. So I am stuck in a bind until either he or my mom passes away (for reference, they are in their 50’s and I am in my late 20’s), so there is a while to go.  

TL;DR my father might be an ndad and here is an account of all the shit he’s done to me so if I ever see a therapist I can have them read this instead of spending the first five sessions establishing a background. Also, if anyone sees an alternative out of this relationship please tell me. Maybe I have blinders on from years of dealing with this.

72htor,2,2017-09-25,I [22 M] feel like my relationship with my roommate who I have a crush on [22 F] is growing more distant.,sange_,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/72htor/i_22_m_feel_like_my_relationship_with_my_roommate/,"Probably need to preface this post with we are both college students and I am male, my roommate is female and I currently have a crush on her for a long time now.

I've lived with my roommate for almost three years now and over these three years we've become close friends. Especially this last year since we moved into a small two bedroom apartment. There was never really any sort of flirting or interest in a relationship with me just becoming close friends. During the summer she went on an internship while I was taking summer classes. During that time we kept talking a little and mostly communicated through snapchat. Half way through communication with her pretty much stopped, just one or two snaps a day.

Shes now back from her internship but she feels kind of different than before. She feels more distant towards me, and shes been keeping her door closed when she is home rather than open which is what was normal for the past two years. She also is continuing the trend of not snapchatting me as often as before the internship. This whole snapchat bushiness may seem trivial and stupid, but before the internship it was pretty regular for us to be sending snaps back and fourth for the whole day and we even got an icon that indicates that we snapchat each other the most often for two months. Today she broke our streak, which is odd to me since she is the type to care about the streak.

All of this is making me anxious and depressed. I am just wondering did I do something wrong? Am I just being too paranoid that all of this is really nothing? Is she avoiding me for some reason? Has she caught on that I like her and is avoiding me? All these questions are really making my life miserable right now. I mean I haven't talked to her at all yesterday and today, like not even a single conversation. It makes be think back to all the things I've said and done and I wonder if that was the thing that started this. I am still interested in a relationship with her, but right now I just want my best friend back.

What should I do? Should I do nothing? Confess to her? Just deal with it and move on?

**TL;DR** Communication with a close female friend I have abruptly stopped over the summer. Shes back and seems distant and we don't talk as often as we did. Making me completely depressed. 

I've also posted this on /r/offmychest so I'm sorry if that's against the rules, I just really need someone to talk to and some advice right now. "
72huqq,29,2017-09-25,"Me [23F] with my friend[25F] of 1 year, whose wedding I will be in, things are tense and I don't know what to do",mythrowawayforhelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/72huqq/me_23f_with_my_friend25f_of_1_year_whose_wedding/,"I have had this friend for just about one year now. We are in the same grad school program, we finish in December. 
She and I are about 0% alike. I am really immaterial, a bit of an introvert, take school really seriously, absolutely love my degree and put great pride into my work. Not a ""live in the moment"" kind of girl. She is material, loves to party, gets excited (and upset) easily, and is really happy-go-lucky. We hit it off really well at the beginning of the program despite the fact that we were opposites. I love to dote on my friends. Buy them gifts, drop everything to do favors, give lots of verbal encouragement and also harsh advice when necessary. I gave her a lot of this affection at the beginning of the friendship, as I do everyone. She got engaged on a trip that I took with her and her fiance, which I helped make happen. She asked me to be a bridesmaid! I was very excited. I have never been a bridesmaid because most of my friends are like me - won't get married until late in life, career above all, etc.

But now things are tense between us. I've noticed that she isn't all that great of a friend. I see her take no actions that mimic all I have done for her, except for her being annoyingly fake chipper. She used to love to celebrate my accomplishments with me, but now she seems upset that the company who rejected her last year is now headhunting me. I have been hanging out more with some other people due to the fact that I am job hunting along with a few individuals. She landed a job from her internship this summer, so she isn't spending all her time doing the same things we are doing. This process is intense. She now spends a lot of time wedding planning and talking/being with her mom. No problem, of course, but I'm not very involved in either of those things. Her mom hates me. And she doesn't like my opinions on flowers, photography, etc. Which she has blatantly stated to me. 

Now things feel like high school drama. Our typical friend group is getting really frustrated with her, but I feel like I have to keep the peace since I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. But she is constantly irking me, and I have never had to put up with someone like her before.

As an example of my frustrations with her, our normal friend group invited her to dinner after class. She turned us down to eat with her mom, and said she wanted to meet up with us after. At dinner we brought up that we wanted to see a scary movie, which the 4 of us at dinner had been planning for weeks. We called her to say, ""hey, Movie starts at 830!"" and she says that we should have known better than to pick something she won't see. We had no idea she would refuse to see a scary movie. She pouted and said ""fine, you guys do what you want, but i dont appreciate you all going to dinner without me and then purposely picking a scary movie i can't watch."" she has very fragile feelings so we ended up just going to one of the friend's houses instead. it was pretty boring, and she kept making comments about how we were acting boring to her. and she kept asking us to tell her everything we talked about at dinner because she felt left out.

This is a small example. Imagine this behavior round the clock, all in what used to be a great friend group. How do I keep the peace to not mess up her wedding? The friend group says I should be the one to say something to her, but this is just her personality. Nothing I say will change her behavior. We are in a super tight-knit grad program as well, which only complicates things. If we piss her off, there will be hell to pay in the classroom. Our degree is nearly 100% group project based. 

I know how I would handle this in the workplace, but I've never invited this kind of drama into my personal life, and don't know what obligations I have here. What do I do?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My kinda-spoiled close friend is showing her true colors and our friend group is getting frustrated. I am supposed to be in her wedding, what do I do?"
72i56b,25,2017-09-26,My life has forever been changed by The Simulation Hypothesis.,Coolwhipyyy,AWLIAS,https://www.reddit.com/r/AWLIAS/comments/72i56b/my_life_has_forever_been_changed_by_the/,"I've always entertained myself with the desire to know, that unwavering curiosity to learn. This might be the first time I've filled my curiosity to the brim. I think this is the first time in my life I've reached my existential breaking point. 

For the past week (waiting to start my internship into cyber security) I've been obsessed with this hypothesis. I just can't even put my mind at rest. I've read so many thought provoking arguments here that I don't even know what to do with myself. I honestly just want to let all my thoughts out.

The parallels between Quantum mechanics, Arbitrary constants/limits, the similarities between frame rates and the Planck Length, The Fermi Paradox, Dark Matter, Dark Energy,  the astronomical chance the moon perfectly aligns with the sun... How well this connects the singularity....

I've never considered myself to be ""spiritual"" or to believe in a higher power but these statistics, these similarities just make me ponder what it means to be alive. What it means to be able to have this exact conversation with you right now. For a brief moment in my life I'm starting to really realize how remarkable everything is and I truly hope this feeling lasts... and I'm not trying to sound preachy here-  I'll quote u/slaterslum here:


""The odds of this universe existing at all, given the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant, are beyond absurd on their own. You can then compound that absurdity by calculating the odds that a planet within a particular solar system can sustain life, the odds that that life can persist against asteroid belts and assaults from space, the odds that that life will evolve into multicellular organisms, the odds that language will radically alter life on the host planet (I skipped a bunch of evolutionary watersheds, but there's a ton of similar examples), etc.
We are a rare event that occurred within a subset of reality that resulted from a previous rare event that occurred in a similar context, probably 30 times over until you get to the Big Bang. That's a lot of rarity on top of rarity. You'd probably be more likely to win the power ball 500 times in a row or something like that.
Among life, multicellular organisms are absurdly rare. Among multicellular organisms, mammals are absurdly rare, and all the way down. Primates are absurdly rare mammals. There are dozens more species of monkeys than there are primates. And only one of those has culture and language. Among that species, currently 7 billion strong, I'd guess that less than a billion (maybe as few as 600-800 million) have regular access to the Internet and social media, which is virtually nothing compared to the total human population. And out of all of those compounded rare events, we just so happen to be sitting here, talking about singularities and simulations, when we're far more likely to be a clump of space dust two billion light-years from here.""


 I've read some extremely breath-taking debates here and even coming to appreciate the skeptics. I never really gave myself the time to properly entertain this theory. I always thought of it as a fun thought experiment but it wasn't until recently that I've really started to stop and think. 


Perhaps I'm part of something greater, a deep nested root that never seizes to stop growing, something far beyond my greatest comprehension, a machine so complex not even the brightest human minds could begin to explain it. Designed by a vast network of omnipotent artificial super intelligence's at a scale a human mind was never built to understand.

Perhaps my most beloved memories, thoughts and experiences will dissipate into darkness as time continues to ebb and flow. Uninterrupted by this chaotic soup, brewing with countless possibilities   that my mere monkey brain will forever fail to understand. 

I just frankly don't know. I've followed this stuff for so damn long that I'm starting to find myself in this grey limbo land. I think this is the closest I've ever gotten to an answer but I believe this is where my pursuit ends. (for now, although I'll always remain on the lookout for new innovations)

I've read so many damn remarkable things in these past few days that it really makes me stop and think how beautiful everything is regardless of if this is some spectacular illusion or something very real. 

From the spiritual DMT user, to the optimistic simulation supporter and all the skeptics between. 

You have all brought me to tears.

soon graduating student (Computer Science - Web Development specialization) here. I have recent studies in Web Security (obviously basic level, as much as you can learn in a semester) and I wondered if you guys and girls out there could recommend me a company where I could do my internship (2018 Spring intake), and deepen my knowledge to be a penetration tester/ethical hacker. As far as I experienced there's not many company has such offer as they don't really want to invest into newcomers but hire those with professional skills, but I was like it might worth to try my luck and ask you folks here. I'm an EU citizen and looking for an intern position/training program preferably in London/UK but I'm opened for any opportunity. Thank you for your help and feedback, appreciated."

We met overseas and so have always been dating while living in separate towns. My issue is that I'm studying a post graduate medicine degree in a large city, and he is working as a dentist down in a small coastal town (relevant as it is a fairly re-locatable profession - he doesn't own the practice).


Because I'm still studying for the next 2 years, I can't move to live with him. I have my placement in this large city next year, and then in a different state for my final 4th year. Then when I graduate, as an intern, I will probably move back to this large city I am in now as there are plenty of internship positions here. As we have been dating for a year, I am wanting to get slightly more serious. Not in terms of marriage or children (that isn't on my cards right now) but I would like to have conversations about living together eventually.


My boyfriend says he doesn't know what he wants. He says he's focused on his career at the moment and is learning a lot living in a regional town (which I support him with and is fair) but then says he never wants to live in the major city I am in (which is an issue for me) and further that he doesn't really know what he wants. We have been on an overseas trip together and while we were together there I told him that I loved him, and I still do. He said it back. But when I said it again later on he stopped reciprocating and then said he isn't ready to say it. He says ""I think I love you"" and that we need more time together.

Lastly, he mentioned that the catch 22 for him was if he broke up with me he probably would end up moving to this city so he could find a girlfriend...

  **tl;dr**: My long distance boyfriend is not giving me any reassurance about our relationship and does not say 'I love you' despite saying it a couple of times before. I would like things to progress but I don't know what to do. He mentioned that the catch 22 for him was if he broke up with me he probably would end up moving to this city so that he could find a girlfriend as he lives in the country. "
72ivy8,2,2017-09-26,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/72ivy8/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts

1) You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.

2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower.

3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”.

4) A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc… Or if you prefer we can reverse roles and a young boy gets his first massage etc... 

5) Private tutoring for a young girl

6) You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something…. For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character.

If you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion! I will be at work but mostly availaible all day with the exception of 1 hour here and there. If we click I would like this to be long(er) term. 


Kinks: Cumplay, age play, lingerie, instructions, oral (giving/receiving), other vanilla-ish stuff


Limits: The usual, scat, gore, violence, rape, death, futa, furry, group, etc"

72jf0j,1,2017-09-26,"Has my Ex lead me on, or is she just freaking out, or something else?",quick201290,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/72jf0j/has_my_ex_lead_me_on_or_is_she_just_freaking_out/,"A tiny bit of background here (so many more details I could give, but this'll do): We met at uni, she's 21, I'm 26, she's never had a boyfriend before, never been on a date, never been kissed etc. I'm her first for everything, she's quiet yet confident, rarely parties, her sister's her best friend (besides me), she does A LOT with her family, most times she goes out is with her family, she doesn't really interact with any other guys besides those at uni and her boss's sons (both have girlfriends, so don't go there), hmmm...what else? She's very indecisive, stresses a lot, and I think that's it. That may have sounded very negative, admittedly it was, but I really care for her, she's the nicest girl I've ever met, felt the closest to her then any other girl I've been with, we've shared so many memories together, make fun of each other, our relationship was good an everyone saw that. All of that was just to give you a little background.

Anyway, we broke up just over a month ago. She's the one who ended it, understandably I didn't want it to be over and I was a bit of an emotional wreck afterwards. There was this guy who was obsessed with her at uni (he was a creep) and he said something like ""if you don't want to be my girlfriend, I wouldn't want to stay friends with you"", I said I don't blame him, and I'd do the same. So when we broke up I hesitantly said I'd stay friends, but if either of us found someone else I don't think it'd be such a great idea to stay friends, I also said (and made it clear) that if things become good between us again, relationship-wise and we gave things another go then that would be good, if not then sobeit. So I made it clear that yes we'd stay friends, but also left that option open for something more. OK, moving forward, a week after we broke up, she tagged me in a Facebook post, it was some post to do with an inside joke of ours, I liked it and replied, that was good, I was pretty happy. There was no direct contact for at least another week or two, I may have tagged her in something as a sort of dumb 'courtesy' for tagging me in something, anyway we have a group chat on Facebook and snapchat with our uni friends, and it seemed like she was trying to reach out to me that way, I'd responded to something she sent and then there'd be a back and forth between us, no one else in the group contributing. And we come to now, well the last two weeks (besides this week); snapchat stories: she is someone who hates people responding to something in her snapchat story ""they're for everyone to see, no need to respond"", yet she started responding to my snapchat stories, ""I love that song"", and then starting long conversations over snapchat, even cute goodnight messages. Maybe a day or two here and there over the past couple of weeks there was nothing from her, but when there was something, it's been a long conversation (hours), talking about anything and everything, each other's lives, family, hobbies, uni etc. the first 2-3 days had some cute stuff in the messaging like how we talked when we were together. All the other days weren't as cute, but still friendly, still joking with each other, still saying goodnight. So Friday just gone was a bit different, we were talking a group chat in snapchat, we were pretty much just talking to each other, no one else was really contributing, then she sent me a direct message on snapchat saying ""I thought I'd move the conversation here, they might get annoyed"", and like all the other times we had a really good, long conversation, and now since Friday, nothing.

This is an edit, I left it out, but thought it was worth noting, so I thought I'd slot it in here: we were both doing a 10 week internship, which just finished on Friday, which is our last thing for university, and it's been incredibly stressful and we broke up halfway through this internship - don't know how much that added, but any context and background should help.

This might sound like I'm some deluded conspiracy theorists, and hey I could be, but I have a suspicion that one of our mutual 'friends' could be manipulating her, this 'friend' most people know I don't like her because she's manipulated our relationship in the past (before we were together), I know my ex has been in contact with her because they're going to a concert together and they've been tagging each other in facebook posts, the odd thing there though is we've talked about how much this girl annoys us and how much of a spoiled brat she is, so this 'best buds' friendship they've got going on now is weird.

I sent her a couple of snapchats today because we hadn't talked since Friday (when everything was good), and she didn't respond, then for some reason I checked her Instagram and she deleted a picture of us, don't know if that was today or not, or sometime between Friday and now, but that's really strange considering how well things have been going between us. The things we'd been talking about, if people read the messages, they'd think we'd be close to getting back together. Yet the no contact since Friday, snapchat today and Instagram would suggest otherwise. Right now I'm fairly pissed off, for one reason it feels like I've been lead on, she's the one who reached out to me in the first place after the break up and initiated the contact, and two what's changed all of a sudden since Friday, has this 'friend' of ours been manipulating her and putting thoughts in her head because this 'friend' doesn't like me? Who knows? And my ex isn't the sort of girl to come out and tell me her feelings or what she's thinking, she'll just leave me guessing until I say or do something. 

The thing is I was almost over her and ready to move on and then she reached out to me, and now she's just stopped contacting me since Friday. What do you reckon's going on? Do I just leave it as no contact and wait for her to reach out again, and if she does reach out again should I say something, if so what?

Sorry if that was long and a bit abrupt, I'm just frustrated and needed to vent and get things off my chest.

Thanks in advanced for any constructive, positive and helpful advice (I could really do without any negativity in my life at the moment). "
72jnvj,59,2017-09-26,Engineering Expo Tips,terrawp,OSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/72jnvj/engineering_expo_tips/,"Couple things to get you going, im sure others have some...

Stay cool when talking to reps. Show enthusiasm but not fan boy crazyness.

Bring some kleenex or hankerchief to wipe sweat off forehead right before you meet someone. Seriously, hot as shit and crowded.

Wear extra deodorent and bring mints. Seriously, hot as shit and crowded.

When they ask what rank you are, just tell them your expected graduation date, thats what they want. Not your life story and how you are basically a junior because of AP classes in high school.

Dont pretend you know everything, but rather that youve got a lifelong desire to learn and welcome feedback from experienced team members and peers. If thats not you, gtfo of engineering.

If you dont know what a company does, get off your candy crush and take 30 seconds to google the company so you can at least seem familiar with the reps company and show interest in working there. They arent there to create your interest.

Check out smaller companies, especially if first internship. Not everyone works for the giants, and they arent perfect, or no one would leave.

Good luck."

I am a junior midway through my third year in a STEM major at a fairly prestigious tech school. I made around $4000 this summer at an internship, but have been spending that money pretty much exclusively on dumb shit I didn't need because I wasn't aware that money was going to become a problem. Previous to starting the school year, my parents had said they would cover everything (tuition, rent, food, bills, etc.), so I viewed my summer income as ""for fun stuff"" money.

My sister(high school) has had some medical issue the past year or so, but I had assumed our insurance was covering it. I got a call a couple weeks ago from my parents saying that my sisters medical bills were much more than they had let on, and that we had exhausted most of our savings. They were calling to let me know that they were cashing some of the bonds they had bought for me when I was born that would have been my graduation present. In addition to that, my tuition, which had previously been paid out of pocket (plus some scholarships) is now being paid out of a 509 which will last me the rest of the year. 

I'm not upset about any of this, but it does put me in a bit of a bind. I now have about $2000 in savings and $500 in stocks to last me pretty much the rest of the year for groceries and other school related expenses. My parents have said they will still cover rent and bills, and have said they would try to help with groceries but I really don't know how much that will end up being.

I have been fortunate enough to have never had to worry about money before in my life, and so I'm sure I'm making lots of poor choices that I don't even realize are a problem. How can I make this money last for the rest of the year? I know groceries are the biggest problem, how can I minimize that cost?

Another issue is that I am studying abroad for 7 weeks starting October. I know things will be much more expensive in Italy, how can I minimize those costs without sacrificing my experience abroad?

What he’s saying doesn’t make sense. The words all do, sure, but it’s the meaning of it. You now belong to someone else?

Minutes ago, he rushed in the door and began to tell you that someone was going to publish his novel. His eyes were bright with the news that someone was going to help him achieve his life goal! This mysterious benefactor is even willing to pay your father a living wage while he edits and polishes it, which means he doesn’t have to rely on the slowly thinning customer base of his store. As the years have gone on, you’ve seen less and less of your father as he let go of employees one by one that he couldn’t afford to keep on. The stress and exhaustion has him looking 10 years older than he is.

This amazing news had a catch though, a big one. The rich man had seen you, and was immediately taken. When he approached your father, he already knew a lot, and had the terms of the deal already lined up. You tell your father he can’t possibly take the deal, and that’s when his eyes fall to the floor.

“It’s already done,” he tells you, the excitement slipping from his voice, “I signed the papers.”

You protest, standing up and stomping your feet. This is illegal!

“The contract was very thorough,” he says as sweat forms on his brow, “you’re going to be an intern of sorts. This will give you the best education, and opportunities I never could.”

Tears form in his eyes as you beg him to take it back. You clutch at his sweater, and he takes your hands in his. You can feel now how much he’s shaking.

“If I do, he’ll take away my funding. And- and he owns the shop. If I back out, he could take it away,” he says. “Please, do it for me.”

A knock at the door makes both of you turn towards it. Your father stands up a little straighter and informs you that the driver is here for you, ready to take you to your new life. He wraps his arms around you, hugging you tight to him.

“I’ll come visit if he lets me. I love you,” he says, kissing you on the forehead. He steps back, and nods towards the door.

I am looking for someone for a long term roleplay. I am as into the plot and world building as I am the smut. We can discuss some details before hand, or you can jump right in to things. While there’s definite dubcon elements, I think there’s still a lot of room for fun and some lighthearted parts. Perhaps you take to the lifestyle instantly, or maybe you need a firmer guiding hand.

As for ages, we can discuss that or just both decide in the moment. I wouldn’t want you to be younger than 13, or me older than 50.

My kinks are oral, anal, teasing/edgeplay, partially/clothed sex, dom/sub, rough sex, age gaps, public/risk of getting caught, name calling, light pain, group (preferably FFM), and a lot more. If it’s not listed, I am likely still open to it.

My limits are gore, scat, beastiality, futa, and rape."

A short series  / 6 episodes (15 min.) via Official LAFC Youtube Channel

The series would shot in the style of the office (Comedy)

 

The Premise: 

                   The series will follow ""Ricky"" who's actually friends with someone who works for   

                    Tony Robbins. ""Ricky"" bugs and bugs his friend to introduce him to Tony Robbins.

                   ""Ricky"" meets Tony Robbins and begs for a job (at LAFC) and sells Tony and how he

                    would be such  an asset to LAFC (Ricky lays it on thick). Tony, doing his

                 employee a favor, agrees to let ""Ricky"" become a ""Floater"" or like an ""Intern""

 

The series then follows Ricky as he ""helps""  the different departments at the LAFC

Front Office like Ticket Sales, Marketing, Soccer Operations, Venue / Events, Academy, he

even gets sent to the stadium construction site as the Front Office grows frustrated with him.

 

Every episode would be a different dept

 

The Goals Accomplished:

* Create an awareness of not only the club itself but on the work and movement the club is going through as it prepares for kickoff in 2018

* Give current members (Originals, 3252, and other SGs) a ""behind the scenes"" look at the operations of the club. This would help satisfy the appetite LAFC members and followers have for LAFC news and content as the club is not currently playing"

I'm his direct leader so I always discourage that kind of behavior and try to find projects he'd be interested in, still, no results.

Almost everyone in management disagrees with him staying after his internship period (6 months) ended. Still... I need to keep him ""cuz he knows people....""

Long story short I detonated the process of his leave as procedure mandates after 6 months of internship. Turns out he's related to someone from the board and I got scolded for ""not encouraging him enough"" and my leadership skills were seriously questioned. The rest of my team are very high-performing guys and girls, recognized by the whole organization but I might lose them all just because of this one guy.

I honestly don't know what to do, should I suck it up? am I really that crappy leader? I feel sad that I might let go 4 amazing guys and girls due to ""budget issues"" and keep the one that shows the poorest performance of all... -_-

72lqjf,2,2017-09-26,"I [21 M] am on a break with my girlfriend[21F] after 4-years. However, it's actually not the first time and, because of recent events, I need help thinking about whether to continue this relationship or not.",Leowee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/72lqjf/i_21_m_am_on_a_break_with_my_girlfriend21f_after/,"This might be a little long, but I will try to contextualize as briefly as I can.

I met her on the last year of year of high school and since then, we have been together for more than 4 years counting the time between these little breaks.

The main reason that she asks for a break (somehow often now) is because of my way of deal with things in life. 

* Usually, I am the kind of guy who somehow postpone a little of everything, especially what my brain doesn't feel it is urgent to do so. It just irritates her so much.

* I like to think that I'm similar to the man from *Simple Man* from Lynyrd Skynyrd song. Well, really simple.

* In general, according to her, I have a problem of incorporating her into my life (in a sense of not calling her enough to my family events or my friends) as well as having trouble being social and nice around her friends.

**All of this** is something she have being asking for me to improve since the beginning of the relationship.

In opposite to me, she often plan literally everything in her life and try to be ahead of every schedule.
 
* She is like what you would expect of a girl of my age: social, entrepreneurship's spirit-like, and wanting to do all of what live can offer to her.
 
* **Experimenting** things is her keyword, while **satisfied** would describe me best. 

* In general, I blame her for putting everything in life above me - like I'm her last option to do stuff and I sometimes feel more like a tool to have sex than actually her partner.


Usually, even with these differences, we get along pretty well in every other way. However, things started to take a bad course around February. She went over to study in Portugal for 6 months and, to make long story short, we actually break up on the first few days there because she wanted to ""*experimentate all* that life have to offer*"" (like kissing other guys/girls) and said that ""*it was an *unique opportunity* to do so"". To be more specific, I especially told her that I was not okay with this and it was Me or the other potential guys/girls and she stood her ground on the other ones.

At the ending of the trip, she started to get lonely and started messaging me again. She told me that wanted me back, etc - like nothing had ever happened - and she confessed she slept with a guy there. While she was there, she said it wasn't that good and reminded me while doing stuff with him (until this, we had only slept with ourselves in our lifes). After I questioned her here, she changed the ""not so good"" to ""it was different"" and ""somehow good"". I struggle with all of this, but still accepted.

Still on this discussion on the same day, I found out that she was actually marking a date at the house of some guy from her college (she was doing this since the break on Portugal). I obviously told her that we are dating again and would not want her to talk with him anymore.

Fast forward a month, she gets an internship on a company here and there was a another internship from her college there: **this very same guy!**
She reassures me that won't happen nothing and etc, etc.

One week after she starts working, she said to me Friday that she will go to a bar with some friends. That's actually something normal, but she stops responding to my messages at some point.
In the mean time, my best friend is from the same college and he said that there was a party in this bar. Well, that is different. There is gonna be people dancing and making out, not everyone sitted and talking about stuff.

Without talking too much for some days, she says to me that guy, the very same who I told her to get away from and worked with her, took her to the bus station and they kissed each other.

I forgave her and everything a little... but my trust just wasn't 100%. The trip was a month ago at the time and now this. It just wouldn't get up so quickly.


Since she came back, two months and a half, we haven't had a single date as a couple alone - everytime she tries to call me to go out with her friends together and stuff, but I'm not that sure about a lot of things. 

And now, we are here. After 3 weeks of fighting over related-stuff, she asked for a break for my way of dealing with stuff and not incorporating her enough in my life, so... I'm little clueless.

I got some social anxiety of sorts and I really hoped that she would take my hand and help through this, but I don't feel her passion to help me on this either.

So... I'm so confused by the recent events: *It's worth trying to improve myself alone only to be able to be ""worthy"" of her again, in spite of everything she did to me?* I forgave her, but I don't feel 100% of that trust is back again still.

I love her and feel really, really happy by her side, but I just don't know what to think anymore.

PS: I""m not a native English speaker, neither live on US if that is a thing, so sorry if there are some grammar mistakes.
PSS: Don't know which flair would better fit.


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: We are on a break now, especially for stuff she thinks I should improve, but recent events - such as cheating, and breaking my trust over time - questions me if I should try to improve, be ""worthy again"" and get back to her.

72m9pq,16,2017-09-26,R1D23,AdoptiveParent2,whole30,https://www.reddit.com/r/whole30/comments/72m9pq/r1d23/,"I am on my first round. I have 7 more days to go. I can say that these past 23 days have gone by very quickly and have not been anywhere near as difficult as I had anticipated. I have one week of busy work ahead of me, before I go on vacation.

I can tell you why I did NOT want to participate in this process when my spouse did his first round last year. Primarily, I don't believe in fad diets, and this is why. I was a raw food practitioner for many years, and knew very well the key players who have risen to prominence in promotion of their lifestyle. I became a raw foods chef and was immersed in the lifestyle. I was very passionate about my new beliefs. I saw some benefits, but then I began to lose weight. A lot. 
When my mother saw me for the first time, after I had been away on a college internship, she was taken aback. I had gone from being a very healthy athlete, 160lbs of solid muscle who could run 15 miles without a thought.
I came home for Thanksgiving, weighing only 120lbs (after 4 months). I was able to eat carrot and celery sticks. That's all. I could see the panicked look on my mother's face when she offered me mashed potatoes smothered in butter, and I rejected them. Surely I could allow myself this one indulgence, I could see her thinking. I didn't. I stuck to my guns and had the most miserable Thanksgiving dinner ever. 

My mother, who was a nurse, explained that my body had digested itself. I had starved myself and was withering away, a slow and silent death. Mostly, I felt isolated and separate from the people whom I really loved. They had a different belief system than I did, I thought. 

Then reality set in. Away from a core group of people, the raw lifestyle I had adopted became unmanageable. I began to incorporate cooked foods into my diet while living in Hawaii, a land of abundance. I even allowed myself to eat Mahi Mahi. It was a full two year period before I had regained the muscle and weight I had once had.

That is why I did not want to try Whole30, when my partner presented the idea to me, to try a round last year. I immediately rejected the idea for myself, but was supportive of him doing it. I am the cook in the household, so I agreed to make the food he'd need. I read the book and researched on line and began reading testimonies. I wasn't convinced, but was curious as he began feeling better and began losing weight. He had a pretty dramatic first round, losing nearly 20 lbs! He didn't starve himself, in fact the opposite. He ate very well. I made sure of it.

I have many other friends who said they had a good experience participating. I was still reluctant, but was willing, in the end, to give it a try. 

Here is why I WILL continue:

I have found this program to be very simple to adapt to a normal lifestyle. The foods are abundant in Portland, OR, where there are natural food stores in every neighborhood. I have had no problem finding the essentials. I didn't want to go to the store the second week in, and decided to use Thrive Market on line. It made it that much more simple to purchase the wonderful sauces and some of the snacks.

I will continue doing Whole30 going forward; occasionally allowing myself to partake in things not allowed on the program. Mainly, I love wine. I will plan my rounds after holidays or periods of celebration. Then I will maintain the lifestyle off round, by doing Monday through Friday on Whole30, then Saturday and Sunday I will be more lenient. That's the plan going forward. 

This last week will go by very quickly. I see the end in site. For anyone who is considering doing Whole30, I recommend it. It is much less difficult than you can imagine. It is challenging, but not impossible. I have had some cravings and have been tempted, but ultimately I knew what was at stake. Ultimately, I didn't want to let myself down! 

I am nearly there and am thankful for the support I have had. It is helpful to read other's experiences and get the upvotes of approval. Thank you all for helping me thus far!

72mo75,2,2017-09-26,I [22/M] cut contact with my ex [22/f] because she hooked up with a dude [25/M] who kissed her while we were still in a relationship. I want some advice on how to proceed.,World__Circus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/72mo75/i_22m_cut_contact_with_my_ex_22f_because_she/,"I broke up with my girlfriend of two years back in June, due to an impasse we couldn't get past. She told me she had an aversion to touch and didn't really like being touchy-feely (handholding, kissing, etc.), and I've been respectful of those wishes for the majority of the relationship.

Around April, I finally got a chance to see her since she was busy with school and internship work.  When I went to kiss her goodbye, she didn't want to even though she had been more comfortable with it around February. This is when I started to feel the strain of the relationship and admittedly got pushier with the physical intimacy, cumulating up until late June, where we broke up and I asked to cut contact so that I can get over my feelings for her and return back so we could be friends.

Here's the issue that I have. At the start of late April, she made a male friend at a party and got to talking and hanging out with him. I found out the day before we were supposed to meet to talk about our relationship, he kissed her while they were out. She pushed him away and got mad at him, but still continued to hang out with him, which made me really mad.

After a month, we met up again because we were going on a preplanned trip for a week, and on the last day I found out that not only had she'd been hanging out with the new friend, they had fooled around and got physically intimate the week before we left (I was assured that they didn't sleep together, since she didn't with me and her aversion to touch made her not want to have sex, but I question that on further thought). I got super mad at this since it took her months before she could kiss me properly, but only two for her new friend, about three weeks after our breakup. Consequently, I cut contact from her once we returned.

---
Additional Details:

-She's very interested in topics about sex, but has had no actual experience prior to our relationship. Additionally, her friend was described to me as being very promiscuous and into polyamory.

-She didn't give me any solid reason for if she wanted to breakup, just a bunch of ""I don't know""'s.

-I would've been accepting of the break up/being friends if she had given me a solid reason for our split (i.e. ""I'm not attracted to you"", ""I think you're annoying"", ""I'm not looking for anything serious at the moment"") but hasn't mentioned anything.

-We live about 30-45 mins away from each other by car. It's two different cities, where transit isn't as good as where I live.

-Her friend and my ex live closer than I do to her.

-I had to pry and push to find out if she actually did anything with her new friend, and took her a while before

-She has assured me that I was a very good boyfriend for the duration of the relationship, especially in regards to being patient and understanding of her issues.

-I've asked if she was physically attracted to the new friend and she was dodgy about the answer. I found out later from someone else that she liked it when the new friend commented on how her new choker looks provocative.

---
I want the subreddit to help me determine a few things:

-Am I justified in cutting contact with her? Should I reach out to her in the future?

-Is what she did was wrong?

-Did I deserve a proper answer for the breakup, or should I not have pushed for an answer?

Any general advice or comments would be appreciated. I understand that it's been a while between then and the post, but I haven't reached out to anyone about the matter and would like some solid understanding of what I should do next.

TL;DR Another dude kissed her the day before we broke up. In the three weeks we haven't talked, she hooked up with the guy while she gave me no solid answer as to why we broke up."

If you’re not aware, today is actually [Mesothelioma Awareness Day]( http://www.curemeso.org/site/c.duIWJfNQKiL8G/b.8578113/k.7E50/Mesothelioma_Awareness_Day__Mesothelioma_Applied_Research_Foundation.htm), so I figured this would be a pretty good way to raise awareness for mesothelioma. We’re not all geriatric smokers towing around our oxygen canisters!

* If you can believe it, this is the *short* version of my story. I've actually written almost an entire book about this, at this point, and the [Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation](http://blog.curemeso.org/) has been publishing my chapters as blog posts on their site. You can [get started with reading it right here,](http://blog.curemeso.org/part-1/) if you're interested. It's broken into readable/digestible chunks that actually work pretty well.

* I'd really love any constructive feedback you guys might have about it. My goal is to one day try to get it published, but I'm not sure if any publishers would take me seriously. What do you think? Interesting book? Garbage pulp-fiction? I honestly can't tell. Would you buy and read this book?

Anyway, back in March of 2016 – just a few short months after I got engaged to the love of my life – I was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma. What the hell is that, you might ask? It's a super rare cancer of the lining of the belly. Whenever you say, ""mesothelioma,"" everyone thinks lung cancer and asbestos exposure. It turns out that you can get mesothelioma from a variety of places in the body, and that the lung kind is just the most common and most strongly associated with asbestos exposure. I've never been exposed to asbestos, to my knowledge. I'm just a lucky guy.

-

For years leading up to the diagnosis, I'd have these weird episodes of vague abdominal pain and nausea. They'd usually go away on their own after a few days, or I'd feel better if I threw up, but the symptoms were so infrequent and non-specific that I didn't really think about it too hard. It didn't sound like any diseases I'd ever heard about, and I was a doctor, so I knew things, right?

-

Well, eventually it dawned on me that there was something more going on than just the stress of residency hurting my delicate feelings. I went to the GI doctors and they put a camera down into my stomach. They saw some inflammation in the esophagus (food tube), and they took a biopsy which showed eosinophilic esophagitis, which is basically asthma of the esophagus. So we had an answer, or so I thought. This was about a year before my actual diagnosis.

-

Over the course of that year, the episodes of pain got worse and worse, until one day I had focal pain and swelling in my right lower quadrant. I thought I was having appendicitis, so I went to the ER to get a CT scan, and that's when we found out something was wildly amiss. I had abnormal fluid (ascites) all throughout my belly, and there were abnormal masses along the lining of the abdomen, and my right colon was grossly thickened and irregular. It was the radiology equivalent of a dumpster fire.

-

So after a work-up that involved cameras down my throat *and* up my butt, we finally got the diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma. Here are some fun facts about peritoneal mesothelioma that you might not know: it exists. The average age at diagnosis is about 50-55. The life expectancy for people who can't get surgery is about 6-18 months. It's super rare, about one case per million people per year. There's a saying in medicine that goes, ""if you hear hoof beats, think horses not zebras."" Meaning, if someone has a common symptom, the diagnosis is probably pretty common as well. Peritoneal mesothelioma isn't a horse. It's not even a zebra. It's a freaking unicorn.

-

At the time, they didn't think I was a surgical candidate. They thought I had too much disease. But, sometimes the imaging doesn't 100% reflect the reality of the situation, so they put some cameras in my belly to take a look, and when they did that, there wasn't *quite* as much disease as they originally thought. They decided that I was, in fact, a surgical candidate. We'd try a two-step approach, where they'd take out as much as they could during the first surgery, but they leave in anything that would be too technically challenging to remove, or which would necessitate removal of an entire organ that they wouldn't really want to remove, like a stomach (very morbid procedure). Then, we'd do chemotherapy in the belly to try to shrink it, and then we'd go back for a second surgery a few months later to try to take out the rest of it. Before all of this happened, I used to say things like, ""I wouldn't let a surgeon touch me unless I were *literally dying.*"" So hopefully that will give you a sense of how serious this was, because more than anything else in the world, I wanted to go to surgery.

-

So we went to surgery, and they took out a bunch of stuff: spleen, distal pancreas, gallbladder, portions of the liver surface, half of my colon, all the lining of my abdomen, and all the masses they could get out. It took about 12 hours. Also during the surgery they did this thing called HIPEC, which is heated chemotherapy in the belly. The idea is that we can physically remove bulky, visible disease. The chemo is to take care of the microscopic disease that we know is there but can't see. It's heated so it penetrates the cells better. But even 12 hours wasn't enough time to get it all out. We'd have to save some for round two. There was a golf-ball sized nodule near my stomach that they had to leave it, because my surgeon was worried that if he tried to take it out, I'd end up losing my stomach. That's something you really don't want, for a variety of reasons.

-

Meanwhile, and even though we didn't know it for a few days, the chemo they used during the HIPEC was absolutely wrecking my kidneys. A few days after surgery, I went into severe acute renal failure. Normally, for an average man, your creatinine (a waste protein excreted by your kidneys) is about 1 mg/dL. If you were working outside and got heat stroke to the point that you needed to come to the ER, your creatinine might be 2-3 mg/dL, and something like that would probably buy you at least one night in the hospital. My creatinine eventually peaked above 10 mg/dL which is what we, in the medical field, call ""pretty fucking bad."" 

-

A few days into the hospital stay, I started dialysis and would be on that 3 times a week for about three months. Obviously, with dialysis, you need some way to get blood in and out of your body so it can get cleaned by the dialysis machine, so they placed what's known as a ""tunneled line."" Basically, it's a long-term IV in one of the big veins in your body, but then instead of coming out of the skin right where it goes into the vein, the tubing is tunneled under the skin (but outside of the vein) for a few inches so that it (1) doesn't come out right at your neck and (2) greatly lowers the chance of bacteria getting into the blood stream. People can have tunneled lines for months and occasionally years. Regular IVs only last a week or two at most, and are also way too small to use for dialysis.

-

I was in the hospital, in total, for about 10 days during the first surgery. About half of that was in the ICU. I could go into great detail about the nature of patienthood and hospital admission, but we'd never finish the overall story in a reasonable amount of time. [I write about this a lot in my book, though.](http://blog.curemeso.org/part-1/) Between the renal failure and all the drugs I was getting for pain, I was pretty loopy in the hospital and I remember having hallucinations and talking to people who weren't there and all of that fun stuff. But after about a week, things were getting better and I was just sitting around getting dialysis, which you can also do at an outpatient center. It was finally time to go home.

-

One thing they don't really tell you about the dialysis catheter is that it's a big honkin' hose, not some little peripheral IV tubing. You need to move a lot of blood during a short time, so you need a large caliber tube to do that. And the larger the caliber tube in your vein, the more chances for problems. Problems like blood clots. And I had basically all of the risk factors for blood clots, too: recent surgery, physical immobility, cancer, indwelling foreign body (the tube). The only one I was missing was pregnancy, which was good because I was in no shape to be pregnant, even if I wanted to be. So one day after dialysis, my arm and neck started getting tight and swollen: I had a blood clot in my neck and arm veins. 

-

So I went to the ER. They started treatment without getting any scans because it was such a slam-dunk diagnosis. They put me on a heparin drip, which is a blood thinner that works immediately, and started me on oral blood thinners that take a couple days to kick in. I already knew I was a lucky guy, but I found out that day what a unique and special snowflake I really am: turns out, heparin doesn't work on me. Nothing bad happens when I get it, it's just that *nothing at all* happens when I get it. So we wasted an entire day in the hospital figuring that out. I was in the hospital for a week just waiting for the oral blood thinner to kick in.

-

They finally let me go home from that one. Now, I was going to dialysis clinic every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings until about noon, and at least twice a week I'd also have to go to the anti-coagulation clinic to make sure my blood clotting times were in the therapeutic range. Not too thin, not too thick… just right. That's how we like our blood thinner levels.

-

Your whole identity turns into being ""a patient"" when you're in a situation like that. Keep in mind that the surgery was at most 2-3 weeks prior to all of this. My surgical wound wasn't even close to being healed. I could still barely walk around a Bed, Bath, and Beyond without having to take a few rest stops on the display furniture they had set up. For months, I felt like my life was nothing but feeling vaguely bad and going to doctor's appointments. Where, of course, you play the, ""hurry up and wait"" game.

-

Anyway, it was at one of the next dialysis sessions where the next problem cropped up. This time, it was at the end of one of the treatments, and I had to go pee (which is slightly ironic because most people on dialysis don't make a lot of urine). Well, when I got in the bathroom, I noticed that my undershirt was wet and there was a hint of this putrid odor in the air.

-

So I opened up the abdominal binder I had on, and the dressings were soaked. With pus. It was a giant purulent mess. Just as an aside to any young medical people, infected wounds with pus are described as being ""purulent."" You can't write the –y form of ""pus"" on the chart. Try it some time, and you'll see why. Anyway, this stuff is just oozing out of my abdominal wound. I cleaned it up the best I could, attempted to make a pressure dressing to keep it in one spot, and called the surgical oncology office. They told us to come on by.

One of the residents came to see me and confirmed that yes, I did in fact, have an infected surgical incision. Once you get something like that, it has to basically fill in from the bottom with granulation tissue and heal up on its own. If you try to just sew it closed, it just leaves a potential space for bacteria to form abscesses. 

-

So the resident took the blunt end of a scalpel and started probing the wound to see how much would open up. After it was all said and done, it was about 4 inches top to bottom, and about 2 inches deep. The deep layer had come open, too, and you could see a single surgical suture holding the two sides of my abdominal wall together. I could see my own intestines. [I could have put a finger down the hole and literally touched my own bowel.](https://i.imgur.com/1hPeaxU.jpg) I didn't, because that seemed gross and also like a really bad idea. But I *could* have.

-

So with wounds like that, you want to both pack and clean them, and we do that with ""wet-to-dry"" dressings. Basically, you get some appropriate material (eg, Kerlex), get it wet, and shove it in the wound. Then you let it dry, take out the material, and repeat the whole process over and over until it's healed. That way you're cleaning the wound every time you change the bandage, because all of the gross stuff on top comes out with the bandages, leaving only the nice healthy viable tissue underneath.

-

This went on for about a month. Things slowly got better, but for the longest time I couldn't take a shower because of all of this. For months, I'd sit on the edge of the tub and wash all of the important parts. You know what I'm talking about. I don't know about you, but a nice shower is one of my more favorite things in life (right up there with the pee shivers after holding it in forever). And sometimes you don't appreciate the little things like that until they're gone.

-

But life continued, as it does. I'd go to dialysis or Coumadin clinic 4-5 times a week. I'd change out the wet-to-dry dressings in the surgical wound 2-3 times a day. I took all of my blood thinners as instructed. Things slowly improved. However, we'd been holding off on chemo given all of the complications, and it was rapidly approaching time to start that.

-

I only had intra-abdominal chemo at first. We used carboplatin and doxorubicin and we'd alternate medications each week for 8 weeks of treatment - 4 cycles to use the oncology parlance… and don't ""cycles"" sound just so much more fancy? The doxorubicin was tolerable. It basically just made by belly hurt and made it difficult to stand up all the way, or lay completely flat, because the stretching really hurt. Carboplatin just makes you puke and feel like shit. You get used to all of it after a while.

-

Anyway, during the very first surgery, we had placed two intra-abdominal ports to access the abdomen for chemotherapy. We didn't really need two, but we figured it would be nice to have a backup in case one failed. And what would the chances be of *both* of them failing? Astronomically low, right?

-

As you may be deducing by now, I'm a pretty lucky guy. One of the ports just stopped working, so we stopped using it. The other port had its anchoring sutures come loose, and it started moving under the skin. It turned in a funny way underneath the skin, and after a few days of it ""just"" hurting pretty badly, [it ended up partially eroding through my skin.](https://i.imgur.com/lSndrhD.jpg) A few days later, and through something of a minor miracle, one of the interventional radiologists was able to place a 3rd abdominal port, and it worked beautifully. This was about 5 months after the initial diagnosis, and it occurred to me that this was the first time that something in this entire fucked up process had actually gone according to plan.

-

Between the surgery itself, all its associated complications like the surgical wound opening back up, dialysis, the blood clot, the fact that heparin doesn't work on me, and the fact that both of my ports failed, I was pretty much done with all of this crap, thank you very much. I thought I'd handled it pretty well up until that point, all things considered. But when that freaking port eroded through my body wall, that was it. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

-

So I went to go see them in clinic again shortly after that, and discussed everything with them. This was towards the end of July in 2016, and by that point the blood clot and the dialysis had pretty much resolved (although I now have permanent renal impairment and am currently at CKD stage IIIb). The debacle with the ports and feeling like shit from chemo had been taking its toll on me, and so we decided to hold off on more treatment for the time being. It was the first time since this whole process started that I finally got a (very welcome) reprieve from treatment.

-

Our wedding was coming up in about 6 weeks, and they were going to give me a chemo holiday and let me regain some strength before the wedding. And then, we were going on a kickass honeymoon to Cozumel! Woo! So that break came right at the perfect time.

-

[Our wedding was the single best day of my life](https://i.imgur.com/RhLj0u4.jpg?1), hands down. It was a huge, fun, amazing party with all of our closest friends and family there to celebrate it with us. We played Bohemian Rhapsody as our final song, and even during the last song at the end of a very long night, the entire dance floor was packed with everyone singing along. It's one of my favorite memories from that night.

-

A couple days later, we went on an amazing dive trip to Cozumel. It was some of the best diving I've done (though my experience is pretty limited), and we had a fantastic time just spending a normal week with each other, far away from all of the bullshit of treatment and cancer problems. I made a video from some of the gopro footage I took, [which you can see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb3OASSR3pg). I hope you'll check it out! I put a lot of work into it, and I'm fairly proud of it.

-

I also need to stop for a second here and just tell you guys how amazing my wife really is. We had just gotten engaged about 3 months prior to my diagnosis. Not everyone is super excited about entering into a long-term commitment where you know the other person is going to be chronically ill. I even asked her, at the time, if she wanted to ""stay in the game,"" so to speak. But, and this is why I married her as fast as I possibly could, she said something to the effect of, ""stop being a ridiculous idiot, our wedding date is set, so you'd better get planning!"" 

-

My dear reader, I hope you will grant me a small courtesy here, and allow me to address Nicole directly, just for a brief moment. Nicole, you are the absolute love of my life. My source of unending strength. I love you in a way I never thought you could love another human being. I feel it in my heart. I know it, deep down in the core of my being. I love you. Now, and forever.

-

Thanks guys! Now back to the story! Once we got back from vacation, it was time to start chemo again. We had planned on doing a few more cycles, but when I started back up, it hit me like a ton of bricks. And, I was still planning on trying to take my radiology board exam in November, a mere 6 weeks away at that point. But as it often turns out, life had other plans for me.

-

A couple weeks after we got back, I started having a sensation of early fullness when eating, and I noticed my bowel movements were becoming less frequent. Then, I started having these increasingly severe abdominal pains that would kind of come and go, and I started throwing up. And I threw up some more. And even more. I must have barfed at least 6 or 7 times on the day we finally went to the hospital. I puked again on the car ride of the emergency room, but this time it was a little different. Instead of smelling like regular old vomit, it smelled more like fecal material. At this point, I was throwing up stuff so far down in my gut that it was in the process of turning from food into *literal shit.* 

-

And so I was admitted yet again for another bowel obstruction. This time, I'd end up in the hospital for about a week before I finally went home. Once they get you stabilized, an admission for a bowel obstruction is pretty much you just sitting around asking for pain/nausea meds. Once you finally take a shit, they start advancing your diet beginning with liquids and moving up to more complex consistencies of food. Other than that, it's just a whole lot of sitting around your hospital room, so be sure to bring something to keep you occupied. The hospital is boring AF. But the bowel obstruction had totally destroyed my plans to take the boards in the fall. It looked like I was going to be a year behind, after all. Oh well.

-

The week before Thanksgiving of 2016, it was time for surgery 2.0. Remember, we'd left some disease during the first case so we knew there was stuff we had to go back and get. We were hoping that the second surgery would basically get everything out. But man I was scared shitless to go through the surgical process again. The first go-a-round didn't exactly go according to plan, as you've probably gathered at this point. One more bad hit to my kidneys and they're gone. They work okay right now, and they do their job, but only just. It wouldn't take much to push me over to permanent dialysis. And guess how excited they are to give a transplant kidney to a patient with known cancer (hint: they're not excited about that *at all*).

-

But, through what I can only assume is the grace of God, the second surgery was the most technically successful procedure we could have hoped for. They were able to get everything out that they could see. A bunch of areas looked ""weird"" (for lack of a better phrase) and so they biopsied a bunch of places, but pretty much all of it came back as treatment related change. And I got to keep my stomach, and I didn't have to have a colostomy or any other bowel diverting procedure. The recovery was a lot easier the second time around, since there were many fewer complications. The entire thing seemed to hurt a lot less, too. 

-

But it's still really hard to eat after a big open abdominal surgery case, sometimes for months. I dropped down to a low of about 120 lbs which, for me, was pretty scary. I could make out all of the bones in my shoulders and ribs. I could see the individual muscles that constitute the quadriceps in my legs. My size 32"" jeans literally slid right down my body. I had to by ""sick clothes"" just so it didn't look like I was wearing hand-me-downs from a guy 50 pounds heavier than me. It took me a good 10 months after that second surgery to get my weight back up to the 160s, and even now, if I don't pay attention and eat properly, I'll just start losing weight without noticing it. It sounds cool until you realize that that's how people with this disease die – they literally can't get enough food intake to meet their metabolic needs, so they get cachectic and waste away and die. So yeah, it's kinda fun being skinny without trying, and I can eat whatever I want pretty much, but there's definitely a darker side to that story.

-

So in March of 2017, I started back at work, officially, full time. I basically ended up sitting out an entire year of residency because of this, and now I'm going to graduate with the class that came behind my original one. My new class was just starting to study for the boards, too, so it was a perfect time to jump back in and try to get back up to speed. I felt like a complete moron for a couple of weeks when I first got back. Turns out that if you don't do anything related to your job for a year, your knowledge level will atrophy. Who knew?!

-

And so I was freaking terrified of failing the boards. More than one of my attendings specifically mentioned to me that it ""would be totally understandable"" if I failed the boards (or something to that sentiment). Thanks for the vote of confidence, guys! But they'd been looming over my head for what seemed like forever at this point, and I just wanted to finally be done with it. So I studied for the boards just about as hard as I've ever studied for anything in my life. I read multiple books, some multiple times. I did thousands and thousands of practice questions. I studied any free minute I had at work, and basically from the time I got home until it was time to go to bed, for 3 months in a row. It was brutal, and exhausting, but fear of failure is a powerful motivator. 

-

I found out that I passed the board exam on the same day that we did my first post-op follow-up scan. The day started out pretty great – I passed my boards! Hooray! But the PET/CT news was much less good. They found a few new nodules in my mediastinum right next to the heart, and they were metabolically active. It was highly probable that it was cancer, but the only way to know for sure is to do a biopsy. So I went in for a third surgery in August 2017 and they took out all of the nodules they could see. I was hesitant to do another surgery, because most chest surgeries are a pretty big deal, but my surgeon decided to use the DaVinci robot and so I actually only have 3 tiny little scars on the left side of my chest where they placed the access ports for the robot.

-

And, unfortunately, we weren't surprised when those nodules all turned out to be metastatic disease. I went to go see med onc again, and we decided to go ahead and do systemic chemo. So I'll get carboplatin/pemetrexed/avastin every 3 weeks for four cycles, and then we'll do another scan and see if things are better, worse, or the same.

-

This is the part of cancer care where can get very tedious, and you start to lose options for therapy as you try things that work to varying degrees of success initially, and then stop working. I still have a couple conventional treatment regimens to fall back on if this one fails, but after that, it's time to start looking into experimental trials. 

-

My current plan (if one can even have plans in such circumstances) is to try and kick the can down the road a few years at a time until immunotherapy has caught up with the solid tumors. It's already done wonders in certain types of cancer, and they have mouse models of mesothelioma where all of this stuff works, too. So in principle we've got some promising leads. But with medicine, the devil is always in the details and we need to get a lot more data and refine this process more and more until it's truly ready for game day. But, I really do believe that, in principle, we're about to start making enormous strides in extending the lives of cancer patients.

-

And so that's where I'm at, about 18 months after my initial diagnosis. The day I got diagnosed, 18 months was about all the time I thought I had left, too. So I'm already winning in that sense, and I'm very happy to be where I am. I think it's reasonable to hope that I could get a few years of progression-free disease control out of conventional treatment before we have to move on to most experimental things. Of course, no one knows if they're going to be the person to beat the odds, or not. The only thing I can continue to do is hope and pray that I turn out to be one of the lucky ones.

-

I think a lot of people might find this next sentence bizarre, but in many ways, this thing has been a simultaneous blessing and a curse. The negative aspects of it are obvious, and we could discuss those ad nauseaum. I think the positive aspects are the more *interesting* ones, though. This diagnosis forced me to really tackle some existential questions about life and the nature of existence, and after much reading and thinking, I've found a belief structure that works very well for me and provides a source of strength. I've had friends from ages ago, or even just simple acquaintances, who have gone so far above and beyond what they had to do that I can never repay them. 

-

Before this, I had always labored under the assumption that I'd been merely passing through life, with no one taking any serious notice of me one way or the other, and that I wasn't really making any meaningful impression on people, at all. I felt like I was always just ""there,"" like a wallflower at a party. Present, but un-involved. Even that couldn't have been farther from the truth. People who were my medical students when I was an intern got in touch with me, just to see how I was doing. The entire radiology department set up a gofundme page for us and raised a bunch of money to help with the medical bills. People made us food, so we didn't have to cook. People got us gift cards to restaurants so we could go out every once in a while. 

-

My interpersonal relationships mean a great deal more to me now than they ever did before. One thing I've noticed during all of this is the degree to which people really genuinely care about each other. For some reason, we just never say it when things are going fine. It takes a horrible tragedy like this to bring that to the surface. Well, I've since decided that's dumb. I've started telling people how much they mean to me in my life. You should try it some time. It's pretty rewarding.

-

I want to finish my residency and go practice as an attending back home. I used to put my career first, above everything. I was going to do interventional radiology and live in a big city with an academic IR department and do all kinds of cool cases! And it still sounds fun, sure. But after something like this, you realize that no matter how cool your job is, it eventually becomes just your job. I mean, astronauts probably get up on some Mondays and are like, ""damnit I have to go to work today."" There are more important things in life than what you do.

-

My family all lives in this one little town in Louisiana, and it just so happens that a group in that area is looking for a general diagnostic radiologist, so it's a good fit. My wife and I are trying to start a family. I've always wanted to be a dad, mostly because I think I'd be pretty good at it, and I hope that I have that opportunity. I hope I have the opportunity to work as an attending for a while so I can actually help people, and not be ""just the resident"" on the case. I can completely relate to what patients go through now in a way that I never understood before.

-

For a series of reasons, after the boards were (finally) behind me, I ended up on a block of mammography rotations all in a row. By the time it's all said and done, I'll have done 5 months of breast radiology contiguously. It's secretly a really great field. We get to use a variety of imaging modalities: x-rays (the mammograms), ultrasound, and MRI, and we can do image guided biopsies under all of those things, too. There's also a lot of interaction with the technologists all throughout the day, so you're not just sitting in a room alone by yourself just reading cases all day (there's a reason most radiologists are weirdos). 

-


I also like it because I get to meet patients on a regular basis, often 20+ a week. Sometimes, it's to tell someone that they need a biopsy. Sometimes it's to actually do the biopsy, or the other minor procedures we do. But I can empathize with the patients *very* deeply now, especially young people who get stricken with this terrible disease. Not that I think I was a huge jerk before or anything. But after something like this, you just kinda ""get it."" It's immensely rewarding to be an integral part of the process that ultimately saves people's lives.

-

I also realized the other day, that when I started listing out the reasons I like breast radiology, those are pretty much the same reasons I wanted to go into IR in the first place. I think most people would say breast radiology and IR are just about as far apart on the spectrum as it gets, but I think they're more similar than people give them credit for. It's interesting how when one door closes, another seems to open. I'm just happy to have a job I love where I get to help people on a daily basis.

-

As for me personally, to the extent that it's feasible, I want to keep traveling and diving and seeing as much of the world as I can, before I kick the bucket. I've come to believe quite strongly that the things which provide meaning to our lives are experiences and relationships with other people, and I want to foster both of those things.

-

Basically, I plan on continuing to do awesome things with the people who matter most in my life, until the day I literally can't get out of bed anymore.

72nmxj,6,2017-09-26,How bad is a Dell Precision 690?,Spiral_Out_462,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/72nmxj/how_bad_is_a_dell_precision_690/,"Hi r/homelab!

First time posting on this sub so bear with me if its a little rough, and a little long. Also not sure if I flared correctly so please help if it is incorrect. 

I just recently acquired a Dell Precision 690 (1 Xeon X5365, 16GB Ram &amp; a 500GB HDD) after we went through and discarded some old equipment and hardware. A good friend also upgraded his GPU for a 1080ti so he gave me his old GTX 970 in return for copying his old hard drive to his new SSD. 

I am currently in Uni (for Game Design and SWE), but I have an internship as an IT Tech for a small company that I have been in for awhile now. Up until now I was just a basic Help Desk Tech/System Builder/ and general helping hand, but our sole Admin left a few months ago and the company asked me to take over the main Sys. Admin role (with some help and tutoring from my boss. Ive been struggling with networking and maintaining the servers as efficiently as they need so I plan on taking this 690 and setting up my first actual home-lab to try and get better at everything. 

I plan on doing a few things with this server. I can get free licenses of Windows Server and Windows 10/8/7 through my university so I plan on installing Server 2016, and then running a combination of Windows 10, Windows 7 and Ubuntu on Virtual Machines for a Plex Server, a Software Test environment and a download machine. 

So my main question is, how limiting will this older chipset be for my uses? Im mostly worried about the limitations of the SATA 3Gb/s drive connection. Ive done a little research and I can upgrade with another CPU but I am wondering if this set up will be enough for what I wish to do at this current time. 

TL;DR: acquired a Precision 690 with a X5365 and a GTX 970, wondering if it will be powerful enough for several VM's and a Plex Server. 
Thanks for all the help in advance!"
72nzjq,4,2017-09-26,I am still struggling (Being the dumper) - advice? (Long post),theunknown209,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/72nzjq/i_am_still_struggling_being_the_dumper_advice/,"Hey, 

so I've been a lurker for most of the time and did not have the guts to post anything here yet. I am not quite sure why I am posting this here...maybe to get a different view on it, maybe to find some kind of validation or maybe just to get it off my chest or maybe advice if I have overreacted.

Honestly, I am a little afraid to post this, as I have the feeling that a lot of people here (unfortunately) have the role of 'dumpee'.

Ok, here it goes:

We've been together for +4 years and spent the past 3.5 years in a LDR (2h flight distance). (Her 24/me 26)

The past 1 to 1.5 years I feel neglected in the relationship.
(I'm gonna put this into chapters - my OCD is slightly kicking in)

1. I think, it started with her taking an internship abroad (13h flight in between) for eight months. She wasn't really talking with me about it when the day came that she got accepted. It was more like 'Boom' - 'I am gonna do this, no matter what'. To be honest I was a little disappointed, because I would have loved to be a little more involved in her future plans. But I said 'OK' helped her throughout the internship (worked in the same field beforehand and was able to give her an advice every now and then), called her when she was having a bad day and all that kind of stuff and did a surprise visit on her birthday (even though it took a lot of effort for me: new job, still in the 6--months probation phase in the job, entry wage vs. expensive flight, her expectation to visit me (of course I wanted to see her as well!), and working over hours so I could take more days off). My self-esteem took a big hit when I arrived there with flowers and her reaction was...rather cold (?) - let's say it's not that kind of reaction you would expect when you haven't seen each other for a couple of months and you try to surprise someone. 

My self-esteem was taking some other hits, when I found out that she went on a date with another guy ('didn't tell you because I was worried that you would worry'), all these messages popping up on her phone from random dudes and her being constantly on her phone, while she was never texting me when she was out and told me all these stories of her phone running out of battery, no mobile data/wifi and so on. 
I kind of left the country with a bad feeling in my stomach. While still thinking it was a nice time...

She decided to stay a little longer to travel around in the end. 

2. After her internship (back to a 2h flight) I kind of developed that feeling, that something was not right. I was usually the one who had to initiate visits or asking for them. She always postponed visits, up to the point where I was not even sure if she wants to see me or not. She basically said that she is so busy with school (which I still believe to a certain degree), while still being able to take short trips with family and friends (was never asked to do the same and never invited). I asked if we could make a trip together, she always said 'yea, sure' but nothing else, but never followed up when I asked again. Please, keep in mind, I wasn't able to take any vacation instantly as I spent most of them for the surprise visit and wanted to keep some for Xmas and New Years. So I was depending mostly on her regarding that topic. 

Also sex got weird. She would never initiate it and I was starting to feel insecure more and more, even though we talked about it and she assured me that everything was fine.

But during that time she also applied for two different programs, but only told me about the first one. I helped her with the application for the first one. I kind of have the feeling that she was not really honest about the dates of her trip as they eventually be during Christmas and New Years until end of January. We actually made plans to visit each others families during that time and I cancelled plans with friends because of that. I felt kind of screwed over since I now was standing there with empty hands so to say, while from her side only came 'Sorry' (literally). 

A week later she told me about the second program, where she would go to East Asia for another 2 months. I was really disappointed and actually hurt at this point, because I had the feeling that there was enough time for her friends, family and applying for such programs, while she would not even make time for me to visit. I felt betrayed to be honest (even though I am not quite sure if that is the right term here) We eventually had a big fight about it. She agreed to visit me for a couple of days, though I believe it was just because of the fight and she had the feeling that I was getting annoyed. We actually had a quite good discussion about all these things and I told her that I was not seeing a point anymore in hoping and always asking for a vacation together, while she is making only plans by her own means. She agreed and said that she will now plan a nice vacation and asked me to join her and her brother for a vacation to South Africa. I agreed. 


3. During that time, we had a lot of stress at work. People got fired, I was denied a promotion and a raise (because the company had to save money). At the same time I had a loss in my family. I was devastated. I told my now ex a day before said family member died that she is in the ER and probably wont make it. She died the next day. My ex wasn't even asking about it the next day and was partying with friends when I got the news. While my ex just complained how stupid the people were and why I was not feeling sorry for her, I was in shock. I told her and she apologized. 

I did not expect her to come to my country and such things, but I think I can expect from a partner to remember such thing for less than 24 hours?

As I said I was not feeling well anymore. Neither physically, nor mentally. One day after work, I wanted to jump in front of train. It is still a scary memory. I couldn't handle it anymore. Loss in my family, girlfriend did not show any kind of empathy to my problems and the whole situation at my job. I believe that it was at that time where my depression eventually kicked in.


4. Remember that trip to South Africa I mentioned beforehand? Well, she went with her brother alone. Did not talk with me nor did she say that I wasn't invited anymore. Another hit in my face. 


5. As the situation got more and more serious at my job (more people got fired/left for better jobs), I asked my now ex what she would think if I would move to a closer country or to her country/city after I found a job there. At that time she was slowly applying for another internship which was mandatory for her school. She then told me that she would rather do the internship in the city where I am currently living or would go somewhere completely else, when I moved to one of the given options. I still don't really know what to think of it. But I felt like she would only to the internship in my city for the sake of having an adventure than actually being with me. I then got an offer from a company in Thailand and suddenly she was making me aware of all the dangers there, and that we need the time to be together in my city when she is doing the internship there...I turned it down, unfortunately, because I thought so too.

6. I slowly started to look for a bigger apartment (bigger places are freaking expensive in my city, especially with my salary). When I showed her pictures of the place I was able to afford (fully furnished), while still saving money, she would only complain that it looks too small and that she wanted a bigger place, where we could buy a kitchen (rather like, I was supposed to buy the kitchen). I decided against it and still took the place. She was starting to complain about the place when during her first and second (also last) visit. Couch was uncomfortable, bed was ugly, we need more book shelfs (we already had two, barely used ones), knifes 'sucked' and were 'cheap' -  the list goes on. Also, a few months prior she would quit her part time job to have more time for volunteering (which I respected, while also being kind of worried as we were still in a LDR at that point, and I usually ended up paying for most of the things), so she didn't actually contribute to actually living together. Also doing 50/50 on the rent wasn't an option, as she told me that she could only contribute 20% to the rent, when she would start her internship in my city. (fun fact: one would not even be able to afford a room in a shared flat with those 20% in my city.) It was another blow to my self esteem. I couldn't say anything anymore. I was so exhausted. I was too tired to fight about anything.

7. About four months ago she started her program in China (mentioned earlier - for about two months). During that time I visited my older brother. When I saw him I suddenly had nervous break down. I cried for hours and could not stop anymore. It was the first time in over a year that I was able to cry. He assumed that I had a severe depression (he has a medical background). I told my ex-girlfriend about it and she would say that she was so sorry for me, asking me what she could do for me and all that, while not even making any move to show some initiative. (In retrospective I would say that was my first cry for help).

After visiting my brother I started to see a therapist. My depression is quite severe, but I am slowly making progress. My therapist told me that my depression was not necessarily triggered by my then gf but rather reinforced since it was kind of one-sided, the way I presented it to him. I tried to open up to my ex about my depression (not her role in it), she was upset that I had not told her before hand that I was seeing a therapist. (I guess, second cry for help?) It was a few days before she would return to her home country. She then added she would have another vacation with her brother for another month but had a lot of time for me afterwards...

At this point I still ask myself: Was I not worth dropping that vacation (they would stay in her country) for once and listen to my cry for help? Or come and see me? Did I expect to much? I again talked with my therapist about it. And he said to end the relationship for now, as I was not capable anymore to work on myself anymore. 

She was angry and sad at me for breaking up. But understood it. I helped her to find a shared flat in my city (we haven't met yet) (Side fact: She is suddenly able to afford a place where the rent is more than twice as high as what she had told me) and moved all her stuff there before she moved in. 

Still, I feel so guilty about the break up. I can't forget how she cried and how it broke my heart. And I miss her a lot. I miss waking up next to her, how she would smile at me, how she hug me and cuddle me...Still I can't understand how she would not even drop anything when I really needed her (and we are not talking about an important job interview or anything like that)

I am still convinced that there were some kind of miscommunication on both sides, but I can't stop feeling guilty and missing her and regretting the break up every day. Did I expect too much? Should I feel guilty?

Thanks in advance for any advice and help!

So ive been feeling pretty uneasy about my experience so far in the big 4... Its been about a year since my last accounting class, and I feel like I forgot all of the material I learned in school. 

I started training recently, and I always hear that you are not expected to know anything when you start in the big 4. during training they talk about all of these terms that I don't understand, and it seems that all my peers are already familiar with all of these terms and processes. I feel so stupid when all of my peers/previous interns are answering questions and all know what to do during our training exercises. 

I am really willing to work hard and learn, but at the same time I do not want to look like an idiot for asking questions that I probably should know from my accounting classes. 

Was anyone else in the same position/ feel this way during their training? I know it is only going to get worse, but will it just click when I start actual work? What is expected of me during my first engagement if I didnt really learn during my training?

What do you guys think I should do to catch up before it's too late?"

My girlfriend at the time and I watched a movie called City Island. For some reason, at the end of this movie, I freaked the fuck out. It was some typical find yourself story but it had a massive impact on me. I got really scared/unsure about my future and I rejected everything that was known to me. I broke up with my girlfriend and lost most of my friends because of this 'identity crisis'. I lost the internship because I kept going to therapy and couldn't keep it together at work. Then a month after this 'crisis' I got insanely ""happy"", I said I had ephiphany (which I now know was severe depression). I tried everything, I probably looked like I was the star of that yes man movie. I wanted to get involved in a completely different major to help people because I was such a 'happy' person. I got involved in the college drama club because I loved singing so much. Looking back on it, it was so weird. I was not like me at all.

For the last 7 years I've had over 15 low paying jobs with nothing related to my degree. I've lived with my parents for most of the 7 years and I've had no real platonic or intimate connections. I'm fortunate to have a loving family, otherwise, id be screwed.

On sunday, for some reason, it all came back into place. I feel like myself again, my normal interests have been restored, I'm on track to get a job back in my major/interest. I've made re connections with the friends I lost during my identity crisis. I really regret breaking up with the love of my life and, as a result, I have been going through some grief. She is married with a child on the way so there no going back to that. I also really regret losing 7 years of career progression. 

I'm wondering, how the hell does that all happen?! Can one simple thing like a movie really alter someones personality?

I appreciate whoever reads this. I'm not sure if it should be in depression but I just wanted to share my story."

Die Lügenpresse hat sich längst damit abgefunden, dass jede Migration grundsätzlich Einwanderung ist, Flucht ist nur ein weiteres Synonym für diese. 

Die FDP allerdings unterscheidet da. Nirgendwo hat die FDP davon gesprochen, dass es mit einem Einwanderungsgesetz wie von ihnen gefordert auch zu einem Aufnahmestopp illegaler Migranten kommt. 

Hier offenbart sich, dass in einer Jamaika-Koalition bis auf die CSU niemand von irgendeiner Begrenzung spricht. Lindner will auch weiterhin Migranten aufnehmen die sich als Flüchtlinge ausgeben, er will nur ein Einwanderungsgesetz oben drauf, mit dem die Wirtschaft sich dann einfacher Fachkräfte aus Indien ranholen kann.

Beide Parteien, Grün und Gelb stehen für ein weiteres Offenhalten der Grenzen. Merkel und mit ihr die CDU sowieso.

Die CSU wird übrigens nachgeben. Intern wird gerade diskutiert zumindest die Obergrenze in den Koalitionsvertrag mit reinzubringen, dagegen klagen und diese vom Verfassungsgericht für unzulässig erklären zu lassen. Dabei hofft man auf ein Urteil nach den Landtagswahlen in Bayern.

Jamaika wird also nichts anderes tun als weiterhin für einen steten Zustrom an Straftätern sorgen.

I am not actually smart or passionate about tech like I thought. I went to good university to study mechanical engineering. but all I did was going to class and taking exams that I crammed for. This again is the easiest thing you can do as a student. I walked away with high gpa but no skills. I actually struggled HARD in the difficult classes because you can't cram for those. I got No actual engineering experience or internship. I have deisgned nothing. I will never get a job in engineering. Nobody i know is in this situation right now. Even the worst student got engineering job somehow.

Jobless for 2 years, i came to this expensive city to study master in biomedical engineering because again i based it off short term happiness. because my (ex)gf is here and it's a short non thesis program that offers coop positions. But i see that i will be just as non competitive as i was before when i graduate. Might not even land a co op since my peers are super competent and experienced already in Biomedical. I have papers piling up but i have zero motivation.

I want to drop out and go study computer science in my home city because i think I'll be more focused in a familiar environment and more motivated to succeed in something I have more interest in. but I still am only interested in CS on a ""hey neat"" level right now and never picked up a book on my own. I don't even know what it is just like I didn't know what biomedical engineering is about before. I am just jumping fields to something I THINK is better. I'm just chasing short term happiness again. But i cannot stop thinking about it.

I have been remembering the past instances where I actually had to code things myself. Never had I actually coded somethign decently complex that works. I either quit half way or it just never worked. In fact I failed such simple things like Day of Week checker. I can't think like a programmer. 

I also fantasize about not existing. But I'm too cowardly for that. Quitting things is my habit. I did it for many side hobbies or opportunities when they got too hard or time consuming. You get instant gratification when you do. This is another instance of it.

My options:

1. Quit UBC. Go back home. Work minimal wage jobs.

2. Stop existing as a waste of a human being.


I have to decide which one to do. I skipped classes and homework and screwd over my teammates already.

Tl;dr: I'm a human garbage. I have been seeking instant gratification all my life and didn't learn anything in life. Not because I didn't try but because I couldn't. I am dropping out of my Master's and have no back up plan whatsoever. I will be replying on my parents once again just like forever.

72qze4,6,2017-09-27,[Help] Making spider-themed superheroes feel different from Marvel?,UltimateLazer,characterforge,https://www.reddit.com/r/characterforge/comments/72qze4/help_making_spiderthemed_superheroes_feel/,"I've shared this story on here numerous times to help out my world building. *Protectors* is a story about superheroes and exists very much in a universe I've been constructing, and takes influence from many stories to create something different. One of the inspirations I've taken from Marvel are spider-themed superheroes. I have two: Night Spider and Scarlet Web. The former is male (both of them), the latter is female. The thing is, Marvel kind of is famous for having spider-themed heroes. Apart from the obvious Spider-Man, you have Miles Morales, Silk, Spider-Girl, Spider-Gwen, Venom, Toxin, Spider-Man 2099, Master Weaver, Spider-Woman, and probably some others I'm forgetting. Basically, I have two ideas for spider-themed heroes but I want them to feel somewhat original. I know they'll inevitably be compared to Marvel, but I don't want them to feel like rip-offs. I've even been told I ""can't do them"" because ""copyright"", but that's absurd because you can't copyright the basic concept of a character.

----

I'll give you guys a rundown on both of them.

#Night Spider

Night Spider is an identity belonging to two different heroes, Desmond Harper and Roy Flynn. The former is a Manhattan billionaire who created the identity, the suit, and its gadgets as a means to fight crime, as a result of losing his family in a mob attack. He was a founding member of the Protectors, and served until he became too old and suffered a heart attack, forcing him to retire. The latter comes from a poor background, originally from Pennsylvania, he's a former criminal who robbed stores and rich people and got involved in street gangs because he didn't see any other way of life. He turned it around when he met his current girlfriend Kristy Park in high school, and they moved to New York together, where she became an intern at Desmond's company Harper-Rise. Roy donned the Night Spider suit soon after he met Desmond, as he needed someone who could stop the corrupt members who have taken over his company from dealing with criminals, and continues as the identity today being a member of the Young Protectors, while also doing some other work on the side. Roy makes it clear he doesn't want his girlfriend to ever get involved with his hero life, fearing what could happen if she digs too deep.

His costume is a dark, flexible armor suit with white visors that serve as his ""eyes"". This suit enhances his agility, reflexes, allows him to shoot artificial webs, has ""spider hairs"" to stick and climb walls, summon ""spider legs"" to attack enemies out of his range, summon talons out of his hands to either strengthen his grip or enhance his attacks, and he has infra-red sight he can access while in the dark. He also has a utility belt with gadgets like smokescreen, web bombs, explosive webs, trackers, and poison. This is all managed by an intelligent A.I. named Charlotte.

I essentially created the idea of the Night Spider by combining Spider-Man with Batman. Especially considering both Bruce Wayne and Terry McGinnis. A dark superhero who bases himself off a scary creature, utilizes a special suit and gadgets, and uses fear as a weapon. The former has the billionaire who lost his family, is older and experienced, and was a founding member of the super team down. The latter follows the former criminal trying to do good, comes from poverty, and being a younger hero taking an old mantle part.

#Scarlet Web

Scarlet Web is the identity of Angela Sáez, a native New Yorker from The Bronx who was born to parents of Puerto Rican descent. She's intelligent, but is often known to let her emotions get the best of her. Partially, this was due to living in a family that struggled to make ends meet, her father an auto-mechanic and her mother a waitress. There was also racism she faced, as a Latina in New York (which is known for having its share of intolerant people). Once she got the high school, they took a field trip the Manhattan Institute of Research and Development. This was considered the premier development facility in the state of New York. They created genetically enhanced spiders that were made to use venom as means to light up cancer cells. One escaped, and no one noticed until it happened upon Angela during the field trip and bit her. She squashed it, none the wiser at the time of what it was, and continued about her day. When Angela woke up the next morning, she found herself sticking on the ceiling. It became clear she had newfound special abilities. Instead of joining the Protectors, she became an independent superhero who sometimes works with others. Generally, she considers herself more of a lone wolf than a team player, and often does hero services for money to support her family.

Her costume was made herself, using silk to form a skin-tight blue outfit with a red spider symbol in the center. She wears a white half-mask that covers the lower half of her face and her hair is tied in a ponytail. Her webbing is natural, able to extend out of her wrists. She can stick to walls, has enhanced agility, reflexes, and strength. Her senses are enhanced, while it's not a ""spidey sense"" per se that triggers when it's convenient, but rather she sees things much more vividly and sharply (especially in the dark), and can hear things coming at her that most people can't.

This idea came about by making a female Spider-Man, but I knew I had to make core differences. I decided not to have her be a Protector, but rather an independent hero because of her financial situation, who does heroing for free but takes on specific missions for money to support her family. Both her parents know she's the Scarlet Web, and instead of working a normal job, she does this. She would be the first to admit that she doesn't work well in big teams and answering to a higher authority, hence she likes the flexibility being independent gives her.

----

The two interact in the story, in fact they have worked together before and have a ""partnership"" that is strictly platonic. Roy even says ""Night Spider and Scarlet Web, sounds like bad kids show. Hope you don't mind second billing."" to Angela as a joke. It's natural, since they both utilize spider-themed abilities, thus they compliment each other very well. Night Spider is strong and agile but not to the extent of Scarlet Web, while he has plenty of gadgets at his disposal. Scarlet Web is strong for a human, but weaker than Night Spider, however her extreme agility more than makes up for it. Also, she doesn't need a suit or any gadgets to use her abilities, while Night Spider has to be suited up to access all of his powers.

So, is there any suggestions you guys have when writing spider-themed superheroes? The Marvel influence is pretty obvious, but I think when you like something, if common to think ""how would I do this differently"". I just want to make sure they feel like they're their own characters rather than just copies of Spider-Man. What do you guys think?"

I have had a complex few months, I have been having problems with my internship and problems with my estate agent. 

I felt confused with my feelings towards this internship, I want to become an environmental consultant one day and this internship was to get me on the right track, I got onto this internship out of many people and not sure how I got onto it. For a while I felt so lucky, and I was told by people how lucky I am, but my internship has barely given me any work resulting in me not earning much money, and almost unable to pay rent or food, it's my parents and boyfriend who are helping keep me up by paying for my food when I need it, in that case I am so lucky to have those people in my life, but I feel like a burden, like I am now negatively impacting their life because they are giving me money that they need to preciously themselves!

I think it’s because, when I joined the company and started my internship, I felt like my dreams had come true, I imagined myself in a few months time having no money problems, I was doing the work I love, I would be sorted with life and not having to worry about money and surviving for a while, but it didn’t go that way at all. I got this internship after having months of not finding a job, and with being on a master’s degree I became so poor and worried about my life having no money, I thought the internship would save me and it didn’t. I applied for weekend jobs to earn money where I wasn’t with the internship, but couldn’t get work in the week for how last minute this company can ask me for work. I must of applied for over 50 weekend jobs, I had an interview for 2, didn’t get a job out of all of them, no one wanted me or noticed how much experience I have. I felt like it was lie when people told me the more experience you have the easier you’ll get a job, I have had a lot of experience, employed and voluntary, and where has that taken me? 

It’s very sad that in this world you really do need money to be happy. 

The other was this estate agents messing up my flat and my enjoyment of living, we have been messed around and lied to, which made me feel saddened and corrupted by selfish rich people. 

I felt as though people didn’t like me, that all of these things happening was because I deserved it. I am unlikable and no one wants me. My internship don’t give me any work so how can they like me? Or see my potential? My estate agent messing my boyfriend’s life and mine and being spiteful with it. No one wanted to employ me, what does that say about me? I feel hated on, even if no one was necessarily hating me. 

I started to get too stressed with it all, I felt like I was such an unlikeable person, that I deserved this happening to me, that I had no value and had no potential despite all the education I have done and experience I have had. I felt like I wasn’t going anywhere and that maybe it was the world telling me it’s not worth it. 

I had thoughts like I wanted to die, I was thinking ‘if this is my life, why the hell do I want to be alive?’, I started thinking of how much people would care if I went, I wondered how much it would actually it would impact on peoples life if I wasn’t here. I know my family would be distraught, I know my boyfriend would need help in his life and my closest friends would be saddened. I didn’t want to commit suicide, but I did want to go. I didn’t really think of ways to kill myself, but I wished I could fade away, I wish I could fall asleep and then I’d never wake up, and that everyone I know would have their memory wiped of me so that I didn’t cause any pain on anyone, I don’t want people to miss me as I felt I wasn’t worth that. 

I got into a dark place, I took it out on my boyfriend at times, I didn’t feel like I was really there or like myself, I didn’t know what I was doing in all honesty, but I still haven’t confessed to my boyfriend, I don’t want to cause anymore issues. 

I still haven’t told him that I wanted my life to end in some way, that I had had enough, I still don’t think I will.

Because, I feel better now, not ‘great’ or ‘perfect’, but I feel like I am happy with being alive. I finally got a trial shift yesterday and I have been kept on! I’m not working much, but it’s something, and it’s money! 
Something about yesterday made me feel happy, I haven’t felt actual ‘happiness’ for a while. I feel good, and so much better! I told my parents and boyfriend that I got the job and they were so happy for me. I reminded myself that I really do have a lovely family that make me in a much better position than I could be. And I owe my boyfriend, I realised that throughout all of this stress he has made light of it, making me feel better and keeping me from feeling entirely alone, he has made all these shitty days better even after I had treated him like shit. 

From today, I am going to remember that we have a future, and it can get bright! My boyfriend is doing well, and this internship should help me get somewhere even if it hasn’t now, my family are doing well and are as loving as always.

The future can be a good one, and that is what makes life so special in the end.

There's a lack of discussion on this particular company's interviews, but it seems to have included ""relationships of the financial statements"" as one tech. q in the past. I'm also worried since I haven't taken audit in college yet, so I'm doing a crash course in basic audit concepts.

* What (internal) audit/accounting technical questions will most likely pop up in an interview?
* How would the process for a case study look like during an interview? (Links or sharing exp. are welcome!)

72sn0l,4,2017-09-27,I feel my wife doesn't respect my concerns,MrChouette,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/72sn0l/i_feel_my_wife_doesnt_respect_my_concerns/,"My wife and I married earlier this year, and while that was good, she had to leave out of state for an internship for 3 months a little after. We had never considered anything other than a monogamous relationship, but a few months into the internship she mentioned she had been spending lots of time with another man, and that although nothing had happened, she wanted something to. At the time, she was very respectful of me and we discussed it long and hard when she visited me halfway through the internship. I could see it was incredibly important to her, and that saying no would have caused nearly as much damage as saying yes, so I told her I was ok with it, as long as she didn't neglect me in turn. 

The rest of her internship (about 3 weeks) I heard from her very little. We would text about things regarding fixing up our house, and other common things like that, but we didn't skype anymore, and we rarely talked on the phone for more than a few minutes. She started getting annoyed when I would bring this up, telling me she didn't want to sit on Skype and talk about how bad my day was or how I was stressed I was or how I was having trouble dealing with her extra relationship and her silence. 

Now she's home, and although they never had sex (they did other sexual things, but his wife wouldn't allow the complete act), I can see how much she's fallen for this guy. It does seem like they have more in common with each other, and she texts him constantly...when I drive her somewhere, when we snuggle on the couch, when I'm making her dinner, and it's starting to drive me a little crazy. She also treats me differently. Before the internship, she did have a bit of a temper, and would get mad when I would make a mistake or forget something (justifiably), but now it feels like she snaps at everything I do. Last night, we were on the couch snuggling with Netflix, and after a show I got up to feed our cat and take our dog out to potty. I asked if we could pause the show until I got back, and she snapped at how I expected her to just sit there (not like she wasn't texting him the whole time watching tv) while I ran around ""doing chores"". I had already put off feeding the cat to finish the last show...

This has not been easy for me. Polyamory was never even something either of us had considered beforehand, and I told her that for me to be ok with it I would need help. I feel like I am compromising my life, while she gets everything she wants, and if I say no or suggest a rule or boundary I'm getting in the way of her feelings and her happiness. He comes to visit her in a few weeks (finally with the wife's ok), and I've suggested me and him should meet over lunch, just to ground him a bit and try to relieve some jealousy, but she told me ""I know you well enough to know that's a terrible idea that will make you feel worse, he's taller than you and you'll be intimidated"". I feel everything I try to do to help myself, she is either unsupportive or uncaring. She doesn't seem to get that this is hard for me, and while I'm sitting on the couch with her in my arms thinking about how my life feels like it's spiraling out of control, she is texting him about what they are going to do the morning after, either sex or a shower or both (I know I shouldn't have looked at her message but she accidentally held the phone a foot from my face while texting him and I couldn't help). It's getting to the point that I don't really know how to bring up my feelings or my concerns without getting shot down, brushed off, or made to be the bad guy because I ""don't have enough self esteem"". I want this to work, I love her (I should mention there have been good mixed in with the bad since she's been home, but with how charged everything is, the bad sticks out) and I want to have children with her someday. I love how happy he makes her, I sincerely do, and the idea of sex doesn't even really bother me that much, but the lack of courtesy she's shown to my feelings is really wearing on me. I'm not sure what to do at this point."

I am originally a mechanical engineer. However seeing the demand and earning potential in computer science I changed my career route, and end up with a low pay, long year internship at a global giant. 

I am content with my current situation, however economical meltdown is coming to my country (Turkey), and I want to be ready for it.

My expenses are low, and if I tighten the belt a lot more, I can save nearly entirety of my paycheque. However saving money may not help me in the long term if real shit happens and political instability follows.

So in some sense I want to prepare for the end of the world and become mobile and tough for survival.

Where do I start ? What should I do ?
Like gradually saving food ( dried beans, protein bars etc ), learning how to camp maybe? Create a high duty minimalist wardrobe ?

72ucl5,1,2017-09-27,Not sure how to handle logging around lunch hours,_axelp_,workplace,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace/comments/72ucl5/not_sure_how_to_handle_logging_around_lunch_hours/,"I'm a new co-op at a defense contractor (co-ops are like interns who have longer assignments, more job duties (sometimes), and work through various parts of the year). This is my second week on the job, and I'll be here for the next three months. I really like the DIB and I'm hoping to secure a job right after my co-op, so I want to make a good impression. 

During my HR orientation I was told that logging correct hours is very important to the company as they hold random audits. I have been very compliant in making sure I show up on time (or if I run a little late, I'll work the equivalent time after work). Now I have to say that when it requires, I will stay at work all-night, even without OT, to get the job done. I'm very committed to my work.

However, I don't know how to handle lunches. For lunch, I always bring my lunch, and I eat at my desk. I either have something light, or soylent which means I'm doing something while eating, not just sitting around. We all have our hours publicly posted (just in case we need to get a hold of one another), and it seems that everyone logs stays here for 8.5 hours (with half an hour for lunch). But I feel like I'm getting a little cheated for working through my lunch (half)hour. The other employees are mixed between going home (if they live nearby), eating at their desk, or eating at the cafeteria. 

Right now I get to work at 0800 and leave at 1730. (I do work an hour extra, but that's something else, just pretend 9 hours is the normal working week). So that adds up to 9 hours + half an hour for lunch. Is it appropriate to leave even before 1730 since I don't take that long for lunch, or should I just keep my head down and but in the extra 20 or so minutes for free?

Thank you!

72ue7v,2,2017-09-27,"Reflecting on my (first) LTR, trying to learn",jhfzfhj37,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/72ue7v/reflecting_on_my_first_ltr_trying_to_learn/,"(Longer read as I would like to reflect)
I’m looking for some input on how to handle my LTR situation respectively what to improve next time (will drop this one soon). I’ve been successful employing TRP techniques with many different women to the extent that I felt very confident about my game and the way I act. However, I feel like I am starting to lose frame in my LTR I recently engaged into (I realize that losing some frame/control is a price to pay, but still). I met this girl and her friends at college, she’s from a conservative background (no sex until marriage). After 2 or 3 nights I took her up to my room and we had sex (she was a virgin). She was a little mad at herself after this and wanted to go down immediately after, I just ignored her until she admitted she was acting dumb. Fast forward, lots of common interests, clever, funny girl, good sex (could teach her) I did something I didn’t envision this year and got into an LTR with her (me being 23, her being 19).

This was like 4 months ago. Now due to me working in an internship right now, I’ve been far away from her for like 2 months now, I will see her again in roughly 2 week though when I’m back. The first couple of weeks went well, she sent me lots of kinky snaps and stuff (not useful but well), asked for me to send stuff, and texting was mostly brief (I’m not the biggest text fan) but still funny/sexy. No shit tests at all, I could joke around all I wanted, she was just fine. I was pretty happy but things changed around a week ago or so. The kinky snaps came to an absolute halt and the shit tests started to come in. I’ll give some examples and my handling, which I think wasn’t bad (but maybe she already fucked with my game, it used to work perfectly fine)

Brings up dick size of blacks, how it must be (I ignored the text for a day which led to her texting on different channels and then just said that now she has no excuse not taking it all in once I’m back)
Brings up boys who had a crush on her (again I ignored for a longer than usual and said something like, seems like you are quite a popular person in a non butthurt fashion)
Brings up open relationships (here I feel I didn’t do too well, I just said I rather break up and pursue other woman than care about a woman that sleeps with other dudes)

This led to her eventually being really clingy again (two days ago) and texting non-stop and being all flirty. I wanted to reward that by texting back quickly and responding to her texts such as I miss you by telling her so do I and stuff (I thought I managed but I fear I was giving in too quickly here).

However, the day after the shit started again. Randomly bringing up how catholics should preserve themselves where I just said, ""just assume I am Jesus"" which was met will rolled eyes. Then she ghosted for 5 hours before she briefly texted before going to bed (without the emojis and sweet talk, which I started to enjoy, fuck myself, but just to give you an idea of how she tries to portray things are different). Since she is normally very predictable, these changes seem odd to me. Basically I came to the conclusion, I must drop her after I came back and had sex with her (if it stills works). However, I’d like to get some input from the more experienced LTR guys (maybe those who had some long distance periods as well) and what I could have done better for the next time, should this ever happen again or if this shit is expected and I should carry on. I think pretty much only my (missing) dread game is to blame, but I did go out a lot and often take some time to respond, so not sure why it was so bad. Maybe it was stupid to basically text her every night before going to bed? I demand the same from her though. For the time being, I plan on not to respond to her at all (I usually text her when I go to bed) and wait/see if she texts at any point tomorrow. Then be brief and delay a lot. Is that a sound idea? Thanks for any input."

72ujrv,10,2017-09-27,A deeper look into the NFL.,sweaty_clitoris,conspiracyundone,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone/comments/72ujrv/a_deeper_look_into_the_nfl/,"**TL&amp;DR: 
The corruption in the NFL may be more widespread than originally thought and is just another psych-op to distract and divide the American people.**  

This post is not at all politically driven, and I couldn't care less what position anyone has on the topic. It is just another example of identity politics being used to divide the masses and create a distraction from what is actually going on in the world. They want us fighting among ourselves instead of addressing the important issues. 

I want to start off with a quote: 
&gt;panem et circenses

This translates to ""Bread and Circuses"". It was coined by a latin poet in describing how the majority of Roman citizens couldn't care less about politics and voting, as long as they were fed and entertained. I believe this has proved true by the test of time. 

The first person I want to address is Roger Goodell. He has spent his entire career in the NFL, first as an intern and now all the way to commission. While the rise of his career is certainly attributed to his ""dedication"" and ""hardwork"", maybe nepotism had a helping hand. 

His father, Charles Goodell was a Yale graduate and congressman. He was appointed to the US Senate by Nelson Rockefeller after the RFK assassination. He served the seat for nearly 2 years and even faced legal challenges for such a long, unelected term. During that time he was one of the only anti-war Republicans. His opposition was back by [President Nixon](https://townhall.com/columnists/rogerstone/2016/06/29/would-the-gipper-endorse-the-donald-n2185373) and he was defeated. 

After he lost the next election, he becomes a ghost. Wikipedia is very vague on anything he did after his Senate term. For one, he was appointed by President Ford to his inner circle, [see here.](http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Watergate/Watergate%20Items%2017846%20to%2018094/Watergate%2017894.pdf) Also, it appears he joined and was active in [DGA.](https://www.dga.org/). I have read before he was involved in the Bush Sr. Administration, but I do not have a source for that. 

Even though the WP is CIA propaganda, this [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/sports/roger-goodell-is-very-powerful-heres-which-nfl-team-owners-have-his-ear/1813/) can be used to see how Goodell came to power. His primary backers included Kraft, Jones, Mara's, and Rooney's. Those 4 NFL owners undoubtedly yield tremendous influence in the league, the Rooney's and Mara's are even related through marriage. 

Several of the NFL owners donated to Trump's campaign. Kraft, Jones, Snyder, Johnson and Glazer (I omitted anyone who also gave 10K+ to Democrat super-PACs). If we go off the WP article talking about the influence different owners have in the league, only Jones and Kraft have any influence. Jones sided with Trump, while Kraft disagreed. I think this is important to see how easily the owners who actually hold the power, are influencing the argument. The other 3 owners have not even issued a comment on the matter, not that it would make a difference.  The WP even refers to them as ""irrelevant"". 

Dan Rooney, the former Steeler's chairman, and owner was appointed US Ambassador to Ireland in 2008 by Barrack Obama. He had previously donated 30K to his campaign, but I'm sure that was unrelated and not possibly linked to any pay-to-play schemes. 

The last point I would like to make. Robert Mueller, the same person investigating the Russia hacking/influencing the election as well as being the FBI director during and after 9/11, was in charge of investigating the NFL's investigation into the Ray Rice abuse. The NFL claimed they had never seen the elevator video prior to it being leaked. Robert Mueller was the person who confirmed this, even though the league had the video in their possession.

I reluctantly agreed. Since then she's never let up on me:

* always buying me coffee, lunches, cases of soda
* I usually take the bus into work and she drove me home whenever she could.
* Always tried to get my attention with questions about work, school, etc.
* Offered to take me to Brazil (her home country) for two weeks (I said no).
* Offers to take me out to lunch now and then.
* Came in one day and tried to hug me saying that she ""missed me""
* Complimented me on a shirt that I wore saying that it ""matched my eyes"".
* Twice followed me around in her car and begged me to get back in (I wanted to be let out since she drives like a maniac).
* Said that she wanted to follow me to another city when I let her know I was thinking about moving.
* Lots of sexually suggestive language: ""can I get a massage with a happy ending?"" ""I'm going to buy you a whip"", ""I need to be spanked"" etc. etc.
* Begged me to stay at the company I'm working for when I let her know I was going to look for another job.
* And much much more. I think you get the picture though.

I wrote that list above and have a longer list myself to convince you that I'm not deluding myself.

Well this went on for years and me being in a crappy relationship with my GF one day my heart gives in.

She had to stop at the DMV before dropping me off. Asked me to sit in the seat next to her but I stood (everybody looked at me like I was nuts). She had to run an errand afterward before 6pm so she said that I was ""stuck with her"". Asked me to go and get a bite to eat with her. While finally driving me home, I ask her to pull over and say that I have feelings for her (which is true). Days later she explains that she doesn't want a BF right now. BF/GF was never my intention though I think that would be a nice outcome. Of course its awkward at the office and she avoided me for a while as I would expect. I still don't understand what she was trying to pull and my guess is that she didn't either.

So I go thru the standard crappy cycle that everyone who experiences unrequited love does but she doesn't stop and it gives me false hope and it really really sucks ...

I got an offer from another company in another state and accepted. My current ""girlfriend"" won't be moving with me. Now she (the intern) says that she'll ""find me"" and fly up to visit. Bought me lunch again and still buys me coffee. Still comes to me asking questions and for help with her homework. When I recieved another offer (current city we are in) yesterday she was noticibly dissapointed when I told her I wasn't going to take it.

Honestly I don't understand this. I'd like to say that I want it to stop but her ""love"" (attention) feels great. I feel very protective of her (she is naive) and don't want to fall out of contact. I would also like to help her attain her professional goals. She doesn't have her civil engineering license and I do. She captured my heart the first Saturday we worked together when she said how excited she was going from a barefoot farm girl in Brazil to a professional engineer.

Man... heartbreak.

From 187 to 144, progress pics included (NSFW)",spearmintskies,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/72vi1g/goal_ish_from_187_to_144_progress_pics_included/,"Hello! I'll start off by saying this isn't my first post. [These are my progress photos: 42.6 lb loss](https://imgur.com/a/Z74OI)

I made a progress post a year ago that still has a lot of applicability to my success, so that is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/52si2o/10_of_my_body_gone_progress_pics_and_a_sv_187_to/) What I posted then still applies today, and this is it: 

A few things I've learned while doing this:

* Prioritize yourself. You are important. You're really important. Your health is important and what/how much you eat, how well you sleep, whether you go outside every day will affect you in the long run. And other people depend on you too whether you believe that or not.

* CICO is super simple, but it's not easy. Discipline really is more important than motivation. Work on developing discipline and it won't be too tough when you lose motivation (And that is when, not if.)

* The little things add up. Choosing to eat Halo Top every night and instead of Ben and Jerry's does add up. Cutting out literally ONE soda out of the week, adds up. And then all those little habits you've developed over time will make you wake up one day and go, ""What the fuck?"" because they'll have accumulated into lots of big habits that have now improved your life.

* Get a support system. Be it your parents, friends, partner, you guys, coworkers, therapists, doctors, nutritionists, you name it. Do the thing. The people who love you will help you and be there for you. It is okay to ask for help! 

* Don't be afraid to step back and take a break once in a while. It gives your brain a little break and your body a little shock that will rev up your mind and system again to keep going. You will not be a failure if you do this, no matter what your brain is telling you. But in the same strain:

* **LOG EVERYTHING.** Every single stupid gram of cheese and every single scoop of protein powder and that 500g of broccoli that ends up being 170 calories and chocolate drizzle on top of your morning coffee. You weigh that shit, and you log that shit.

* You cannot control water weight. Drink more water.

* There is no such thing as bad food. There is no such thing as good food.

* Sometimes it's best to think statistically about the whole thing. CICO is mathematics, after all. Don't tie negative emotions to the number on the scale or in MFP. If you wake up a pound heavier today, you log that number and move on. it's just one spot on the downhill trend that is your weight and body fat and the uphill trend that is your mental, physical, and emotional health.



I was in a bad place a few years back. A year and a half ago, I began to realize how important prioritizing my health was, and started my journey of discipline/CICO/IF. Since posting last year, I've been focusing mainly on development of discipline and putting my health first, out of love, not contempt.


I had been losing 6lbs, gaining 2, rinsing and repeating. I had a hard time moving past 153 pounds or so (whether it was physical or mental, I'm not sure). I went to Thailand this summer for a month-long lab/research internship in urban development and production of spirulina, and when I came back, I discovered I had hit my goal weight! 


I can't say that I'm completely done losing weight yet. But this is the first major goal, the goal I have been trying to reach for 5 years, since I had my baby. Maybe I'll decide to go until 140, or 135. I plan to start an exercise regime as soon as I'm over the bronchitis I contracted in Thailand. Heh, perhaps I'm a bit scared of maintenance too. 

**EDIT: you guys are all so flipping nice! I'm trying to keep up with your comments and feedback. Thank you all so much for your support. Also, I got some requests for a facial comparison, so I added that in there to the best of my ability. I can't say I really enjoyed photos of myself back then.**

it all probably started 3 years ago (not really sure, maybe earlier, I'm kind of a loner and don't communicate with other people a lot, even my family). He started university and probably at that point started gambling, dropped out after the first semester due attendance, kept lying to us till start of the 3rd semester that he is still going to uni, in reality probably was gambling all the time.

He was living in apartment that belongs to our dad and working for my dad, but our dad has harsh character and that did not work out well, my brother was gambling during work hours (for job he needed to drive across country). That did not work out well, they got in fight and stopped talking. my brother was not going to work anymore. Dad got him another job, things started to look better for him, at that point he also won big, he was earning decent salary, ocasionaly gambling, and won like 8000$. did not touch that money, and was quite smart with it at least for few months. he also plays a lot videogames, so he bought high end gaming laptop (which he have already destroyed in anger of losing csgo game) and good phone, but got it used.

something happened and lost it all, also went in payday loan debt about 3000$ in few weeks. lost job due few factors, one probably was again gambling during work and speeding tickets, also crashed companys car while browsing phone.

for last 9 months he is living with me and my wife, I tried to help but I can't anymore, i'm very close to beat his sorry ass and toss it on street. Reason he lives with me is, that he mentioned that he wants to learn CS and programming, I'm software developer and thought that I could help him learning while he lives with me. but he is lazy as hell, was playing games all day till destroyed his gaming laptop, i gave him my old thinkpad which does not run any games, instead of learning he was watching twitch and playing heartstone all the time. 

I got eneough of that and asked him to get job, he got internship in some web agency startup. startup was complete disaster, incompetent devs that also was not teaching him anything, there even was no work to do, most days he had to ""work"" from home. After 2 months startup stopped paying him (or he lied that he still works there) I also asked multiple times, that he starts looking for real job and pays his debt, so he can finaly move out and live his own life. after few weeks i decided to check how many CV he has sent- he was lying, did not send any.

I made ultimatum- 1 week to find job with decent salary or get out. He started to work as taxi driver, which sux, because taxi drivers are the biggest gambler, on top of that he gets paid in cash, so it is impossible for me to control him.

I have huge suspicions he gambled his whole salary last time and now lies that he got in accident, that is why he got paid less and salary was late 1 week (paid weekly)

On top of all this he gambles away every last penny he gets from mother or me. (I thought he stopped when he moved in with me). constantly lies about everything, like literally everything. Have stolen money from my wife's and my wallets. have stolen from fathers wallet.

I'm very close to beat his sorry ass and throw him on street, boiling in anger. 

any advice how to help him?"
72vqb3,3,2017-09-27,"My [20 M] girlfriend [19 F] of one year wants to start spending more time apart. This happens after spending a lot of time together, basically 24/7 with each other during the summer.",whiteguyoftheyear,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/72vqb3/my_20_m_girlfriend_19_f_of_one_year_wants_to/,"After spending all the time together during the summer she has finally told me that she wants to spend significantly less time together. I have come to understand that she likes to have time for herself as most people do, but it was not an easy thing to learn. I had a difficult time trying to understand why she didn't want to spend a lot of time together because I did. In the beginning we argued about this but I eventually realized that I am the one with the problem and that giving her space and time would be better in the end. Whenever she would want some time for herself I asked her to tell me and then I would grant that. 

At first it was just a couple of hours and then we would spend more time with each other and we would enjoy it. She eventually stopped asking for time for herself, this was around summer, and we began working at the same spot, we didn't see each other much but it would defiantly be bad if the company found out that we were dating. I did not care for this because I disliked working at the company but kept working there because I wanted to make some extra money, but she really wanted to keep the job so she became very paranoid about us being caught showing affection in public. This caused some trouble but we got though it, and I decided that I would try to show less affection in general just because I also knew that she enjoys it but she never really returned it or enjoyed it as much as I did. It was fine, but I got tired of that and decided to quit the job so that her paranoia would lessen and maybe she would return to normal, but it did not happen in fact the opposite happened, we spent less time with each other. Her hours also changed to where she basically entered work at the same time, got an hour lunch and got out an hour later. She also got a raise during this time and began to enjoy working at the old work place more, when before she was on the verge of quitting because she disliked it. She claims that it is that she wants the experience so that it would benefit her future, but it was not easy for me to take all that in. Now we were spending a lot less time together and when we were I kept trying to get an answer as to why the change and she said it was the change in office, this was on the verge of happening when I was about to quit. It took alot of time to get that answer out of her and some arguing but eventually she told me. 

Now classes are about to begin at my university and with that comes all the clubs and internships that she is involved with are also about to start. She does not plan on quitting anytime soon and she has told me that she is sick and tired of me say stuff about her job, which I stopped saying because I want nothing but happiness for her, and this would mean that we will spend very little time not seeing each other. I was ok with that because I knew that she would not be willing to bend about her carrier since she is going into a field that has very little job opportunities so she needs all the help she can get, but recently she told me that she wants to spend less time with each other apart from all the time that we spend apart because of work and school. This crushed me because I couldn't understand why she would want to take away from the already very little time that we have together and I tried to convince her but it was to no avail because she would not budge claiming that it was only temporary and it would make us appreciate the time that we spent together even more. I eventually agreed on the condition that we would make an effort to truly enjoy and have fun on the days and time that we spent together. At this point I can say that it was really tough and that it was going to get a bit tougher going from spending all the time together to basically 2 or 3 hours a day. I can say that I skulcked the nest day because of this and another argument ensued where she tild me that she would be ok with us just sleeping together after a long day of doing our own thing. I was at a loss for words because it made me feel as though she really did not care if we spend time together or not, but I did not know what to say apart from asking her if she was serious and she said yes. She followed that by saying that even if we are in the same room on some days she would just do her own thing and not give me attention. I was just hurt beyond belief and I teared up a bit, but we continued talking, the argument simmered down to talking, and this is where she hit me with a hydrogen bomb of devastation. She told me that she wants to start hanging out whit her friends even more, this is also different from the time that she would get to be by herself and I was torn because not it went to a couple hours a day to a couple hours a week and I didn't know what to do. 

She did not stop at friends though she said that she wanted to talk and go on dates with other guys. This killed me and I died a bit and had my voice cracking as I talked and felt like it was harder to talk now. She said that it was not anything sexual she just wants to occasionally go out on a ""first date"" type of situation with other guys. Our relationship was on the more open end but this still hurt because now she was going to spend little time every couple of days and she wants to hang out with other guys, which we agreed to no sex or anything intimate just hang out, because she says she enjoys meeting people and talking to older more wise people, but I am devastated and keep thinking about this because I feel like I may become neglected and lonely where she seems like she is fine and in fact very ok with all of which she said. She also gave me the options of seeing other people too but I just feel hurt that she would want to reduce all the time that we spend together to what feels like nothing, and I do not know what to say do or thing. I want to hear from other people's experiences and see what I can make of this, and I do not have anyone to turn to for a help at a time like this.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: GF of an year wants so spend almost no time together interacting and expressing our affection toward each other. She would rather spend time at work, school, with friends, and ""dating"" other people, and still have time for herself, and all of this worries me and I need some advice on what to do."

I graduated in May with my BSN &amp; started working at a medium sized hospital in the float pool. I've heard before that the float pool is a challenging place for new grads but it is my only option at this hospital. I have 14 weeks of orientation &amp; am approaching week 11. I was hired for nights but I'm switching over to evenings because I didn't function well during nights.

A little background. Good student in college, had a 10 week summer internship in a Surgical ICU &amp; had vast clinical experiences.

Anyways, I never thought nursing would be this challenging. Knowledge and assessment wise, I feel confident in my abilities. What I am really struggling with is time management skills, knowing when to communicate with different members of the healthcare team &amp; being able to remember all the different concerns/events that happen during the day. The float pool is specifically challenging because every floor has different physicians &amp; numbers to contact. I'm usually okay when I have 4 or 5 patients but when I have 6 and on the occasion 7 patients I start to get lost. What usually happens is that my preceptor will step in &amp; start doing a lot of the work. This frustrates me because I know in a couple of weeks I'm not going to have someone directly by my side. Some other challenges that I face are documentation. I usually stay about an hour past my shift to finish charting. Besides all of this, I do enjoy my job but the stress is getting to me &amp; I don't want to fail at what I've worked so hard for. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!"

I am a Macc student with a few years experience in non-accounting related work.  I have a few office visits for audit/assurance internships, and am extremely interested in going the technical accounting route. A few questions:

1. I've read that staff associates are not on these teams. Can anyone confirm that?
2. Should I mention my interest in this group in my office visits? Would that be off-putting to a manager?

In one of my initial interviews, a firm brought up their new TAC group - and after she started talking about it, I knew its exactly what I wanted to do. So I am trying to gauge my best options for getting into this.

Thanks!

72wszp,8,2017-09-27,Wheres the Clorox: Chapter 1,EbrietasSonOfEcgtheo,surrealmemes,https://www.reddit.com/r/surrealmemes/comments/72wszp/wheres_the_clorox_chapter_1/,"One day, a legion of rebels gathered on the edge of a lake, and one of the captains asked the leader to tell the men a story of encouragement before battle. And he started “One day, a legion of rebels gathered…” and his story began to fold in upon itself infinitely, each iteration going faster and faster until he was telling it 1000 times a second. 10,000 times a second. 1,000,000 times a second! Reality was beginning to warp. The men’s eyes widened in horror as the soldiers closest to the leader were getting sucked toward the leader and crushed. Exploding into higher dimensional memes no one could comprehend, Orangs and vegitals shot out from the leader at near light speed. Eyes began to grow on some of the soldiers faces as their irony levels sky rocketed. Those whose minds and bodies failed to adapt were sucked into the normie void and soon only eight remained. Those eight's heads were completely engulfed in eyes, save for their now growing mouths. Their innards began to dissolve and regurgitated out their mouths, only to resolidify as writhing tendrils. The army they were previously going to fight, came over the hill and saw across the lake 8 heads floating higher and higher up to the a circling green vortex in the sky from which they saw surreal nightmares emerge. The commander at the sight went “nope, nope… no no no” and proceeded back the other way. The bodies of the normi soldiers melted into a swirling slushy in the sky. The floating eye covered entities consumed the liquid flesh, and grew to enormous size. As the army gazed across the lake in utter confusion, the commander continued back down the hill, He remembered this event was depicted in a picture as a prophecy.
 &lt;intermission&gt; Time for a nerdy math joke that only nerdy maths majors will understand! So there was this guy whose job was to take the second derivative of parabolic functions… but he quit his job because it was too flat! He then proceeded to down an entire bottle of clorox. &lt;/intermision&gt;
 The commander got down on his knees and bowed in worship of the surreal meme masters as they ascended to a higher plane of thought “OH GREAT MEME MASTERS, MAY WE BE BLESSED WITH IRONY”, and thusly he was granted an irony level of -1. Now even his irony level was ironic, he was the first and last mortal meme lord of such high rank during this millennia. He will go down into myth and legend as The Buddha. He, the Buddha, arose from the ground, arms raised in gratitude of his new higher dimensional gift from beyond this realm. The portal in the sky closed, and the men stared at where it once was in hope of its return so they to could ascend. But alas, it would not return for another 1,000,000 years, not until the next person utters the sacred text for which no mortal knows. It can only be found by chance, and on this day, some lucky boi struck gold. The Grey Beards back in the city felt the DANK and S U R R E A L shock wave. The normally modest monks would party hard that night in celebration, listening to more ironic music from the future called DUBSTEP.
The Grey Beards found this living myth, the man with a negative irony, and brought him to their monastery. There they trained him in the ways of the DANK in the hopes he may one day save us from the cult of the normie. His irony however was too great, and much to their disappointment, no one could translate his higher dimensional tongue. They had given him a scroll to write on in hopes they could one day translate it, this is what he wrote. ”Я дрейфую через неизвестное как более высокое размерное существо, и где находится ANGERY” the monks of the silver facial hair could not decipher this strange language no matter how hard they tried, but they soon discovered that these strange writings held great power, for you see, he was able to hear the eight great meme lords, and he wrote their strange utterings in the only language that could depict such dankness. And to this day, travelers still go to to the lake where the DANK portal had opened to feast on the liquefied flesh of those who were left behind in hopes that they may rise a level or two. The water too is considered sacred, and many people from the village would go there to bath. This idea of bathing in a natural body of water is the first ever record of what we would consider Beach Going.
And next to that lake, there is a temple.he who hears the dank ones resides in this temple. He spends his days scrawling the DANK utterings onto sacred parchment given to him by the Grey Beards. His body was failing because his S U R R E A L level was too high for his current plane of existence. And so he died, leaving behind hundreds of indecipherable symbols, each with a power beyond human comprehension. Deeming these symbols too DANK for humanity to possess, the Grey Beards sealed the lakeside temple.
But now, 10,000 years later, after the Greybeards have long since been forgotten, the temple was rediscovered by mankind. The Buddha before he died was discovered to have learned some of our normi language and described one if his symbols to us; he said “It is the way of the future” followed by ☭. This confused many, as the USSR had long since collapsed. Until one day, one of the workers tasked with uncovering the tomb had an epiphany; WE MUST BRING BACK COMMUNISM! 
His name was Bernie Sanders. While he was exploring the tomb, he came running out of the cave with nothing on and fell to his knees. He then stared straight at the sun without blinking and screamed continuously for 10 minutes without pause. After his eyes had melted out of their sockets, he screamed “I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT! I CAN SEE THEIR DANK MEMES! OH DANK ONES, ALLOW ME COMPREHENSION OF YOUR DANKNESS!” But the Dank ones would not allow it. His feeble normie mind could not comprehend their S U R R E A L memes. And so he was cursed to view these memes, without the ability to comprehend them.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to get clown costumes for the village presents &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

His highest irony level he was able to achieve thus far in his life was 5, and even then it wasn't very convincing. Sadness and ANGERY enveloped him, and he continued screaming for another 20 minutes or so. His archaeologist colleagues this whole time were utterly confused as they witnessed this well known political figure convert to communism, run out of a cave naked, and scream at the sun, all in the space of an hour. The archeologists dragged the screaming naked, wrinkly old man across the ground to the medical tent at the excavation site, where they bandaged his eyeless sockets, and gave him a cup of coco. The boss came, putting a caring hand on bernie’s shoulder “now bernie, why don’t you tell me what happened?”. They could tell Bernie was trying to cry by the sounds he made but no tears came. He gathered himself and said in a wavering tone, “I have seen true dankness [sniffles], boi, I saw Richard Simmons”. Everyone gasped, Richard Simmons was the DANKEST meme lord to ever live, in his prime back in 1980 he was a worldwide sensation during the era they call, “The Fitness Revolution”. But that movement died off, after all it is the year 8192. 
The spirit of Richard Simmons was now trying to communicate through Bernie, that the world was in grave danger. But from what, they didn't know, because Bernie lacked the irony level necessary to understand beings from the upper plane. Thus the archeologists determined they needed to raise Sander’s irony, and luckily they knew of an ancient ruin where they could do exactly that. &lt;intermission&gt; We interrupt your regularly scheduled surreal program to bring you a word from our sponsors: Have you ever needed to get high on irony? Do you ever feel like your irony level is dropping? Are you only a 3 dimensional creature? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, then you need Clorox®. To use, simply take a pleasant swig of Clorox’s flavored, natural concoction, and feel the lasting effects immediately. Clorox: Stimulate your senses &lt;/intermission&gt;
The archeologists used the Dustymobile to speed old Bernie to the ruins of the Biggest Clorox factory ever built. This great facility was known as Clerot hall. Here they would have to delve into the depths of dankness to obtain the very last bottle of Clorox in existence.
	There they stood, at the foot of this monument of memetry, they bowed their heads in respect for the great meme lords of the past, now long since fallen. Remembering all those who had tried to drink of the nectar but alas, we're not S U R R E A L enough to endure its intense high. This being the last clorox factory it was seen as a national park of sorts to the remaining DANKSTERS. After Oxiclean took over Clorox, they declared this factory off limits to the public. Oxiclean destroyed all but one of the Clorox factories to remember what they had conqord. If they were to embark on this adventure, there’d be no going back. Once they step foot into that cavernous warehouse, they’d be fugitives.
	Bernie and the archeologist took that first step into the sacred tomb, and descended the first great staircase on their journey to the center of the maze like factory. The Archeologists guided Bernie, as he was blind but for his visions of the DANK ones memes. The DANKNESS transcended the limits of language and bestowed Bernie with an ineffable, unfathomable truth of: VEGITAL BADDDDDD!!!! Though they didn’t know it at the time, this was a prophesy of the hardships they'd face within the factory.
At the bottom of the staircase laid their first challenge, a vast open room, completely dark except for what little light fell from the top of the stairs. They'd have to traverse true darkness if they were to reach their goal, but they couldn't have known at the time, that vegetal hid within the shadows of that great void. They heard it scuttle along the hard floor somewhere far ahead of them but could not see it. It reverberated through the large chamber and it sounded as if the VEGITAL was everywhere at once. They cringed at the feeling of the cold air on their skin as they proceeded into the darkness with the VEGITAL.
Bernies eye sockets stung intensely in the presence of this creature of dankitude, and the archeologist had to drag the nude and screaming old man across the cold cement floor. This screaming is what attracted the vegital to their location. They found that whistling the tune of Thomas the Dank Engine worked the best in silencing him. But it was too late. Vegetal appeared out of the darkness, and grabs Bernie with his mouth, and began trying to drag him into the shadows. The archeologists tried to pull Sanders from the creature's grasp, but the very laws of physics were warped within its presence, and force didn't work the same. Then one of the archeologists used this to his advantage, and broke Bernie’s legs off at the knees, freeing him from the monster’s jaw. The biggest of the archeologists put Sanders on his back like chewbaca did with C-3PO that one time, and they ran to what they could only hope would be an escape. They heard vicious hissing behind them as the vile creature tried to gain on them, when all of a sudden, one of the archeologist interns tripped and fell to the floor. The rest of the gang took advantage and used him as a distraction to buy them a little more time. 
&lt;obituary&gt; To the family of the intern: he was… good…. i guess. I mean he turned in his work on time… honestly was the most average intern we ever had &lt;/obituary&gt;
The vegetal consumed the one known as Greg while the rest ran away in fear. After that, vegetal seemed sated for the time being, and they were able to make it out of the void safely. They enter the next room, a single light source hangs by a thin wire dimly illuminating the room. Cracks fill the ceiling letting small amounts of sunlight protrude the room, while other cracks slowly drip drops of Clorox onto the floor, forming small puddles across the floor, and slowly flowing towards the single drain In the room. In front of the archeologists are 13 pedestals of stone, on each sits a bottle, or a container of some sort, each one different from the last. A floating teapot is in the center of the room, the guardian and messenger of not only Richard Simmons, but the omniscient SURREAL being above and beyond Simmons. Meme Man. The teapot speaks “These are the remaining Clorox products, drink from the original, and you will be granted ultimate SURREAL levels and unfathomable DANKNESS. Choose wrongly, and suffer the agonizing death of drinking bleach, followed by facing the eternal wrath of the King of the underworld, 4chan”.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to take Richard Simmons to soccer practice &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

The archeologists looked to Bernie, as he rose to his stubs, and reached for a bottle he was not tall enough to grasp “it is this one! I can sense the dankness contained within.” An archeologist was about to hand it to Sanders when another stopped him “wait, if that's the wrong one, then our only hope for saving humanity is lost with Bernie... one of us must drink it…” he said, looking at the other three archeologists making up their team of five. With a shaking hand, the smallest of the group reached for the bottle “I volunteer as tribute!” The others gladly allowed him to take the first swig, and were verified in their fear when the frail archeologist began melting before their very eyes. The ground began to quiver and the ground under the drinkers feet started glowing green in a clover leaf pattern. The emblem on the ground opened, revealing a portal from which trashy normi pepe memes shot out. The cancer it wielded was so great that it changed from a figure of speech to actual pepe's with rapidly growing cancer in their eyes. The half melted man let out a blood curdling scream that tore through the air just be for the ground swallowed him whole. The ground then sealed shut just as fast as it had appeared, thus sealing his fate to the Nazi ridden normis of the deep. But wait, the teapot speaks! “You choose… Wrong...” the archeologists stared at Bernie, their faith in him now thoroughly shaken. “Uh-uh-oopsies, which bottle did I point to? Sorry I can't see anything without eyes, I think I meant this bottle over here” the others looked at him skeptically, but had no choice but to trust him, after all, humanity's fate was in this naked legless mans hands. It wasn't until after this horrific ordeal that they realized he pointed to an Oxiclean mix, it literally said it right on the container. They went to the bottle he was pointing to, it was Tide Detergent… Without telling him, they instead went to.a different one, the only bottle that actually had a Clorox logo. They said “Oh, you mean this one?” Bernie , pointing in a totally different direction shouted at the wall “Oh Yes! That's the one!”
Much more confident in his chances, the next archeologist took a swig from this bottle. His eyes began to grow, his jaw unhinged like a snake, and from deep inside of him, a blood soaked human fetus crawled out his mouth. The archaeologist's body fell to the ground with a thud, his eyes continuing to grow past the size of soccer balls, and the fetus raised its slimy head, and stared with unseeing eyes at Bernie “I C A N S E E T H E S U R R E A L! T H I S I S T H E B O T T L E!” The others stared with wide eyes as they realized this fetus was actually a reincarnation of their friend (George). The bottle was passed over to Bernie with careful handling. He took the container and… he dropped it, Bernie actually dropped it, what an idiot. The Clorox formed a pool on the old grimy concrete floor and mixed with some of the dirt and dust, making a brown tinted mixture. The others looked at him angrily “Lick it up.” one said bluntly.Bernie promptly started licking the wrong part of the floor, consuming a large amount of god knows what before the others were able to stop giggling and guide him to the puddle.
With each lick, Sanders’s tongue grew longer and longer, and soon other tongues started snaking out from the old man’s mouth, which all also started licking up the contaminated dankness fluid. Then, on the end of each of Bernie’s now numerous tongues, an eyeball sprouted “I CAN SEE!” Bernie shouted, tongues sticking out, as he gazed around the room with his free roaming sensory organs. He leans forward on his extended arms and arched his back, then with all his might he let out an even louder shriek, a call to his higher dimensional companions. The fetus George soon joined in Bernie's call, and together they summoned the great Richard Simmons. He appeared in a flash of holy light, floating a few feet off the ground “congratulation my children, you have done well to make it this far” he put a hand on Bernie’s shoulder “I have come to tell you, Bernie, that the world needs your guidance. They need you to bring back communism…” Bernie stared with all five of his prehensile sensory organs “I - I'll do it Mr Simmons, I'll bring back communism” he said with awe and stuck out tongues. “I know you will son… I know you will…” and with that, the Great Richard simmons vanished back into the DANKNESS.

Or maybe I just got off to early. I feel like an older medical student at best. Since day 1 of residency I've been such a clear fish out of water. Everyone came in apparently knowing how to handle to stress of being an intern. They knew the ordersets. They knew the EMR and how to get all the right info. They knew the major dispo stuff. They knew how to read an X-ray and ECG for most things. Things just kind of flowed for them. Presenting patients came naturally and they didn't look like incompetent fools on rounds. And then there's me.

I get my patients mixed up. They all blur together for me. It takes me forever to pick up what's relevant with a patient. I'm almost always the last one to leave to actually examine my patients. Sometimes I cut corners because I don't have time. Then on rounds seniors will always have more to add to my plans than any other interns. Consistently. Across rotations. And it soon becomes clear to everyone, though of course they'll never say it, that I'm the fuck up. 

The crazy thing is I did well on my boards. I honored and half passed all my rotations. I could hold my own as a student. But I never graduated from that role. And now everyday I go in for work, I know my pride's about to take a bruising. And the worst part is I can't even blame anyone. My seniors are great. My attendings are nice. My residency offers a lot of resources and hours that usually aren't half bad. I just....suck. 

I've talked to the chiefs about it but you just get that BS reaffirming stuff that you know they're supposed to say. But I guess this digs deeper for me. Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest. And now the boards are coming and studying for them is eating me alive. And I'm being singled out by the seniors who can't believe they could inherit such an incompetent idiot.

Career options?",Envgeol,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/72xbvl/environmental_geology_bs_in_houston_1_year_from/,"I'm interested in finding a bit more in my area; my degree plan is pitched as an Environmental Science degree with a Geology Specialization. 

That said, the environmental science aspect is present in almost all of my classes, but as i'm progressing into my senior level classes I'm finding enjoyment in the strict Geoscience courses. 

I've taken classes like environmental sampling, environmental health and safety, and then environmental bio, geo, chem. The last three were all just basic 3300 level courses with their take on environmental science added in.

Here's where I stand:

Basic skills in: AutoCAD, GIS, Hydrus, Excel.

I know my way around a computer and have been building/formatting/using new/different Operating systems for the past 10+ years. 

My technical writing and people skills are pretty on point I'd like to say. 

At this point I'm just itching to finish my degree and actually get out into the job market. 

Internship ideas are welcome but could anyone lay out a few of the fields that I have open to me in a city like Houston?

Edit** Are there any industry level geoscience/environmental skills that you recommend? If so, what/why?"

I'm a hs senior and I've always wanted to go to udub but I'm reconsidering due to the absolutely mad competitiveness you have to have in order to succeed.

So is WSUs CS program any good? One thing I'm concerned about is connections. Obviously UW is gonna win at that because Microsoft, Valve, Boeing, etc. all near UW but do you guys still have career fairs or internship opportunities or no?

Basically convince me to come to your school as someone who is generally friendly and likes to code."
72ytdh,16,2017-09-28,Completely defeated trying to find a graduate job.,Atlas383,oilandgasworkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgasworkers/comments/72ytdh/completely_defeated_trying_to_find_a_graduate_job/,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice/opinions on what I should do.

I graduated with my petroleum engineering degree about one and a half years ago in Australia (Perth) specifically and have been stuck looking for a job since. 

I guess I was unlucky to graduate during the downturn when oil prices were pretty much rock bottom so only a handful of people I know actually ended up with a graduate role. 

I'd done an internship during my degree but unfortunately it wasn't directly related to engineering. At the time, I was just more concerned with being able to get an internship in the first place as a lot of companies were either scrapping or downsizing their vacation/intern programs because of the downturn. 

To make things worst, a petroleum degree is much less versatile as I'd known people with a chemical or a mechanical engineering degree successfully applying for petroleum engineering positions but not the other way round. 

Since then, I've probably applied to more positions that I could remember (Both locally and internationally) but have either just been met with rejections or no responses whatsoever. Including emailing smaller companies. 

I've picked up odd hospitality jobs in the meantime which are completely unrelated to my field but it's been extremely frustrating for me as it's been such a long time since I've graduated without any relevant experience in industry. I've been told that graduates have a two year window in which they can apply for graduate roles after which companies don't bother with you anymore as they'd prefer fresh graduates. 

Anyone currently in a similar situation or have been previously, any advice you could offer? Specifically about the two year window for graduates? I just feel completely defeated at this whole situation and would hate to think I've wasted four years for nothing. "
72ywwe,78,2017-09-28,2 Years Sober,thehouseofjohndeaf,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/72ywwe/2_years_sober/,"Two years ago, today, I entered what I hope to be my last detox.  I had been to several detoxes before, many of which weren’t all that horrible.  The first detox was on a hospital unit; single room, tv, room service, one group a day.  I went back multiple times, often discharging and walking straight to the liquor store.  I tried therapy, psychiatry, IOPs, Prozac, Campral, Ritalin, Zoloft, etc.  Then I found myself in a detox that had about thirty beds and a courtyard where patients could smoke between groups, I went from there to my first thirty day program, which was like a five-star hotel.  At the time, I was under 26 and was still on my parents’ health insurance, which had allowed me these luxuries.  Yet, outside of a program I couldn’t stay sober more than three days.  I had failed out of art school, stopped playing music, lost multiple jobs and internship opportunities, lost friends, lost relationships.  Throughout all of this, from the ages of 19 to 26, I went through withdrawals on a weekly, and eventually daily basis.  Some nights I would go to bed after tying one on praying that I wouldn’t wake up the next morning.  Other nights, after a day of dry heaving and trying to keep the booze in my system, I would lay in bed shaking and sweating praying that this wasn’t how I went out, swearing to whatever powers that be that I wouldn’t touch another drop if could just stop feeling this way.  

I found myself back at my parents' house working a part-time job that paid for my alcohol costs of $20 to $60 a day.  Struggling between either driving to work while going through withdrawal, driving drunk, or calling out of work.  On an average day I would blackout, scare and piss off my family, wake up on the floor somewhere.  There were constant threats of being sectioned.  I was thrown out of the house every few days, left to wander the street, find my way to an AA meeting where someone else would drive me to my parents’ house and I’d swear this was the time I got sober.

A week before Christmas 2014 I caught an OUI and stayed sober for about five months, white knuckling it, hating everything.  I was still at my parents’ house, still working that part-time job, going through all the same motions without the drink.  I hated everyone and everything and often thought about suicide.  Until one day I picked back up and drank from May to September.  During this time, I had hardly any contact with anyone.  Showed up at a friend’s apartment and hid there for a few days, smoking weed and drinking.  I made a lot of phone calls to people I shouldn’t have been calling nightly.  I went to one party and almost drowned in a lake.  This whole time I was appearing at probation, getting drug and alcohol screened, and barely getting away with it. 
 Then one morning, September 28, 2015, I showed up to the court house and blew a .274, my last drink was 10 hours before and I felt like I was about to go through withdrawals.  Even with a high BAC I was still shaking and sweating.

My probation officer allowed me to opt for detox.  When I met with the counselor there he said, “What do you want to do?”  I said, “I’m done.  I’m sick of this.  I don’t care where you send me, just keep me in a program.”  I spent two weeks in detox, three weeks in a CSS, three months in a TSS, and six months in a halfway house.  The halfway house was a Christian based ministry service, but I was able to find my own way to spiritual healing, keeping my general philosophy in the realm of atheism.  During that time, I met my current sponsor, went to meetings, and met my current girlfriend.  

After graduating the halfway house program, I move into a communal living space that wasn’t sober, but portrayed itself as being a Collective that strived towards self-sustainability, community service, volunteer organizations, and activism.  It didn’t really turn out that way.  There was a lot of drama, weed smoking, and egotism.  But I kept my focus on my recovery, didn't partake in any substance abuse or use, making it through parties and events sober.  I played music in front of people sober for the first time in over a decade.  I started working in a substance abuse rehabilitation facility, which put the rest of my focus on the sick and suffering addict and doing what I can to help someone else.

My girlfriend and I got a place together this year.  We adopted a dog.  I changed careers and currently work in mental health.  This October I start a certification program for substance abuse counseling, which puts me on the path to start earning my 6,000 hours in order to get my LADAC.  I have a dream of one day running my own residential program with a focus on art and music therapy.

Today I happier than I ever thought possible.  I’m content.  Though recovery has many gifts, one of the greatest gifts is the ability to sit.  To sit and wait and enjoy the ride.  Even before I ever picked up a drink or drug I couldn’t stay in one place for long.  No matter where I was I wanted to be somewhere else, as if I was constantly missing out on life.  If I was home I wanted to be at the party, if I was at the party I wanted to be home.  If I went into work I wished I called out, if I called out I’d wish I was at work.  Satisfaction was something I never understood.  I’ve learned that alcohol and drugs are not my problem, the problem is me.  It’s my outlook on life.  It’s alcoholism, an ism, a philosophy.  We use terms like “disease” and “god” out of convenience, because they best describe what we’re trying to explain, but it’s much more complicated than that.  I have to be able to fearlessly look inside myself and admit my faults and be willing to do something in order to correct them.  I have to be honest.  And picking up a drink will only move me further away from everything I’ve been looking for my whole life.

Today, I won’t drink with all of you. "

Hey guys! Sorry it's been awhile, life's been crazy with exams and doing multiple interviews for internships over the summer, but I'm back with some notable events to update you guys with!

So if you read some of my comments from the other post, I contemplated texting my aunt about telling her I can't get the image of her breasts out of my mind. I ended up actually sending it after thinking it over for the day and threw my phone to my bed, not wanting to see what she says back to me. I went on a run to further prolong looking at my phone, and when I finished my couple mile run, I saw that she texted back twice.

Seeing this freaked me out, hoping that she didn't see my text yet. At this point I said screw it, and opened the texts that blew me away.

The first text said, ""I was wondering how long it would take for you to text back. It's not very normal for a guy to say nothing after seeing a woman's bust, especially a bust like mine 😜 I'll give you something so you don't have to just remember.""

The next text was a picture of her rack with a red lingerie bra covering her breasts. Her left hand was holding up her left breast which made more cleavage. The bra was pretty see through except for the designs on it, so I could see her right nipple somewhat exposed in the bra. From what I could tell it was hard.

My first instinct was to take care of what was also hard on my side of things, so in the middle of taking care of that, I texted back saying ""Wow, just how I remembered it! What do you want me to do with this?!""

A minute later while I was getting closer to the end of taking care of myself, she responded with, ""Do what guys your age do with pictures like that 😏""

I responded boldly by saying, ""Way ahead of you on that front then, kinda taking care of that now actually 😅""

A couple minutes later, I get another picture from her that almost looked like the other, but this one had cum between her tits.

""Imagine that's yours then.""

After that little exchange, I couldn't hold it anymore and got my relief. 

I text back with, ""Gosh you two know how to tease. All of this is pretty crazy! I knew you two liked doing funny stuff during Mardi Gras, but this is pretty surprising for me to see this side of things.""

""I can stop if this makes you uncomfortable. We can delete everything and just forget about all this. I don't want you thinking differently of me or bad things about me. I thought all this would be good fun.""

""No I'm fine! Just surprised that's all!  This all has been such a thrill to me.""

""Ok great! It's been the same on our side too. Think we could meet in person about this anytime soon?"" 

""It's kind of crazy right now for me, but I see next weekend being available for me to drive over to your house! Will you guys be free?""

""I'll be gone with my friends that weekend, but your uncle would be around if you wanted to spend time with him.""

""That'll be fine, sucks I won't get to see you though. Felt like forever since I've seen the both of you now.""

""That's what seeing a girl's boobs does to guy's perception of time 😉""

""Haha, I'll keep you guys updated if anything changes on my side of availability!""

""Sounds good, love you 😙""

""Love you too! You guys are the best!""

""😊 and you're the best nephew we could have""

After this pretty crazy exchange that weekend, we've texted here and there about unrelated matters. That's where I'm at now and I'm planning to head to their house on Saturday after I help my parents with some yard work.

What should I discuss with my uncle because I'm kind of clueless on what will be brought up or what I should say about our exchange last weekend. 

TLDR; Texted aunt about seeing her tits, got hot pics from her, now I'll be visiting the uncle this coming Saturday.

72z5kz,4,2017-09-28,The Salarymen Archetype,cartridgeBased,customyugioh,https://www.reddit.com/r/customyugioh/comments/72z5kz/the_salarymen_archetype/,"Here's my archetype idea

It's called Salarymen and it's based on the office life of Japanese salarymen. Cards are still in the planning stage but here's the list of cards I've already thought of. If you think I need to change something or you have a good suggestion please comment down below:

1. Salaryman (Level 4/Warrior/Light) [Normal Monster] 1300 atk/300 def - He's expected to work long hours, go with his friends in the karaoke after work, and repeat the process.

2. Salaryman - Office Intern (Level 3/Spellcaster/Light) [Effect/Tuner] 500 atk/300 def. - if this card is normal or special summoned, you can discard this card to special summon one Level 4 ""Salaryman"" monster from your deck.

3. Salaryman - Human Resources (Level 5/Warrior/Earth) [Fusion Monster] 2200 atk/2000 def. - 2 ""Salarymen"" monsters. Once per turn, you can banish one monster from your graveyard, target one monster from your opponent's field and shuffle the target back into the deck but in turn, you cannot attack using this monster.

4. Salaryman - The CEO (Level 8/Fiend/Dark) [Synchro Monster] 2500 atk/ 2100 def - 1 Tuner + 1 or more non-tuner monsters. This card cannot be targeted by the opponent's card effects. Once per turn, you can discard one card from your hand to special summon one Level 4 and higher ""Salaryman"" monster from your deck.

5. Salaryman - Janitor (Level 2/Spellcaster/Earth) [Effect Monster] 200 atk/200 def - FLIP: This card cannot be destroyed by battle. If flip summoned, you can target one card from your graveyard and return it to your hand.

6. Salaryman - The Bodyguard (Level 4/Warrior/Earth) [Effect Monster] 1800 atk/2000 def - If this card was used as a Synchro material, shuffle this card back to the deck instead of sending it to the graveyard.

7. The Office Building [Field Spell] - Once per turn, you can check the top card on your deck. If the card is a ""Salaryman"" monster card, special summon it to the field and it gains 500 atk. If the card is a spell or trap card, send it to the graveyard and put it in your hand on your 2nd standby phase.

8. OVERTIME! [Spell Card] - Target one monster you control in the field, it gains 1000 atk until the end of your turn. At the end of your turn, the target monster's attack is halved until your next standby phase. You can only activate OVERTIME! once per turn. 

9. COFFEE BREAK! [Quick Play Spell card] - target one monster and it gains 300 atk during Damage Calculation only.

10. VACATION! [Trap card] - If a monster you control is targeted by an attack, banish your monster and end the battle phase. Your monster returns to the field at the end of your opponent's turn.

11. YOU'RE FIRED! [Trap card] - If you control at least 1 ""Salaryman - The CEO"" on the field, banish 1 ""Salaryman"" monster from your deck and banish one monster from your opponent's field. You cannot normal summon on your next turn.

12. RUSH HOUR! [Spell card] - Draw 3 additional cards and banish 3 cards from your hand. You cannot draw a card on your next draw phase.

730hc1,25,2017-09-28,"What Really Happened to Andersonsburg, Pennsylvania, in April 1829",TheJesseClark,TheJesseClark,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheJesseClark/comments/730hc1/what_really_happened_to_andersonsburg/,"Perhaps you've heard of Andersonsburg - the old western Pennsylvanian town, that, like Roanoke before it, suffered a mysterious end and left no accounted survivors to enlighten anyone as to the details of its fate. Luckily that may no longer be the case; I've joined a University-funded expedition here, and have been tasked with collecting items of value that can hopefully assist in our search for knowledge pertaining to the curious fate of the city. After some exhausting work, I did indeed come across a Diary that is by *far* the most informative document yet unearthed. I'll check the contents for veracity at a later date. For now, here are the most relevant excerpts for anyone interested:

---

3 April 1829
 
Another man caught the Fever, this time down at the lumber camp. From what I hear the poor bastard was tying down the logs when he just up and fell right over into the river. Almost drowned, I heard, and when the others got to him, Matthew and Thomas and the lot, they said his face had gone pale as a cloud, and that he was shakin,’ and sweating and coughing. Ain’t no mistaking that for nothing but the early signs o’ the Fever. So they hauled the poor fellow out and gave him a canteen and had him rest, but then without telling him, they struck camp and left ‘im there. I'm not sure what came of him. But everyone here knows the Mayor’s rule - none struck with Fever are permitted to return to Andersonsburg. If they're favored enough to survive the thing, unlikely as that sounds, they're to remain banished to the woods with nothing but the clothes on their backs and whatever coin they gots in their purse. Not a one of the other lads down at the camp wanted to risk becoming an Infected and meeting such a grisly fate. No, sir.
 
---
 
4 April, 1829
 
By mayor’s decree: the lumber camp is to be abandoned, along with all the supplies it's gathered, for fear of being tainted with Fever. There was an uproar at the Mansion today over the decision. Many men are out of work now because of it; but strange enough, I didn’t see not a one of the fellows from the camp itself down at the Mansion; just their wives and some others. And I know why, too. They wouldn’t admit it aloud - no, sir - but they don’t wanna go back. I wouldn’t either. I've seen the Fever at work at Pinefield, and it ain't got no place in my home. Not while I got a wife at home. No, sir. 
 
---
 
7 April 1829
 
Maria says to me today in the kitchen: “Paul, I can’t believe the Mayor’d throw so many good men out of jobs!” But I says back to’er: “Dunno, Sweetheart. Perhaps he’s got himself a point. That ol’ camp’s been run clean over with Fever. And you don’t want that Plague finding its way round here, no, sir. God ‘Imself couldnt’ stop it if it did.” So she snorts and walks away. But she’ll come ‘round eventually. ‘Specially when the stories of the Infected keep comin.’ 
 
If Fever’s hit the camp, then its only a good two or three miles from town. Only a matter of time, I think, before it finds its way here. God above, I hope I’m wrong, but maybe I should start thinking bout taking Maria away for a time, though, to see my brother in Philadelphia. Just til all the foul things conclude here.

11 April, 1829
 
A man got shot last night, not a hundred yards from Jim Isley’s porch. Jim says he was delirious, just stumbling about near the treeline without an aim in the world. He calls out to ‘im an he says, “Declare yourself! You’s an Iroquois? I’ll shoot you dead if you an Iroquois, ol’ boy!” And he said nothin,’ so shoot ‘im he did. Then Jim sent his boy Nathan into town to fetch a picket while he watched the field, thinking an Indian attack was brewin.’ But when Nathan got back with some of the men and their rifles looking for a good fight, not another Indian had shown his face. So they went out and looked at the body, and saw it was something worse: that old Infected fellow from the lumber camp. Found his way back to town in his stupor, and by God, says the men, the Fever worked its way through him right quick. Says he was rotting inside-out, skin falling off like a Leper. Teeth all filed into those wicked points. So they puts up their shirts to their noses and mouths and they set the body to the flame. 
 
They told the story today at the Pub, but some o’ the other gents there took offense to the tale. Says they shoulda told the Mayor, says they shouldn’ta gone near the corpses. One fellow, Tom Huggins, I think he was, said those men were probably Infected, too, by virtue of going near even a dead Infected. Says the Plague lingers after death. Then he bolts out the door, and the barkeep asks the storytellers to leave. I left, too. Ain’t no risking getting the Fever. No, sir.
 
---
 
15 April, 1829.
 
Jim Isley didn’t show up at the Office today. And all the men there knows the story with the Infected fellow getting shot, too. So the rumors are swirlin.’ No one’s heard from him. His clients are stopping on by and alls we can say is ‘we ain’t seen the fellow, come on by later on.’ So they do, but they ain’t happy about it. No, sir. I like ol’ Jim, even if he’s a little small-brained, so I says to myself *I think I’ll stop on by his house after closin,’ to see what’s the matter.* I know I shouldn’t, but if he’s sick I’ll know for sure and I won’t go near the man. 
 
I just hope it ain’t the Fever. God above, I hope it ain’t the Fever.

So I gets to his house at roundabout dusk and his wife Sarah opens up the door. She’s a sweetheart, she is, but even though she’s putting on a nice big smile for her guest I can tells she’s got a worry on her mind. So I put my hat to my chest an I says, “Greetings, ma’am. Just stopping on by to extend my regards to Jim. He didn’t show up at the Office today, y’see, and I was hoping I could see him.” Then her smile fades and she says “That’s mighty kind of you, Paul, but Jim’s been under the weather and he won’t let neither me nor Nathan in the bedroom. Alls I know is he’s sweating and having trouble keeping down a meal.” Then *my* smile fades, an I says without a second thought, “Sarah, I’m guessing you heard bout the guest a half-week back? The man Jim shot?” And she says, “The Iroquois scout! Jim says he shot ‘im dead.” So *I* says, “Sarah, that weren’t no Iroquois scout. That was the Infected feller from the Lumber camp. Jim and some other fellers burned the body once they saw the skin.” And her face goes white as a ghost and she just says “Don’t you lie to me! Don’t you lie to me about my Jim!” And she goes and shuts the door in my face! I hope she gets her wits about her and gets Nathan out of there soon. He’s a good lad, and she’s got a big kindly heart herself. They don’t deserve this. As luck would have it, though, I ran across Doctor Armistead on the way home, an I tells him about Jim. Maybe he can help. 
 
---
 
16 April, 1829.
 
Maria wakes me up earlier to-day and she says, “The Isley’s are gone! The Isley’s are gone!” And I’m tired so at first I don’t know what nonsense she’s talkin.’ But then I remember Jim and Sarah and Nathan, and I says, “What you mean, gone? Dead, gone?” And she says, “No! The Doctor says Jim’s got the Fever, Paul, and so a few men grabbed their muskets and they haul the whole Isley family out their house and toss ‘em right out the whole town! Some of the men says, if they ever come back, they’ll shoot ‘em dead.” 
 
So I feels right guilty for ratting ‘em out and I throws my covers off and I run outside and down the street. Sure enough, the Isley home’s gone up in a smoke! The whole towns out there watching it burn without a pity, except the Parish, and when I run up I hears people talking about anyone else who’d been in contact with that body of the fellow down at the Lumber camp. Then I hears the other names come up: David Brody, John Greene, Will Benson Hodges. The townsfolk say they’ve gotta find ‘em an give ‘em the boot, or else the whole town’ll get the Fever! One lass says “Why don’t we just shoot ‘em?” An another fellow says back to her, “Then we’d have to remove the corpse. Wouldn’t wanna go near such a thing, would you? *The Plague lingers.* Better to have ‘em walk right on out on their own two feet.” 
 
But I thinks to myself *hell, that's almost worse.*
 
---
 
18 April 1829. 
 
The town’s all done over in a hysteria, I tell ya. The Mayor’s declared martial law ever since the Isley’s and the Brody’s and the Greenes and the Hodges got evicted, and not a soul is to enter Andersonsburg until further notice. You can leave and he won’t stop ya. But you ain’t coming back if you do, and the townsfolk’ll assume your departure means you been struck with Plague. Then they’ll burn your home to ash. I’ve seen it happen ten times in the last few days alone. These boys ain’t playin games, no, sir. There are some o’ them religious folks talking about how its God’s judgment for sin, and other fellows with muskets patroling the streets, and every once in awhile you’ll hear a big ol’ loud *crack!* as he pops off his gun. 
 
Cause that’s the other thing, y’see. Them Infected keep trying to get back in.

Some o’ the Infected stormed in down Mulberry Street last night. Stole some cattle, rattled some doorknobs. But the militia showed up right quick and drove ‘em off with some sharp musketry. They didn’t kill any of ‘em until after they’d run out past the wooden palisades. Then they shot ‘em in the back and dropped ‘em like a sack o’ potatoes, says they. 
 
The men have orders only to wound, if possible, y’see, if the Infected make it inside the town. That’s seeing as how a dead Infected in the streets is a corpse some poor bastard’ll have to remove. And then he’s struck with Fever too, far as the town’s concerned, and they send him a packin.’ Needless to say not a man woman or child in Andersonsburg's willing to volunteer for such a job. So the Mayor says to the militia captain, he says, “If them infected find their way in here, you get ‘em out some way other than killin ‘em dead, y’hear? I ain’t aimin’ to have to pick a poor lad to take the bodies out and take himself out the same way. No, sir.”

24 April 1829.
 
The Mayor let in a visitor today. Some o’ the townsfolk down at the Hall threw up a good fit over that, but the man had something to say, so in he comes. He meets with the Mayor and from what I heard from Phil Gables, he told the Mayor the Infected have thrown in their numbers and overrun the nearest town over west. That place - Lesterburg - was in a similar spot to us: rooting out the Infected, burning their homes. Barricades had gone up, the milita’d been mobilized. All the same, the Infected, hungry for flesh, swept in out of the woods one night and overran the barricades and the watch towers and killed every last person in the town. Except for this feller - Charles Gates or something or other - he was the last man alive, and he ran all the way here to tell us that horde is heading up this way, not two days out. 

So now the town’s gotta figure out what’s to be done. Some people think the feller’s lying to get himself a bite to eat. Others think we should all leave for Philadelphia while the leavin’s good. Others think we can take on the horde. Lesterburg was half the size of Andersonsburg, after all, says they. We have more men, more muskets. We could beat ‘em. But its all up to the Mayor now.

25 April 1829
 
The Mayor elected to stand and fight, but said that anyone who sought to flee was welcome to do so, o‘course. Got himself a nice round of applause, and then the men, myself among ‘em, set about collecting arms and bullets and building up the barricades in the streets and setting up wood towers for the lookouts. If these Infected aim to have a fight, a fight they shall have. 
 
According to Charles, we should expect the horde to come up from the Southwest near the Pike, sometime in the next twelve or so hours. Said there were uncountable hundreds of ‘em, all rotting away and thirsty for blood and crawling like beasts. We’ve got ourselves a good two hundred forty men and muskets and rounds enough for maybe a hundred eighty of ‘em. Add to that number thirty good sharp-shooting rifles for the marksmen in the towers, and even two twelve-pounders overlooking the pike from two angles, and we gots ourselves a fine force to defend the town with. But I can see it in everyone’s eyes: a mist of fear. 
 
Tonight I’ll spend the evening with Maria, and we’ll do what the two of us can to take our mind off things. By the door is my musket, o’course, and in my satchel all the ammunition I could find. Should I hear the church bells go off at any point, I’ll have no choice but to grab the gun, kiss Maria one last time, perhaps, and rush out to the Southwest barricade to do some fightin.’ 
 
If the church bells ring a second time, though, everyone knows what that means: the Infected have broken on through. Then it's time to hit the road to Philadelphia. So I tells Maria to keep our valuables packed.

26 April 1829
 
To-day I took a good stroll out at the edge of town. We’ve got ourselves a good palisade. Some of the boys at the Northwestern edge even dug themselves a trench, and the whole of the militia, even Captain Gaines, have elected ol’ Booker Downes to lead the defense, seeing as he fought with the mountaineers in the Indian wars and got himself some experience. So he rounds up some horses and dispatches a rider to Philadelphia to call up some help, and then two more riders with orders to scout the outskirts of town - one to the west to spot the horde and the other elsewhere to ensure they ain't coming up from nowhere’s else - and report back what they find no later than mid-afternoon. So off they all go, and the rest of the lads get back to the job of fixing up defenses. 
 
---
 
By now we scrounged up a good twelve more muskets and forty or so pistols and every blade we can find. The butcher was kind enough to lend us some cutlery, and in the town armory Briggs and I bagged up a few score rusty bayonets and distributed them evenly along the front. We got ourselves an army now, boys. I only hope it lasts the night. 
 
---
 
Still no word from the scouts. Downes is getting nervous, so he goes and he sends off another two riders and says “You lads go no more than a mile out, y’hear? Then come on back to me.” So off they go. 
 
---
 
One of the new scouts came a-galloping on back in, and he's huffing and puffing and he says to Downes, “They ain't just coming up from the west, sir. Spotted a good lot of ‘em in the Northwest, too, and the north, and they gots themselves horses! A whole mess of ‘em!” And Downes says “Whatd’ya mean, horses? Like they’s eaten ‘em?” And the scout says, “no sir, they’s *ridin’* ‘em. Like cavalry. Dead looking things, rottin' skin, with the same red eyes as those Infected folk. And they making speed, sir! They makin’ damn good speed!” 
 
And no sooner does he say that then the Church bell rings. And I look up, and all the men looks up, and we see young Johnny Billings up there, and he’s waving his arms and shouting somethin fierce and pointing off to the West. So we looks to the west. And there they are, all’ve sudden, a whole mess o’ them Infected comin up out of the treeline and runnin up the hill towards the barricade. So we all rush up to the wall and take aim, and Downes says to fire the twelve pounders. So they fire - *BOOM! BOOM!* - and a good few of those Infected go’s a-flying. But then more are coming, and more and more. 
 
So then the marksmen open up fire from the towers and they're picking the bastards off as best they can. But the horde gets closer and closer. Soon they's in musket range, so me and the boys fire a volley, and when we reload the boys behind us fire, and then the boys behind them. We three lines deep at the choke-points. And pretty soon we got Infected piling up right quick not fifty yards off. Dead and more dead and more. But the rest of ‘em keep right on climbing over the pile o’ the dead ones and keep right on coming, and we keep right on shooting. 
 
But then the infected did something I ain’t seen yet. Far as I could tell beforehand, the Fever keeps you from thinking straight, and then you’re just not thinking at all; you just a mindless thing with rotten skin that eats and kills. But today, after a good ten or twelve minutes of fighting, the horde got up and the whole lot of ‘em actually *fell back.* Now that says to me a number o’things, things discussed openly as the men set about reloading and fetching water in the interim - that means these things are *thinkin.’* They knew they couldn’t break our lines and so they retreated back towards the trees. They ain’t done - we can still see their damned red eyes glowing through the shroud of trees, but they fell back. Maybe they’s scared? 
 
---
 
The Infected haven’t tried another all out assault yet. Commander Downes thinks they’s waiting for nightfall so they can slip in unseen, so he had a handful of boys from each of the regiments head out to the killing fields and throw up lamps while some others stood guard. When sunlight starts to fall we’ll have other boys run out with torches and light those lamps, and the hope is we can keep the fields lit for shooting throughout the night. We gots’ closer lamps, too, that can be lit from behind the barricade without having to send men out all exposed. 
 
--- 
 
Sun’s coming on down. We can still see them damn Infected in the trees, and we hear rustling and footsteps and Commander Downes says they’s likely to be bringing up reinforcements for another push. Billie’s got a fine ear, and he says he can even hear ‘em talkin,’ out there. Grunting and stuff. Probably planning their next move.  Meanwhile the boys on this side of the palisades have been reinforcing the barriers. 
 
Still no word from the other three scouts. But we ain’t holding our breath on their return. 
 
---
 
Round about eight o’clock we heard some shooting at the Northwest barrier, so Commander Downes sends me and Butler and Payton out to see if they need help. So we get there and the boys said the things had tried crawlin through the tall grass for cover and were only about a hundred some-odd feet from the palisade when the boys spotted ‘em and started shootin.’ So we goes back to Downes an tells him, and he calls up a Council of War with the regiment heads and says that given that and the retreat from earlier, its clear the Infected are smarter than we thought. Made a point to say that no weapons could fall into their hands. Not under any circumstances. No, sir. 
 
No we all’s still waiting on that big night-time push. 
 
---
 
Sure enough as hell, those Infected bastards made a second big charge against all the barricades at the same time, sometime before midnight. Damn near caught us with our pants ‘round the ankles, too. We hear rifle cracks from the marksmens’ towers and then the twelve-pounders fire off, and then a flurry of musket fire from the Northwest. Then they hit us twice as hard as they did before, and we’re firing volley after volley into ‘em, stacked up three lines deep to keep the musketballs flying. And they’re hitting the dirt an bits and pieces of ‘em are flying, but still they keep on coming. 
 
Then they start hitting back, even though they’re still a good fifty yards to the palisade. They bring up rocks and start flinging ‘em towards us. Fistfulls of gravel flying in through the musket smoke, and they peppering the boys and knocking teeth loose. Men start to yelp when they get hit. And them twelve-pounders are firing away, too - *BOOM! BOOM!* - every couple o’minutes, and that tears big groups of ‘em down. But they kept on coming till they was right up at the palisade, and Commander Downes told the front row to start up with their bayonets and blades and tomahawks. I remember how close the bastards came to taking a big ol’ bite outta my neck. Luckily ol’ Bruce knicked the sumbitch with a bayonet to the head and he keeled over. Not long after that the Infected retreated again. 
 
But now we gots a fresh problem: we got casualties. Men are bit, men made contact with Plague, and so now we gots to do what we all knew we’d have to do. Get rid of the infected. Commander Downes rides up and he takes a good, long look at this one poor lad, arm bleeding from a bite, and he tells him to head out and relight the torches. The boy looked all forlorn, like he knew what was happening, but he weren’t about to disobey orders. So out he goes, and as soon as he lights the torch, Downes has one of the men fire on the poor lad. He dropped like a stone, dead ‘fore he hit the ground. That one hurt us all, I think. 
 
But we wasn’t done, neither. Some o’ the other men got touched by Fever, too, and so me and the rest o’ the boys backs up and levels some pistols at ‘em and we asks Commander Downes, “What do we do with ‘em, sir?” An he says, “You know what we do. We send ‘em away.” So at gun point we show the men to the gate, and they’re begging and they’re pleading, but we gots no choice. So out they go, and we say we’ll fire at ‘em unless they get as far away from town as they can. We all knew what was coming, and sure enough as soon as they got near the woods, Infected ran out and dragged ‘em in. We all watched ‘till the screaming stopped and the bushes quit their shakin.’ Few o’ the men here got sick. Others cried. I just wrote it all down. God above, I hope Maria’s as far from this hell as possible.

27 April, 1829.
 
We slept in shifts last night, and luckily there weren’t any other attempts by the Infected to rush the barricades. But we’re tired, the lot of us. Damn hell, we’re tired. I’d be amazed if any man got a lick of real rest. We was silent, but we stayed up and we listened good to the sound of Infected howling out there in the woods. There were thousands of ‘em, it sounded like, filling up the whole night sky with the din o’ their big, collective war-scream. Lasted for an hour, maybe more. 
 
One o’ the boys nearest me was praying along all night, begging for the good Lord to come down and save us. I asked him to put in a good word for me, too. 
 
---
 
This morning some of the wives pitched in with medical aid and a big, hearty breakfast. So we ate well, and Commander Downes allowed us to spend time with our families. Maria and I took a nice stroll, but I didn’t have much to say. By mid-day I was back at the palisade with the other men, and by sun-down we were starting to hear the Infected getting riled up again, hearing that awful *howlin.’* 
 
Downes and his aides were riding back and forth, making sure the walls were good and solid, the cannons reloaded and manned, and the belltower watch was keepin’ his eye out. And this time we gots’ some o’ the younger boys to run ammo up and down where its neede-
 
Shooting started. Will update if possible.
 
---
 
God above. God help us. The Infected hit us at all sides, all at once. Them cannon’s were firing like mad, and Commander Downes was telling ‘em, “Aim for the trees! Aim for the trees!” So they did, and after a few rounds they’d managed to dam off the entry points and slow down the horde. But it weren’t more than a stopgap. Them Infected were running through the musket smoke, howling and screaming for food. Some of ‘em were galloping towards the walls on all fours and you could see the red of their eyes, like pooling blood. Jim Isley was one of ‘em, and I had to be the poor bastard to put ‘im down for good. I’m sorry, Jim. Truly, I am. 
 
But they kept right on comin!’ The boys were firing wildly and chopping and stabbing and screaming, and them Infected was doing the same and trying to mount the palisades. And then, just when there weren’t a lick more we could take, we heard some o’ the men screaming from down *south* of us. We wasn’t aware we were even threatened there, but sure ‘nuff, them Infected bastards had broken on through some of the pickets and were trying to break in through the windows o’ the houses. So Commander Downes sent me and five other gents to go and put a stop to that. We burst in through the houses and stabbed ‘em through the windows and traded shots for rocks over barrels. I got all good and cut up from the exploding glass windows, but I ain’t been bit. Not yet. 
 
So we put a stop to them coming in that way, but when I got back I explained to Downes real good that they were gonna try that again, sooner or later, and we needed a good force o’men to guard up there. Turns out he’d gotten similar reports from other parts o’ town, though, and so we’d have to stretch our lines real thin to cover it all up. But we did what we had to, and by God we held the line all around the town by the skin of our teeth. Some o’ the men - God above - grown men, they’re just cryin.’ They’re so damn tired, and scared. We all are. But we held the line - by God we did. Ain’t a man here who didn’t do his duty. 
 
---
 
28-29 April, 1829.
 
To-day the women and children helped us all build a new defensive line to-wards the center of town. Downes says that if we get hit again like we did last night, we’d have these new palisades and trenches to fall back on. I worked with Maria to-day digging away. She tended to my wounds, too, and we just enjoyed each other’s company as we worked. I even got some shut-eye, some *real* good shut-eye, if not but for an hour or two. Then it was sun-down again. The boys and I ate up a stew the women cooked up, and then we were off to the palisades. 
 
Them wooden posts were beaten and worn, too. We knew we couldn’t stay for long. And as soon as the Howling started from the trees, Commander Downes ordered the twelve pounders be stripped and rushed to the inner line of defense so they’d be ready if it gets bad. Or when it gets bad, I suppose I’ll say. 
 
I made sure to kiss Maria real good tonight, and made her *promise* to make a good run for it if those church bells rang twice - which now meant the inner line’d been breached. She cried and nodded. I wanted to tell her that if she had to run, I’d meet her at Joseph’s house in Philadelphia. But alls I could bring myself to say aloud was, “You run straight for Joesph’s, you hear? Don’t you stop.” ‘Cause Lord, and I’m tearing up just writing this down, I don’t know if I’ll last the night. 
 
Hell, I dunno if anyone here’ll last the night. 
 
---
 
We at the inner line of defense now. We ain’t been hit that hard since the battle started. God above, it was a bloody mess - the rush started off with some Infected leaping outta them woods and tackling the lamps into the ground. The glass broke and all the dry weeds go in a flame. Soon the fire smoke and the musket smoke made it so we couldn’t see a damn thing out there; all’s we could hear were the *howlin’!* Musta been a thousand o’ the bastards tonight. Maybe more. 
 
So we’d been shooting for a good while, and hacking and throwing rocks, an then we heard the commotion up at the other wall, and boy we *knew* it weren’t no small thing. There were men screaming and the shooting altogether stopped up there. So we knew they were done for, and Commander Downes rides up to us and he says, “The Northwest Palisade is breached! Fall back to the inner line! Fall back!” And so me and the boys pick up our guns and beat a fighting retreat down the Boulevard towards the inner walls. Then them Infected started pouring over the palisades, and we knew there weren’t no throwing ‘em back. Not this time. 
 
So we get’s back to the inner palisade and we start right up again, shooting and firing those twelve pounders, boy, and them Infected are coming at us from e’ry side now. Howling the whole way, burning up and’ getting shot all up but still running at us. Now we gots *kids* in the camp, and I can hear the little lads and lasses putting up a good cry even over the din of the fight, an I thinks, *how’s it we ain’t sent them little ones off to Philadelphia? How’s they still here?* Maybe its because Downes thinks their being here will inspire us, y’know, to fight even harder. 
 
Anyways. After ‘bout a good more hour or two o’ shooting and stabbin,’ the horde dwindles a bit, and that’s when Briggs see’s it - one o’ them Infected mounted up on a dead horse, looking down on the town from atop the wooded hill north o’town. We only saw his silhouette and those red eyes peering at us through all the smoke and flame, but he’s there, right as rain. Briggs points and we all look, and we gotta catch our breath in our throats. Them Infected got themselves a general, from the looks’ve it. He’s just sitting up there, watching his Plague-runners set the town ablaze.
 
Not too long after that some sunlight comes up o’er the church tower, and then the horde falls back. But we don’t know how far; we don’t know if they’s ran back to the trees, or if they’s still inside the town, staying in our houses til’ dark. Downes says we can’t spare a-nobody to go and takes a look. So here we stay, here in the inner palisade by the edge of town. And we waits for nightfall. And that Infected up on the horse. 
 
---
 
29 April, 1829
 
So I got some sleep this afternoon. Not a whole hell of a lot, but a better amount than none. First thing I did when I woke was help count ammo. We’s almost clean out; maybe ten rounds a man, and now we’s only got seventy men or so. And them twelve pounders is almost out, too. They only has maybe twelve balls left to shoot between the two of ‘em. And none of the riders have gotten back, neither, so we ain’t got no reinforcements comin.’ 
 
So Briggs and I, and Payton and Short, we goes up to Commander Downes and we says, “Sir, we almost out of men and ammo, and we got lil' ones here, sir, and our wives! And the town’s all up in flames, sir. There ain’t nothing left for us here. Not for a one of us. We should make a run for Philadelphia while we still gots’ daylight.” But he says back, “I ain’t never left the enemy in command of the field. We stay, and we fight.” And he rides off! Now I ain’t no mutineer - Lord above knows I done my duty - but I ain’t aiming to die for the principle of it. Not when I gots my Maria here, and no town left to defend. 
 
So I talks to some o’ the men and women and lay it out for ‘em. And I says, “Look here, boys. We ain’t lasting another night and if we do, what’ll come of us in the next one? We gots to get out while we still can. The road to Philadelphia’s still open, and we still gots ourselves enough daylight to get outta the woods and to the open road before nightfall.” An the majority of ‘em nod and we take a vote. The motion to leave is the clear winner. 
 
So we get our things and we tells Commander Downes, “We’s leavin,’ sir. There ain’t nothing here left for us and we ain’t aiming to die for a pile o’ rubble.” An he gets red in the face and he says back, “I’ll have the lot o’ you *hanged* for treason!” And he calls up his boys - bout half the men left with their muskets and he says, “you lot arrest them mutineers, y’hear?” And so they advance, and we level our muskets to repel ‘em back. But before any shots are fired, one of the women in the Church points down the road heading off to the Southeast and she says, “Look! One o’ the scout’s is riding in!” So we all turns an look and sure enough, ol’ David Benjamin’s puling up into town, an he looks like hell itself. 
 
He says, “Water, water!” And so we gives him a canteen, and then he says, “I was coming up with a column o’ state militia from the midland, alls the help I could muster up, but them Infecteds - they’re everywhere! All over the road, out in force. I swears they was lying in wait for the lot of us, like an ambush, and they leapt down on the main road and just tore into the poor lads. They didn’t have a chance. I’m the only man who made it back; I needs to tells y’all that the road to Philadelphia is blocked!” 
 
So now the whole damn town’s in a panic. We’s surrounded by the Plague, and there ain’t no way out. And not a minute ago, while I was writing this here entry, someone points up to the hill north o’town an they says, “There’s the horseman!” And we all look and there he is - that Plague Rider, eyeing the town with that wicked red stare o’his, and that of his horse, and we see’s he’s got a whole wretched host of other Infected Riders. And then they started moving right on down the mountain towards us. 
 
Then the Howling started, and just now - the church bells started to ring. I know it in my bones I ain’t surviving this night. They coming at us from all sides now. And I’m holding Maria tight, and she’s crying, too, and alls we can hear’s the wailing of the little ones from the church, and the shouts of the boys as they run up to the Palisade with their guns, and the wheeling forward of the cannon. So I gave Maria a kiss, and I’m leaving this here diary in her possession. I love you, darling. I love you, and I hope you know that.

29 April, 1829
 
Paul has gone off to the palisades. He’s scared. I am too. We all are, but we’ve gotta be strong for the children here in the back of the church. The other women and I have tended to the lot of them since the men fell back to the inner line of defense, which I helped to build, and at least half of them have the Fever. Of that I’m now sure. But it no longer matters, does it? They won’t live to see themselves be taken by it, and perhaps that’s a merciful thing. 
 
---
 
The shooting has started. The boys are throwing in everything they’ve got, God bless the lot of them - but I can tell its not enough. We’ve but an hour left, maybe less - before the Infected make it to the church. The children here have cried themselves empty, and now they're huddling around myself and the other women and clutching our dresses and burying their faces in our laps. I’m as afraid as any of them. But I can’t let them see that. I can’t. 
 
---
 
The church bells are ringing again, and the men just outside - the thirty or so of them left (I’ve no idea if Paul is among them) - sound exhausted and panicked. The cannons have long since stopped firing, likely having expended their ammunition. Only periodically do I hear a musket blast. Paul was explaining earlier that they’d nearly run out of bullets last night. I can’t imagine they’ve found many more.  
 
---
 
I hear galloping now, coming up from the west. Its not the state militia. Its that Plague Rider. I can hear him - I know its him. I know it. He commands these beasts. He grunts and shouts, and they listen. They’re only a few yards from the Church doors. We’ve hidden the children in the very furthest corner and covered them up with whatever we can find. We told them to stay quiet, at all costs, but some of them are infants. They’ll cry for their mothers, and when they do? The whole lot of them will be found. 
 
---
 
Its been several minutes since I heard musket fire, and the last of the shouts from our boys have long since ceased. All I can hear now is the Howling, and some of the women in here saying how we should use the pews to barricade the door. But its hopeless. We all know its hopeless. All we can do now is be strong for the children. But how can I? My home is burnt. My Paul - my Paul - is gone. All our boys are gone. How can I be strong when my strength is gone? 
 
---
 
The Infected have begun hammering away at the church doors and windows. We are surrounded in here. God, Lord - give me strength. Please, Father. Give me strength. Just for a little while longer. Just for a liit-

This Diary was found buried in the rubble of an old church in the center of Andersonsburg, cradled by a long-rotted corpse that appears to have suffered severe blunt trauma wounds along the length of the spine and around the skull. There are multiple other skeletons strewn about the floor of the place, all but one of which appear to have suffered similarly. The other one - an infant’s corpse and one well-hidden in the corner, appears to never have suffered a wound at all; it looks instead to have perished of starvation, likely some days after the events described here. 
 
Outside the church of course, is the town itself. It is currently being picked clean by my colleagues and other members of the University - all for research purposes, of course (although I fear black market scavengers will descend like vultures upon the place once word of its existence spreads) - and it is in a spectacular state of ruin, mostly from what appears to be fire damage. As of this document I am the only person who knows of the existence of this Diary. 
 
Anway. Hell, I’ll update this later. At the moment I’m being called over to help with one of the interns, who’s apparently collapsed and begun to convulse. They’re probably just dehydrated.

I majored in Accounting/Business, however, I really didn't enjoy my major but just stuck with it to get my degree. I interned at a small production company last summer in Burbank, doing basic intern things.

I am not sure what job in entertainment I'd like to pursue. I love movies and TV. I read the trades everyday and try to stay up to date with what is going on at both the major and minor production companies.

I know that a lot of creative jobs in the industry can be freelance or require you to start off as someone's assistant. I was wondering if anyone had any insight on entertainment jobs that provide more stability in the long run. Ideally, I would love to have a full time job at a studio down the line, I just don't know what avenue to pursue to help me attain that goal. 

I have applied to a bunch of stuff online, with no luck so far. Its probably because I have yet to make the move out to LA, which is something I've been told I might have to do before securing a job (which would suck).

I know I probably sounds like a naive kid who is looking for a dream scenario but I am trying to get the best of both worlds by pursuing entertainment, but also finding a job within the field that won't have me making minimum wage for the next decade.

Any advice would be amazing. Thank you.

[I Just joined B4 as an audit associate(1 month) Finally got an offer from another industry which I'm genuinely passionate about.],mavericksprout,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/730xpy/whens_a_good_time_to_quit_and_how_do_i_go_about/,"Backstory - made a decision to pursue a field in the tech industry in final 6 months of Uni. Spent 'grad trip' summer months interning in said field, didn't get an offer from that company (headcount issues) in time I.e before I ended the internship. Pressure from family to join audit/get a job (had the audit offer before graduating) even though I wanted to take a break and study/pursue my own shit, caved because of incessant pressure, but secretly pursued all other avenues whilst coasting at Audit. Now unsure of whether to quit at the end of the second month (oct) or do it later (rental place only avail end of oct, and I wanna have my own place to escape family shouting/guilt tripping when they find out I left B4)

Issues at hand: 
- busy season is starting next week in October and I don't wanna OT for a shit job when I have my ""dream"" job waiting (it's not perfect, but I'm elated w the opportunity)

- place I rented only available end of Oct - decided to move out of my fam's place so I can pursue my shit in peace (Asian here, living w parents is not unusual, moving)

- have a month Long engagement plotted for Whole of nov where I'm the only associate 

- if I hand in my resignation end oct/start of nov, will they sign off on it? (I've heard that partners might not process your resignation if they're understaffed- is this true?)

- how does one resign? What questions do the higher ups ask? how honest should I be?what should I expect (from colleagues/bosses/managers) during and after resigning?"
731b4e,203,2017-09-28,My parents are threatening to kidnap me. I dropping out of college so they can no longer control me.,DEV_PER,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/731b4e/my_parents_are_threatening_to_kidnap_me_i/,"So, today I turned 19. Yesterday, I decided to drop out of college. I have no idea what I want to do with my life but I know that I’m deeply unsatisfied with my current situation. I started college when I was just 16 years old because that was what was expected of me. Growing up, I wanted to become an artist/designer. I know that it is not easy to make a living on art, so in high school, I decided I wanted to go to community college so I could get a job. I hoped that I could create a portfolio on the side and still have the means to support myself. However, my Asian parents said that community college was for “losers” and I was “too smart” and “wasting my potential” because in high school, I had a 4.3 GPA and did well on my ACTs. My parents wanted me to be a doctor, and have been forcing me to study for the MCAT for the past three years. When I graduated high school at 16, my parents told me that I could either attend a 4-year university or move out the day I turned 18. They both swore up and down that they never wanted to see me again if I decided not to go to college and become “uneducated trash”. When I started college, they picked my major for me, biology, since it would help me get into medical school. Over the years, I have been severely depressed and on medication, and have had suicidal thoughts.

Yesterday, I decided I finally had enough. My parents asserted that I have no other option but to go to medical school and that I was to spend all school breaks and next summer at home with them. I would also be forced to quit my job and forgo an internship I had lined up. They said they would take me to China to visit my grandparents and learn how to live “properly and with virtue”. They think my mind has been poisoned by Western thinking (valuing individual happiness, following your dreams, etc.) They even wrote up a contract for me to sign, stating that I would pledge my subservience to them or else I would be forced to take a semester off from school to “go to China for an intensive program with or without professional help” to change my personality, beliefs, and behavior. I refused, and my parents threatened to hurt me, so I relented and signed it. However, that “contract” that my dad and I signed did not state any legal ramifications or any time parameters nor was it notarized so I am not sure of its legality. They said I have no say in the matter and they control me because they pay for my tuition and living expenses. 

I know that life will be really hard when I do drop out. For the time being, I’m saving up money. By the time I withdraw, I will hopefully have about $5,000 in savings. I will most likely have to work two jobs, probably minimum wage, 60-70 hours a week to survive. But even that beats having to deal with my parents and my deteriorating mental health. After I drop, I’m leaving and going NC. I just can’t deal with it anymore. It’s not worth staying another year and finishing my degree. Biology is pretty useless without going to grad school, and I hate my major anyway but my parents refuse to let me change it. I have changed it in the past, but could not find something that I was passionate about. I feel like I’m just really lost and I’m worried about whether I’ll be able to survive financially. I appreciate any advice.

Edit: Thanks for all the advice! I made an appointment with my therapist for next week and I'll look into all the resources the school has to offer me while I'm still here. I do hope to go back to college someday, but for now, I think I'll take a year off or so and just work and save money.

**Edit 2: [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/7356dv/homeless_pencil_10_x_13_inches/?st=j85b8dcc&amp;sh=a04755e8) is a link to an artwork I did three years ago when I was 15. I'm not sure which path I want to go in art/design, but I'm thinking illustration. I love doing detailed work, and I also love photography/videography and doing motion graphics. If anyone has any experience working in art, I'd love for you to share your journey.**

**Edit 3: Thank you kind stranger for the gold! I've never gotten one before!**

Thank you for opening my post and hopefully there is someone willing to play this for me. We can start and see where it leads.

We have met at work. I am a doctor in my 4th year and you are a med student doing an internship in our hospital. I was quiet famous for taking girls with me until I met you. I fell in love. How is it called? The lion falls in love with the sheep? :D We have been dating for a while and we never did anything more then kissing. You had decided to wait for the right one, you decided to wait until your wedding night. I wouldn't have imagined I would meet a person like you or live in a sexless relationship. Years passed by and you were still a virgin, except I would get blowjobs.

There I am, waiting for you to enter the altar to be finally my wife. I love you with all my heart and you me. It is going to be a complete new world for us.

In this play I would like you to play the innocent, shy girl who got introduced to sex, who gets a more and more rising sex drive and who likes to try new stuff. Lets have a nice wedding, wedding night, honeymoon...maybe after a time we try to get pregnant?

Kinks: Romance, Teasing, Lingerie, passionate sex, rough sex, semi clothed sex, Passion, Oral"

733cxh,5,2017-09-28,"Husband is a pharmacist and wants more than retail, what are his options Aside from quitting his job and doing a pg-y1?",WillowCat89,PharmacySchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/PharmacySchool/comments/733cxh/husband_is_a_pharmacist_and_wants_more_than/,"Please delete if not allowed, as I am not the pharmacist or potential student. My husband has worked for Walmart for 10 years.. started as an intern, got hired full-time at a high salary for our area and for retail in general, got promoted to a manager and got put in a few hard positions. He stepped down and is now a floater, making an extremely high salary for our area. He only lost $1.00 per hour when he went from being manager to floater, and he was already the highest paid manager in the area.

He loves having students with him. He loves MTM counseling. He loves working in immunization clinics. He is massively over retail. He decided against a residency year because he just wanted to start making money. He has not gone on to get any additional board certifications. We bought a house, we bought a car, we want children and this is all planned around maintaining his $3,800 a week paycheck. There is some flex room, but not much. He has been so depressed and felt stuck over the past several years that he takes 0 initiative in attending in-person trainings, CE's, etc. He won't think about going back to school, and I don't think he'll do a residency year.  

He told me today that he saw an opening for a Clinical position at WalMart and I looked up Walmart's requirements and recommendations for the Clinical District Manager position. 

They include the following..
**Minimum:** basic Pharm.D, 1 year expierence, immunizations and CPR certification
**Preferred:** Board Certified Pharmacotherapy Specialist (BCPS) or Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist (BCACP), APhA Delivering Medication Therapy Management Services certification , 3 years experience delivering advanced patient care services in a community pharmacy, 1 year experience developing advanced patient care services in a community pharmacy, Completion of a post-graduate year one (PGY-1) community pharmacy or ambulatory care residency, 1 year experience presenting to groups, training/facilitating, or classroom instruction

The only thing out of that ""preferred"" list that he has is a year+ of training new employees. As a retail pharmacist at WalMart, he's not going to develop patient care practices, he's not going to deliver those advanced care practices and he does not have any of the Board Certifications. I looked the Board Certifications up and from what I could tell, completing a PG-Y1 is required in order to get the certification. 

I would sell my house, my car and delay having children, even though I'm going to be 28 soon, if it meant he could get a job he genuinely liked. I would go from making $160,000 combined to $60,000 combined a year if it meant he'd get the job he wanted. However, I do not think he will go back and do a residency year. 

Are they ANY other ways to get these certifications and to get the knowledge required for a clinical job aside from completely quitting his current job and going back to do a residency? Could anyone offer any advice that I might be able to give him? Any older students here have experience quitting your job and starting over? 

Any input is greatly, greatly appreciated. I just want to give my smart, talented and totally capable husband some hope and some guidance, but I don't know anything about this. Again, if this is not allowed, I'm sorry."

I just turned 21, but have been drinking ~2x per week since I was 18. Usually stay away from sodas as mixers, but recently discovered hard soda and down it by the 6-pack. (I KNOW IT'S BAD)

I have problems with binge eating and laxative abuse. The highest I have ever weighed was about 155 last summer, brought it down to 135 over 6 months by skipping meals and cutting out alcohol, got back up to 145-150 slowly at first and more quickly after starting my internship about 3 months ago. 

I walk for about 10 minutes at lunch everyday at my internship (8 hr days w 30 min lunch). About 6x each week I go for either a run, a bike ride, or a swim. Had been injured w/ stress fractures so I was forced to take about 2 months off (that's why I picked up swim/bike) which also explains some of the weight gain. Runs are about 30 mins most days, bike rides more like 2 hrs 2x a week, I've been lazy about swimming but usually that's like 45 mins of slow laps with breaks 1x a week. 

I binge eat about 1-3x each week (usually after alcohol) and overeat most nights, whether ""overeating"" a small snack when I was supposed to have only 1200 cals that day or whether just shy of full-on binging. For normal eating, I drink black coffee in the morning (8a - 0 cals), for lunch (12p) I have some beef jerky (100 cals), hummus (150 cals), and raw veggies (70), for a snack (3p) I have a Quest protein bar (220 cals), second snack (5p) either fresh or dried fruit (100) and some nuts or nut butter (150). Then my workout, then my planned dinner around 8pm is supposed to be something like pasta+chicken+sauce+cheese+cooked veggies, or DIY chipotle, either way supposed to be like 800 total and the last thing I eat. That's when I either eat an entire thing of candy/ice cream, or just end up getting takeout (usually with sweets after too). 

I know I need to fix my behaviors. And just to quickly defend myself, the reason I don't ""just stop buying sweets"" is because I always end up binging and at least this way I'm not ordering delivery and trying to get rid of it all bc seeing leftover cinnastix is a bad look (makes me regret, feel hopeless, roommates judge me, feel like I need to finish the leftovers the next night). I know I need to add weight training, I lifted about 3x a week for 2 years, but social anxiety is just way too bad now. Trust me - I'm already beating myself up about not lifting. I just wish I could even think about going in a gym without panicking. Re: alcohol I am going to stop drinking at home. I am struggling to find new friends in the city where I'm interning, and most of the running clubs run their routes from a brewery and then all grab a pint after. So I'll probably join them on that just for the friendship and running aspects. 

Diabetes or not, I know I need to fix these things. I just want to know how bad the damage already is. 

I am seeing a general physician on Saturday, but I didn't bring this concern up on the phone making the appointment - I just said I wanted my first general check up since I was a kid. 

In the mean time, what should I expect and more importantly WHAT DO I DO????"

I'm in my early 20s. My current internship as a civilian working for the U.S. military is ending soon. Around the same time I started keto in June I started working here. In that time I have come to resent my supervisor pretty heavily and today was the last straw. 

Over the course of the Summer I was made to do personal chores for my arrogant princess of a supervisor including packing her personal items in her office and putting them up in her new office in the building we got transferred to. (Note that this is inappropriate in this workplace. I would have complained, but I didn't want to risk losing my internship which pays decently) She would also point me to someone else when I needed her help with something and would inconvenience me to any degree if it meant even the slightest lessening of inconvenience to her. If she forgot to do something for me, she would give me a look like she thought I was lying. Same if I did something and she missed it. I was also challenged when genuinely needing to take sick leave for a dental appointment.

Now for the relevant part: 
About a week ago she asked me if I wanted to grab a free pastry from the chaplain's office. I explained that I was on a special diet and couldn't have things like that. She asked what it was, not really caring to listen, (I was familiar with this tone from her) and how effective it was. It's worth mentioning that she's the one person who apparently hadn't noticed any change in my weight. I told her that I had lost almost 50 lbs. by that point and again I got the tone of ""I don't care"" over fake amazement. I think ""Whatever, I'm not doing this to impress an ugly old woman anyways."" But today was crossing the line.

Everyone in our ""department"" of the organization gets called into a meeting and I figure part of it is being recognized for my internship ending. It was, but the problem is that my supervisor decided to buy food for the occasion. Knowing full-well that I'm on a diet that doesn't allow sweets, she goes out and buys multiple cinnamon and icing desserts from a pizza place. Then she explains that she was hungry and didn't have lunch (cry me a river, I've been having one meal a day on Tuesday and Thursday and nothing on M/W/F lately which means no lunch at work for the past month or so) so she couldn't even wait to get back to the office before eating a piece. I've made a shorter term goal of getting down to 250 lbs. in about a month and just this morning I got back on track down to 269.8 lbs. So as I'm on a tight diet schedule she offers me a piece before anyone else. I'm now in a position of looking incredibly rude or taking a setback. 

I go over the choices in my head. I can decline and look rude in front of everyone I will probably need references from in looking for a job moving forward, I can take a bite and just hold it in my mouth until I can spit it out after the meeting that is to follow (which could go on for 90 minutes and I may have to talk), or I can eat some and fold. So I take the safest bet and just eat a couple small bites as much as it killed me. I'm not even big on sweets btw. My cravings are always rolls, potatoes, or pasta. Turns out, the meeting does go 90 minutes and I do have to talk towards the end of it. Then I toss the rest of my piece in the garbage. 

For anyone curious, at my heaviest I was 360 lbs. Without keto I got to 320 lbs. and stalled there for a bunch of months while I had a lot of personal problems in my life. Around mid June I started keto and was at 269 lbs. this morning. My short term goal is 250 by my birthday in early November which is my 1 cheat day. I only have 4 more hours working this job and then I'm taking a week off from looking for a job to exercise my butt off and work on other personal tasks.

TL;DR: My boss is a terrible person who went as far as to make me be rude (in a way that matters) or eat a dessert knowing I was on keto."
733t7o,1,2017-09-28,Rent a place or travel with such money? (Brazil),iKousen,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/733t7o/rent_a_place_or_travel_with_such_money_brazil/,"Hello Guys,
So I current live with my parents and about to grad at college, with 23y. I have internship so didn't pay for studying, and got promoted at my job and am making more money than I ever did. I'm now worried about what to do with my life as I got a good job now and am looking for good work-life balance and quality. I always wanted to travel the world, but never did, and at the same time, have some idea of about in 5years leave the country for good. But currently I'm getting crappy sleep times, eating badly, and taking too much time to go to work (about 1h a day). I hangout mostly with my gf at her city that is about 1 hour and half away too. 


* Plan A) Renting a place
I found this good quality apartment at her city on the downtown where everything happens: parties, pubs, good food, mails; and at the same time it got some quality security (that is a major concern here at Brazil) and that place is relatively good.

    I would spend 25% of my budget on renting the place, 25% on subscriptions and bills, 12.5% hanging out and buying some stuff (like the furniture first), 12.5% as an emergency fund and the remaining 25% I would be saving for eventually leave the country investing it somewhere.
Here at my country we got a free 13th salary, that I would be using exclusively for travelling. 

    The investment would be enough for making so considerable money, enough for living for sure, or even studying outside or paying for half an apartment if the plan changes.

* Plan B) Keep living with my parents
Its not all that bad where I live as I got a great family. I could keep living with then and using the money I would spend on renting to travel more often.

    I would spend 15% on helping home bills, 10% on subscriptions and bills, 12.% hanging out and buying stuff still, 12.5% as emergency fund, and the same 25% as investment for leaving the country eventualy.

    That is, I would be saving 25% more, that I could use to travel at the south america with my gf every 4 months with great conform or every 8 to 12 months to outside the continent.

* Plan C) buy a place for myself instead of renting
Not the greatest idea as the country is going downhill here and I'm not sure what I want to do with my life, just wanting to live, but nevertheless, still thinking about it.


P.S. I would like to add that getting a place for myself would be a lot more comfortable for being with my gf and would help her too for when she has class at the downtown as she lives kinda far away from here (even more from my current place, about 3 hours away) and could stay with me. And we mostly hangout around there.

P.S2 If I would like to make more money, I would TRY making a kickstart or something, but I'm happy with living well, so I don't see the point of saving the money that I would use to travel of the option B together with the investment fund to make money faster, but I may be wrong.

Thanks in advance"

Hi, I'm a woman in college and I'm scared I might have diabetes or prediabetes. I am 5'6 and weigh about 145- 150 pounds. I'm white. 

Existing conditions: depression/anxiety/tons of mental issues TBH, acne, had stress fractures in lower legs.

Current medications: Wellbutrin, a multivitamin, physillum husk, laxative abuse, ibuprofen 1x a month or so. 


I just turned 21, but have been drinking ~2x per week since I was 18. Usually stay away from sodas as mixers, but recently discovered hard soda and down it by the 6-pack. I know alcohol is unhealthy for everyone so I'm stopping that. 

I have problems with binge eating and laxative abuse. Binge since I was a kid, worsened about 3 years ago. Laxative use/abuse started about 10 months ago and I stopped using them about a month ago. 

The highest I have ever weighed was about 155 last summer, brought it down to 135 over 6 months by skipping meals and cutting out alcohol, got back up to 145-150 slowly at first and more quickly after starting my internship about 3 months ago.

I walk for about 10 minutes at lunch everyday at my internship (8 hr days w 30 min lunch). About 6x each week I go for either a run, a bike ride, or a swim. Had been injured w/ stress fractures so I was forced to take about 2 months off (that's why I picked up swim/bike) which also explains some of the weight gain. Runs are about 30 mins most days, bike rides more like 2 hrs 2x a week, I've been lazy about swimming but usually that's like 45 mins of slow laps with breaks 1x a week.

I binge eat about 1-3x each week (usually after alcohol) and overeat most nights, whether ""overeating"" a small snack when I was supposed to have only 1200 cals that day or whether just shy of full-on binging. For normal eating, I drink black coffee in the morning (8a - 0 cals), for lunch (12p) I have some beef jerky (100 cals), hummus (150 cals), and raw veggies (70), for a snack (3p) I have a Quest protein bar (220 cals), second snack (5p) either fresh or dried fruit (100) and some nuts or nut butter (150). Then my workout, then my planned dinner around 8pm is supposed to be something like pasta+chicken+sauce+cheese+cooked veggies, or DIY chipotle, either way supposed to be like 800 total and the last thing I eat. That's when I either eat an entire thing of candy/ice cream, or just end up getting takeout (usually with sweets after too).

I know I need to fix my behaviors. And just to quickly defend myself, the reason I don't ""just stop buying sweets"" is because I always end up binging and at least this way I'm not ordering delivery and trying to get rid of it all bc seeing leftover cinnastix is a bad look (makes me regret, feel hopeless, roommates judge me, feel like I need to finish the leftovers the next night). I know I need to add weight training, I lifted about 3x a week for 2 years, but social anxiety is just way too bad now. Trust me - I'm already beating myself up about not lifting. I just wish I could even think about going in a gym without panicking. Re: alcohol I am going to stop drinking at home. I am struggling to find new friends in the city where I'm interning, and most of the running clubs run their routes from a brewery and then all grab a pint after. So I'll probably join them on that just for the friendship and running aspects.

Diabetes or not, I know I need to fix these things. I just want to know how bad the damage already is.

I am seeing a general physician on Saturday, but I didn't bring this concern up on the phone making the appointment - I just said I wanted my first general check up since I was a kid.

In the mean time, what should I expect and more importantly WHAT DO I DO????"

Because of this, I highly recommend you go and [check out the previous seasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/71vtnp/d_playhouse_season_archive/) if you haven't already before moving on to this season, just so you are informed of certain events or people that may be mentioned by others in their bios or in the season write-up.*

Hello simulators of the world! I am proud to present the fifth installment of the Playhouse series, which thankfully was created a lot quicker than the previous season was. This season, we have a batch of fifteen new houseguests ready to duke it out. However, their journies won’t be very easy. They’ll have to fight through fast forwards, an instant eviction, and a unique twist known as ‘The Champion’s Blessing.’ Who will have what it takes to climb to the top and seize victory, and whose game will spiral out of control on this spiral staircase?

[The season simulation is right here,](http://brantsteele.net/bigbrother/canada1/r.php?c=KJfGM7FW) and [the write-up is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12t5t-xaYT16OlFhj7D4m7krGanSTtXMRljCe9DI5RDw/edit?usp=sharing) as usual. Bios are down below, with the fan favorite poll at the very bottom of this post. **If your character didn’t get into this season, don’t worry! They’re still in consideration for future seasons, and you can still submit more characters to try and increase your chances of being a part of this series.** I gotta say, I had a lot of strong and diverse applications from this season, so I’m glad for you guys being more creative and thinking up more character types for me to work with. The characters you submitted will not go to waste, I can assure you all that. Anyways, bios! Read them or not, but either way, enjoy the season as a whole! :D

“Hi, my name’s Anick, but my parents and a few friends always called me Annie and I liked that more so...please just call me Annie instead. I'm a clairvoyant! That means I can see into the future and stuff! You think that’d be exciting, but it can get pretty boring sometimes. And let me tell ya, I hate being bored. Growing up in a poor household fighting the poverty line every weekend, I had days where I would mess around and try to get in trouble just to have a little more excitement. Why, I remember one day where I just wrestled with a pig. In the middle of Texas. Yep, the epitome of entertainment, heh. Coming into this game, I'm here to get myself situated with more cash. As you can probably tell, I’m not rolling in dough every day with a job as a professional clairvoyant. So, I'm here to do what my family couldn't do: get in a better position, money-wise. I can see into the future, and I know that I see myself standing there as a winner in front of the playhouse front doors. Now I just need to make that vision a reality!”

* Drake ‘Pat’ Patton, a 21 year old accountant from Tampa, Florida (created by fastpatton)

“Hey, name’s Pat. I'm an accountant--well, more like an accountant-in-training, but whatever. I'm really good with math and numbers, just works well with me. I applied to this gameshow because I want to meet new people. I know, living in a city like Tampa I should be able to meet new people all the time, right? Thing is, I'm not very in-touch with the people from my area, so I'm hoping that maybe going into a more diverse crowd will help me make some new friends. Obviously I'm also playing for the money and the title as well, ‘cause having the title of Champion sounds really dope, but I mainly just want to interact with some new and interesting individuals. My plan to win the game is to connect with people, get a key ally I can trust, and use my logical numbers-driven mind to find out the best way to proceed forward in the game. Sounds like an easy plan, and I know it won't be that simple, but nothing in life ever is and I'm ready to take on the complexities that this game will throw at me.”

* Dylan Miller, a 29 year old WWE announcer from Kalamazoo, Michigan (created by Dylanm0325)

“Dylan Miller here, bringing you the latest update on the match: currently, everyone in the cast has been sequestered from one another. Tensions are high, anticipations are higher, and everyone is nervous for what the coming weeks will bring. Heh, anyways, in case you couldn't tell already I'm an announcer. And in case you didn't recognize my voice either, my name is Dylan Miller. I work with the WWE to announce wrestling matches around the country. I was always told that I have a great voice for speaking in public, and I loved watching wrestling growing up, so I figured, to hell with it, why not make it the best of both worlds? Luckily, I did, and here I am now. Going into a game like this, having a good voice is an essential tool to succeed. You need to be able to speak persuasively and confidently enough to get your point across effectively. I know about the rhetorical triangle--ethos, logos, pathos--and I plan to make use of that as well by incorporating it in my natural speech, whether it be me casually talking or trying to swing someone over to my side. I guess I should also mention I'm a bachelor, and have been dating on-and-off over the past few years, so I'm open to the possibility of a showmance in this house. Just so long as it works out for me, I'd be willing to hook up with any girl in that house. That's besides the point, though. I'm just here to win for myself, no one else, and I won't let others get in the way of that with the power of my voice!”

* Federico Milluo, a 33 year old nurse from Brooklyn, New York (created by weetale)

“Ay, my name is Federico, and I’m a male nurse from Brooklyn. I got three kids, all little angels whom I love very much as much as I can. I’m not the most talkative guy, but I do like meeting new people and hearing their stories. I don’t love people as much as I end up respecting people. Speaking of which, respect and loyalty are my two biggest traits when it comes to people. I try to stay loyal to those who back me up and those I make promises to, and I also respect those who earn my respect. In this game, I won’t hate my competitors even if I get into an intense rivalry. I’ll have a huge respect for them if they impress me. My plan is to just play the game in the moment. I don’t plan on being heroic, and I don’t plan on being villainous, I just plan on being strategic and doing things based on the needs of the moment. My goal is to make it to the jury phase, just like everyone else I suppose. Apart from that, my goal is to obviously win. I just want to make sure I leave my mark on this game. I like it too much to finally come into it and then fail miserably. I’m here for the sake of myself, my pride, and my family, and with all that motivating me to do my best, I’m sure I can take home the win at the end of this multi-week journey.”

* Gavin Boatwright, a 38 year old computer engineer from Orono, Maine (created by Ever24)

“You know, I think computers are just fascinating. They're so complex--always have been, but especially now more than ever. Anyways, that's not really relevant to this, but um...hi! I'm Gavin Boatwright, and I'm a computer engineer in Maine. I work for a tech company there, one of the heads of most projects. I grew up in a household with a mother who always was around to care for us, a father who worked long shifts but came home happier than the previous day once he saw us all at home, and my six sisters. That's right, six sisters. Not a single brother, and surrounded by girly gossip and drama on all sides. Naturally, because of this, I drifted to the internet for most of my early social interaction. Since then, I grew a love for computers and ended up taking many classes related to them in high school. At sixteen, I got an internship at an electronics shop where I got to work with stuff like that all the time. The owner let me disassemble and reassemble all the unsold equipment in the backroom, so I got very familiar with how that stuff worked. I can proudly say I self-taught myself most of the skills I use in my daily work now. I was able to get hired at twenty after gaining a two-year degree, and with my previous learned skills, I got the job! So, here I am now, playing this game, because ironically I need a break from the screens. I need more time with people, as my leadership and communication skills have been lacking at work. Hopefully this game allows me to grow stronger, although I'm pretty skeptical about it in all honesty. Either way, I hope you guys enjoy watching me, and my conversations about computers with all the other houseguests!”

Jimmy wants to make friends too! Jimmy never trusts alliances! Jimmy watched the previous seasons, alliances can backstab you! But if Jimmy's only option to join a alliance, the alliance have to earn Jimmy's trust, Jimmy is a bartender! Jimmy does drinks and stuff! Jimmy needs the money to live his life to the fullest! Jimmy's strategy is unknown, Jimmy just goes with it! Jimmy will never give up! Jimmy wants to be friends with everyone! Jimmy will try his best to win! And Jimmy's friends will help out! If friends help him out, Jimmy will help them out too! But there are bad, bad people! Bad people won't be Jimmy's friend! Because they are baaaaad! Jimmy will defeat bad people! Jimmy's friends will help beat the bad people! Jimmy is done talking for now! Jimmy is out!”

""I am John Cole, but the guys at work call me 'Goofy' for more than one reason, heh. I'm forty-seven, divorced, and I work at Disney World for a living. I didn't always work at Disney World, I used to be a programmer up until my late thirties. I just...felt a need to change things up after, erm...well, nevermind that. Growing up, I had a decent life. Two parents that stuck together and treated me right. I was an only child, so no siblings, but I got along just fine without a brother or sister. I'm in this game to help find a cure for cancer. Specifically, leukemia. It's a deadly force that kills many people a year, and I want to help find a way to cure it by donating eighty percent of the winnings towards its research. I'm planning on winning by using my more laid back behavior to attract folks into talking and aligning with me, and once I have those connections, stick with the people in power for as long as possible. I am capable of winning competitions and do plan to have a few of those under my belt as well before I walk outta here, but I don't want to be the one pissing people off and will only strike if someone is already pissed off at me. So, that's who I am, that's my plan, and hopefully I get in there and win this thing. Wish me luck!”

* Karen ‘Duchess’ Johnson, a 54 year old burlesque dancer from Atlantic City, New Jersey (created by Sorenby)

""Well, hello, darlings! I am Karen Johnson, however, I do prefer to go by my stage name, 'Duchess.' It helps me feel like a separate identity when on stage performing, and when I'm just out on the streets ordering a morning coffee. That being said, yes, I do consider this game to be one big performance. It has it's acts, it's stories, it's characters. So, I am here to be a part of a grand production, in a sense! It's just an improv show instead of something scripted, which I'm fine with. So, I am a burlesque dancer. Have been for the past thirty-four years, and I still feel almost as young as I did when I started. Because of this youth mentality, I've been able to get along with all sorts of people, young and old. Age isn't really a factor to me in my mind. Some people view it as a hindrance, I just see it as a number used to label people so movie theaters and restaurants know how much to charge people for movies and meals. I will say, however, that I want to compete and win this game to prove that older people, especially older woman like myself, can put up as much of a fight as the younger people. I'll try sticking to older people like myself, but like I said, age isn't a factor to me and I can get along and relate to anyone if given enough time. So, I hope you all have fun watching me, because I'll have fun making this production entertaining for you all~”

* Keesha Smith, a 28 year old computer animator from Chicago, Illinois (created by MakiDivine)

“Keesha Smith, twenty-eight, I work as a computer animator in Chicago. I've been told to be a fairly blunt gal. I typically let people know if I have a problem with them pretty quickly, I admit to my faults without beating around the bush, and I address things the way they are. No need to sugarcoat when the sugar doesn't add anything to the taste. My plan for this game is to just coast along. Become part of an alliance, and try to be the glue that holds it together for as long as possible. I'm not here for a showmance and I'm not here for the title, I'm here for the money because I still have student loans to pay off from college, and it'd help to not have that burden on my shoulders anymore. I think I can win this game because people appreciate honesty, especially in a game like this. They think it translates to loyalty, which isn't always the case, but it still works in my favor when people think I'm doing them a favor by telling them things in an upfront way and appreciate my honesty and mistake it for me being loyal to them. I'm only loyal to myself. That's the way it's been and the way it'll stay. No offense to the other people here, of course, but I just can't afford to sacrifice my game for someone else in a situation like this. I do think I have a big chance to win this season, maybe arrogantly so, but all the same I know that I'll get in there and do well.”

* Kerry Rose, a 32 year old circus performer from Greensboro, North Carolina (created by FrieNads)

“I'm Kerry Rose, and I've been performing in a circus for the past seven years. An odd introduction, I know, but trust me I'm not a clown or anything. I perform acts of physical spectacularity. Flexibility, trapeze acts, lifting huge weights, I do all those acts for my circus show. I didn't dream to be a part of the circus, but it's still an enjoyable life for me. That being said, I do workout a lot to stay in shape and keep up the ability to do those acts. I can't let up or else I risk losing my job to some younger, better-performing athlete. As you can probably guess, I am very in shape as a result. I won't try to hide this during the game. In fact, I plan on using my physical prowess to it's full advantage and win as many competitions as possible with my abilities. I also want to lead. Leading just comes naturally to me, so being the leader of an alliance or a backdoor or a rivalry or whatever, I just want to be in control. Sometimes I feel like I need to be in control. I'll have to watch that I'm not hugely straining on my allies, as being too strict with my leadership can lead to poor jury management. I do think I can win this game, easily. I just have to make it to the end, and then I've got it in the bag. No need to wish me luck, as I know it's already on my side.”

*The interview area is just an empty chair, until suddenly a puff of smoke appears. Once the smoke fades, Marina can be seen sitting down in the chair.* ""Ta-daaa! Greetings, everyone, I am Marina Cynthoco, magician extraordinaire! Well, I mean, that description isn't entirely accurate...yet. I'm not that well known at the moment. However, I am still a magician nonetheless! I'm here to make my mark on this series and get some recognition from it. I know a reality TV show isn't the best way to go about that, but hey, with half a million on the line as well, I really don't care if I get famous or not! At the end of it all the cash will make up for any fame that I don't receive just from being here. So, gameplan! I want to find someone else who enjoys trickery and deception, which are essential qualities to being a magician. I plan on playing a little dirty, but letting my partner take the fall for anything villainous we do together. Think of it like Jon and Lars in season two, except that one of them ends up backstabbing the other when things go south--which, honestly, when I was watching season two is something I'm surprised never happened, but the point still stands! I am not afraid to play, and hopefully the rest of this house isn't either or else I'll be low on magic tricks to deceive these people with. So, with that, I think I'll be off! Nice chatting with ya!” *With that, Marina pulls out what looks to be a smoke grenade and throws it on the ground. It is heard thumping on the ground, but nothing happens. Marina awkwardly picks it back up and is about to throw it on the ground again when it suddenly goes off in her hand, surprising her and causing her to fall backwards off of the chair.*

I grew up and started my channel at age 17, since then I've gotten 75K subscribers! I'm going into this game to pay off rents since YouTube really isn't paying me much, heh heh!

“Heyo! My name is Nick, but most of my friends just call me Nifty. Now, I know this is gonna sound weird...but ever since I was casted, I've been able to know exactly what’s going to happen in this season. I know, you're probably skeptical, and honestly I am to an extent too. It's really weird, but it's like an internal voice telling me how things are going to go. It's even told me everyone else’s introduction interviews, so I already have an idea of the competition ahead of me. I'll have to wait until I'm inside the house and stuff actually happens to see if I'm just crazy or if this voice has been telling me what's truly destined to happen, if destiny is even a thing. Anyways, other than this weird voice stuff, I'm an 18 year old just going into college this fall. Gonna try to go on to get a degree in film production, ‘cause I've always had a knack for visual storytelling! I also write little scenes and stories as a hobby. Some fan fictions, too, which is a little embarrassing to admit but it still helps me with my writing. Since the voice has told me I'm not gonna win the game, I guess my goal in this game is to just make sure things happen the way they’ve been told to me. Maybe drop a few mysterious hints and riddles here and there to foreshadow things and confuse people, heh! I’ve always liked riddles and stuff anyways. Hopefully these people do as well.”

* Nicoleta ‘Nikki’ Garcia, a 31 year old strip club manager from Las Vegas, Nevada (created by SenorWildCard, who also made Nikki’s bio, which I appreciate a lot!)

“My name is Nikki Garcia, and I can confidently say I'm the baddest bitch in the building. I've been living on my own by my wits since I was 15, when I was kicked out by my (devoutly Mormon) parents and between then and now, I've gotten my GED and eventually an MBA from UNLV and I've worked my way up from being an exotic dancer at a strip club to being the second in command, just under the owner. Game-wise, I am 100% in it to win it. My strategy is to take the skills I learned in the classroom and the club and use them to try and trick people into underestimating me, manipulating situations so that other people will target each other and making people feel like I'm their #1 when I'm really not, so that they'll open up about their alliances and future strategic moves which I can exploit to my own advantage. Am I open to a showmance? Possibly, if the situation were advantageous (but I'd ditch their ass in a second if it's becoming a sinking ship - I WAS a stripper after all, I know when a loser is a loser). I think that my biggest possible downfalls in this game would be my temper, because I do not tolerate anyone disrespecting me in any form (I've dealt with enough of that shit in my life) and my tough exterior, because it could rub certain types of people the wrong way. I'm gonna treat my time at the Playhouse like it's just another night at the club: walk in, get the job done, and walk out with a $500,000 check.”

* Ronni Kvapil, a 57 year old grocery store manager from Kent, Ohio (created by me)

“I’ll say this right here, I’m not here for the money, or the title, or whatever d-list celebrity fame some of these young kids can think they can gain from a small, ripoff sideshow like this. I’m here to compete. I’m a fighting spirit, and in my day to day life at work, the most conflict I get is arguing with a customer about some mundane or pointless thing going on in the store once or twice a month. I want action and excitement. These old bones haven’t turned to dust yet and can still move around and compete against all these twenty-somethings that I’m sure this house will be infested with. Maybe few thirty-somethings if I’m lucky. I want to prove that I can still hold my own. I want to prove that truly anyone can win a game like this. I’m here to prove myself and entertain myself. What that entails, I don’t give a damn. I’ll stay loyal as a dog, or be a backstabbing asshole if I have to be. One things for certain, I won’t go down easily. I’m gonna leave my mark on this season, and it's gonna be one huge-ass mark, I’ll tell ya that.”

My name is Tony and I'd like to introduce myself. I'm 23 years old, and in my senior year of college. I've been addicted to many things throughout the last decade (opiates, food, alcohol, cigarettes, porn, social attention, you name it). Alcoholism runs deeply in my family, and I was addicted to drinking from my first drink at age 14.

I've cut out a lot of my ""worse"" addictions, but I know that I do need to quit drinking eventually or it will ruin my future. I've know this for awhile, but I just haven't been ready to completely quit yet. There are things that have been going well in my life; I have a good internship, I'm graduating this year with decent grades, and I've been ""trying"" to live a healthier life. 

I don't drink every day either, honestly only on the weekends. But I absolutely cannot stop once I start drinking..and black out about half of the time. I end up doing dangerous things that almost get me arrested, or just completely trash my reputation. I want to stop, but it's so hard for me to do while still in college. And there really isn't a whole lot else to do here on the weekends. 90% of my social life comes from drinking, and I really don't know anyone who doesn't drink on the weekends. I've tried ""moderation"" a million times, but it really doesn't work to well for me.

I'm looking to meet some people on here, and get perspective from people both around my age, and older than me. Thanks for reading!!"

I started my internship yesterday, and one thing I was instructed to do was to go through all of the laptops that were marked as broken.  They also told me that I could take any parts I'd like for myself, so I did.  In the end of just four hours, I had managed to get a total of (21) 320GB drives, (2) 500GB, and (1) 1TB.  I'd like to incorporate these into my homelab, but I'm struggling on how to do it.  This is what I've come up with so far:

**Plan:**

Get an HP D2700, PERC H200E, and use as DAS in WS2012r2 VM in ESXi on my R710.

Any suggestions?  These are 24 drives, but my budget is only around $200~.

734g4m,1,2017-09-28,WTF is wrong with me,dprssdthrowaway5,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/734g4m/wtf_is_wrong_with_me/,"I hate this. I hate this I hate this I hate this. Everyone is making good progress in their lives while I'm still stuck here, the same spot I've been in for the past few years. I can't get a job. I can't go back to school. Then wtf am I supposed to do?

My highest level of education is graduating from high school. I attended college but had to withdraw due to financial issues, as suggested by the school. Now all my friends have long graduated and continued on with their lives/studies and I'm still here. Our financial status hasn't gotten any better. Then my bro decides to go to a private school which costs so much that he has to use MY education funds to pay for HIS school fees. So if I go back to studying, I'd barely have enough funds for myself.

No one wants to hire me and I don't know why. I've sent multiple applications, and physically showed up, at various places. I've reviewed my resume over and over again, got second and third opinions; I even mentioned why I had to withdraw from college so employers would not get the impression that I'm 'lazy' or whatever. I got the OK, so I don't think the resume is a problem? I've always been a sociable, outgoing person, and as a kid I often had people telling me that this was a brilliant trait that would benefit me greatly in the future. Like. GETTING A JOB. But how can I portray this when I'm not even being called in for interviews?? 

I applied for the same jobs with some of my friends, at the same time. They got the jobs within two weeks. I still have not received any phone calls. It's so ironic that jobs that claim to require ZERO EXPERIENCE hire the experienced applicants. How tf am I supposed to gain any experience at all then, if this keeps happening?? It's ironic when a place is DESPERATE for employees and need someone who can work immediately; I'm here willing to do whatever I can, any time, but I never hear from them again. I can draw digitally so I decided to open commissions, I kept the price reasonable because I know my friends and the intended market are mostly young adults like me who still do not have much money. I let my friends know, they let their friends know, etcetc. But so far nothing. My friends kept saying how they were gonna commission something from me and were so excited when I announced them, but it's been weeks now and I still get nothing. One said he would even PM me that night but he didn't. I wanted to ask about it but I figured, he'd just started his internship, he probably doesn't have the money at the moment, and I don't want to bother him. He recently commissioned another artist, a mutual friend, so maybe he spent his money on that commission first, whatever. I feel so fucking invisible no matter what I do. No one acknowledges me, and it's like I don't even exist at all. If this is how it's gonna be then there should be no reason for me to stay any longer.

I'm well in my 20s now. I hate leeching off my family. I want to earn money and contribute to the expenses too. I can tell my parents are getting tired of seeing me like this. I can feel them and all my relatives, my friends' families, looking down at me amd judging me heavily. How pathetic it must be to be an adult and still have to depend on my family because I don't have a job. I bet they think I'm a freeloader, and that I'm just too lazy to care. But I'm TRYING. I swear I'M TRYING AS BEST AS I CAN. But I have nothing to show for it. You know how they say that if everyone seems to have a problem with you, then that means YOU are the actual problem? This is how it feels right now.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but there must be something wrong with me. I've had help from several people to try and improve myself, etc, and I don't want all that to be for nothing. I feel like such a fucking failure, maybe by disappearing I'll be doing everyone a favor, because then my parents do not have to be ashamed or have to live with a burden like me. I'm sure that if I die, instead of grieving they'd just be like ""Good riddance lol"" and move on with their lives.

I don't know any more. I don't want to continue living like this, constantly feeling like a failure. I'm starting to lose all hope in everything. Maybe I'd be better off dead since I'm not contributing to society or anything. Whatever."

I have a question about rental car insurance in the U.S. (Connecticut).

I'm in the following situation: I'm from Europe and I am doing an internship in Connecticut right now. I've purchased a vehicle, but I am not allowed to drive it yet (have to wait 10 business days, then apply for social security card, have to wait again, go to the DMV, etc..).

Because it's not that easy to do daily stuff here without a car I want to get a rental car for a few days. I am not sure about the insurance though, so maybe someone here can help me with that:

I currently have no U.S. car insurance whatsoever, because I have to wait for my SSC before i can do that. However I do have a special liability insurance from Europe. This insurance is basically the same what you would call a ""SLI"" (supplemental liability insurance) in the States: it covers body injury and property damage up to a million euros - worldwide.

However - this insurance will only cover me, if there is already some basic liability coverage on the car.

So my question is: If I rent a car in Connecticut, is there already some basic liability coverage on the car or not (for example the state limits 20.000$/40.000$) ? I've read on the internet that, in order to register the car, the rental company is required to have basic coverage, but I couldn't find a second source on that.

I've also contacted the rental company but they said they have no idea about this - and I went through the whole rental agreement (which is on their website) but found nothing about it.

Can someone help my with that and give me some advice? I would be extremely grateful for that.

734wu8,4,2017-09-28,Just had an interview for a Frac Operator Assistant 1 position with Halliburton and have a couple questions (Recent Graduate).,GeauxTigers1992,oilandgasworkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgasworkers/comments/734wu8/just_had_an_interview_for_a_frac_operator/,"So I just got back from a ""hiring event"" that halliburton did in San Antonio, Texas where they invited about 80 people who applied to their Frac/Acid OA 1 position to their headquarters. We basically filled out another application and then one by one were called to have a brief interview with one of the hiring representatives in another room. The lady who was in charge of the whole thing made it sound like the first interview was a screening process and if we passed we would go to another interview with someone higher up the chain and could potentially get a job offer if we made it ""all the way up the chain.

I recently graduated from a big state school with a Petroleum Engineering degree and when it was my turn for my first interview this was brought up pretty quickly. I was asked why I was applying for an operator position when I had an engineering degree. I feel like I answered the question pretty well and said something along the lines of ""I'm a hands on type of person and would rather start out in the field and work my way up, then sit in an office behind a desk all day"", and the interviewer seemed to think this was a good response. I don't have any oilfield experience but I did a construction management internship two summers ago that was 80+ hours a week in the Texas heat and I referenced this often during the interview to show that I wouldn't shy away from manual labor.

Anyway, the interview went well, and afterwards I was told HR would be in contact with me and I was walked to the door. I didn't even think about ""making it up the chain"" until I had already left. I know i'm starting to ramble here but basically I was wondering if it's possible that having an engineering degree and applying for an operator position would make you seem overqualified or if they thought you would leave the company as soon as another opportunity presents itself.

Other than him questioning me about the degree, the interview went very well and I can't think of any other reason I wasn't given another interview with someone higher up in recruiting. Not to mention they told us at the beginning they were looking for 45 frac operators so it wasn't like everyone was competing for one or two spots. Is there a chance that they could actually call me back in a couple days or do you think the engineering degree blew my chances of getting an operator job? I'm in a shitty position because I don't have any oil field experience so I'm under qualified for an engineering job but because I have an engineering degree it is starting to seem like I'm considered over qualified for an operator job.

Any suggestions or advice? Anyone been in this type of situation before?"
734zay,3,2017-09-28,No one is proud of me.,RecycleOnceUsed,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/734zay/no_one_is_proud_of_me/,"I grew up in a not so great family. Parents divorced, lots of kids, lost house in 2008. Relatively poor but most the time had food so I guess can't complain.

This sort of instilled in me a desire to not be poor. So I worked really hard to get into a good private school that met 100% of financial need with aid.

I got into a school that pays me about $1k a semester after all is said and done - tuition, board, room, books, everything. Best I got was a ""that's incredible"" (no shit) from my parents.

I know this is an incredible privilege. I should just be happy I have it. But since the initial euphoria of learning I got in, this hasn't really a good experience for me. I don't like the people here. I don't really have any friends. I kind of hate it whenever I'm here. I'm working most the time to keep my grades up and get internships. Or just too depressed to do anything.

I got an internship at a company in my field making really good money. Like really good money. My dad asked me if this would be a stepping stone to work at &lt;insert larger more prestigious company&gt;. Didn't even say he was proud once. 

Again, it's a privilege I should be happy to have, but nothing feels  that great after initially learning you got it. And that is usually only after being rejected by 10 to 100 times as many opportunities rejecting you.


I should be happy I'm here and going places. I got out of my home town. I got out of poverty, or at least it looks like I will. But when no one shows up to my on campus performances, nobody tells me they're proud of any of my accomplishments... I don't know.


The best positive refeinforcement I've gotten from my family was my grandmother, whom I really never talk to, asked me ""how did you do it? All your siblings are doing so poorly""

735ku6,55,2017-09-29,The Ultimate College Guide: How to Get into Any Company You Want,theonewhoknocks517,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/735ku6/the_ultimate_college_guide_how_to_get_into_any/,"This is a guide made specifically for college students on how to get a kick-ass sales job right out of college. On top of that, I legitimately believe that the strategies I've outlined below will get you into any company you want. Wanna work for Google? Stryker? Oracle? Follow these steps, and you'll have more than a good shot at getting your ideal gig.

As a disclaimer, my path has been almost exclusively B2B tech sales focused. While I believe in the advice I'm giving, other industries could work differently in terms of breaking in. However, I'd still be surprised if these ideas don't apply to other sales areas like medical device, pharma, finance, etc.

Alright, enough talk. Let's get to it.  

**Why I Made This Guide**

I love this sub with a passion, and it's actually been a huge resource in my personal and professional development. That being said, I respectfully think there's a lot of misinformation on here on the best ways to pursue a legit sales career in college. Furthermore, there's a lot of posts on here from college students that ask really good questions with a lot of misguided answers. I've been fortunate enough to obtain 4 sales internships during my time here at college, and have just accepted a very generous offer from a fortune 100 technology company. I'm here to pass it forward, and help anyone who is hungry enough to get the success they want out of their professional life. 

**Figure out What You Want**

There are lots of sales roles out there. Inside sales, outside sales and everything in between. Do your research and figure out what you think is best for you. You're in college, so you can only do so much research without actually being in the ""real world,"" but there's plenty of ways to figure this out: ask other sales reps what their day to day is, look at some job descriptions of what you're interested in, learn basic sales terms like ""hunter"" and ""farmer."" 

When you have a good idea of the job you want, I encourage you to dig a little deeper and figure out the life you want. For me, I wanted to have a great paying outside sales job, but not one that normally passed 40 hours a week and exhausted me with constant travel. I also wanted a solid training foundation, making me target big companies with established sales programs. The idea of moving to California was always exciting to me, so I limited my search only to opportunities in the SF bay area. Music is also a huge passion of mine that I pursue as a serious side gig, so I needed a company that respected my time and allowed me to do my own thing as long as I hit my numbers. 

**What You Study**

Without a doubt, this has been the number one thing that has impacted my path in sales. Allow me to explain. In a growing handful of universities, professional selling is [being taught](http://franke.nau.edu/images/uploads/fcb/SEF-ProfSalesProgram_2017-Magazine-NAU-listing.pdf) as an area of study in the form of majors, minors, concentrations and specializations. If you're interested in sales, my first piece of advice is to see if your school falls on this list, and to then find out the criteria for getting involved with such a program. In my case, I was an advertising major who added on a sales leadership minor.

So what's so special about these programs? By being part of the minor, I had a checklist of requirements to complete that constantly put me out of my comfort zone. This includes a sales curriculum of material, constant role-playing (both individual and team), lots of public speaking, [participating in competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AdsNsmnG_g), and much more. On top of all this, I had a sales specific career fair, a sales organization tied to the program and most importantly, access to a fantastic network of successful sales professionals. I credit this program to my best connections and landing almost all of my sales internships. There was a noticeable difference between sales students and non sales students in my internships, and I firmly believe that's because these kids have already been trained in cold calling, presenting and sales methodology. By being surrounded by talented salespeople daily, you'll naturally improve in the areas you're weak in.

However, in the likely event that your school doesn't have a sales program, no worries! The strategies I outline below should be more than enough to get you the opportunities you want, with a sales program just being a big bonus. Almost all salespeople I've met never intended to go into sales, and usually have quite random degrees, ranging from finance to zoology. This proves that you don't need a certain kind of a degree to go into sales. *However,* it only helps you to have a business degree vs. something like anthropology. This is especially true if you want to go into a Fortune 500 company, who have abstract screening processes that favor business degrees over everything else. I'm not justifying this process, this is just how things are. You can be someone who overcomes these barriers, but employers will almost certainly question your major if you get past the screening process. Be ready. 

**Get Experience**

This is HUGE, and it's so painful to me that this sub seems so adamant on [not taking sales internships seriously](https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/34vfzz/how_to_get_a_sales_internship/). 20 years ago these programs may not have existed, but they do now, and they're definitely worth having. Even tech leaders like [Cisco](https://jobs.cisco.com/jobs/ProjectDetail/Field-Sales-Intern-United-States/1216220?source=Cisco+Jobs+Career+Site&amp;tags=CDC+Browse+all+jobs+careers), [Google](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/bold.html) and [IBM](https://krb-sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/Home/Home?partnerid=26059&amp;siteid=5016&amp;cm_mc_uid=71262205387314962648960&amp;cm_mc_sid_50200000=1506657117#jobDetails=118786_5016) have sales roles that groom undergrads to be entry level workers upon graduation. While it's great that many find success without sales internships, the experience makes it 100x easier to break in to more competitive brands. Those who scoff at the idea really have no idea what they're talking about. 

I had four sales internships in college:

- internship one: Part time during school. Very basic excel work where I managed lead sheets for an account executive in another state. However, this was a great intro to learning a sales cycle and remote work.

- internship two: This is where shit got crazy. Big corporate tech company, where as an intern I was actually selling a product myself. Full time reps sold software, while interns sold training for this software. On top of this, I had monthly quotas, weekly sales huddles, and legitimate training like Sandler and SPIN. This internship gave me legit numbers to prove I could hit and exceed quota, call numbers, and other metrics for my resume.

- internship three: Another part time sales internship. This one wasn't nearly as exciting, but I won over almost all of my business via email, a tool I had neglected heavily till then

- internship four: My last and final internship with a fortune 100 tech company. To re-iterate my above points, my past experience showed a proven record of drive and success, and allowed me to stand out among thousands of candidates. This internship not only allowed me to get a preview into the full time position, but it gave me incredible traveling and presentation experiences that only large companies are capable of. This went so positively that I successfully secured a full time position with the location and role that I specifically wanted.  

Having more experience allows you to be very selective on who you work with, but will also show you if something is right for you. One of m internships was completely inside sales. Before I thought I'd never want a role like that, but just one summer changed my whole perspective on the matter, and I'm a lot warmer to the idea now. 

The biggest advantage of having an internship is that you now have an ""in."" By being part of the intern program, you usually get to bypass the ultra-competitive full time process that everyone else has to go through, giving you a much better shot. 

**Keep Your Grades Up**

This is something I really should have taken my own advice on as I enter my last year. I have a shit GPA due to a combination of idiotic choices and personal pitfalls, currently sitting at about a 2.7. I worked hard and had to overcome a lot of objections with those in HR who ask, but it eventually paid off when recruiters made ""exceptions"" for me and gave me a shot to prove myself. While I'm steadily working my way up this semester, I would still no doubt be auto-rejected by many companies due to a 3.0 cutoff (even though I'm more than qualified at this point). While experience outdoes GPA, don't be an idiot like me. Maintain a good GPA, otherwise you're just limiting yourself. Plain and simple. 

**Be a Student Leader**

If there's a business org (or even something completely non business) that you frequent, get involved and join the e-board. Not only does this attract the eyes of many recruiters, but it helps in so many ways that you may not anticipate. Once being a somewhat timid guy who sucked at public speaking, being the Vice President of my Sales org really kicked my ass in to gear and forced me to be sharper, adaptable, organized and a leader others could use as a resource. Furthermore, it's a great way to learn how to manage people without the corporate stress of a real job. 

**Network Hard**

Network. Network. NETWORK. Holy shit, if I had a dollar for every missed opportunity students pass I could retire right now. I've literally been in classrooms where professionals from large companies speak, only to have the room empty out as soon as the class ends. APPROACH AND TALK TO THEM. Form a relationship. Have a meaningful connection. The easiest way by far to hack the interview process is to know someone in the company. All of my opportunities, and I mean *all*, had some form of networking involved, whether it was via referral, LinkedIn, talking to sales professionals from classes or orgs, etc. 

If you have no connections in a desired company and don't know where to start, I suggest the following:

1) Search for sales professionals who's jobs you want

2) Send a connection invite to a handful of these professionals, attaching a note 

3) In this note, express you interest in their role, and how you'd love to have a quick phone conversation about their role. Many won't respond, but many will.

4) Be curious about their role. Ask them real questions you'd actually like to know about their day to day. This is your opportunity to get ""real talk"" and not some PR-crafted bullshit.

5) Ask them how the best way to break into their company would be. They'll almost always say reference. If you feel the conversation went well, ask for a reference. 

Boom! You now have insight into the role you want, and a way to get that first interview. With this method and school opportunities, I've created strong connections at Microsoft, IBM, LinkedIn, Cisco, Salesforce and more. Be creative! Sell yourself, and have a genuine curiosity to learn. 

I hope this guide was helpful. I've learned so much in my college journey and couldn't be happier with how it turned out, so I hope to pass the baton to younger minds with bright futures! With fall recruitment already starting, I hope this can be used as a resource to hit the ground running! "

735q7z,3,2017-09-29,Tore my left ACL now after recovering from right! HELP please,yanks93,ACL,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/735q7z/tore_my_left_acl_now_after_recovering_from_right/,"Hey guys! I wanted to share my story and also get some advice/help. I tore my right ACL and medial meniscus on November 2015. I got the surgery on December 2016 (had to wait a year due to insurance and school issues) My PT apparently sucked but I didn't know the importance of a good PT but he was the only the one that took my insurance. Fast forward 9 months later (3 weeks ago), I tear my left ACL coming off a bench. I wasn't looking and used my good leg to come down and it hyperextended and there it went. ACL tear, medial meniscus tear and a mild sprain of MCL was what the MRI showed. Currently, I am in graduate school and doing my internship. Therefore, if I take a semester off, I would have to take a full year off because of the fall classes not being offered in the spring. I then opted to get some prehab done on my left and continue rehab on my right. However, I am paying $100 a session at the best PT Rehab center around my area. My parents are obviously saying it's fine and we want your knees 100% so don't worry about the money. I am just worried about my knee giving out in the next 8 months ( I plan to get surgery in May after all my shit is done). I also have been feeling depressed because I am limping with a brace on (it's been about 3 1/2 weeks now) and it sucks. My right knee isn't fully strong yet and I feel lost. I feel very lost and I am afraid of re-tearing the right now because of it's now my 'dominant' leg. With all of this being said, has anyone heard of someone tearing both ACLs and recovering very well from it to the point of where they don't have to worry about re-tearing. I am not an athlete but I like to play basketball and baseball a lot. I used to go the gym a lot as well. Therefore, I am active but I'm not some crazy athlete. I guess with all of this, I am just kinda depressed and I want to get back on my feet. Any suggestions/kind words/ harsh words/stories/ etc. are much appreciated. Thank you so much! "
735u1l,9,2017-09-29,[22M] I broke up with my girlfriend [22F] this past weekend and I regret everything. I feel horrible and I still want to be with her.,Aquaflip,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/735u1l/22m_i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_22f_this_past/,"My significant other and I have been together for 3+ years. Although I'm originally from the east coast, I met her during a summer internship on the west coast. We fell in love, and despite our inherent need to finish our academics, we made considerable effort to visit each other all throughout the year. Honestly, everything was going great for the first 2.5 years, but then she graduated this past December. I, however, was still in school and decided that I wanted to tack on about 2 more years of academics. I personally wanted to stay in school longer to finish several degrees, try out new research opportunities and potentially apply for grad school. I don't think my SO liked this idea though. She had the impression we would close the distance shortly after she graduated and I guess I was too focused on my aspirations. Unfortunately she never really communicated how she felt, and thus I had no way of knowing that my ambitions would soon drive us apart.


So anyway, this past Spring she was looking for a job. As stressful as it was, I supported her every step of the way and she finally landed something amazing! I was so happy for her when she received her offer -- I couldn't control myself. The thing is, my girlfriend has always been (and I absolutely love this about her) very clingy and dependent. I don't think she had a lot of confidence, and so I always tried to help her and make her love herself. I think, however, after she graduated and found her new job, she started to change. She started to become more independent and confident. That summer when I decided to intern on the west coast again, she would start to argue about little things and get frustrated easily. We still loved each other, but I felt like something was a little off.


Anyway, after my summer internship, I moved back to the east coast. Long story short: these past five weeks have been the worst days of my life. Essentially, My girlfriend and I started fighting more and more on the phone. One night she told me how jealous she was of me and how she felt I was much better than her. Another night she felt depressed but didn't want me to cheer her up. Another night she would say things like ""I don't need you, but I want you."" I just felt like we started to become more distant from each other, and I started to matter less and less to her. Finally at one point she told me what was bothering her: it was my desire to stay in school for about 2 more years (not including grad school). I wanted to fix things, so we made an ultimatum -- I would only take three more semesters and search for a grad school near where she works. Although I felt pressured to choose between her or my ambitions, I soon realized that I love her so much that I would be willing to compromise -- because that's what relationships are all about. Right?


Well, it soon came to my attention that this wasn't enough for her. Every weekend in the past 5 weeks she has been going to the bars with her friends. She would get drunk each night and smoke weed with her friends. Now I have nothing against these activities, but I felt like she wasn't being honest with me. In regards to weed, in the past she told me that she only tried it a few times, and then 4 weeks ago she told me that she actually smokes once every few months or so. It wasn't until very recently, however, that she told me that she smokes weed every weekend. We actually saw each other two weekends ago (due to an onsite interview). We both got high together on an edible. I was high for nearly 6-8 hours, yet she hardly felt anything. My tolerance is very low, since I don't smoke, but I felt like she was lying to me with her weed habits. I felt like I couldn't trust her.


In regards to her drinking habits, I didn't really think much of her going to the bars... that is until I found out on snapchat that there was this other ""guy"" hanging out with her friend group. I asked my SO how many people she was hanging out with (just to test the waters). At first she completely neglected the fact that this guys was even there. But when I proceeded to ask her about this other guy, she apologized and told me that this guy confessed his ""love"" to her that night while he was drunk. Initially, my girlfriend told me not to worry about it though. He has a girlfriend anyway, so what's the big deal? Well, as the weeks progressed I soon found out my girlfriend thought this guy was in fact attractive as well. She then confessed that she wanted to flirt with him and even have sex with him (with his gf's permission of course...). This made me feel devastated and jealous beyond belief. She started fantasizing group sex, and sex with women (I had no idea she was curious of women -- which is completely fine... but it still shocked me). I wanted to support her with these fantasies of hers, but things between us started to feel more divided.


She told me at one point she wanted a break, but didn't want to break up with me ""yet."" She then decided that the break was unnecessary and changed her mind. Nevertheless, she talked about her desire to meet other people. This was starting to really tear me up inside. We agreed on an ultimatum, but now she doesn't want to wait for me anymore? I really thought we had something special. WE WERE TOGETHER FOR THREE YEARS. Did that mean anything to her? 


So last weekend was the worst. She confessed that the only way our relationship would work is if it were an open relationship. I hesitated. I didn't want to see anyone else. I loved this woman. I didn't want any hookups and casual dates. Eventually, I felt pressured to say yes. I wanted her to be happy, and if she needed something ""physical"" then I could understand. She created a tinder this past weekend, and even wanted me to do the same. I told her I didn't feel comfortable and wasn't ready to see other people, but I gave her permission to use the app. She got upset though since she wanted to share our tinder experiences together. I eventually caved in and created one -- even though I didn't want to. I was scared as well. I didn't want her to grow attached to anyone on this app. We could easily drift away. Well anyway, the whole situation was eating me up inside, and I couldn't take it anymore. So I broke up with her this past Sunday.


Monday was horrible. I felt like a knife was lunged into my chest. She deleted me from all social media. I begged her that we could still be friends and eventually we DID add each other back. I then began to question all of my ambitions. I went to my university advisor and requested to graduate this semester (instead of in two years). In this case I would only be graduating with 1 degree. None of my other degrees, however, mattered to me anymore. Future research opportunities didn't matter to me anymore. I just wanted to see my Girlfiend and move to the west coast with her. On Tuesday, I then couldn't take the thought of not being in a relationship with her anymore. As soon as I got back home from school, I called her and told her i was sorry and wanted to be with her... even if it were an open relationship. 


But unfortunately it felt like she was already moving on. She already told everyone we broke up, and she felt that if we were together it wouldn't be any different from a friendship in her eyes. She even told me she wouldn't tell her friends or family we got back together. I accepted nevertheless, but yesterday I still felt like she was not treating me like how she used to. I felt no affection, and thus I decided that perhaps it was time for me to move on. I'm devastated and I really want us to get back together.


It's like my plan to graduate this semester doesn't matter to her. And what's worse, because we are still friends, every time we chat now it hurts so much. So then I tell her I accept her decision, and that I'm ready to move on. Unfortunately she immediately gets sad and tells me she wants to die. I get concerned and call her, and despite my efforts to cheer her up, she still can't make up her mind as to whether or not she wants to get back together with me. I told her that i resent how she can't just wait for me for one more semester, and how she is so indecisive. I still love her, but I feel so heartbroken.


**TL;DR** I broke up with my gf, and now she doesn't know if she wants to get back together with me. I'm torn and don't want to move on.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
737sa5,70,2017-09-29,A word of caution to anyone considering the Cross-Continental MPH program at NYU.,nyuccmph2017,publichealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/737sa5/a_word_of_caution_to_anyone_considering_the/,"I am in this program now, currently in Accra, Ghana. I gave up other more established programs to be here because I wanted the experience of living abroad for a year. However I believe I was severely misled about the program and want to warn anyone who is starting to think about their applications for 2018. Had I been fully informed, I would not have enrolled.

I'll try to put personal feelings aside and make this as factual as possible, which admittedly is difficult.

General info:

* This is only the second year this program has existed, and that means there are a lot of administrative and organizational failings that you will not encounter at another school. You will not find this fact in print anywhere; they do not advertise it.
* **The summer semester consisted of 6 courses. 4 of them were online. We paid over $40K for that.**
* If you request a tuition breakdown, you will not be provided with one. Tuition, housing, food, etc is all ""bundled,"" so they are able to mask what they pay for individual items. Yes it's a new program and we understand they need to make money to improve it, but from what we are able to discern the difference between what we are charged and what NYU is actually paying is exorbitant. **For example, tuition at the University of Ghana (where we are enrolled this semester) is $1,750 USD per semester. We are paying about $35K.**
* This bundling of fees also means that if you would like to find your own housing to save money (as many grad students are wont to do), you will be unable to do so, as NYU will apply any scholarship or financial aid you receive to their ""tuition"" package and you will not receive a refund for any fees for NYU housing that you are not using.

Caliber of the education:

* Students were accepted to the program well beyond the official admission deadline. I was told by NYU staff that this is because they had fewer students accept than they expected. This resulted in students being in the program that fall far short of the academic caliber one might expect of other NYU graduate programs.
* The summer semester this year was in DC instead of NYC, yet there appeared no real reason for this. The program did not plan any DC-related activities. No public health policy seminars, no poli-sci class, no capitol visits or government internships. We had a few speakers come to give some seminars on campus, but they could have done that in NYC. And had the semester been in NYC instead, classes would have been in person rather than online.
* We are taking classes at the University of Ghana this semester. I'm reluctant to make comparisons to universities in the western world...but I can tell you that these classes will not prepare you to work as a public health professional in the US. The topics we have covered thus far are remedial. It is not a graduate level education. It would be infinitely better if the subjects were taught at NYU Accra, but they are either unwilling or unable to provide the faculty and funding to do so. Yet NYU touted this semester as a ""world class"" and ""world renowned"" education.
* The fall semester also includes 180 hours of field work in the form of a practicum, or internship. Do not be fooled -- these are not internships as you understand them to be. NYU and UG are laughably unorganized in their orchestration of these practicums. We have been here for 7 weeks and there are students who still have not started, students whose internships cancelled on them, students who were not allowed to use the restroom or eat while at work, students who sit for 5-8 hours a day doing nothing because their internship sites do not have work for them to do. The organizations are ill prepared for and/or unable to accommodate interns, but NYU will attempt to sell you on what an ""incredible opportunity"" they are, and the ""insight"" you will gain at work.

This more or less highlights my major concerns with the program thus far. There are more personal issues that I've encountered, such as drinking and drug use among the cohort, religious and sexist rhetoric being spewed at us by UG professors and students alike, not having wifi for a month at our housing location, wifi not working on campus, waiting several hours for software training to begin while they attempt to get us wifi and then ultimately fail to do so...so much of our work requires the internet.

To summarize, I feel that I was led to believe I'd be *learning*, *thinking,* *doing*, and have not been. There are students here who gave up Yale, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, etc to be here and have not received an education that is on par with those universities, though NYU administrators still claim it to be. 

**Tl;dr: If you'd like to get a Master's degree abroad while partying constantly and not working, choose NYU CCMPH. If you actually want to be a trained professional, look to other programs instead.**"

I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my floating around sipping your drinks](http://www.clearwatercolumbus.com/two-women-pool-float.jpg). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later. The sun is still out but it is time I head back in to the house. I grab my towel and head for the back door...
______________________________________
I will let you decide what happens from there. Do I walk in on you and my mom going at it? Do you go back home and invite me over? Do you spend the night and find a way to sneak to my room/somewhere else in the house? Do we include my mom as well? (if you cannot tell, a kink of mine is definitely incest). We could both play the role of her and direct her based on whose turn it is. You can determine your age in the RP, add more back story to your character, and make any other changes you like.
___________________________________________
I'm pretty open sexually. Some of my other kinks include being dominant, anal, light bondage, deep throat, threesomes, public sex, and age play (18+ only). But I'm open to any and all suggestions. I am looking for long term RP for this. "

738ljy,0,2017-09-29,"My Journey Towards FIRE as Someone Who Makes Less Than $100,000 per Year",SwimmerFan,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/738ljy/my_journey_towards_fire_as_someone_who_makes_less/,"Saw someone ask to have a post with someone making less than $100k.

My story is interesting and unique, but not unlike others in the pursuit to FIRE and happiness.

I graduated from undergrad college in 2012 from a 5 year mechanical engineering degree. Have no school loans as I was a student-athlete. Some may scoff at that, but it's like a full time job. I ""worked"" 30 hours per week and was up at 4:45am every day. Engineering also forced paid internships, so 2 quarters (school was still on quarters at this time) per year for 3 of the 5 years, I worked for anywhere from 10 to 20 dollars an hour for a 40 hour week. So I made some money which was nice. I also didn't spend it frivolously and only drank Saturdays while doing homework late most every other night. 

Got a job at $59,000 right out of college with take-home of about 36k after taxes, insurance, and 401(k). Business was good. Moved up to manager of a product line after 2.5 years to making $65,000, but it was a struggle to get them to go there. Company paid for MBA with stipulation I stay for 5 years afterward. I was renting at this time for NO more than $550 and had a car payment of $400. Saved about 30% on average. 

Left that company after 3 years to one where I was making $85,000. Bought a condo for $80k with 20% down. 

Still at this company making $85k. Take home is $4400 per month. Putting minimum for matching in simple IRA. Have $60k in 401k from last work and 5k from current work. Will merge when it makes sense, probably soon before next market dip so I can buy low. Obviously that's hard to predict but I'm making a lot off the 401k. 

I also work part time as an associate professor making about 6,500 per Year. It's pretty easy work and low hours. Plus I get to teach robotics which is cool. 

Finally, I airbnb extra rooms in the girlfriends house and my condo making about 1000 per room per month at 4 rooms giving us about an extra $50k per year. This is a work in progress as only 1 room is up and running now and we spend or will spend most of the first few months income to update certain things like adding a 2nd bath in the GF house and I'm gutting parts of the condo. 

So here's the fun part, the savings. I try to save 2000 per month. In 8 years the girlfriend will have her loans forgiven, thanks Obama, and we will be sent free from the houses and loans. We plan on putting half of all AirBnB money into the house loans. And the 2k mentioned above goes into our sailboat fund. We are planning in 8 years to FIRE, with 350k and trek around in a van around the Americas giving us 3 more years of compounding income on that 350. If it goes well we will get to about 450k and have incomes from the 2 houses renting, and pulling a small amount out of the 450k to live on. We also plan to have a travel website which I won't plug here cause you all will spam it and give me the Reddit hug of death.  Total income per month of $3k. After 3 years and savings at 450k, we will purchase a sailboat and sail all over the world while maintaining the blog which hopefully will cover all our expenses. If needed, we could sell our 2 houses for 100k each if not more with the updates we added. 

So that's how making under 100k can get you to FIRE. Look at long term and manage expenses. It's super easy but you need a plan and you need will power. "

After one year here, i'm sad and not happy. I'm not learning anything new because there is no creative lead in my department (ECD don't give a shit about social media, and this is 99% of my job), no senior, and my partner just quit because he don't want to make ads anymore.

i'm tired of politic ( i have to fight for the tiny piece of brief), i'm buried under work so i have no more energy left to work on spec. With 1 year working on 100% social stuff without CD or senior supervision my ideas are sooo fucking lame since 2 months. And so underpaid that is barely legal.

I love the intellectual stimulation of this job, but i can't stand his people ( gosh so much ego).
I don't know if my social personnality fit this industry.
I know i need to find a place where i can grow my creative skill under some senior or CD, but who hire a 31y old junior with 2years experience ?

Should i leave ?

TLDR : 31y old junior solo copywriter stucked with no creative lead, exhausted, wondering about leaving this industry."

I hope you are nice and horny!

I have a new roleplay i'd love to play out with you all where I get fucked by a male pornstar. there is just something about those hunks I just love, I would pay good money to just see Kieran Lee's dick in the flesh.

This can go a number of ways, the most obvious is I come for a couch casting and get the dick of every girls dream. I can bump into you at a bar and be a huge fan. I could be an intern at the porn company. There are so many way we can do it just let me at your big famous cock!

I have a few kinks; cheating, big cocks, long passionate blowjobs, rimjobs, anal, Cuckold, ego boosting, cock worship

I have a huge girl crush on Dani Mathers, Sam Blacky, Tammy Hebrow, basically any hot blonde so would love to play as them!

Anyone who sends a hot gif or pic of who they want me to play as or to include in the scene wins bonus points

Look forward to playing, obviously all stuff will be 18+ on the ages x"

73bwvj,9,2017-09-29,223**** signing off,bundlesofbeans,starbucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/73bwvj/223_signing_off/,"Although I planned to stick it out until next week, my last day was unfortunately today. (This will be long, I’m sorry)

To give some background, I am a senior year college student, required to do 200 internship hours this semester on top of my classes. I am heavily involved in student life, and the only days I do not have any availability are the two days I am in class/internship, which are Tuesday and Thursday. I am almost always scheduled on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and even with all these days, I was barely breaking 20 hours a week. I was a transfer partner from an area with a higher cost of living, so on top of the hours cut (because I was used to working 30-35 hours a week) my pay went down. the last time I had a one on one with my manager, I explained my concerns, and asked for a single day off on weekends here and there to have time to do homework/see my boyfriend since he lives an hour away and works 9-5 during the week, or less days and longer shifts, either would’ve been fine. They said that it was hard to do with my availability. I understood that we were short staffed and a lot of partners had limited weekend availability but it still was frustrating because I really felt like my SM heard me but didn’t listen to a word I said. 

As previously stated, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and anxious, and I wanted to focus more on school and internship, among other things, so I put in my two weeks, with that reasoning. After I put in my two weeks I felt passive aggressive vibes from my SM and it was really uncomfortable. I still stuck it out, but things came to a head this week. A lot of outside things have been affecting me and my anxiety spiked to the point of almost constant panic. I’ve cried more this week than I have in months and today I called the standing SM because my SM was on vacation. I explained my feelings in a short voicemail and basically told them I couldn’t do it anymore. They called me back, and I spoke to this store manager in full out panic mode. I was crying, I couldn’t catch my breath, but I tried to explain myself the best I could. They kept asking me if I was sure of my decision, and reminded me of the implications of quitting suddenly. I understood what I was doing and I felt like shit about it. I have become close with the partners and customers at that store, and there were still shifts I had to work. I hated fucking people over, but I needed to take care of my mental Health because I would be of no help to anyone constantly crying and shaking. I ended the call with a sincere apology, and they said “I wish I could believe you”, and that destroyed me because I laid my vulnerabilities and pain out to someone I’ve worked with a total of 2 times and they didn’t believe I was sincere. I know it was the wrong course of action, but in my current state of mind, I knew I couldn’t do it.

I learned a lot in my almost year and a half with Starbucks, and I’ll miss my fellow partners and the regulars I made connections with, but right now I need to take some time for myself. "
73c3m8,1,2017-09-29,luke ford interviews interview mason,tranypanda7,tranypanda,https://www.reddit.com/r/tranypanda/comments/73c3m8/luke_ford_interviews_interview_mason/,"Mason As You've Never Seen Her by Duke Floored (send email to Duke Floored) AdultBeat.com This interview is courtesy of www.setgo.com (where it first appeared) and www.fetishbucks.com: I've never met porn director Mason. I've seen her at a couple of industry events dressed in a burka. At the AVN Expo, she had Julie Night in tow, wearing a dog collar. I guess Mason's reclusive. Mason makes nasty porn films where the women get spat on and choked. Not my cup of tea. I've called her about a dozen times this year trying to secure an interview. I've talked to all the other directors at Platinum X Pictures. A few months ago, Mason had a bad car accident and she's still hurting from it and can no longer engage in rough sex. She can't jog or jump on trampolines either. I'd love to see her do either as she has DD breasts, and stands 5'4"" [and here Mason forces me to end the sentence]. She calls me back Wednesday morning, October 22, and we speak for two hours. At first, she sounds groggy, like I woke her up. Mason: ""I've had insomnia since Graham left."" DUC: ""Who's Graham?"" Mason: ""My roommate. You haven't read my site?"" I surf over to the diary portion of www.insidemason.com: OK, Graham is officially a retard. I love you, Graham, but, you fucked up all of the orders. You are going to have to service me big time when/if you ever get your ass back to the states!!! If you have not received your order, please email me and let me know! And I will straighten this out!!! Just tell me your name and what you ordered and it will be sent out ASAP! Got an email from my roommate Graham yesterday--had not heard from him in a while. In short, it was great to receive this email. I miss you too, my dear friend. I miss you, too. Dear Mason, Hate to say it, life just isn't the same here in Blighty without ur perpetual grifting for lifts to the liquor store. It is so good to not be bombarded with images of women being demeaned and degraded around every turn, and yet, I find myself quite uncomfortably missing you. Your outrageous screaming and shouting, finickines, jerking off in front of the TV while I eat at the dinner table, ur aggressive, violating sexual advances...and of course those incredible blue eyes. I miss u my beautiful friend. Graham ................................ Been cutting back on the booze, decided I had to break the mold and branch out to a kinder, gentler, substance . . . Root Beer. My roommate, Graham, is going home. Sucks. I hope he won't read this, but maybe I hope he will. Uh, Graham, uh, well, uh, ah, forget it. Have this fucking movie to edit by next week. In a way it's different than anything I've ever done before, but, in a way, I think it's something that's been closer than I ever wanted to admit. I'm getting pretty sick of all of this gossip shit. This industry is unfortunately full of a bunch of lying, take no prisoners, sell your soul for whatever it takes kinda fucks. I guess I was naive to think it would be different than any other industry. It's ironic that the most ethical people I've met in porn are those who are so often portrayed as ""sluts"" and ""whores,"" morally bankrupt, doing anything for money. 8/16/03 Hey, everybody. My name is Graham, and I am Mason's roommate. Mason was involved today in a horrific car crash. She was badly shaken, but thankfully after numerous tests including X-Rays and an MRI, she was given the all clear. She has asked me to tell you that it will be a few days before she updates the diary. If you want to send her get well wishes, I know she will appreciate it. Thanks. Pssst, she told me a great story about being strapped down in the ambulance, surrounded by Paramedics, with her amble chest on display for all to see (don't tell her I told you!). ................................... Mason: ""It's just driving me crazy. I haven't written about it at all."" DUC: ""Is he your boyfriend?"" Mason: ""It's weird. He emailed me about six months ago during the whole Elegant Angel thing. I don't know if we're going to become boyfriend-girlfriend. It's just weird. I just miss him terribly and it's been hell trying to get him back in the country. He's just a beautiful boy and I love him. He's something very special. He's the only person who's understood my whole sexual philosophy. I don't know if he's ever coming back. I don't know what's going on. I don't like things not being resolved. It's driving me crazy."" DUC: ""Is William H. your biological brother?"" Mason yells: ""I hate being so honest with you. I don't want to be so honest with you."" DUC: ""Don't tell me then. Does he work in the industry?"" Mason: ""Yes, at Elegant Angel. He's a director and staff photographer."" DUC: ""Does he like to dress up in women's clothing?"" Mason: ""Not just women's clothing, everything. He's crazy. I'm drawn to those types."" DUC: ""I'm sensing that."" Mason: ""I've tried to have girls come over and do stuff to Graham but he won't do it."" DUC: ""That doesn't sound straight."" Mason: ""No. He just really likes me. He's been gone eight weeks."" DUC: ""Will you have to marry him for him to be able to stay here?"" Mason: ""We don't know yet."" DUC: ""Would you like to marry him?"" Mason: ""Yeah."" DUC: ""Would you like to have his children?"" Mason: ""I've never wanted to have kids."" DUC: ""When you met Graham, did you want to have his babies? Did you want your belly to swell with his seed?"" Mason giggles: ""You sound an awful lot like him. It's a British thing, isn't it? Full stop, right? Sort it out. All this stuff I've picked up comes out of me at strange moments."" DUC: ""So Graham was a fan."" Mason: ""He'd never seen any of them. He'd read a review on rogreviews.com. He wrote me and said I was the most beautiful brilliant thing he'd not seen. He sketched that picture of me on the website. That Elegant Angel thing was a difficult part of my life. We emailed back and forth for a month or so until he finally came out. We've been really close since. This is like therapy."" DUC: ""I've had years of therapy, so I know how to administer it. So how does it make you feel to have him gone?"" Mason: ""It's just sad and a bit desperate. I've never had someone care for me so unconditionally and have someone be so honest and real. He's too brilliant. We share the same weird sexual stuff. I've always thought of porn as my therapy to work through all my stuff. Even embracing my sexuality was something I couldn't do until a couple of years ago. ""I'm trying to reclaim the words ""slut"" and ""whore."" I no longer think of them as something bad."" Mason says she has a good relationship with her parents. They divorced when she was seven and her dad moved down the block. She had a happy childhood. ""I was privileged and I never had to want for anything. My mom was beautiful. I went to good schools, one of the best private schools in the country. Like Harvard Westlake. I had to wear a uniform."" DUC: ""What type of uniform?"" Mason: ""Are you going to investigate?"" DUC: ""No."" Mason: ""Yes you will. That's your nature."" Mason majored in politics at a small liberal arts college. ""I went in conservative and they brainwashed me and turned me into a communist. ""Can I ask you something? How come you are kind to some people and not kind to others?"" DUC laughs. Mason: ""Am I overstepping my interviewee bounds?"" DUC: ""You can ask me anything. I call it like I see it. People get the coverage they deserve. You don't see Meryl Streep in The National Enquirer because she lives a respectable life. Demi Moore is in the Enquirer all the time because she does bizarre things. If people get high, flake on shoots, get into accidents, transmit STDs, bouncing checks, then they will show up in my column."" Mason: ""I've been reading you since 1999. I read your thing every day. Then, about a year ago, I found an audio interview you on Stunningcurves.com. I freaked out. You sounded so much more human. The whole tone changed. You were a reporter and then you got so negative. [On the audio] you seemed so human and alive."" DUC: ""People often like me in person but hate what I write. My writing tone is cold but I am not like that in person."" Mason: ""Hearing your accent reminds me of talking to Graham."" Mason started out in porn in 2000 as an intern, holding the camera and working for $50 a day. Then it went to $100 a day. Then $200. Then she had a strange awakening. She realized she could no longer turn out crap. ""Please don't reveal dates. I like to be as anonymous as possible. Soon enough people will figure it all out."" DUC: ""Why do you want to stay anonymous?"" Mason: ""I thought it was interesting that all women were just out there and having sex. I thought it would be interesting to juxtapose that with this enigmatic female presence."" DUC: ""So it's just schtick?"" Mason: ""Sure, if you want to call it that, but there's more to it. I think it's fun and interesting. I think it's cool that I am just a voice you hear. You can see my hands once in a while."" DUC: ""How did you come up with the burka?"" Mason: ""It was Rodney Moore's idea."" DUC: ""Do your parents know about your career?"" Mason: ""Oh yeah. I shot a scene in my dad's airplane hanger. It's an intense scene that people talk about. My dad and many of his friends were there to watch."" DUC: ""Was it weird directing a sex scene with your dad there?"" Mason: ""No. Yeah. It was funny. It was cool. My mom came down when I shot my second movie and she watched the entire thing with me in the editing bay. She said the women were clearly enjoying themselves, having many orgasms and that I shouldn't worry about it. ""I was on my way to law school. I'd taken my LSATs. I've always lived on the margins. I was trying to prove to myself that I needed a straight job to fit in with society. I just realized it wasn't for me. I put myself through school. I used to book escorts. I did market research. I sold newspapers via telemarketing."" DUC: ""I bet you made more with the escorting."" Mason: ""With answering the phones, silly. Get that correct. I wish I had been as sexually secure as I am now, because I wouldn't have had a problem with it [escorting]. Of course I thought about it but I wouldn't have felt good. I don't like to do anything that makes me feel bad about myself. I don't want to have guilt or regrets. ""I worked booking escorts in my last year in college. That's when I was totally into you. I'd bring my AVNs in. I thought porn was what I was going to do. In between phone calls, I'd plot my whole career. It all started in my little cubicle."" DUC: ""I would've thought my strong moral influence would've sent you fleeing from the industry."" Mason: ""What drew me to the industry is that I wanted to save these women. I wanted to help them. I wanted to say, 'It's ok. You're going to have a great shoot because you are on my set and I'm going to take care of you.' Then, once I got into it, I realized it was not like that. The girls I found were in control of things. The girls I work with now, in the hardcore sets I do, the chicks are really together. I don't get when people say that porn girls are abused, on drugs... I don't know anyone I've ever shot with is on drugs."" DUC: ""Agree or disagree: Most porn stars escort."" Mason: ""No one that I know. Just when one person I know. Let me look on my tapes. Oh no, I've seen her before. Yeah. They do. Let's see. Yeah, I'd say ten, twenty percent of the girls I've shot. Whoa, now I'm looking at more. I guess they do. I never thought about it. Yeah, they do."" DUC: ""Do you think escorting is an honorable profession?"" Mason: ""I don't know why sex as a commodity is wrong."" DUC: ""One of the top guys in the Internet porn industry threw a fit yesterday because I'd reported his sister worked as an escort. He was ashamed, furious, embarrassed... Once you work as an escort, you are forever tarred. I go to these journalist gatherings, and there's a woman there who worked as a prostitute. And she's marked for life despite her success."" Mason: ""I don't think escorting is intrinsically wrong. I think the side effects of doing it can be damaging. ""I've met so many beautiful people in this industry who made me feel so good about myself. There's a perception that there is no humanity in this industry. You can find it and it is beautiful. It's changed my life. It's hard for me to talk negatively about the industry, except, maybe, some of the people who run it and the bullshit that goes on. My immediate circle is filled with beautiful people."" DUC: ""What do you love about the industry?"" Mason: ""I love the freedom it affords me. I love that I don't have to work 9-5. I love the talent I've worked with. I only like to shoot people who truly enjoy sex. I do a thorough screening process before I shoot anybody. I'll talk with them. Sometimes I'll meet with them."" DUC: ""Will you have sex with them?"" Mason: ""Never. I can't. I revere these chicks. I couldn't do that. That would overstep my boundaries."" DUC: ""Have you ever had sex with a porn star?"" Mason: ""Nope."" DUC: ""Do you have a committed relationship with Graham?"" Mason: ""Nope. Not yet. I hope. There is one person I've wanted to have sex with. I've had the opportunity and did not do it. He came over and signed my boxcover today and said, 'Mason, the only girl who ever said no.' This guy is the spitting image of what I like in men. ""I like aggressive men. I love to be spat on. I love to be slapped. Out of all the things, that is the thing I love the most. I guess it's the endorphins. When it is consensual, it can be an extreme expression of passion."" DUC: ""Is there anything else you like in a man, aside from being spat on?"" Mason: ""Honesty."" DUC: ""Such a lonely word."" Mason: ""Why?"" DUC: ""It's a song by Billy Joel."" Mason: ""Intelligence. Integrity."" DUC: ""How many men have you been with in your life?"" Mason, who's about 28: ""Fifteen?"" DUC: ""How old were you the first time?"" Mason: ""Fourteen. It was with someone I fell in love with. I planned it that way. I knew I was too young. It just didn't feel right. But he was moving to England to go to boarding school. I wasn't going to see him for at least a year. It was beautiful. I've never had a one-night stand."" DUC: ""How many black guys have you slept with?"" Mason: ""Two. Lots of Hispanics. That was my thing for a while."" DUC: ""How many Jews?"" Mason: ""One."" DUC: ""Are most guys happy to slap you and spit on you?"" Mason: ""No. They don't get it. Only three guys who have gotten it."" DUC: ""Does that leave you unsatisfied?"" Mason: ""Of course. Always."" DUC: ""Yearning for more."" Mason: ""Of course."" DUC: ""Desiring."" Mason: ""Of course."" DUC: ""In bed, do you boss the guy around?"" Mason: ""No. I don't like to be dominant. I don't like to be in a relationship with someone unless he can surrender himself to me and I can surrender myself to him."" DUC: ""Have you ever had sex with a girl?"" Mason: ""Yeah, with two. The first one I was young. The second one was just to try it and I found it creepy. We were laying there and she was saying, I love you so much. Oh no. I felt like a dude and she was a girl. I said, I'm really sick. I have to go. ""I like to watch my boyfriend with girls."" DUC: ""Oh man."" Mason: ""If I hadn't lost your respect before, I have now... I've only done that two or three times."" DUC: ""What did you feel?"" Mason: ""I felt tensed up, jealous and exhilarated. It's weird. I go through these spells where I either want to be in a totally committed relationship like Romeo and Juliet or I want to be a total whore. I think I'm more comfortable in the Romeo and Juliet thing. As much as I want to be a whore and be decadent, I don't think that's the best thing for me."" DUC: ""Have you ever been pregnant?"" Mason: ""Nope."" DUC: ""So when you take your burka off, what do you look like?"" Mason: ""Normal. I'm like the Martha Stewart of porn. I drink every once in a while. Every two or three months, I will get drunk. I can drink 12-15 pints."" DUC: ""You're a lush. How do you feel about being spanked?"" Mason: ""It's boring. It feels retarded. It's not a turn on. To be slapped? Hell yeah. That's beautiful."" DUC: ""What are the chances of you doing a sex scene?"" Mason: ""Never. I've never wanted to, except when I was in college and desperate for money and when I was working for $50 and being bossed around and told to get bananas and this and that. I'd look at the girls and think, 'That is so much less demeaning and so much more respecting oneself.' I wanted to do it but I knew I couldn't handle it."" DUC: ""Were you ever sexually harassed in the porn industry?"" Mason: ""No. Never. I've been treated like an equal. Why I paused in answering your question: I had a problem with a talent one time. He wanted to see my tits. It was when I was a grunt, when I was making a $100 for a 14-hour shoot. It hurt me a lot. I was on my twelfth or thirteenth hour or running around, and this guy turned to another guy and said, 'Wow, I wish she'd show us her tits.' It was so humiliating. I felt the lowest I've ever felt in this industry. ""Rodney Moore taught me how to shoot, edit and take stills. He never once made me feel uncomfortable. The first time I went to Rodney's apartment, I had my boyfriend wait downstairs for me so I could call him in case I got attacked. I had this fear that the big scary porno producer was going to attack me. He asked me if I ever wanted to get in front of the camera? I said no, never. Then he transitioned to talk about camera work. I worked for him for about two years. ""I then learned with Andre Madness. He taught me everything. He was technical, meticulous, business-minded. ""Then I met Patrick Collins at Elegant Angel. I had an epiphany in his office. I'd been doing camerawork in the Dr. Fellatio series. Someone had written in to him, 'Who is this voice behind the camera? You have to meet with her.' He's an intimidating guy. He's the Italian, stocky, cigar-smoking take-no-sh-- kinda guy with tattoos all over. I'm sitting in his giant office. ""He says, 'I want you to do camerawork but I want you to get in there and suck those cocks and show all the girls how to suck to cock.' I sank in my chair. I'd given up law school. It was all crap. I wasn't going to get anywhere. I said, 'Sir, if I am going to do your movies justice, I cannot do that because that is not what I want to do.' He goes, OK, what do you want to do?' I said, 'I want to direct and shoot what I think is hot.' OK, how many lines do you think you can handle?' 'I think I can put out two a month.' OK, you're doing two lines a month.'"" Mason has five movies in her oeuvre. DUC: ""Have you ever videotaped yourself having sex in your private life?"" Mason reprimands me: ""You're bored with my stories. We're back into my sex life. I get tears in my eyes when I tell that story."" DUC: ""Please. Believe me. I have tears in my eyes too."" Mason: ""The outside world looks at him as a vile piece of sh-- who's going to take advantage of young women and he was like, 'Do what you want to do.' He was always like that. He's such a beautiful man. It's horrible how it ended."" DUC: ""Why did it end?"" Mason: ""It was a change in management. You're going to do what you want to do but I don't want to rehash that in public. ""Leaving Elegant Angel was one of the lowest points in my life. I'm crying about it because it was so tough. I had felt like I had gotten my life together and I was doing what I wanted to do and it was so hard leaving. It was such a family and Pat was so good to me. ""Yeah, I videotaped myself a couple of times. The first time was novel and fun. The second time was aggressive and great and cute. ""I thought I was over that. Nine months later, I'm not over it. It was heartbreaking leaving. ""Patrick Collins hooked me up with a Mercedes. It was the first time that what I was producing was rewarded. I always give 100% and I've always been taken advantage of. 'Oh, it's somebody we can exploit. A hard worker, let's exploit her.'"" DUC: ""Do you have a sign on your forehead that says, 'Exploit me!'"" Mason: ""I don't think so. I've never really been exploited in this business."" DUC: ""You just told me 15 seconds ago that everybody exploited you until you went to Patrick Collins."" Mason: ""Not exploiting me. Just not giving me my fair share. I get to the point where I just leave."" DUC: ""How's it going with Platinum X?"" Mason: ""I haven't solidified my presence there yet because I'm just hesitant because of how heartbroken I was before. I'm happy to be there because they let me be true to my vision. They've put up with a lot from me in the past few months because of my accident. I'm indebted to them."" DUC: ""How come your first movie (Mason's Sexual Disorder) only came out last week?"" Mason: ""I usually take two or three months to do a project. I've only directed five videos."" DUC: ""I thought you were doing two lines a month for Elegant Angel?"" Mason: ""That's what they gave and then I realized I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to churn stuff out. I was tired of watching them to do blowjobs on couches in the warehouse. I had to do a spin on it."" I take a leak break and return to the phone. DUC: ""Sorry. I drank too much water this morning."" Mason: ""I've never been peed on."" DUC: ""Good. Don't let them do that to you."" Mason: ""The way you phrase things. What if it is a reciprocal exchange?"" DUC: ""I don't want to see your sweet beautiful flower get soiled by them."" Mason: ""I'm a curvy girl. I have giant boobs. D cup."" DUC: ""How do you feel about your breasts?"" Mason: ""I've always hated them because they got in the way of being athletic. I was so conscious growing up. I used to always wear big clothes. Guys never stare at them. I don't wear low-cut stuff. Maybe they just sense my innocence and leave me alone."" DUC: ""Are they a source of pleasure for you?"" Mason: ""Yeah."" Mason says she can't have rough sex since her car accident. ""They can't pull my hair and smack me in the mouth. One of my ribs that connects to my spine...and I might need surgery on my left shoulder. I can't run anymore."" Mason likes to talk during sex. ""I like them to tell me elaborate stories and fantasies. And talking back and forth, yeah. Sex is like a dance. Back and forth."" DUC: ""What's the most number of orgasms you've had in one day?"" Mason: ""Seven or eight."" DUC: ""What's the last book you read?"" Mason: ""I read a lot of financial books. I don't read much fiction. My favorite book ever is The Awakening by Kate Chopin. [Nineteenth Century Victorian heroine kills herself.]"" DUC: ""Are you primarily visual, auditory or kinesthetic? [A Tony Robbins breakdown of human motivation.]"" Mason: ""Hearing [auditory].

73dfgc,2,2017-09-30,What to do about crush I volunteer with?,sendhelpspls,Crushes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/73dfgc/what_to_do_about_crush_i_volunteer_with/,"Let me start by saying thank you to whoever made the pinned thread on this sub. I've asked so many people but the thread has been the most helpful so far.

Anyway, I guess I'm in a similar boat to about every 3rd post here. I first met said crush on the launch of an org I chose to volunteer with. I've had a few relatively stronger crushes before but the weird thing is for this one, I didn't instantly get smitten by him the first time I saw him. Like, that moment I had already confirmed I wouldn't be having any crushes on him, which makes this experience totally unexpected.

Fast forward to about a month ago, and suddenly one day I realized my feelings for him had surged to dramatic levels without noticing it immediately. Now, normally if he were straight it would be much easier for the feelings to dissipate and I wouldn't have too much trouble, but then I just happened to find out several months ago this wasn't the case and so now I'm dying.

Every single fave on my posts, every single comment and tweet saying he's proud of me, and that one time he took a photo of me to mention to our committee's group chat he was with me don't help with this one bit. I pride myself having a combination of both objectivity and introspection along with experience to back it up, but honestly, fighting the feelings to prevent myself from completely falling for him is passively draining. 

I remember we were at a youth event once and he was one of the speakers in front. After he was done, we went all the way to the middle row where I was seated in the auditorium to ask if anyone was seated beside me (context: there was at one other executive commitee member of our org present that  he should be working with more often). I sadly replied yes, pointing to the bag on the adjacent seat. The guy literally transferred the bag 2 seats away and just plopped down beaide me. I also remember we were at our org's band event and I came mainly to support. I'd just arrived and settled in when suddenly someone comes up and hugs me from behind. No need to guess who it was.

Why don't I decide to give it a shot? I opened up to another one of the executive committee members because I had a lot on my plate for the month and wanted to find a way to get rid of extra stressors, my feelings included. Funny thing is we had just finished a meeting for the org then, and I was pretty much hugging the other person while in non-crying tears after laughing and being flustered from the whole thing, and it just so happened he was still across the street and saw us talking. He came over and asked why I was crying, and so I just clutched the other person tighter and he came on around for a group hug. He even asked me something like ""we're together all the time, why don't you tell me what's going on?"" (Context: the guy's a medical intern and is always so busy with org work outside intern hours so the weeks before that I was subconsciously making every excuse possible to work with him in person or if not just drop by).

Thankfully when we got to a spot where we could talk he fell asleep a minute aftersitting down and I wouldnt have to tell him anything. While we were talking (me and the other executive committee member), I found out despite him being always about work 100%, he was already with someone(!!). And tbh, I was really relieved to hear that because that meant my feelings would finally sizzle out and I could go on as normal. It worked for a day, but on the 2nd day when my friend persuaded me to reconfirm, the feelings have begun resurfacing again.

I guess the only options I really have are to say something or wait it out. If I say something, I worry less about rejection and more of the ramifications, such as the awkwardness, the unexpected emotions I may feel since I don't expect to feel too bad if I were to be rejected, and above all given we'll continue to work together for quite some more time I'm afraid it'll affect work relationships. I'm not really the most attractive guy out there; The best adjective I get is cute because of being overweight. In addition the guy I'm crushing on is like *legit*. His credentials for his age are just outstanding (I should know since I volunteered to compile them for him. Bad move)

If I don't, I basically have to wait it out. From experience, it'll take about 1-1.5 years and that's a *long* time.

So now, I'd really appreciate your inputs. Idk what to do anymore :(

Edit: tl;dr I suddenly like a guy I volunteer with in an org I never expected to like but I'm told he's with someone now. What do I do?

Thank you."
73dorf,4,2017-09-30,[18F] need advice on how to conduct myself in a meeting with my manager [40'sF] where I'm going to get fired. I worked 1 day there.,multiequations,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73dorf/18f_need_advice_on_how_to_conduct_myself_in_a/,"So I got hired by a 24 hour store that is part of a large chain in the US as a part-time sales associate. The company was really vague about scheduling during the interview. The manager that hired me didn't tell me much about how many hours I was going to work, when my shift is going to end and what days I was going to work. In fact, it was close to nothing. I just assumed, that it will all be hatched out come the first day of work. My first big mistake was not asking about any of those details. 

The only thing she said to me was that this job required open availability. That term kind of scared me because I'm a full time college student and I really didn't want to miscommunicate anything. So, I told her several times that I was a full time student and I wasn't going to be available until after 5:30pm, M-F. My second big mistake was not telling her that I wanted to end my shift at 10:00pm. I automatically assumed that she would schedule for me to end at around 10pm because I was a student and because since it was a part-time job, I would be working close to 20 hours so I would be given the option of 4 hour long shifts. Basically have shorter shifts over several days of the week. I was naive and stupid. At all of my other jobs (mostly intern positions), during the job interview they told me the schedule, roughly how many hours or how long the shifts were.

Some come the first day of work, the manger is not there because she leaves at 4, the assistant manager is there and he didn't tell me when my shift was going to end. I found out through one of the guys training me. So once I find out, I tried to find a private place to tell him that I can't stay until 12am because I have class at 9, I have to leave at 10, I'm sorry for the inconvenience and I didn't want to abandon my shift. He's immediately dismissive towards me and tells me to take it up with the manager the next morning. I left at 10. 

The next morning right before class, I called the manager. I told her that I'm sorry I couldn't finish my shift because I can't work a whole 6.5 hour shift after a full day of classes, asked if there were 4 hour shifts available or if they could just schedule me on the weekend and etc., The manager responds with saying that she dosen't hire people for just the weekends, 4 hour shifts were unavailable and that the situation was ""unbelievable"". I tried to be really polite to her and apologize a whole bunch. She then told me she was going to have to terminate my employment and I told I was fine with that and understood the situation. 

I know I was very unprofessional in how I went about the job and that a lot of the blame falls onto my hands. I should have asked her because had I known that that four hour shifts or the fact that I couldn't just be scheduled on the weekends, I wouldn't have taken the job. 

I have to go back because I never did my I-9 and other paperwork because the system was down on my first day at work. She's going to be pissed and I don't think she thinks I'm remorseful enough about the situation. The phone call ended after I gave a firm apology because I was about to run late for class. How do I make a good ""last impression"" as I get fired/have to talk to her? I don't want to make the situation any worst. 

Reddit, thanks for all of your advice!

  **tl;dr**: I got hired PT at a 24 hour store that didn't tell me much about their shifts; they scheduled me for too long and I had to abandon my shift so I'm getting fired. How do I face the manager?

73eqrp,5819,2017-09-30,"Director stealing credit for intern's work? Enjoy unemployment and €250,000 personal debt",anpassungburo,ProRevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/73eqrp/director_stealing_credit_for_interns_work_enjoy/,"Brace yourselves, it's a bit of a long one, but it's a prime example of a single sentence can go a long way.    


So one summer at university I took a job in the marketing department of a small manufacturing company, ostensibly creating foreign language advertising material and safety texts, as well as all the social media stuff for their upcoming move into Europe.    


It quickly became clear a large element of sales was involved but I didn't mind - I was young and wanted lots of big wins for my résumé. The department consisted of myself, another guy for another European language, and one hugely underpaid 16-year-old 'junior' intern. We all worked for an absolute bandit (hereafter 'the boss') who basically had no relevant experience or competencies but was a smooth talker and had ensnared the company owner with some kind of evil wizardry. This boss spent most of his time running a side business off his iPhone, only stopping to literally throw things at us whilst we were on the phone (banter), to randomly paint the inside of our office jet black (ceiling included) or make inane demands like trying to force a supplier to give us a 40% discount based on our tiny firms 'potential'.    


This was all fine and kind of funny, and gave us something to laugh about at KFC during lunch, but the real pain in the arse was that whenever anyone made any real headway (sealed a deal with a supplier or vendor, completed negotiations with government agencies, secured a good rate for marketing, found a new opportunity etc.)  he would steal the credit. The owner never caught on and genuinely thought the guy was a one-man powerhouse, despite us occasionally leaving evidence or outright telling the owner when we'd done the work, catching the boss out in some blatant lies. It was all just 'miscommunication' in the owner's eyes.    


This went on for months. We were all on minimum wage or lower as ""interns"" whilst basically doing the boss' job for him as he repeatedly told us how great he was and how little we understood. We spent the summer confusing the hell out of European CEOs and Purchasing Directors who wondered why this mad little English company was using interns for all its international business.    


The other marketing guy got tired and quit, leaving just me and the junior intern, at which point I was told I had been 'promoted' to lead the project for both countries. At this point I was now, on part-time minimum wage, entrusted with planning and executing a foreign market invasion for two different countries solo, whilst the boss sold dildos on his iPhone (oh btw his side business was a sex shop).    


Even that would have been alright by me if the boss hadn't kept trying to steal credit. At one point he jumped in in a foreign language phone call I was making to a well-circulated magazine and, in English, said ""I'll take over, Anpassungburo isn't really that important"" before promptly realising the other party was about 60 years old, partially deaf, and spoke about 4 words of English. He handed the phone back to me then went off to tell the owner he'd just landed a great rate on some ad space.    


Public episodes like this meant our potential vendors scented weakness and ultimately proposed a lopsided contract which basically stated that if our products didn't sell a certain volume, we would be liable to pay the vendor pure cash for the remainder. The 'certain volume' was €250000 (net profit, not even gross sales) in the first twelve months. I'd never heard of such a proposal before, and even at 19 I knew it was all kinds of shady. This was the first thing I was perfectly happy to let the boss take credit for. There was no way we'd make that quota, but the clueless boss was so thrilled to have a 'big' number to throw around he printed the contract there and then. It had been mailed to me but he instantly claimed HE had brokered it, the absolute turnip.
Now for the Pro Revenge; he asked what I thought of the contract and whether we could achieve it. What I did not say was that only a world champion village idiot would sign this contract. I did not say that only an absolute dildo vendor would go ahead with this blatantly disastrous contract without consulting the owner. As the boss had made very clear, he was the marketing god and I was a lowly intern whose opinion was no more use than a chocolate teapot, so rather than warning him that this contract was so horrible we should burn the paper it was printed on and have the office exorcised to be safe, I instead said simply;    


*""you're the boss - the numbers are all in the project book if you want to read it over but if it looks good to you the post office closes in 15.""*    


I knew without a shadow of a doubt he wouldn't bother with my boring paperwork, not when I had dangled the chance for him to get his big win dispatched by the end of business, and sure enough he said there was no need to see my figures as he had 'done the sums himself' and was certain it was solid gold. Funnily enough, the project book quite clearly showed that I had estimated (as best I could with no analytical experience) that our gross first year sales might top 20k if we were lucky, but anything written by me wasn't worth reading, not with the post office closing in 15, so he signed the contract and sent me running off to post it. I made copies and mailed it off to our lucky new vendors. I then took a copy straight to the owner, told the owner the project book was in the boss' office if he wanted to check he numbers, and then went to HR next door to regretfully hand in my notice before shifting it out of there before the fireworks started.
    

Bang on opening the next day, the boss was called to a meeting with the owner. Yelling was heard. About an hour later the boss is walked off the property and a hastily typed email is sent out reminding people that only the owner and HR are Signing Authorized on behalf of the firm. Unfortunately the contract was still apparently valid as the boss' title (marketing director) gave him implied authority or something.    


I'm not a lawyer and all I did during my final week (with no boss and our project in tatters) was to hang out at KFC with the other surviving intern. I wasn't at any board meetings, shockingly, but the company lawyer was there every day that week and last I heard the ex-boss was being sued by the company for the damages they had to fork out to the European vendor, which were potentially over €250k. I doubt that his dildo dealership made enough to cover his legal fees.    


TL;DR - lazy boss/shady sex toy salesman steals credit for year's worth of work, has no idea what is going on and signs nonsense contract he has no authority to sign. Company fires him and takes him to court for damages. I eat KFC throughout


EDIT

Thanks for all your responses! I'm sorry some people feel I'm a millennial snowflake who fucked over a small company but this was nearly ten years ago and the company still exists. 

When a marketing director signs a 250k contract without reading it after sneering at his young employee who wrote him an *entire project book* that made it pretty evident  it was a bad idea, you really have to hate 'millenials' to blame anyone but the director. Also my career turned out fine thanks and I had KFC today out of nostalgia it was absolutely delicious"

Currently, I've been exposed to only R3 and a few of the modules. I'm currently taking a configuration class. I can't help to think that this class is completely out dated. I may be going out on a limb here, but I feel that ERP implementation is pretty saturated and most companies are looking towards a more stream lining approach. Also, during my internship for the summer, there was a real lack of SAP automation in the accounting department. For example, there were employees who would manually go in and download reports from SAP into excel and then manually transform the data into excel spreadsheets. This approach seems archaic. I wrote them VBA macros so they no longer had to transform the data into excel, and they were oblivious to the fact that this could happen. 

My question to all the SAP experts out there is: What sort of automation can happen to generate defined transaction reports from SAP and can I have them streamlined into excel? Interactive excel X?  I also have R/3 for the remainder of the year and I've been using it to practice things along this nature. I'm also interested in transforming data from SAP using other middleware. Can someone point me into the direction of some resources? Maybe a book or some youtube videos.

73fr50,17,2017-09-30,Where's the Clorox: Chapter 1,EbrietasSonOfEcgtheo,SurrealLore,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurrealLore/comments/73fr50/wheres_the_clorox_chapter_1/,"One day, a legion of rebels gathered on the edge of a lake, and one of the captains asked the leader to tell the men a story of encouragement before battle. And he started “One day, a legion of rebels gathered…” and his story began to fold in upon itself infinitely, each iteration going faster and faster until he was telling it 1000 times a second. 10,000 times a second. 1,000,000 times a second! Reality was beginning to warp. The men’s eyes widened in horror as the soldiers closest to the leader were getting sucked toward the leader and crushed. Exploding into higher dimensional memes no one could comprehend, Orangs and vegitals shot out from the leader at near light speed. Eyes began to grow on some of the soldiers faces as their irony levels sky rocketed. Those whose minds and bodies failed to adapt were sucked into the normie void and soon only eight remained. Those eight's heads were completely engulfed in eyes, save for their now growing mouths. Their innards began to dissolve and regurgitated out their mouths, only to resolidify as writhing tendrils. The army they were previously going to fight, came over the hill and saw across the lake 8 heads floating higher and higher up to the a circling green vortex in the sky from which they saw surreal nightmares emerge. The commander at the sight went “nope, nope… no no no” and proceeded back the other way. The bodies of the normi soldiers melted into a swirling slushy in the sky. The floating eye covered entities consumed the liquid flesh, and grew to enormous size. As the army gazed across the lake in utter confusion, the commander continued back down the hill, He remembered this event was depicted in a picture as a prophecy.
 &lt;intermission&gt; Time for a nerdy math joke that only nerdy maths majors will understand! So there was this guy whose job was to take the second derivative of parabolic functions… but he quit his job because it was too flat! He then proceeded to down an entire bottle of clorox. &lt;/intermision&gt;
 The commander got down on his knees and bowed in worship of the surreal meme masters as they ascended to a higher plane of thought “OH GREAT MEME MASTERS, MAY WE BE BLESSED WITH IRONY”, and thusly he was granted an irony level of -1. Now even his irony level was ironic, he was the first and last mortal meme lord of such high rank during this millennia. He will go down into myth and legend as The Buddha. He, the Buddha, arose from the ground, arms raised in gratitude of his new higher dimensional gift from beyond this realm. The portal in the sky closed, and the men stared at where it once was in hope of its return so they to could ascend. But alas, it would not return for another 1,000,000 years, not until the next person utters the sacred text for which no mortal knows. It can only be found by chance, and on this day, some lucky boi struck gold. The Grey Beards back in the city felt the DANK and S U R R E A L shock wave. The normally modest monks would party hard that night in celebration, listening to more ironic music from the future called DUBSTEP.
The Grey Beards found this living myth, the man with a negative irony, and brought him to their monastery. There they trained him in the ways of the DANK in the hopes he may one day save us from the cult of the normie. His irony however was too great, and much to their disappointment, no one could translate his higher dimensional tongue. They had given him a scroll to write on in hopes they could one day translate it, this is what he wrote. ”Я дрейфую через неизвестное как более высокое размерное существо, и где находится ANGERY” the monks of the silver facial hair could not decipher this strange language no matter how hard they tried, but they soon discovered that these strange writings held great power, for you see, he was able to hear the eight great meme lords, and he wrote their strange utterings in the only language that could depict such dankness. And to this day, travelers still go to to the lake where the DANK portal had opened to feast on the liquefied flesh of those who were left behind in hopes that they may rise a level or two. The water too is considered sacred, and many people from the village would go there to bath. This idea of bathing in a natural body of water is the first ever record of what we would consider Beach Going.
And next to that lake, there is a temple.he who hears the dank ones resides in this temple. He spends his days scrawling the DANK utterings onto sacred parchment given to him by the Grey Beards. His body was failing because his S U R R E A L level was too high for his current plane of existence. And so he died, leaving behind hundreds of indecipherable symbols, each with a power beyond human comprehension. Deeming these symbols too DANK for humanity to possess, the Grey Beards sealed the lakeside temple.
But now, 10,000 years later, after the Greybeards have long since been forgotten, the temple was rediscovered by mankind. The Buddha before he died was discovered to have learned some of our normi language and described one if his symbols to us; he said “It is the way of the future” followed by ☭. This confused many, as the USSR had long since collapsed. Until one day, one of the workers tasked with uncovering the tomb had an epiphany; WE MUST BRING BACK COMMUNISM! 
His name was Bernie Sanders. While he was exploring the tomb, he came running out of the cave with nothing on and fell to his knees. He then stared straight at the sun without blinking and screamed continuously for 10 minutes without pause. After his eyes had melted out of their sockets, he screamed “I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT! I CAN SEE THEIR DANK MEMES! OH DANK ONES, ALLOW ME COMPREHENSION OF YOUR DANKNESS!” But the Dank ones would not allow it. His feeble normie mind could not comprehend their S U R R E A L memes. And so he was cursed to view these memes, without the ability to comprehend them.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to get clown costumes for the village peasents &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

His highest irony level he was able to achieve thus far in his life was 5, and even then it wasn't very convincing. Sadness and ANGERY enveloped him, and he continued screaming for another 20 minutes or so. His archaeologist colleagues this whole time were utterly confused as they witnessed this well known political figure convert to communism, run out of a cave naked, and scream at the sun, all in the space of an hour. The archeologists dragged the screaming naked, wrinkly old man across the ground to the medical tent at the excavation site, where they bandaged his eyeless sockets, and gave him a cup of coco. The boss came, putting a caring hand on bernie’s shoulder “now bernie, why don’t you tell me what happened?”. They could tell Bernie was trying to cry by the sounds he made but no tears came. He gathered himself and said in a wavering tone, “I have seen true dankness [sniffles], boi, I saw Richard Simmons”. Everyone gasped, Richard Simmons was the DANKEST meme lord to ever live, in his prime back in 1980 he was a worldwide sensation during the era they call, “The Fitness Revolution”. But that movement died off, after all it is the year 8192. 
The spirit of Richard Simmons was now trying to communicate through Bernie, that the world was in grave danger. But from what, they didn't know, because Bernie lacked the irony level necessary to understand beings from the upper plane. Thus the archeologists determined they needed to raise Sander’s irony, and luckily they knew of an ancient ruin where they could do exactly that. &lt;intermission&gt; We interrupt your regularly scheduled surreal program to bring you a word from our sponsors: Have you ever needed to get high on irony? Do you ever feel like your irony level is dropping? Are you only a 3 dimensional creature? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, then you need Clorox®. To use, simply take a pleasant swig of Clorox’s flavored, natural concoction, and feel the lasting effects immediately. Clorox: Stimulate your senses &lt;/intermission&gt;
The archeologists used the Dustymobile to speed old Bernie to the ruins of the Biggest Clorox factory ever built. This great facility was known as Clerot hall. Here they would have to delve into the depths of dankness to obtain the very last bottle of Clorox in existence.
	There they stood, at the foot of this monument of memetry, they bowed their heads in respect for the great meme lords of the past, now long since fallen. Remembering all those who had tried to drink of the nectar but alas, we're not S U R R E A L enough to endure its intense high. This being the last clorox factory it was seen as a national park of sorts to the remaining DANKSTERS. After Oxiclean took over Clorox, they declared this factory off limits to the public. Oxiclean destroyed all but one of the Clorox factories to remember what they had conqord. If they were to embark on this adventure, there’d be no going back. Once they step foot into that cavernous warehouse, they’d be fugitives.
	Bernie and the archeologist took that first step into the sacred tomb, and descended the first great staircase on their journey to the center of the maze like factory. The Archeologists guided Bernie, as he was blind but for his visions of the DANK ones memes. The DANKNESS transcended the limits of language and bestowed Bernie with an ineffable, unfathomable truth of: VEGITAL BADDDDDD!!!! Though they didn’t know it at the time, this was a prophesy of the hardships they'd face within the factory.
At the bottom of the staircase laid their first challenge, a vast open room, completely dark except for what little light fell from the top of the stairs. They'd have to traverse true darkness if they were to reach their goal, but they couldn't have known at the time, that vegetal hid within the shadows of that great void. They heard it scuttle along the hard floor somewhere far ahead of them but could not see it. It reverberated through the large chamber and it sounded as if the VEGITAL was everywhere at once. They cringed at the feeling of the cold air on their skin as they proceeded into the darkness with the VEGITAL.
Bernies eye sockets stung intensely in the presence of this creature of dankitude, and the archeologist had to drag the nude and screaming old man across the cold cement floor. This screaming is what attracted the vegital to their location. They found that whistling the tune of Thomas the Dank Engine worked the best in silencing him. But it was too late. Vegetal appeared out of the darkness, and grabs Bernie with his mouth, and began trying to drag him into the shadows. The archeologists tried to pull Sanders from the creature's grasp, but the very laws of physics were warped within its presence, and force didn't work the same. Then one of the archeologists used this to his advantage, and broke Bernie’s legs off at the knees, freeing him from the monster’s jaw. The biggest of the archeologists put Sanders on his back like chewbaca did with C-3PO that one time, and they ran to what they could only hope would be an escape. They heard vicious hissing behind them as the vile creature tried to gain on them, when all of a sudden, one of the archeologist interns tripped and fell to the floor. The rest of the gang took advantage and used him as a distraction to buy them a little more time. 
&lt;obituary&gt; To the family of the intern: he was… good…. i guess. I mean he turned in his work on time… honestly was the most average intern we ever had &lt;/obituary&gt;
The vegetal consumed the one known as Greg while the rest ran away in fear. After that, vegetal seemed sated for the time being, and they were able to make it out of the void safely. They enter the next room, a single light source hangs by a thin wire dimly illuminating the room. Cracks fill the ceiling letting small amounts of sunlight protrude the room, while other cracks slowly drip drops of Clorox onto the floor, forming small puddles across the floor, and slowly flowing towards the single drain In the room. In front of the archeologists are 13 pedestals of stone, on each sits a bottle, or a container of some sort, each one different from the last. A floating teapot is in the center of the room, the guardian and messenger of not only Richard Simmons, but the omniscient SURREAL being above and beyond Simmons. Meme Man. The teapot speaks “These are the remaining Clorox products, drink from the original, and you will be granted ultimate SURREAL levels and unfathomable DANKNESS. Choose wrongly, and suffer the agonizing death of drinking bleach, followed by facing the eternal wrath of the King of the underworld, 4chan”.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to take Richard Simmons to soccer practice &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

The archeologists looked to Bernie, as he rose to his stubs, and reached for a bottle he was not tall enough to grasp “it is this one! I can sense the dankness contained within.” An archeologist was about to hand it to Sanders when another stopped him “wait, if that's the wrong one, then our only hope for saving humanity is lost with Bernie... one of us must drink it…” he said, looking at the other three archeologists making up their team of five. With a shaking hand, the smallest of the group reached for the bottle “I volunteer as tribute!” The others gladly allowed him to take the first swig, and were verified in their fear when the frail archeologist began melting before their very eyes. The ground began to quiver and the ground under the drinkers feet started glowing green in a clover leaf pattern. The emblem on the ground opened, revealing a portal from which trashy normi pepe memes shot out. The cancer it wielded was so great that it changed from a figure of speech to actual pepe's with rapidly growing cancer in their eyes. The half melted man let out a blood curdling scream that tore through the air just be for the ground swallowed him whole. The ground then sealed shut just as fast as it had appeared, thus sealing his fate to the Nazi ridden normis of the deep. But wait, the teapot speaks! “You choose… Wrong...” the archeologists stared at Bernie, their faith in him now thoroughly shaken. “Uh-uh-oopsies, which bottle did I point to? Sorry I can't see anything without eyes, I think I meant this bottle over here” the others looked at him skeptically, but had no choice but to trust him, after all, humanity's fate was in this naked legless mans hands. It wasn't until after this horrific ordeal that they realized he pointed to an Oxiclean mix, it literally said it right on the container. They went to the bottle he was pointing to, it was Tide Detergent… Without telling him, they instead went to.a different one, the only bottle that actually had a Clorox logo. They said “Oh, you mean this one?” Bernie , pointing in a totally different direction shouted at the wall “Oh Yes! That's the one!”
Much more confident in his chances, the next archeologist took a swig from this bottle. His eyes began to grow, his jaw unhinged like a snake, and from deep inside of him, a blood soaked human fetus crawled out his mouth. The archaeologist's body fell to the ground with a thud, his eyes continuing to grow past the size of soccer balls, and the fetus raised its slimy head, and stared with unseeing eyes at Bernie “I C A N S E E T H E S U R R E A L! T H I S I S T H E B O T T L E!” The others stared with wide eyes as they realized this fetus was actually a reincarnation of their friend (George). The bottle was passed over to Bernie with careful handling. He took the container and… he dropped it, Bernie actually dropped it, what an idiot. The Clorox formed a pool on the old grimy concrete floor and mixed with some of the dirt and dust, making a brown tinted mixture. The others looked at him angrily “Lick it up.” one said bluntly.Bernie promptly started licking the wrong part of the floor, consuming a large amount of god knows what before the others were able to stop giggling and guide him to the puddle.
With each lick, Sanders’s tongue grew longer and longer, and soon other tongues started snaking out from the old man’s mouth, which all also started licking up the contaminated dankness fluid. Then, on the end of each of Bernie’s now numerous tongues, an eyeball sprouted “I CAN SEE!” Bernie shouted, tongues sticking out, as he gazed around the room with his free roaming sensory organs. He leans forward on his extended arms and arched his back, then with all his might he let out an even louder shriek, a call to his higher dimensional companions. The fetus George soon joined in Bernie's call, and together they summoned the great Richard Simmons. He appeared in a flash of holy light, floating a few feet off the ground “congratulation my children, you have done well to make it this far” he put a hand on Bernie’s shoulder “I have come to tell you, Bernie, that the world needs your guidance. They need you to bring back communism…” Bernie stared with all five of his prehensile sensory organs “I - I'll do it Mr Simmons, I'll bring back communism” he said with awe and stuck out tongues. “I know you will son… I know you will…” and with that, the Great Richard simmons vanished back into the DANKNESS.

73gluo,2,2017-09-30,[M4A (playing F/Futa)] Seduced by RoosterTeeth,Nmarshall273,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/73gluo/m4a_playing_ffuta_seduced_by_roosterteeth/,"Hey DPP! I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

I gained an intense interest in recent times for cybernetics, however i myself do not know anything much about this field,  can you please recommend any good researchers to follow? are there any companies that would standout in this area? I'd atleast like to start with an internship. 

Thanks,

73i2wt,638,2017-09-30,Milestone Post - $250k liquid net worth while earning &lt;$100K (Age: 30),feeFIfofreedom,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/73i2wt/milestone_post_250k_liquid_net_worth_while/,"This post is brought to you by slightly above average wages, disciplined spending, and consistent saving.  **First the basics**:

* Age: 30
* Field: Mechanical engineer working in design engineering
* Location: Minnesota
* Current LNW: $260k (EF, 401k, IRA, and taxable brokerage)
* Current NW: $370k ($110k home equity)
* FIRE Target: $1.2M at end of 2030
* Single, no children

[Plot of liquid net worth since starting my full-time position](https://imgur.com/a/CmrOr).  The major drops are the house down payment and a cash purchase of a car.

**Income from my W2 job (includes bonuses)**:

* 2010: $17,000
* 2011: $52,000     
* 2012: $54,000    
* 2013: $60,500     
* 2014: $70,500     
* 2015: $81,000     
* 2016: $85,500     
* 2017: $87,500     

**Monthly expenses**:

* 2012: $2,620     
* 2013: $2,550     
* 2014: $3,890     
* 2015: $2,570     
* 2016: $2,310     
* 2017: $2,600     

With a high end estimate included for 2017 this averages to $2,760 a month.  The outlier in 2014 is $1,450 added from the car purchase, stripping that out you can see a good base level of consistency.

**Phony Alert**: I graduated without student loan debt thanks to my school choice, some hard work, but also 8k/year tuition support from my parents.  While unemployed (2009) I moved back home to live bill free, and I stayed there while underemployed (2010) and employed (2011).  This let me continue looking for work in my major, take a foot-in-the-door internship, and save up a down payment for my own house.  I also used a family car that limped along into 2014 and they insured.

**Background**: Graduating out into the Great Recession was a lesson in feeling helpless I was dedicated not to repeat.  For the early years my target was “fuck this” money that would let me lose or walk away from my job with a carefree shrug.  When I found myself holding an unwieldy 3+ years worth of expenses in a bank account and taxable brokerage I started after “fuck you” money and have been chasing it ever since.

**W2 Job**: At this point I’m not pursuing additional growth in salary.  The high income in the last three years is due to some likely unsustainable bonuses, I expect things to at best level off in the short term.  It’s a job I neither love nor dread, it’s 40hrs/week and I leave it at the door.

**1099 Income**: I officiate youth sports (hockey, lacrosse, football, baseball).  I cultivated this as a crutch to stave off job anxiety before reaching “fuck this” money.  I’ve dialed things back considerably since then, but maintain some participation in all of them in the event I need to ramp it back up.  I’ve averaged $5,000 per year with a max of over $9,000 the year I bought my home (both before expenses).  If desired I could probably push as high as $14,000 before it impacted my day job. 

**Budgeting**: I’m a natural saver, so I put little effort into this.  I track spending against take home pay from my W2 job with a general goal to stay in the green each month.  To this point I haven’t seen any concerning habits, monthly spending is consistent and the occasional red month isn’t a concern. 

**Savings**: Early on I focused on EF and taxable brokerage, I paid into my 401k enough to get my employer match through 2014, starting in mid-2015 I learned about the conversion ladder and shifted over to reaching the annual max.  I fell just short in 2015 and have maxed it out since.  I started a Roth IRA in 2016 and have maxed since.  I’m projecting an additional $12,000 into taxable brokerage per year, but this may not be sustainable.  Halving that will delay my FI date by one year.  I started maxing my HSA in 2016 after smaller contributions in years prior.

**Mistakes**: You folks are probably on the ball enough these are pretty simple and obvious.  They have been touched on earlier but I’ll highlight them here:

* Did not take advantage of 401k max limit not knowing there was means to access the money for an early retirement
* Was lazy about opening an IRA and at the least should have contributed in 2014, 2015.  When I finally started one and was done 10 minutes later I felt like an idiot for procrastinating.  Because I was.
* Spent my early years picking individual stocks, oops.  I don’t *think* I paid a heavy idiot tax here, but I’ve never properly analyzed.  At best it was a lot of effort, worry, and frustration to lag the market a bit. 
* I scrapped way too low when buying my house.  Thankfully it worked out but it’s hard to look back and think that was the right time.

**Miscellaneous takeaways**:

* I love paying my bills each month, I get a reward at the end of tallying up my accounts once a month.  Not the impression I get from others in my day to day life.
* I’ve seen some debate here over home ownership on the road to FI.  My experience lands me healthily in the pro column, but that obviously depends on the person, goals, and location.  It’s been an okay financial choice and is nice for a consistent COL I can project forward, but I’d pay a penalty for aspects that don’t fit on a spreadsheet. 
* Seeing my goal saves me from mindlessly “doing my best” to save.  I’m happy enough with it and my life I don’t need to chase a different job, work more 1099 hours, rent out part of my home, etc. 
* Financial security is an incredible stress reliever.  My industry has frequent layoff cycles and when they hit my only concern now is ensuring I get items with sentimental value from my desk.
