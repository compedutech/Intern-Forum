1woz49,2,2014-01-31,I feel horrible and I need someone to talk to.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1woz49/i_feel_horrible_and_i_need_someone_to_talk_to/,"Hello /r/depression. I've always thought about making a post here but it never seems to happen. I'm a long-time lurker. I'd like someone to talk to, but knowing me, it probably won't happen since I have a tendency to isolate myself from others. This might also turn out to be terribly long, so I doubt that anybody will really read it. I'm 23 years old and I just graduated from college.

My living situation is good. I am a telecommuter, and I work from home providing customer service over the phone. They pay isn't great, and the angry customers tend to be verbally abusive. I've only been doing this for a few weeks, as I do need a way to pay the bills while I look for a job that's ""in my field"". 

I have always been an imaginative person. My dad has always yelled at me for day dreaming when I should be paying attention. When I graduated from high school, I was a lot happier and more hopeful than I am now. I was going to college to be a nurse, and I would just sit in my human biology class looking at this beautiful poster of all these different sharks. I loved it. I always loved nature and animals. I began to think it would be wonderful to go to school to do something that I loved. I received all kinds of discouragement about how hard it is to be a scientist. I was told that the pay was terrible, that the job security isn't great, and that there aren't many openings. Academic advisors were mostly unhelpful and dismissive. In all of my naive glory, I took the leap and followed the advice of Confucius: do what you love and you'll never work a day of your life.

I took an internship at the Department of Environmental Protection in my senior year and it was the most miserable ""job"" of my life. I spent 4-8 hours a week there doing monotonous, repetitive data entry into spreadsheets. They never gave me a chance to do anything enriching. It was miserable, and for the most part, the people who worked there seemed as miserable as me. They were constantly laying nice people off because they were underfunded. I left after spending a year there.

Despite the bad experience, I worked my ass off on my degree. All the while, I began to grow weary of the entire thing. My senior research project was the best in my class, and I graduated in the top percentile of my peers with cum laude.

Despite my accomplishments, I feel utterly devoid of any sense of achievement of motivation. I have not been able to find a job in my state, and I am absolutely crushed. I have severe medical depression, but I'm a very tenacious person so I have always fought it tooth and nail. I have never succumbed to it in any way, but I am starting to lose steam here. I'm so discouraged. I kept telling myself all of this time that everyone was wrong, and that I would prevail and do something with my dreams.

Meanwhile, a lot of other things have gone to shit. Almost all of my friends are in horrible situations. They're all either addicted to drugs, horribly depressed, in abusive relationships, or something else that's just bleak as fuck. My parents are terribly unhelpful. My mother walked out on me when I was 14, and although we have kept in touch, the last time I tried to tell her what I was going through she found it appropriate to tell me about how ""God is the answer"" for forty minutes. She just talked at me about how I should stop being an atheist for forty minutes while I said nothing. My father is a recovered alcoholic and drug addict who has nothing to offer me as far as emotional support is concerned. His approach is ""tough love"", and I just can't take feeling like any more of a loser right now than I already do. My boy friend is a guy who is easily satisfied as long as he isn't starving and homeless, so depression is completely out of his ballpark and he never has anything to say to me. I feel like I can't even talk to my best friend. She is as depressed as I am and in the same position, but every time I try to bring it up with her, I feel like I'm making her feel worse and then I can add guilt to the laundry list of my problems.

I feel so fucking alone, and I hate trying to make new friends. I almost always find other people to be disappointing and hard to relate to. Everyone who gets close to me loses interest or finds me disagreeable.

The thing that hurts me the most right now is that poster of the sharks. Someone I loved bought it for me a couple of years before I received my degree. He's now addicted to drugs, without a job, suicidal, without a degree, and living at his parents' house. He calls me all of the time because I'm his only friend, but hearing from him makes me sad. The poster is hanging behind where I sit when I work. I used to turn around and see it when I was finished studying, and it filled me with hope and reminded me of why I was working so hard. Now I turn around and see it when I'm done working, and all it does is remind me of what a failure I am and how everyone I love is suffering horribly. I want to take it down, but I think it would hurt me more to look at an empty space where the image that ignited my dream once rested.

The world is so ugly. I didn't think this was how my life would turn out to be."

I do not want to be a police officer.  I don't have the personality type to do that kind of work every day.  However, it is my hope to work as a criminologist or criminal profiler.  I know these positions require Grad Degrees (sometimes Doctorates), which I am absolutely going to enter into.  I'm a serious student (3.98 GPA, graduating top of my class, have done a few great internships while working FT) and possess a desire to keep acquiring criminological knowledge as it becomes available.  My question is do I have any chance of getting into a Forensic Psych program (such as NYU or John Jay) even though I'm a CJ Major?  I've taken a myriad of psychology and forensic courses as they pertain to law, i.e., victimology, psychology and crime, criminal profiling, forensic accounting, forensic geology, intro to forensics.  Are these classes enough (along with basic psych and soc glasses) for me to get into a forensic psychology program?  Any help/career advice would be sincerely appreciated.  Thanks guys."
1wpcv2,7,2014-01-31,First timer; my story and a couple questions,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1wpcv2/first_timer_my_story_and_a_couple_questions/,"Hey guys. Before I ask my questions, I'm going to explain a little bit about myself first. Feel free to skip to the bottom for the questions.

First off, I am 17. I know this sub is 18+, but I think I can address this topic maturely. If the mods feel the need to ban me, so be it, I won't hold anything against them (although this is a throwaway). If it's any consolation, i'll be 18 in two months anyways.

I first came into contact with trees face to face this summer. Some friends asked me if I wanted to smoke with them, but I had to turn them down as I was starting an internship that was likely to ask for a drug test. If it weren't for the internship, I don't really know what I would have done. Up until then I'd never really researched anything about weed, I just knew what I had been told from others.

At about the same time that I first saw cannabis face to face, I began actively using reddit. Eventually, I stumbled upon this sub. I decided to subscribe and quietly observe these ""stoners"" from a safe distance.

After following /r/trees for a few months, and seeing the posts on here, I realized pretty much all my preconceptions about marijuana and its users were wrong. I'm not kidding when I say just being around you guys really showed me how uneducated I was. 

One day, while riding in the car with my dad, I had a debate with him on the legality of marijuana. Coming from conservative roots in the deep south, I wasn't entirely surprised to hear that he opposed it. We both made our opposing cases fairly well, but neither of us were able to fully convince the other to change their views. Neither of us could cite any real scientific evidence on the effects of weed. So I decided to educate myself.

About two months ago I started researching the effects of smoking cannabis. After listening to countless debates, browsing many forums, reading endless studies, and even watching movies (The Union: The Business Behind Getting High), I formed a new opinion of this misunderstood drug. After lots of research, I've come to the conclusion that while smoking marijuana is not necessarily harmless, its negative effects are negligible compared to the potential benefits it has for many people (myself included).

I even went as far as to voluntarily type a 1000+ word essay on my case for legalization. I originally planned to present my paper to my parents, but decided against it. I'll save it for any extreme cases in which I may need it.

Which leads me to where I am now. Tomorrow, my friend and I are planning on smoking some weed. She has smoked once, but I've never even touched weed before. I really cant afford to be caught, as it would ruin my parents' image of me. Up until now I've pretty much been the ""role model"" kid. Most of all, I don't want to hurt them.

TL;DR I'm about to start smoking. Mind answering a few questions?

1), We are most likely going to smoke from a joint. We are also going to be outside. Will there be a noticeable smell on me/my clothes? If so, is it possible to cover up?

2), We'll be smoking mid-high grade weed. I've also never smoked before. Approximately how long do you think I'll be high for?

Thanks so much for reading! Feel free to give me any advice that you may have!"

I am looking for advice, or an opportunity if it turns out that way. I'll keep it brief so I don't bore you. I am unemployed right now, but have been working in an IT department as an intern (county work experience program with no chance for being hired) getting all around IT experience for the last 9 months, and recently received an assignment to build a Coldbox application. I have been working with ColdFusion for 2-3 months. I have about 2 years programming (personal) experience and learning (still in school, working on my degree). 

I live in northern California and willing to relocate for a good job, the only challenge there is not having enough money to move my family right away. I've been unemployed for over a year, so if there is anyone that can point me in the right direction, or has any good advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks for taking the time to read my story. PM me if you want more info, or I can send you my resume, letter of recommendation, or references."

and wore it for a little while. Then I grew it out again because I wasn't completely satisfied with it. Then I wore it long for a while again. Then I just kept going back and forth getting it cut short and then letting it grow out again and repeating. 

So now I'm not sure how long/short I want it. I'm 22 in my last year and a half of college and think I should start looking a bit more professional and mature since job and internship interviews are coming up soon. I think I might like it short if I got the right style but I'm not sure what that is for my face/body shape and I keep being a little unhappy with it when I cut it shorter.

Without revealing much, I attend a high-powered school in the city and have many accolades on my resume.

I've received admissions to two schools of my choice known for their strengths in the sciences and engineering, what luck!

Now that I am a second-term senior, I'd like to start getting some work experience under my belt.

I have applied for computer science for the two schools, but I am interested in other fields too. I don't know exactly what I want to study, but I'd sure like it to be a field where I'd be able to make a DIY Segway or a raspberry pi powered safe! (I have so many ideas but never the resources, heh)

So that being said, I'd like to know about potential places where I can intern.

Thanks folks!"

1wqqla,11,2014-02-01,"I feel out of place among people younger, older, and my own age. I feel very alone.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1wqqla/i_feel_out_of_place_among_people_younger_older/,"I have a boyfriend, younger siblings, and work with people that are 15 to 20 years older than me. I'm going to feel like a huge douche writing this, but I'll do it anyway.

The lives of people younger than me or even my own age seem trivial. Their problems are non-problems to me and while I try not to be judgmental and be helpful, I often find myself internally rolling my eyes. Okay, you don't know what you want to do in life? Get an internship doing anything and figure it out. You can't find a job? Okay, stop being picky and take whatever comes first. You can get a better job later. Your boyfriend is being a dick? Okay, do something about it or shut the fuck up.

Nevertheless, I am the first person to volunteer for helping you find your dream job, or applying for 50 jobs, or listening to you when you want to complain about your relationship problems. I do these things because they are me. It is how I am. I see a problem and I want to solve it. Not necessarily because I want to be kind or helpful (at least not some of the time), but because I want to fix whatever is broken.

As for people older than me, especially at my job, all they want to do is drink and go out. That is not me. I am a homebody. I don't drink because I have not found any beer, wine, or liquor that doesn't burn like a thousand suns as I'm drinking it and bar/club scenes creep me out. I don't want to make small talk with people I don't care to see again.

I could be super focused on what you're saying and then I'll get bored or want to talk about something else and it never goes past that. I guess you could call it a passing interest. 

I have been very good at masking how much I really don't care with people in general. However, with family members and my boyfriend, I sometimes can't hide it. In those times, I do come off as bitchy and insensitive and as soon as I notice, I try to right my wrong.

Maybe something's wrong with me but I just don't click with many people on anything deeper than a superficial level. I feel like I'm just going through life pretending I give a shit when really, I don't.


Has anyone else experienced something similar?

1wqr9j,9,2014-02-01,How do I deal with my irrational dad?,mypup321,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1wqr9j/how_do_i_deal_with_my_irrational_dad/,"I am hoping this is the right sub-reddit to deal with dad issues.

I am a 21 year old female currently enrolled in university. Back story, my parents got divorced right before the sub-prime mortgage crisis. My family was well off at the time and dad had to pay my mom significant alimony. The crisis happened and we went broke. My dad quit paying my mom alimony and she had to get a job. My dad keeps trying to keep our previous life style even though he's essentially broke now. He's been trying to get back up on his feet changing from real estate to finance jobs back and fourth, but he's struggling.

How does this relate to my dad being irrational? Well, I am currently a student at university. My dad use to give me some money my freshman year of college, but he's essentially stopped. I get a tuition waiver because we are now low income and some years when he makes more money, I take out loans to pay for my education. I basically take out loans entirely to pay for my cost of living. Last year when I barely got any financial aid, he took out a parent plus loan for $7,000 to help me pay for school. I never saw a dime of the money and he claimed ""well it's for all the money I gave you before. it's making up for it"". 

Most recently I realized that I am already 15,000 in debt and I can't keep taking out loans. Last summer, I buckled down and landed myself an internship that I grossed 10k. I received scholarships as well and ended up studying abroad in Europe. I financed my entire trip traveling in Europe myself with no debt. My mom gave me $700 towards the end of the trip because she wanted me to have the experience I always dreamed of. Mind you, this was my first time leaving the country and traveling alone. My parents have never traveled outside the US.

I got back to the United States basically broke. I had a scholarship check come in for $1800, but this won't last me very long. Rent in my city is very expensive. I should be graduating in the Spring, but I realized I will have to take out loans if I don't get a job. I can't handle my courses and a job. Not to mention, I am unemployed after graduation.

I decided my best bet was to take an extra semester, take less classes, and get a job right now. I can get another internship this summer to help pay for my school in the Fall. I can recruit next Fall when I have less classes for a full time job and be entirely independent of my dad. I hopefully can get a tuition-waiver again.

My frustration comes in because my dad is still claiming me as a dependent. He pays for only my health insurance and cell-phone bill and files my tuition breaks on his tax returns. I called him about discussing my taxes and he started to yell at me. He told me I needed to file my 10k income under his tax returns. I told him no, I was independent and you didn't pay for anything for me. He said well, until your out of school, you're my dependent. 

I know this year I will get a huge refund for my 10k income because my employer with-held a lot of money. This could easily go towards paying for my schooling next Fall. 

My frustration is that he's been getting tax breaks on me and he yells at me when I try to discuss otherwise. He basically does nothing for me. He pays my cellphone bill and medical insurance and that's it.

I don't know how to discuss this with them because I still need his taxes for next year to get my financial aid. I know if he got auditted he'd be screwed if I didn't consult him and just filed independently.

What should I do? He won't listen to me when I am clearly an adult basically doing everything myself.

**Dad is broke, but still claims me as a dependent. He only pays for my health-insurance and cell-phone bill. I made a hefty amount last summer that I want the tax refund for, but he keeps telling me I have to file under him. Even if I file it myself, I will still get less of a refund because he's claiming be as a dependent. He's also taking my tutition breaks, but filing my financial aid on his tax returns.What should I do?**"
1wrlya,2,2014-02-01,"I have a phone interview with IBM on Tuesday (Feb 4th) that I'm trying to prepare for, question about the selection process (internship)",[deleted],InterviewFauxYou,https://www.reddit.com/r/InterviewFauxYou/comments/1wrlya/i_have_a_phone_interview_with_ibm_on_tuesday_feb/,"This is a Software Developer Internship position, and I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering major (our school is a 5 year program).



Trying to be honest as possible: Through a family friend that works in the company, my resume was passed around and I got the opportunity for this 30 minute phone interview. When I was sent an email offering this interview by an HR recruiter, she mentioned that she really liked my resume. I don't have my GPA listed on my resume because it is **god awful** (about a 2.4, was about a 1.9 last semester). I have no excuses; I was a different person, a shitty, lazy person that never put effort into schoolwork and had delusions of grandeur. Now I'm trying to kick it back up and for the first time in my life striving for a 4.0 this semester (last semester I got a 3.3 I believe).



Anyways, I don't believe this recruiter knows my GPA; What I'm curious about that I'd like some folks to input their answers on is, once you get to the interview process (like I am right now), are you passed the *resume screening* process? Do I have to still worry about my GPA holding me back from going further, or has that already been ignored since I've been offered an interview?



Thank you.

1wru61,6,2014-02-01,I Contacted Anonymous Ads about using Dogecoin as well as using Bitcoin - I urge you to do the same!,Pizzaface97,dogecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wru61/i_contacted_anonymous_ads_about_using_dogecoin_as/,"For a while, I've seen webmasters using Adsense, and while that's great, I think we should be supporting the whole ""Anonymous"" type feel that we get from using Cryptocurrencies, as well as keeping the whole fun feel that we've had from DogeCoin.

Now, as a future Webmaster (Stay Tuned for more information Later). I'd like to gain some revenue for site costs and etc. And to do so, I'd like to receive payments in Doge (I know this isn't the most effective way, but it supports the economy) So, I sent an email over to Anonymous Ads Support (See [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/u9W8FFz.png).) asking them to support Dogecoin as a form of Payment, and a form of Paying. 

Using /u/wouldacouldashoulda 's letter as a backbone, I wrote the following:

Dear people of the awesome at AnonAds,
Let me start of with saying how much I appreciate your ad service. As a cryptocoin user and webmaster, I love the ease of being able to earn direct Bitcoins for displaying ads on my site!
Anyway, that's not why I'm writing today. Today, I'm writing about Dogecoin. You might already have heard about Dogecoin, but in case you haven't: Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) that's kind of hot recently, and has been the most traded cryptocurrency (after Bitcoin) for nearly a month. It is a bit different than Bitcoins, most notably in that there are much more of them, which in my opinion is also one of its strengths; it's not a lot of fun (and not so easy) to pay with 0.00044779 Bitcoin for something like ads. That makes it much more suited for smaller payments. In that sense, Bitcoin can be compared more to a valuable material such as gold, with Dogecoin being more like a regular coin.
The strongest point of the currency however is its community. If you search for the Dogecoin, you will find it was based upon a meme. This might make you disqualify it, but honestly, the community behind it is the best behind any other cryptocoin, with people really believing in it instead of just being in it for a quick buck. Because it is such a familiar concept for something unfamiliar (a trick earlier performed by Apple, by putting a piece of fruit as logo for a hi-tech company) it attracts way more kinds of people to it than your regular, techie cryptocoin. This has caused the getting started guides to be the best of all coins, is evolving the tooling better than for any other coin (for example an Android app was released a while ago, unique for most cryptocoins but the very big ones), and has made marketing efforts sprout up here and there (such as Starcraft gamers playing against each other for Dogecoins). There's a momentum going on, and I think it's time for Dogecoin to take the next step.
So, to get to my point. It would be awesome if you guys could add Dogecoin as valid payment method to your Anonymous Ads. There's a big userbase behind it so there would be no worries about not getting anyone to use it; I can guarantee you'll even see a large influx of new customers paying with the coin.
It does require some kind of faith however from your side, as the value of any cryptocoin isn't fully stable right now. However, a move like this would be unprecedented, and as such will for sure make the value of the Dogecoin rise quite a bit, at the very least for the short term. This should make it quite a safe investment for you as well. Obviously the value could still plummet, but with more support will come more trust, and with more trust comes more support. We just need someone to take a leap of faith. I am asking you to take that leap of faith.
About the implementation,There are a few PSP solutions available such as https://www.dogeapi.com/ or https://www.moolah.ch, but you can make incorporate it, but some custom work would have to be done. The coin is based on the Bitcoin principle, so your system wouldn't have to change all that much, and plus, Dogecoin is just as Anonymous as Bitcoin!
Furthermore, for any questions or requests to the community, we are available here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogecoin. We are very happy to answer any questions, or to help you during implementation. I'm sure it could even be an option to recruit one of us as intern to build the implementation completely, if that would be an option for you.
This has been quite a long mail already. I hope you will consider taking up Dogecoin as real payment method on your website. It would give a great boost to the coin and to cryptocoins in general, and will help provide a real alternative for Bitcoins, which is currently really more for investors than for consumers.
Thank you so much for your time.
Best regards,

I suggest you shoot them an email too! This could be big for DogeCoin, as I don't see an ad service that supports it directly. 

Email them at contact@anonymousads.com!

To the Moon!

I don't know how or why but I just feel so pathetic and unhappy. I shouldn't be so negative. I know that I have to be positive. But I just can't. This, everything around me, even though I'm at a place where I thought it would make me happy two years ago, is not making me happy. Everything around me is boring. Nothing excites me. I'm so fucked up on the inside, but I don't know how to tell people that correctly. Maybe it's the stress or slow realization that I'm an impatient fuck up. I used to be passionate. I used to be motivated. I used to be a person with a purpose. Everything I did worked towards that purpose and it worked and I felt so happy and felt like I was achieving something great. I used to be confident yet humble about it because I never spoke of my successes or improvements to others. I knew I was happy with myself and that was all I cared about.

Then somehow, everything started going downhill. I can't exactly say when, but the confidence started to be replaced by my huge ego. I feel like the person that I NEVER wanted to be before. My confidence, I feel like, has hit rock bottom while my ego is hugely inflated. I was such a man before. I was proud of myself. But now, everything is a repetition and I am not happy. I was emotionally stable with just being me, but now I'm such a fuck up that I need someone and sometimes I'm so needy that I don't even recognize myself anymore.

I'm only a Sophomore in college and I've never been in love. I have commitment issues so I used to run away a lot. Around three months ago, I met a girl and we fell in love really fast. We went really in fast in the relationship too. She moved in and we lived together for about two months until she moved away for study abroad very recently. I think my roots of my problems started from her. Couple weeks before she left, we started to fight a lot. Even though we never explicitly said we were exclusive, we were in a serious relationship even though we knew our relationship had an expiration date. And then I started to question this whole thing. What if I'm being used? What if she doesn't really love me? Can I trust her? And such. They were extremely irrational looking back, but it was too late. We began to fight a lot and I admitted to her that I was dating someone else when we only began to see each other (ended with the other one very soon after). Then it just began to all fall apart and she started talking about how she really doesn't like me and started pointing out all my flaws. Then she left leaving things in a huge mess. 

Couple days later, I open my diary and finds that she read my diary. When I write, most of it is just emotional dump at any random days when I'm feeling whatever I'm feeling. I also find that she left a note at my diary that says 'stupid, if you love her, should've told her'. I thought about being mad at her, but realized that didn't achieve anything. But she has read my diary and seen me at my most vulnerable state. I think this experience is emotionally taxing me more than I admit. 

I only say that because I recently met another girl at a party and started seeing her. I absolutely hate defining relationships with people, especially with girls. I think emotions shouldn't have such clear lines when dealing with people especially romantically. But, on our second date, I asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship with me. What the fuck? What was I thinking? The past me would have NEVER done it.  And of course, she said no even though I knew she liked me somewhat. It was just too soon for either of us. I definitely wasn't ready for it. Later that night, I realized that I was the one that fucked up and that I should just let it go, but pathetically I later texted her 'don't talk about this to other people'. Really? I'm such a fucking pathetic person. Why couldn't I just man up and realized that I fucked up and got rejected and just let it be? I had to be a needy pathetic person that makes sure my failure goes unnoticed. 

I used to be happy with myself and these things would never faze me. I never got emotionally involved with anything and if it did, I ran away. But now, I care about my emotions and failure and it's fucking stupid and pathetic. Also, my life isn't fun. Everyone around me is moving forward with their lives with internships and boosting their resume when there is nothing new going on with my life. Go to classes, go to work. I know as soon as I'm done with this semester that I'm going to go traveling, but I don't know how much longer I can take. I hope I was as independent as I was just couple months ago. And I really hope I can find my passion and motivation again. I want that feeling of knowing what to do again. I want to smile every morning knowing that I have purpose again. Right now, that seems so hard and distant and it's killing me. I wish I could man the fuck up and make my family proud for being in a city all alone by myself. 

Sorry this was a terrible rant. I really know I shouldn't self-loath this much and this seems so pathetic and petty and negative, but I don't know how to stop it. And I really just wanted to get my story off somehow so here it is. "

1ws2jb,0,2014-02-01,How do I [24F] forgive my boyfriend [28M] for a lot of wrong doings?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ws2jb/how_do_i_24f_forgive_my_boyfriend_28m_for_a_lot/,"I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years. We met and started dating my last year of college. He was a returning student that needed to fulfill some prereqs for grad school. We are 4 years a part. To be honest I was in a relationship when we became close friends and when I started having feeling for him I broke it off with me ex before I did anything stupid like cheat. My close friends and people who knew him during his undergrad years warned me about him. Things were fine for a while. I caught him flirting with a girl through facebook and confronted him about it. I forgave him. After that most arguments were just about communication and still understand each other's personalities. I will admit I did do something wrong. I had a best guy friend (he has a girlfriend) who I would confide in when I need a guy's opinion. Some how we started talking about sex after I said that my bf and I were for some reason lacking in that department for a while. The conversations about sex started getting deeper and deeper and then i was actually caught. I stopped. I even stopped talking to my friend at all. By the way, to me sex is really important in a relationship. 

My bf is very into fitness and would always try to get me to workout before. The topic of us not having any activities in common was and issue. My close friends will tell you that you would not catch me in a gym or outside doing any physical activities. But then I saw a conversation between my bf and a friend saying that he didn't know if he loved me anymore. We don't do anything together and that I get jealous easily. It's true. I would get jealous when I would see him commenting and liking other girls' fitness photos. So what did I do? I gave in. Now I work out 4-5 days a week and my body has drastically changed. Did the sex get better? No. Mind you we don't live together, we actually live over an hour away from each other. But in the beginning after I graduated we had a lot of sex. And then it went down to maybe once a month. And honestly, if I could I would have sex everyday. I kept my mouth shut until i caught him 2 more times flirting with other girls on facebook. Then I had the idea of googling his most common username and what do I find? I find that he has accounts to online dating sites like Plenty of Fish and OK Cupid. That was really hard to take. I was freaking crushed. So of course I confronted him. His excuse was that he was just curious and bored. I told him how inadequate I feel and that maybe I just don't satisfy him anymore. He cried and apologized and said he would deactivate all of them. He even offered to give me the passwords to his facebook and email. I didn't ask for them because I was hoping he was would stop everything on his own.

 A few months later while we were in bed he got a text message from a girl whose name i recognized and asked about before. Months earlier he said she was a friend. This time she was a new intern at his work. So i called him out on lying. I confessed to lying but said the message was friendly. During our work out I asked him to prove it to me. Well he didn't so I took is phone and saw that their conversation was deleted and so was her number. ANYONE would assume that he deleted it because he's hiding the fact that it wasn't a ""friendly"" conversation. 

I forgave him again and along with threatening him to leave I also said that we were having major sex problems and that i needed more from him. After that sex wasn't an issue anymore. But something was still lingering in the back of my mind so I asked for the passwords. Boy! I found a lot of shit. I found a lot of those craigslist ads trying to meet with women. Now most of them were from before we started dating but DAMN. He's been doing it for the past 3 girlfriends. A part of me wants to contact them and ask if they knew. Anyways. We talked about it. He has a lot of issues he needs to take care of. He says needs me to get through these problems so he'll stop. But going though his emails I noticed he has other email accounts that he said he has deleted but my gut is telling me that they are still active. 

Despite ALL these negative things everything is fine. We enjoy each other most of the time. We are close to each others' families. We do a lot together ever since I started working out with him. It's just that I feel like I only have a grasp on one side of him and the other half I'm just finding out and it's not good. He keeps telling me that he will be more open with me. He'll make me happy. He says he doesn't want to lose me and that I am the one. Even asked him to move with him if he has to move out of state for grad school because he feels that if we are together everyday things would be different.

 My question to whoever reads this whole thing is should I confront him about the other emails or hope he's not using them for bad reasons and how should handle this? How do I make it clear to him? I love him a lot and I'm trying to make the positives out weigh the negatives. So breaking up with him is out of the question. We just need to move forward and things need to change. I did tell him though, that if he does anything like that again I will end it. But I just need advice on how to get through it.

I am in a high stress graduate level program working towards a degree in the medical field.  Last year when I quit it was right before finals and the high stress of work/school/losing my coping mechanism resulted in me grinding my teeth alot.  I ended up injuring a ligament so that I was in pretty bad pain all the time (these sort of injuries take about a month to resolve) which made studying super difficult.

I have been a heavy user of weed for ~6 years, hitting a bowl about every 3 hours all day, every day when not at school or at work. The only times I have quit since I started were last year for about 2 months and now.

 Quit again last week for the same reason, and while it feels much easier psychologically this time, I have already noticed I'm clenching my jaw alot, and starting to feel pain in my teeth again.  Ideas anyone?  Should I just suck it up and go to the doc for some anxiety meds?


Edit : thanks for your help everyone!  Gonna go see the doc once I can save up the money for a visit"

**What is a time you have had a conflict with a supervisor?**
( I have never really had a supervisor let alone a conflict with a supervisor so I am confused on how I could answer this. Would it be dumb to say something like ""fortunately I have never had a conflict with a supervisor but If i did this is how i would respond and act"" or should I try and come up with some specific event?

He eventually became my best friend and, after I had a messy break-up with my high school sweetheart, we started dating during sophomore year.

College was great, and we really didn't have many issues in our relationship.  During senior year, we tried to make sure our post-grad paths would keep us together.  He was starting grad school, and I was looking for a job, and we both managed to end up in the same city.  We lived together for a year, and it was great.  Sometimes we had minor arguments -- sometimes I wanted him to spend more time with me, sometimes I felt like we weren't physical enough in our relationship -- but we loved living together.

Then I decided to apply to grad school and ended up moving 12 hours away.  We talked about it, about how we would need to communicate really well, but how we were going to make it work.  By the time I moved, we had been together for 3.5 years, so I thought we had a strong foundation.  The end goal was to be together again -- and we talked about moving back together after we graduated.  It would be 2-3 years before we were in the same city again, but I thought we would make it.

Long-distance was really hard on me, and a lot less hard on him.  I didn't know anyone in my new city.  My grad program is very small, and I have had trouble making a solid group of friends.  Then my dog died about 1.5 months after I started school.  I just felt really lonely -- and I took it out on him.  I wanted to talk more, to video chat more, to text more -- and I guess he felt overwhelmed by it, and like he was always disappointing me.  But every time we saw each other in person -- the last time being 2 weeks ago -- we had a great time, and the distance seemed to me like a small thing we would get past.

Then, just a few hours ago, he broke up with me over the phone.  I am so lost and confused.  Just at the beginning of January, he told me he thought he was ""in it for the long haul.""  We had our share of problems and uneven expectations, but we didn't talk about breaking up over them.  This decision just seems so sudden, so I am having a lot of trouble accepting it.  After 4 years, I feel like he shouldn't just give up on a whim.  Like he owes it to our relationship to try a little longer, to try different things to make it work.  I had already booked flights to visit over spring break, and I was planning to visit him often during the summer around my internship dates.  Things were looking up, and I feel like he should have stuck it out a little longer to see how things progressed.  Maybe I am being unreasonable.

One of his good friends broke up with his GF of 4+ years just a few weeks ago, and the two of them have been hanging out a lot.  I feel like this friend might have influenced my BF's decision.  His friend told his GF that he didn't want to ""waste her time,"" and my BF used that exact same line.  He kept telling me that I deserved someone better, who could give me everything I wanted and who wouldn't hurt me all the time, and that he didn't want to waste more of my time than he already had.

It just seems like such BS reasons to break up with me.  Who is he to decide what I deserve?  Who is he to tell me that I am hurting too much as things are?  I feel like there is some underlying reason he is not telling me, or like we just had a rough day and he broke up with me on a whim.  I want him to reconsider.  But I don't want to be the crazy ex that is desperate to get him back... even though that is what I am.

He was my best friend, and I don't know what to do now.  I don't have many friends here.  All of my hobbies involved him.  I feel like this was such an unfair, unilateral decision... but I guess that's what break-ups are.  

I honestly thought we would be together forever.  We talked about it... where we wanted to live, how many children we each wanted, our views on family.  

I regret moving.  I regret pursuing my career over staying with him.  I was so proud of our relationship, that we could each strive to make ourselves better and do our own thing while staying together.  Now I'm questioning everything.  Was he just looking for an excuse to break up with me?  Did he ever really love me?  Why is he doing this?  How can I get him to change his mind?

Sorry to rant.  I don't know what to do.  It's hard to breathe, it's hard to think, it's impossible to sleep.  I feel so alone.

1wtcys,1,2014-02-02,"The one that got away. Just my story, not really asking for anything, but any advice is welcome. (Sorry in advance for the length)",buddy469,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wtcys/the_one_that_got_away_just_my_story_not_really/,"So I met this girl in high school. Let's call her Carrie. Carrie and I were involved in a lot of the same activities in school and had some classes together, so we saw a lot of each other. We didn't talk much Freshman year, we started talking more Sophomore year. 

I was best friends with her best friend, and the summer before junior year I talked to my best friend (call her Sandy) a lot. Carrie saw how much Sandy was talking to me and decided she wanted to talk to me too. So we started talking and started getting very close. She had a phone plan that caused her texting to eat up her minutes, and she would always use up those minutes very quickly because we were always talking. 

So Junior year started and I was infatuated with Sandy. I dated her once before and I really liked her again. Unfortunately for me, Sandy is a naturally flirtatious girl and unknowingly led me on and I just got hurt. Carrie, hated the way Sandy treated me and we started getting closer.

About two months into the school year, we both realized how much we liked each other. I remember one night I planned to drive her back from a Halloween party. She got there first, and she was constantly looking to the door hoping I would be there. Once I came there, we spent the whole night next to each other dancing and talking. It was a blast. When I drove her home I was playing a CD my band just finished recording, and I just casually sang my favorite love song to her. But anyways, that's all beside the point. We started dating soon after.

That was the beginning of the best relationship of my life. We talked all the time about anything and everything. On our first date we went to a local park and sat by the water, just talking about life and our morals and views on everything. It felt so natural, I was so comfortable around her. We had our first kiss before we left the park, and then we went to the circus. Honestly, that was one of the best nights of my life. 

That's basically what our relationship was like until the end of high school. We spent so much time together, made so many memories, it felt like nothing could keep us apart. 

Then it was time for college. We both went for very different things in college. Carrie is more science/math inclined, I'm more artistically inclined. The school I wanted to go to was about 1500 miles away from her school, which is only about a four hour drive from our hometown. Neither of us wanted to end our relationship simply due to the fact that we wouldn't be able to see each other, so we decided to give long-distance a try.

While the first year was hard, with a lot of ups and downs, our love never wavered. We stayed strong even in our weakest moments. There was a lot of crying on both sides. We missed each other like crazy, and were just counting down the days until we'd be back together for the summer.

Well we made it to the summer, and it was perfect. It was like we had never left. Both of us were a little worried that we had changed and things between us wouldn't be the same, but that wasn't the case. We spent almost every day together all summer. Going to zoos, her family reunion, just having so much fun and making so many memories. By the end of the summer, we were more in love than we ever had been.

Because of the way our schools work, her semester starts about two weeks before mine does. So I was at home with my parents while she was at school. 

During her second semester (of the first year) Carrie got really into swing dancing. She went every Friday, and Saturday for a while. She went out dancing until 4am the night before she said she would drive back to see me off on the plane back to school. She left at 7am, on about three hours of sleep, and wound up getting into a really bad car accident on the way home. Somehow, she came out of the accident unscathed. Everybody said she should be dead, but someone, somehow must have been watching over her. 

We still wound up seeing each other that day and slept in each others' arms that night. Something we always dreamt about doing, and it was so special. It was a great day for us despite everything that happened. 

We cried at the airport as we said our ""see ya laters"" (we didn't like saying goodbye), but we were very optimistic about the upcoming year since we had already done it before (and she bought plane tickets to come visit me over winter break!!). 

Before her accident, she met this guy (we'll say Mark) at a blues dance. He was very outgoing, very forward (at least from what my friends told me), but he was married, so I didn't have too much of a problem with it. He did sound creepy to me (He googled Carrie's name and found her address and other things about her), but Carrie assured me it was just the way he was. He wasn't creepy. 

I still had concerns that I voiced, but she was free to do as she wished and started spending a lot of time with him. One time, they went to a dance that was an hour or so outside of the city she lived, and her and Mark stayed at some friends house for the dance. On that trip, Mark told Carrie that he was in an open relationship with his wife. He was free to date and be intimate with whomever he wanted outside of his marriage. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that life style, people live how they want to live, but with how much time Carrie was spending with him, I just got a really bad feeling.

Now for a little about my situation for the first month. I lived off-campus this year with three of my friends. The people that rented the place before us were absolute slobs and left the place disgusting. Our landlord didn't do anything about it. So the first two weeks coming home from school, all my roommates and I did was clean the apartment. It was really stressful when all I wanted to do was relax from my really long days, but I couldn't because the place was that revolting.

On top of school I also took on a part-time job and an internship. I was way too ambitious. 18-credit hours, 15 hours a week job, an internship that took up seven hours of my Saturday, and being a music major, I had to find time to practice and do homework on top of everything. I was stressed out to the max. I would come home and just sit for like an hour every day, just trying to relax. (I quit my job after three weeks).

I wanted to confide in Carrie about all of this (what one would naturally do in this situation) but she wasn't really there. She would cancel our Skype calls, she wouldn't call me before bed, and she wouldn't even text me if she was around anyone. I felt really alone.

All this time that she wasn't really there for me, she was spending time with Mark. Going sailing, watching movies, dancing, he was always asking her to hang out. And Carrie, recovering from a potential fatal event, just wanted to live life and have fun, so she took all the opportunities to hang out with him. 

As time went on, she became more and more distant. There were days we never even talked on the phone and only sent a few texts here and there. The fact that she was leaving me alone and spending all this time with another guy started eating away at me. I felt like something was going on that she wasn't telling me, but she was such a pure, innocent girl that I couldn't actually believe anything was happening.

A couple weeks before our 3-year anniversary, she told me she started having romantic feelings for Mark. I was really upset. She said she would distance herself from him until her feelings subsided, she really didn't want to lose one of her best friends. Well she never really distanced herself, and that made me jealous and angry. A few times I toyed with the idea of breaking up with her because of the way she was acting, but couldn't bring myself to do it because I loved her and she promised me she would distance herself.

In November, she finally said she would distance herself, and it seemed like she really was. She said her feelings for him were diminishing and she was seeing him as just a friend. So they started to hang out more again. I was stupid, and I let the problem eat away at me. I would ask her probing questions because I couldn't understand how the woman I loved fell for another man. It consumed me and I exhausted her with these questions.

In the weeks leading up to her trip to come visit, she told me she had started losing romantic feelings for me. I was devastated. I took a lot of time to think, and I apologized for everything I had done and told that I trusted her because she had given me no reason not to trust her. She didn't seem very moved by this, she seemed indifferent. 

We hoped things would get better when we saw each other when she came up. They didn't really. Every night I could feel that she didn't love me the same way she used to, and I would talk about it. Staying up late with conversations that she really did not want to have. There were some good moments, but overall it was not a good trip. When we got home, things seemed to be a little better. We went to the places we always used to go, reminiscing and having some laughs.

Then she went back to school, and the first thing she does is see Mark. He winds up spending the next 3 days with her, never going home, just sleeping on her couch.

I went up to see her for the week before I left. At some point we had a fight about Mark (she told me she still had strong feelings for him and was sexually attracted to him) and all this, I told her to stop toying with me and I stormed off. She came and found me a while later and we talked in her car. She wanted another chance and I told her this was the very last one.

The next day, I met her in between one of her classes and I told her that the second chance comes with one condition, I get full disclosure on everything that happened between her and Mark. She was crying and ashamed, but she told me she had been cheating on me for two months now.

1wtdsv,0,2014-02-02,(22M) I'm in love with my (22f) gf but I'm also attracted to another girl,anonymous19992,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wtdsv/22m_im_in_love_with_my_22f_gf_but_im_also/,"I've been in a relationship with my amazing girlfriend for 4 years. We met when we were in high school. After the first 1 and a half years, we left our home town for college, each in a different city, but remained in a long distance relationship, trying to see each other as often as we could (every 3 weeks, on average).

Despite the physical distance, we got closer together during college. We understand each other really well, which is a rare thing for both of us, being that we are so driven to be great in our profession, which has taken a toll on our social lives. We are both determined to become financially secure before committing our lives to someone, probably because we both felt the difficulty in having to live without it in our childhood. We talk on the phone every day, discuss everything from how our day was to philosophy or science, and so I go as far as to say that intellectually, we are a match made in heaven.

We started being physically intimate about a year ago, which brought our relationship to a whole new level. Needless to say, when we get to see each other, we go at it like we're insatiable. She was my first sexual partner and I know I was her first too, although I never asked. So this is yet another department where we are perfect for each other. Did I mention I think she's beautiful? (even with clothes on *cough*)


So everything is perfect in our relationship. **Right? Well, not really.** The first problem is we expect to be together after she graduates, and given that she's in medical school, that'll be in 3 and a half more years. I knew that when we started this, but after 2 and a half years, I miss her like crazy. What's worse, because I choose to focus on getting the best education I can and go to internships in the summer, and so on, my social skills are fairly poor. As a result, I often feel lonely, and this is eating away my happiness. I know I would be happy with this woman if I would end up marrying her. But, when you meet someone else you're attracted to, who can actually be with you when you want to see them, it starts to feel like this is a steep price to pay.


---


So here's the other story: I met this other girl, in the city where I study, about a year ago. We clicked instantly, and we went on some walks together, and talked about everything our minds could grasp. One day, she invites me to the theater. At that point, I started to get a fuzzy feeling about there being more emotions between us than I knew what to do with (remember, I was in a relationship at the time). But I went to see that play with her, as I felt great while spending time with her, and hoped we could see each other and be friends.

I was actually beginning to notice I was attracted to her, but decided I would just ignore that, because I didn't want to lose the great time I discovered I could have. That night ended up feeling like a date. We never even touched hands, but we didn't have to. It was enough to look into each other's eyes to feel the tension. 


So I walk her home, like any self respecting man would do. Then, as I get home, I get her message saying she like me, and would like to be more than friends, but that she understands that I am in a relationship, and if I don't feel the same for her, she would like us to at least continue to be friends. **BOOM! Bomb dropped.** What do I do now? Foolishly imagining that we could actually continue to be friends, I tell her that I don't feel the same way. **Even though I did. Why, you ask? Because I was afraid. Afraid of hurting my girlfriend, afraid something that started with more passion than I ever felt could last.** This is not to say that I know now I should have behaved differently back then. I still love my girlfriend. I don't know if that would have made me happier. I guess I never will.


Long story short, the next time we saw each other was extremely awkward, conversation felt forced, and slowly got to the point of no contact. I still thought about her every once in a while, but didn't want to hurt her by reminding her of me. We saw each other again one time when we were going out with a group of friends. I found out that she was in a relationship, said I was happy for her, and got out of there as soon as I could.


---


A few days ago, I started thinking about her again. She is still in that relationship, but because almost a year has passed since that night, and we haven't talked in 6 months, I decided to talk to her again. Who knows? Maybe she's happy in her relationship, so much so that we could be friends again. So I did. We talked on Facebook for a while, got updates on what each of us is up to, and felt like there was no awkwardness anymore. Yay!

I'll be leaving the country in a few months, for my graduate studies. I asked her to get together sometime, before I leave, as I feel this might be the last time we'll have the chance. She seemed to love the idea.

I'm not sure, at this point, that I still want to fight for my relationship with my girlfriend. I think we're perfect for each other, and I love her, but this is hurting me. **I know that breaking up with her would be something I would always think about with regret, even if I would find someone else to be happy with.** I am actually considering sharing all this with the other girl. Including the fact that I actually was attracted to her, and that I was still thinking about how nice the little time we spent together was.

Now, I'm facing you, dear redditer, to ask for your opinion. What do you think I should do, both in my relationship and on my (probably last) meeting with the other girl?

**TL;DR;** : I'm in a 4 years long LDR with a girl I love, but my infatuation with another girl didn't go away even after we had no contact for 6 months.

1wtfvh,469,2014-02-02,Shibe-onomics Vol. 1,[deleted],dogecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wtfvh/shibeonomics_vol_1/,"Dear Dogecoin community!

I am writing this post in the aftermath of a momentous decision by the devs and the last /u/GoodShibe post regarding the future of Dogecoin. I am fairly certain that some of you will be a bit confused by the discussion about deflation and what it means for the future of Dogecoin. After seeing so many helpful posts here, I was thinking about how I could contribute more to the subreddit and provide a service to my fellow shibes. That's why I decided to start a small series about economics to give you at least a glimpse into what economists are actually talking about. Not all of this will be related to currencies, in fact I would like to also talk a lot about the topics that are maybe seen as more peripheral. However, I hope that you will find it interesting and maybe learn a thing or two.

About me:

I'm an economics grad and about to start my PhD thesis. I have a Bachelor in Economics and a Master in Quantitative Economics. I have been able to apply my education in the real world during internships in Geneva at the German embassy, where I helped formulate the German proposal to reform the WHO and at an institute here in Germany where I cowrote a policy paper on behavioral economics as well as cowrote a study on macroeconomic scenarios for a major insurance company. If you are interested, I have produced a few episodes of a podcast on the basics of economics with a friend between my bachelor and master, so if you liked this post you can listen to me blabbering [here](http://econcast.libsyn.com/). Please also excuse my language mistakes and pronunciation, I'm not a native speaker and it was sometimes not that easy to keep the pace easy to listen to :)

___

Enough with the formalities, now on to the good stuff!

Let's talk about money!

Since cryptocurrencies have the currency right in their name, it stands to reason that they are intended to be used as money. A succinct definition of money is the first sentence of the money article on wikipedia: 
___

""Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given socio-economic context or country-""
___

This is a very broad definition that lacks some important properties, but it is a start. The most important point of this definition is in the words ""generally accepted"". Money as a medium of exchange functions all the better the more people accept your money as payment. This makes intuitive sense. If we had something we intended to use as money, but we were unable to actually exchange this in economic transactions because it were not widely accepted, it would be useless for its intended function. As you can see already, we have hit upon a key factor dogecoin has going for it: It has a high rate of adoption and steady growth in users. This means that more and more people are trying out dogecoin. This also means more and more people are willing to ACCEPT dogecoin, which is even more important than having dogecoin. The exchange of doge for goods and services is what makes dogecoin ""money"".Exchanging dogecoin for USD or any other currency would be using doge as a commodity.

But the definition is still too broad, because there are also other things you can exchange for goods and services, such as labor! Instead, we can look at the second sentence of the definition:

___

The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally in the past, a standard of deferred payment. Any kind of object or secure verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered money.
___

Now we're getting somewhere! Let's ignore the point about the ""standard of deferred payment"" for now and focus on the first three properties:

* A medium of exchange

This is already contained in the first sentence, but we can try to make it a bit more clear: Money has to be able to be exchanged for anything that has economic value. If you have debt, you pay it back with money, if you want someone to do something for you and he doesn't want to do it for free, you can offer him money in exchange for his service. If you want to acquire something from someone else, you can exchange it for money. 

Money has an intermediary and smoothing function in economic transactions. It allows us to convert our time, labor, electricity, ingenuity, ideas and actions into a commonly used item, which we can then exchange for things we want.

This is extremely important for economies to function! Traditionally, people think that the evolution of markets goes from 

1. Gift economy, an economic system only feasible in tightly knit group where economic exchange is based on reciprocity and the enforcement of adherence to this system by societal pressure.

2. Barter economy, an economic system where goods are directly traded by participants (i.e. a shovel for five sacks of wheat)

3. Monetary economy, an economic system where goods and services are first exchanged to the intermediary form of money, which can then be used to acquire other goods and service.

The problem with the 2nd step, the barter economy is twofold: First, we have a problem called the ""double-coincidence of wants"". This is relatively easy to understand and a tremendous source of friction in this fictional type of economy. Imagine you are a blacksmith: You have just finished an expensive tool, for example an axe. In order to live, however, you need food and you want to trade the axe with the farmer next door for food. The farmer, however doesn't really have a use for an expensive axe and no trade can be made. He suggests, however, that you should ask the lumberjack, he will surely have a need for a fine axe. When you get to the lumberjack, he loves your axe, but all he can trade you for it is wood, which you have no need for. You could of course trade the axe for wood, trade the wood with the carpenter etc. until you can finally trade for food, but the tedium and inconvenience I think has become clear.

Money solves this problem because it serves as a common standard, a channel if you will, through which economic actions can be funneled. This is also why barter economies have never really existed outside of thought experiments, the ""transaction costs"" (I'll talk about these soon!) are just too high.

Which brings us to the second point:

* A unit of account

Money as a unit of account makes immediate sense and we do it all the time. This allows money to actually function as a medium of exchange. Something that is inherently related to this property is what we call ""divisibility"" and ""fungibility"". Divisibility is pretty self-explanatory, but nevertheless important: Money needs to have enough divisibility in order to be used for small as well as large economic transactions. Dogecoin of course has almost infinite divisibility, as there is no diminished use of 1 * 1000 Doge or 100,000* 0.01 Doge. Think about the example beforehand: an axe can't be divided up into smaller parts in order to make multiple small transactions.

Fungibility is a related concept. All units of the money should have the same value. This is why diamonds can't be considered money, because their properties and value differ wildly depending on a host of factors. however, every doge is exactly like any other. 

This means that money as a unit can be used to describe the price of every economic interaction. It can be used like any other unit and it denotes ""value"". Important for this function is that there is some relative stability. This is a key point that will continue to be important for cryptocurrencies, because they are still rarely used as a true unit of account. Instead, they are usually instantly converted to fiat, or prices are set on the current exchange rate for that cryptocurrency.

Doge is starting to move away from this already, in the subreddits /r/dogeservice and /r/dogecoinbusiness, where prices are set in doge. 

Now on to the last point 

*  A store of value

The use as a store of value is incredibly important for the use of money. Money does not only act as an intermediary to alleviate the ""double-coincidence of wants"" in the spacial sense, but also in a temporal sense! Most people have something called a ""time-preference"", which means that we rate things not only in their sense of economic worth and the utility, but also when we will get that utility. Money as a store of value allows us to pool the rewards of multiple transactions so that we may use them in a bigger transaction in the future. This is why perishable things are not very suitable as money, because they are not good at storing value long-term. Storing value in the form of money allows people to invest, and it allows the development of lending money.

This property is there for every cryptocurrency, as long as people are able to exchange it back into fiat. It's also true for other financial assets, such as real estate, commodities, art, precious stones, etc.

As you can already tell, these things are great stores of value, however they lack the other properties of money, instead, they are assets.


Considering these three core properties, where does that leave us? In my opinion, Dogecoin is doing great in the most important category for any cryptocoin: Being a medium of exchange. If we continue to see these high adoption numbers, I believe the future is indeed,

           the moon!

I know these are the very basics, but only if we all understand what makes money money, can we have an informed discussion about things like deflation, inflation, fiat money, intrinsic value, etc."

About 25-35 hours go to a part-time job I need to pay for my living expenses in college, and 15 hours go to an internship I got this semester for a company I have been wanting to work with for a long while. I'm only one month into the internship, and one of my bosses already recommended me to a full-time position that has been recently created in the company. I've been tired, but I'm feeling good.

This past week has been especially stressful, so I was very much looking forward to yesterday, my first non-work day in two weeks. That morning, my best friend invited me to go shopping later in the afternoon. However, there was a miscommunication, and I arrived at the mall earlier than she anticipated and was left waiting for 45 minutes. When I called, she said she was still at home, and I snapped at her for wasting my time on my first free day in weeks. She apologized, but I had trouble holding my temper in check. I didn't completely blow up on her, but I said some choice words I would not have said in hindsight. We didn't hang out yesterday, and I spent all yesterday watching TV and eating snacks alone.

It took me the entire Saturday to calm down, which surprised me. Normally, I have a gentle temperament. I've been complimented by others — including my best friend — for my patience. I exercise regularly, eat relatively healthy, and get solid 8 hours of sleep. I have been fatigued lately though with all the work. 

I'm disappointed with how I let my emotions boil over to my best friend. I texted her a long apology letter last night, explaining my point of view and that regardless how fatigued I am, the way I acted was inexcusable. She hasn't responded yet (I'm letting her take her time). But I want to know I how can avoid these situations in the future.  What measures can I take to de-stress? What would you recommend? "

I work out three-four times a week, I have a decent GPA, internships, close friends, family, and life is looking good. But I know I can do better. At least that what I keep telling myself.

This semester, my earliest classes start at 10:30AM. I told myself I'd wake up early and go to the gym on my way to class. That failed after day two, when I started telling myself I'd just sleep in later, go to the gym in the evening, and go to bed later. Of course I never end up studying at night so that never works. 

Ok, so suppose I go to the gym in the evening. That works, in fact I've been doing that. Great. But as I'm writing this, it's the afternoon and I haven't started studying yet, even though I have two midterms coming right up. I just spent the entire day in my room refreshing /r/videos wondering why there's nothing left to entertain me on the internet. 

Every few days, walking to school, I'll give myself a pep talk. Today's the day! Not like all those other times. This time is *different*. I'll honestly believe myself. Then it starts over.

I'm scared that this endless cycle is just part of who I am. I'm scared that it will just continue on forever and define my life. *Oh yeah him, he spends his days laying around, but still gets things done and seems pretty happy*. 

Sleeping in/oversleeping. I sleep like 9 hours a night - it's gotten to the point where I'll just go to bed early to avoid work, telling myself I'll do it first thing in the morning (future me won't). Procrastination. Constant motivational cycles. Laying around wasting away. I have important books I want to read, I have programming I want to learn, career aspirations, and interesting classes to study. An outsider will think I'm really occupied, which I am during work hours at school (very involved - a friend just the other day asked me how I managed to keep up with everything), but at home, nothing happens. I'll only start working when the deadline is right in from of me.

Alarms across the room, glasses of water in the morning, thinking about future/past me, poor results on exams, pep talks, none of them woke me up figuratively or literally.

How can I get out of this for real, once and for all, and regain control of myself?"
1wubig,2,2014-02-02,Completely overwhelmed by depression and anxiety,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1wubig/completely_overwhelmed_by_depression_and_anxiety/,"
I am a 23-year-old recent graduate, unemployed, living at home and suffering from crippling anxiety/depression. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression in the past, but never in my life has it been so debilitating. If it’s worth anything, I have also had a history with disorder eating and self-harm.

Anyway, I graduated from university back in may at the top of my class (4.0 GPA, excellent rapport with all my professors who keep urging me to become a professor myself, completed an 60 paged honors thesis, etc.) with a seemingly useless degree (French literature). I knew my degree wouldn't really qualify me for much in the “real world”, so I made sure to get some work experience under my belt before leaving school (I interned at a major magazine in NYC, worked part time in a restaurant, wrote for the student newspaper, tutored on the side and occasionally worked as a volunteer ESL instructor at an adult school). 

Maybe all of this seems like a lot, but I know I would have been capable of doing so much more had anxiety not impeded me. I took ""safe"" risks that look good on paper and were somewhat within my comfort zone. Despite having many “what if” and “wouldn’t it be cool to” thoughts blooming in my mind, I sheltered myself, engaging only in actives I was 100% sure I could do. If ever there was a question of failure or discomfort, I ran. 

Thanks to this mentality, I avoided many things. Anxiety prevented me from ever living on campus or getting involved with student actives I was interested in or curious about ( improv theatre/comedy troupes, poetry clubs, alternate spring breaks); Ever attending a ""real"" college party;  Ever making friends/ reaching out to people; Ever participating in a full-year abroad (instead I spent the summer abroad because it was “safer”) and taking care of my health (I always told myself that grades were the most important, so I never really put a lot of effort into my anxiety/ eating disorder recovery even though I did seek some help from the university behavioral department when things got particularly difficult).

I realize that I graduated with many successes; however, I have many, many many more regrets than anything else. Currently it seems as if everything I’ve ignored over the years have come back to haunt me with a vengeance ever since I graduated.

For example, in September I attempted to chase my dream of living and working abroad for a few months (in a way it was to see if I could do more than a safe summer abroad). To be fair, the whole situation was a major undertaking considering a) I had never lived away from home longer than the month and a half I studied abroad and b) I took myself off of my medication before leaving because acquiring the medicine while abroad would have been a really messy process. Anyway, I wound up having a complete nervous breakdown when I was there, crying hysterically in my room whenever I got home from work. 
Additionally, the simplicity of transportation (I could basically walk or take a bus/train anywhere I needed to go. This freedom was relatively new for me, since I don't drive here in the USA so it's more difficult to get to the store) made it so I could acquire binge food absolutely anytime I wanted with minimal effort. Needless to say, I wasted a lot of time and money stuffing my face with sugary treats in order to blunt my feelings of fear and inadequacy. I constantly felt disgusting, uncomfortable and desperate.

I remained abroad for about two months before coming home. I had to make up some terrible excuse to my employer, and I know I let a lot of people down. Most days I wonder if I should have just stayed and pushed through the negativity, Everyday the regret of wasting that opportunity and of taking the ""easy"" way out consumes me and I feel like an utter loser. It humiliates me when I have to explain to people why I came home early, and what the next steps in my life are.

Ever since I came home life seems to be in a downward spiral.  I barely leave my room, and binge eat almost every single day. I feel terrified for the future because I have no idea what I want or if I can even hold down a job. I want a job, I want to contribute to society but I feel overwhelmed by the amount of things I want to accomplish, and the thought of picking ""one path"" feels suffocating and sends me into a panic. Aside from sending out a few resumes here and there (the easy part --- its the follow-up and the settling-in that terrifies me), I can't get myself to do any productive during the day due the fear/anxiety of not being able to accomplish it all.

Every day I feel more and more behind my peers. Most days I even feel significantly behind my brother who is a high school sophomore. In many ways, I still feel like the lost high school girl I was years ago, except now much more is demanded of me, and it feels much less acceptable to ask for help when I’m drowning.

Recently a local grocery store hired me for part time help, but after three days my anxiety got so bad I just stopped showing up. I haven't contacted the grocery store and they haven't contacted me. Chances are I won't even go in to collect my check for the three days of work. I was also interviewed for an internship position at a pretty awesome company, but I stopped responding to e-mails once I knew they might actually hire me. I felt like I couldn't handle the pressure, and I backed down to avoid disappointing the company. 

I'm so tired of anxiety ruling my life. I don't want to make decisions based on fear anymore, but sometimes it becomes so unbearable that I can't even imagine acting or reacting in any other way. Panic screams into my ear, and I listen because sometimes it’s the only thing I can hear. The threat feels so real, and I almost gladly hand over my dreams for a false promise of safety. 

My question to you all is how do I fix this? How do I stop myself from becoming a recluse or from being comfortable with running away all the time?

 Do I deal with my anxiety first before tackling other issues (i.e. finding a job)? How do you chase dreams and thrive in a competitive world when you can't even compete with the thoughts racing in your own mind?

I've been scanning the subreddit for a while and seen cold wallets being discussed fairly frequently. Dogecoin has taken over my life as well and I have wanted to be involved in the community in a practical way from day one. My hardwired fear of failure always stops me from really seeing anything through.  I'm sick of getting in my own way, I hate it and I think I need your help to see this through.

I've found a potential plastic card printer in the UK to create a plastic wallet to gift to people or keep as an offline wallet.  I feel like [this card design](http://www.e-plasticcard.co.uk/plastic_card/images/2_part_snap_off_cards.jpg) offers an advantage over a standard dogecoin card. The designs I've seen so far have both the private and public key on the same card, rendering it insecure. My example card design allows for the private key to be printed on the small snap-off card. The private key can then be discarded or stored separately once used, leaving the main card for day to day use.

While I'd love to just charge into this idea headlong, a few personal obstacles stand in my way:

*I have no design experience.  I literally do not possess a creative bone in my body!

*I do not fully understand how to bulk generate keys, private keys and QR codes and how to export them accurately into a share-able format.

*Even if I do work out bulk address generation, how will I get that information to the printers?  Will printing highly individualized cards like this be cost-effective?

*Creation of a fully functional website to handle selling wallets.  I've dipped my toe into Wordpress and built a basic site on there before. I know HTML and web fundamentals. but putting in a payment processor, conditional redirects and handling shipping and queries? It fills me with dread! 

So I'm putting myself out there to the community with my little seed of an idea. 

If someone wants to take it and run with it, super! I've helped in my own little way. 

If you feel like giving me some pointers, smashing! 

If you have the generosity to take me under your wing as an intern and mentor me while you work on this yourself?...well shit, I'd love you forever.

So there you go. What do you think? any advice will be well received.

I took ""safe"" risks that look good on paper and were somewhat within my comfort zone. Despite having many “what if” and “wouldn’t it be cool to” thoughts blooming in my mind, I sheltered myself, engaging only in actives I was 100% sure I could do. If ever there was a question of failure or discomfort, I ran.
Thanks to this mentality, I avoided many things. Anxiety prevented me from ever living on campus or getting involved with student actives I was interested in or curious about ( improv theatre/comedy troupes, poetry clubs, alternate spring breaks); Ever attending a ""real"" college party; Ever making friends/ reaching out to people; Ever participating in a full-year abroad (instead I spent the summer abroad because it was “safer”) and taking care of my health (I always told myself that grades were the most important, so I never really put a lot of effort into my anxiety/ eating disorder recovery even though I did seek some help from the university behavioral department when things got particularly difficult).
I realize that I graduated with many successes; however, I have many, many many more regrets than anything else. Currently it seems as if everything I’ve ignored over the years have come back to haunt me with a vengeance ever since I graduated.
For example, in September I attempted to chase my dream of living and working abroad for a few months (in a way it was to see if I could do more than a safe summer abroad). To be fair, the whole situation was a major undertaking considering a) I had never lived away from home longer than the month and a half I studied abroad and b) I took myself off of my medication before leaving because acquiring the medicine while abroad would have been a really messy process. Anyway, I wound up having a complete nervous breakdown when I was there, crying hysterically in my room whenever I got home from work. Additionally, the simplicity of transportation (I could basically walk or take a bus/train anywhere I needed to go. This freedom was relatively new for me, since I don't drive here in the USA so it's more difficult to get to the store) made it so I could acquire binge food absolutely anytime I wanted with minimal effort. Needless to say, I wasted a lot of time and money stuffing my face with sugary treats in order to blunt my feelings of fear and inadequacy. I constantly felt disgusting, uncomfortable and desperate.
I remained abroad for about two months before coming home. I had to make up some terrible excuse to my employer, and I know I let a lot of people down. Most days I wonder if I should have just stayed and pushed through the negativity, Everyday the regret of wasting that opportunity and of taking the ""easy"" way out consumes me and I feel like an utter loser. It humiliates me when I have to explain to people why I came home early, and what the next steps in my life are.
Ever since I came home life seems to be in a downward spiral. I barely leave my room, and binge eat almost every single day. I feel terrified for the future because I have no idea what I want or if I can even hold down a job. I want a job, I want to contribute to society but I feel overwhelmed by the amount of things I want to accomplish, and the thought of picking ""one path"" feels suffocating and sends me into a panic. Aside from sending out a few resumes here and there (the easy part --- its the follow-up and the settling-in that terrifies me), I can't get myself to do any productive during the day due the fear/anxiety of not being able to accomplish it all.
Every day I feel more and more behind my peers. Most days I even feel significantly behind my brother who is a high school sophomore. In many ways, I still feel like the lost high school girl I was years ago, except now much more is demanded of me, and it feels much less acceptable to ask for help when I’m drowning.
Recently a local grocery store hired me for part time help, but after three days my anxiety got so bad I just stopped showing up. I haven't contacted the grocery store and they haven't contacted me. Chances are I won't even go in to collect my check for the three days of work. I was also interviewed for an internship position at a pretty awesome company, but I stopped responding to e-mails once I knew they might actually hire me. I felt like I couldn't handle the pressure, and I backed down to avoid disappointing the company.
I'm so tired of anxiety ruling my life. I don't want to make decisions based on fear anymore, but sometimes it becomes so unbearable that I can't even imagine acting or reacting in any other way. Panic screams into my ear, and I listen because sometimes it’s the only thing I can hear. The threat feels so real, and I almost gladly hand over my dreams for a false promise of safety.
My question to you all is how do I fix this? How do I stop myself from becoming a recluse or from being comfortable with running away all the time?
Do I deal with my anxiety first before tackling other issues (i.e. finding a job)? How do you chase dreams and thrive in a competitive world when you can't even compete with the thoughts racing in your own mind?

I'm new to this and read the rules, but if any of this is wrong, I apologize in advance. 

I submitted my federal refund on TurboTax, and then I was notified that the IRS had received it. Meanwhile, I got another W2 from an internship (it was a busy year and I forgot). So I went online to fix it, but my return (and my status on wheresmyrefund.irs.gov) is only reflecting the original form I submitted. I really don't want to have to mail off my taxes if possible and TurboTax hasn't been able to give me an answer. From what I gather, you can update the changes but have to wait for the IRS to reject your form (which I presume they will do since it didn't reflect all my employment) and then resubmit-hopefully online again without having to pay an additional fee. 

Any ideas on how to fix this? Thank you in advance. "

1wut34,3,2014-02-02,[23F] Not sure where things are going with my ex[24M] from 4 years ago,yaweighyoself2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wut34/23f_not_sure_where_things_are_going_with_my_ex24m/,"Hey all. I dated this guy my sophomore year of college for about eight months, and while it was my shortest relationship so far, it was probably my most serious in terms of long-term vision. Being 19-20, neither of us were experts at relationships (we drank and fought a fair bit, I crossed some emotional boundaries with a friend who was pursuing me, I was uncomfortable with him mentioning kids/marriage, etc).

We had a really awful breakup at the end of it all that left me a bit of an emotional wreck. We didn't talk for over 3 years - total blocking on all platforms, avoiding or ignoring each other at events with mutual friends, the whole shebang. Since then, I've had a serious relationship with one of his close friends; he dated a girl he met abroad long-distance for over a year and had quite a few flings. We both became relatively accomplished in our related fields but never interacted, and I never expected to speak to him again.

Fast forward to November. We now attend grad school 200ish miles apart. I have many friends in his current city, intern with an agency there, visit relatively often, and am moving there after graduate school (~1 year away). I drove up for a mutual friend's birthday party and he happened to show up. He told my friend he needed a few more drinks to talk to me. Friend is dickishly giggling about playing matchmaker, so of course he passes on the message. As you might expect, my ex and I eventually break 3 years of silence and I wake up in his apartment the next morning.

Turns out he's been seriously struggling with depression for years. Some aspects of our breakup seem related to its initial manifestation. Since then, we've texted constantly. I've visited twice. Last time I left (2 weeks ago), we hammered out specific issues that might prevent us from having a successful round two relationship and agreed on a roadmap for working on them. I'm a bit apprehensive about getting involved with someone who is depressed; he's concerned that I would have issues with the number of women he's been with since we first dated (not true, really, though he's friendly with all of his exes which I do find a bit strange); he doesn't think he's ""smart enough or good enough for me"" (which I adamantly disagree with). 

We've talked about all the above - don't worry - and have agreed to take the wait-and-see approach. He's said that his plan is to keep on talking often, see each other once or twice a month, and to wait and see if he falls in love with me again. That sounds good to me, and I know that's how building relationships normally goes. He also doesn't want to shut down all other options while we're figuring this stuff out. That's totally understandable given our distance and uncertainty and makes logical sense to me; however, I'm reluctant to invest time in visiting him if he's considering other people. I know I'll have to get over that if this is going to grow, so I'm working on it.

Reddit, I have the feels for this dude. He's attractive and smart and hardworking, his family provides what mine lacks, he'd be a great dad, we want similar things in life, he is goofy and irreverent, and we'd make a crazy power couple. I know he's a little bonkers but I think I'd be good for him. I know he likes me, but I'm fucking terrified to let my feels grow after getting so hurt last time. I know he's also scared of that. So, questions: 1) Does this have any potential whatsoever? 2) Are there any blatant red flags that I'm not seeing or acknowledging? 3) If not, how do I chill the fuck out and let this thing run its course without sabotaging it out of fear and trepidation? 

---   
Tl;dr - Have become mid-distance complicated friends with an ex from 3-4 years ago. We've grown up a lot, I enjoy his company, he has some issues, we're working on the hard stuff. Are there any red flags I'm not spotting? If not, how do I calm down and enjoy the ride?"
1wv4p2,18,2014-02-02,Me [22 F] and my husband [26 M] are newlyweds struggling with the money and my husband's irresponsible behavior and defensive attitude when I address our money issues is really pissing me off. How do communicate my feelings in a non-hurtful way?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wv4p2/me_22_f_and_my_husband_26_m_are_newlyweds/,"My husband and I have been married for nearly six months, but we’ve known each other since we were children and we dated for five years before getting married.  Like most newlywed couples, we’ve been trying to work out a balance and partnership that plays off of our strengths and weaknesses.  Unfortunately, my husband’s major weakness is in being responsible – namely with money.  I’m not saying he spends recklessly or gambles, but he doesn’t plan ahead any farther than a week with money.  If he has it, then he uses it and if not, then he struggles.

Life has been dealing both of us some harsh blows and I’ve tried my best to stand by him as his wife and support him through it.  We discovered last year that he is getting deployed to Afghanistan.  Then he moved away temporarily because the job prospects were better back in our home town than in the town I live in (I am finishing college).   But the job he got was only paying him slightly above minimum wage ($8/hour).   He was living with his brother and paying rent for the apartment we leased (we split the rent).  However, that was up until this October when the shit hit the fan.  My husband’s car broke down and his sister stole his mother’s debit card and essentially cleaned her bank account out and my husband gave his mom money to get by until her next paycheck.  

I, however, was left stranded without any of my husband’s income for two months because he couldn’t pay his share of rent.  I managed to pay nearly $1250 over two months while going to school and working two part-time jobs.  He offered to pay me back the next month but I refused because he didn’t have enough money to pay me the full amount and him paying me back would’ve bankrupted him and left him unable to pay the next month’s rent anyways.  (I.E. thinking more than a week ahead with money).

That next month (December), I came home for Christmas and my husband was ready to move back in with me since he is leaving again in about two months for Afghanistan.  I kept telling him to plan ahead with his money and start saving now because we have rent to pay and I no longer have nearly as many hours because I am Student Teaching until June and Student Teaching is an unpaid internship.

Well, surprise su-fucking-prise that now it is February and the rent isn’t paid.  My husband’s earnings from his temp job back here and my meager earnings from the time that I CAN get paid to work pay our internet, utilities, my credit card – from paying for his car repair back in September – and a small amount of groceries.  Nevertheless, we owe $540 by the 5th.  Now he’s stranded back in our hometown until tomorrow (hopefully not longer) because he has no money for gas.

I am so upset with him and yet every time I broach the subject with him he says that I’m being condescending and he quits talking about it.  If I’m being condescending it’s because I relied on him to do one simple thing (save money over December since I couldn’t) and he failed me.

Now I’m left to pick up the pieces like I always do.  I’m not saying we are anywhere close to calling our relationship “quits” but I am at my wits end and I don’t know what to do.  All the talks I’ve tried in the past don’t seem to work.  I’m not getting through to my husband and I’m tired of being treated as an afterthought when all of my energy and free time is spent figuring out ways for us to not get evicted!

angry tl:dr: Newlywed husband's life shits on him and instead of wiping the shit off and overcoming obstacles he sits in the shit and makes shit castles.

real tl:dr: Newlywed husband's irresponsible behavior and lack of planning about money are causing issues with our relationship."

1wvb1q,1,2014-02-03,I [23F] was cheated on by SO [22M] and I want to forgive him completely but am hung up.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wvb1q/i_23f_was_cheated_on_by_so_22m_and_i_want_to/,"This isn't a throwaway because I don't care who sees this. Last weekend the guy I've been dating for roughly a year now slept with a freshly minted 18-year-old his roommates know. He came over and we had sex and everything was normal on Sunday, but on Monday he calls me at 12:30 in the morning and comes over crying his eyes out and tells me he's done something horrible, keeps me up all night talking about it.

Then, because I've never been the sort to tell people how I feel or opine in general, he gets mad at me because he wants to stay with me and can't figure out if I hate or love him. He refuses to have a serious conversation with me in person because he has ADHD and gets derailed too easily if we talk in person... or something. So we hash it out over Facebook, I don't sleep much of the week, I end up going to on-campus psych and counselling and talking to them (after my roommate came home to find me naked, blackout drunk, and having a panic/crying attack under my bed after he apparently came over and tried to talk to me and then left, which I don't remember). They've set me an appointment for this Wednesday.

After talking about the whole situation with friends, some of them concluded that he probably cheated because I was too emotionally unavailable. However, I don't feel like he was any more available than I was; we barely saw/see each other more than once a week despite having been together for so long. Any time he asked me to do something, I generally would, though the reverse was not true (in fact, any time I asked him to do anything and we weren't on break from university, he was invariably far too busy). He thinks moving in together could fix the not-seeing-each-other part. His argument for why he never sees me is engineering homework, but I have the same amoutn or more (of also engineering) homework he does, and we work roughly the same number of hours per week... I think the honest truth is he'd rather spend time with other people. Which, I get it, you don't have to spend every moment with your SO, and that's why I didn't press the issue til he asked me if anything was bothering me when we started talking in-depth about stuff this week.

I asked him at one point how he'd feel if I had cheated on him, and his response was something along the lines of ""it would have been about time, everyone else I've ever dated has cheated on me."" Well, having only been in a couple *exclusive* relationships, and mostly having only had casual sex, me even deciding to be exclusive with him at all was kind of a big deal. He had to know it was; back when we first talked about going exclusive, right around that time he'd found a pair of panties in his room while moving and asked if they were mine, but they weren't, and he knew how upset I was just by that. 

Further, pretty much the entire time we've been dating he keeps asking me about having a threesome with a mutual friend, despite us talking and laying out that if anyone else is to be included in our sex life, strictly no friends or coworkers allowed. I'm not attracted to this mutual friend, despite having made out with her once while drunk when I first met her. The girl he slept with is over at his and his roommates' apt all the time, and I'm not sure if she's just there to hang out with his roommates. 

He's met my parents, and most of my best friends. He flew out to California to help me drive my car back to our university from my summer internship. Yet I've never met anyone he's related to, or anyone he's friends with besides roommates, plus the offer to go see someone when he knew I wouldn't be able to make it due to a prior committment to my family.

I want to keep dating him because he's funny, generally kind, and sweet, and we share a lot of interests. I'm just not sure if, even given a week of open conversation, overcoming the emotional and sexual disconnect is entirely possible. Yet he has said he wants to stay with me.

My roommates have banned him from the apartment for at least three weeks given that last he was here I ended up blackout drunk under my bed, and I don't really feel like spending the night in his (twin) bed, so basically he's not getting laid until March. Is there any reason I should give him the benefit of the doubt until he's allowed back in my apartment, to see what he does? He's apologized for sleeping with her, but that's all.

Edit: I should like to add that I am by no means clean-linen innocent; I've done plenty of equally bad things in the few relationships I've had, which also factors into my reluctance to pass negative judgement. 

Though most of my friends disliked him from the start, his friends for some reason kept saying we were perfect for each other, which makes me wonder how much he's fucked up in previous relationships, and how much they might want him to not be weeping over girls all the bloody time.

---   
**tl;dr**: Having major misgivings about relationship, then boy cheats on me. Wat do? Am I being an unreasonable, crazy bitch? I'm just so confused and generally hurt. I'm 99% sure I love him, but I'm seriously surprised by the ""I'm emotionally unavailable"" thing."

1wvm6b,14,2014-02-03,I'm engaged to a man who I've been with for 7 years... just now admitting to myself who I really am,[deleted],actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1wvm6b/im_engaged_to_a_man_who_ive_been_with_for_7_years/,"I don't know who to talk to about this. I feel incredibly fragile and frankly, terrified right now, so I would like to ask that if you have criticisms, to keep them to yourselves- I have too much of that going on in my own head. I am severely depressed (not suicidal at the moment, but I do have support for that if it does come up again), and I feel completely alone. I don't know how to make this story short, but I'll give it my best try.

I've been in a relationship with a man for 7 years (engaged for 4, planning on getting married in 1-2 years). He basically rescued me from my dysfunctional family, from whom I am essentially estranged now, and has been supporting me as I have struggled to complete school (Bachelor's in 2008; changing fields and graduating with MA this fall), all while struggling with a shitload of mental health issues. (I'm 29 now, FYI). I have been unable to hold down a job because of these issues, and I am most certainly eligible for disability, if I wanted to go down that road, but that hasn't been necessary, as he has been supporting me financially throughout this entire time. I'm getting better, more rapidly, in the last few months in particular, and hoping to be functional enough to land an internship this fall, and re-enter the workforce next spring, after graduating. I am completely dependent on him. I have *nobody* else on whom I can depend.


He's a wonderful guy. He doesn't hold this over my head- there's no power plays or manipulation going on. He genuinely wants to see me get better (recovering from extensive, severe childhood trauma, an eating disorder, and a lot of other shit which I will disclose if asked). The progress I have made in personal growth over the last few months has included getting in touch with my authentic self. For at least 6 years, I've 'hidden' under the label of bi-sexual, because being a lesbian has not been an option. I am that dependent on him. He knows I'm ""bi-sexual"", and doesn't seem to care, but we are monogamous, and he doesn't believe that any other type of relationship would work or last. For the last 2 years, he has been unable to perform, which has left me sexually frustrated. I mean, I'm not attracted to him in that way, but my body responds to certain sensations, and it feels good. For me, it's the emotional intimacy with him that I miss the most. Our relationship is completely devoid of any type of sexual interaction. He has lost interest. (He is 20 years older, btw). He is seeing a therapist now, but hates talking about it. He can't get on any meds to help him because he has a rather serious heart condition.

All that aside, we're basically just best friends with a deeper level of emotional intimacy, and lots of cuddling. I like that. I love him to death. But now that I've grown to where I am today, I can't stifle my true sexual orientation or repress it any longer. I'm a lesbian, and I hate myself for it. I feel like a complete scumbag. I can't stop thinking about it. I used to be able to just shut those thoughts down, and avoid anything that would bring up feelings I could not act on. It tears me up inside to see a lesbian couple, or to get on a lesbian website... it just hurts so bad to see what I want, who I know I truly am, and know I can't be that. I feel like a traitor. This man has given me everything- and I'm not just talking financial support. He has been there for me through everything, and is always available for me. I am the world to him. And we just started talking about building our 'dream house' on some land he owns- which is the last step before marriage. I feel like a piece of shit hypocrite. 

I have no idea what to do. I've been talking with my therapist about it more, lately, and she's going to try to find some more resources for me, particularly from some of her colleagues who are gay or lesbian. In the meantime, what the hell do I do with this? Now I know why I suppressed this for so long- it hurts like hell, knowing who I really am, and yearning to express that openly, and not being able to. 

I love him and I don't want to leave him, and I don't want to break his heart or abandon the plans we've made together for the future. But I need to be with a woman. That is where I belong. That is being true to myself. I don't know what my options are. I just know that right now, at least until I can support myself financially, I can't do anything about it. I certainly can't talk to him about it. I'm in a very bad place, emotionally, because of this. I almost broke my cutting sobriety streak tonight because of this. I have been crying all day. I can't 'turn off' the self-hatred because I truly believe it is justified and legitimate. I can't fucking sleep, or eat, or think, or do anything.

Very stressed out about this.,unhappy_confused,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1wvxex/depressed_or_internet_addicted_or_something_else/,"I am a 23yr old guy who has been living in the UK since 2007. I came here for university and spent the majority of my time here.After a bad fallout with a girl that I was seeing in my 'friends' circle and getting very isolated in my second year, I went down the dumps. But I think with the help of some coping mechanisms like reading a lot on the internet, videogames,music, etc., I felt I survived. I made a few good friends that year and afterward did a year long internship with a big american company here in the UK. Having not enjoyed the emptiness of the daily 9-5 and the corporate environment and feeling lonely all this while, I realized that I couldnt do this for the rest of my life.Unfortunately as an international student, I had already invested a lot of money and couldnt turn back. While talking to my parents hoping to get some direction or supports, I would get a standard reply saying ""but everyone has to do this. This is life"". Feeling  unsupported and that changing course would be an expensive option I continued on with my final year. Instead of studying intensively and focussing on my project,  I was feeling low, very lonely even though I had lots of friends and attended many parties and social gatherings and was spending a lot of time reading on the internet about alternative economics, environmental issues, society and women. I did it to such an extent that I hardly spent any time on my project and as a result my supervisor warned me that I wouldnt even pass. weeks before the deadline, I found myself very very stressed, thinking about how if I failed I would let my parents down. But somehow with some help from others I managed to submit it. I managed to score a good mark on my project and degree but felt my confidence SAPPED! I figured I wasn't interested in my degree enough to make a career out of it. I clearly remember not enjoying my graduation and feeling quite negative and ill about it in the morning about it. Soon after I again started spending a lot of time on the internet reading not to the extent of avoiding social contact but definitely productivity to the extent that I almost forgot to extend my visa if it hadnt been for my mum reminding me! To this day she is shocked that I forgot. I then moved out to another house in the same city with my friends that I was living with in the summer. All that year I again spent a lot of time on the internet, had 2 brief relationships, some good parties but zero productivity. I was living off my parents feeling regret but soon forgetting about it,  till the next month arrived to pay rent. I landed a part time job with very variable hours so couldnt properly sustain myself. Then when summer arrived I didnt have enough money to travel Europe,which I had always wanted to, and felt bad. But did manage to attend some once in a lifetime gigs that I really wanted to. After summer ended some of my friends left for work and uni whereas I stuck around in the same house but this time with a different set of housemates. All this while I was still reading quite a lot(on the internet) and felt as if I wasnt getting enough stimulation. I was slowly developing the feeling that I should be away from the computer yet couldnt quite manage to effectively do so. Thinking something was very wrong I started exploring depression and diagnosing myself. Then I approached my GP who referred me on to mental health services who classified me as a mild case and referred me on to external counselling services. I feel that it helped me a bit but my productivity is still not good enough.I was recently prescibed a low dose of antidepressant but havent taken it as I am very skeptical and fearful of them. I know that I need to do many daily and big life related things but the mere thought of them makes me feel tired and not wanting to bother to do them.I find myself pushing myself mentally to do them and then wondering why that barrier exists at all. I also have conflicting feelings regarding spending my time. for eg., I feel like going out but also feel that I havent  done the things i need to do. I then think that i can do them later but dont end up doing them and feeling bad about it.
I soon found myself with only a few months remaining on my visa without a direction as to what to do and only a temporary 30 hours per week job that ended the following week. I also needed to find a new place in 2 weeks.  At the time I was really stresed but thanks to a friend I was able to find a place in a beautiful house with a nice family that made me dinner and I had no chores. During that time, I found that my productivity was still very low. I often had things to do like apply for jobs, fix the bike etc but said to myself ""na its not that important"" and then soon swayed over towards the internet. Anyway I wasnt able to find a job in the remaining months and had to return to my home country. Now here I am living with my parents and again find myself spending the same hours on the internet as before, reading or watching videos on the same topics as before. Everytime I sit down to apply for work I end up after a while going back to the internet to distract myself and then feeling bad about it. The days seem to go by without any decent results. And I am not sure what's really wrong. What do you people think? Any advice would be much appreciated :)"

In the days once the horrific automotive crash that took Paul Walker's life on Gregorian calendar month. 30, several tributes were paid to the handsome 40-year-old actor best acknowledged for his hush-hush protector within the ""Fast &amp;amp; Furious"" movies. He was a good dada to his teenaged female offspring. He was given to generous acts of charity, once in secret buying an expensive band for associate Asian nation war vet and his fiancée. He was a capable action hero, and his likability issue onscreen and off was through the roof. What you did not hear, however, was a lot of effusive praise of his acting talent.

That may modification once ""Hours,"" the primary of his 2 finished movies, arrives in theaters and on VOD this weekend. Set during a point of entry hospital throughout the aftermath of cyclone Katrina, the adventure story is not good, the budget deficiencies square measure apparent, and Walker is just about forced to hold the complete weight of the drama on his well-muscled shoulders.

That's not stunning, considering he's the sole recognizable solid member, and his main co-star winds up being a baby. what's sudden is however well he realizes what's basically a one-person show.

Once the story gets going once a rather clumsy and long gap, film writer Eric Heisserer (""Final Destination 5""), in his directional debut, permits Walker lots of space to quite rise to the occasion. The film winds up being a rather ingenious survival tale crossed with a tension-ratcheting gimmick—somewhat such as ""Speed""'s bomb-on-a bus scenario—that makes each ticking minute count.

First, however, we tend to should with patience learn all the small print of things. after we initial meet his character Nolan Hayes, his pregnant spouse Abigail (Genesis Rodriguez) has gone into labor 5 weeks early. Nolan rushes her to the hospital even as the historic storm starts production. The tragic news that his spouse has died leaves Nolan a lot of numb than tearful, however a minimum of their female offspring is alive. However, a doctor explains the newborn should be fed through associate IV and placed during a ventilator, remaining there for a minimum of forty eight hours.

However, once Katrina unleashes her wrath and therefore the flood waters speedily rise (clips of actual newscasts keep US up to date), the hospital is forced to evacuate. That leaves Nolan and his kid on their own since the ventilator cannot be affected. Then the facility cuts out, the back-up generator fails and Walker's character spends the remainder of the film cranking A battery which will solely be recharged for some minutes at a time.

Much like Sandra Bullock in ""Gravity"" or thespian in ""Cast Away,"" Walker's Nolan finds astonishingly partaking if compelling ways that to pass the time. He speaks to his silent female offspring, telling her concerning her mother whereas coitus interruptus photos and different souvenirs—including her engagement and wedding rings, started out during a rush before going into the delivery room—and putting them atop the ventilator. He hunts down refill baggage for the IV drip, changes a diaper for the primary time, seeks out a sender once cell service goes out, remembers however he and

1wwi45,0,2014-02-03,Professional 25/F Quitting Marijuana after 8 years of heavy use,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1wwi45/professional_25f_quitting_marijuana_after_8_years/,"As a heavy marijuana user for the past 8 years of my life, IT IS possible to kick your smoking addiction even if you rely on getting high every couple hours to get through the day.  I should know, I use to wake and bake, go to school/work, get high on my lunch break, and then come home and smoke at least 3 more bowls.  Once I was home, I would load bowls for myself until I passed out in front of the TV.  I was smoking about 1g a day, and was spending all my money at the dispensary or streets (whichever connect came through first).  For a while, everything was great- I was a college student with a job and I had a low overhead so I spent all my money buying weed.  I didn't care because it was the only thing I felt worth spending my money on.  

I resumed this pattern of life post college- and continued smoking pot in graduate school.  I told myself I would quit once I found an internship but I actually smoked even more due to stress.  Last year, I graduated with my Master's degree and realized it is time for a life change.

My family is against smoking so it was a secret I kept from them.  My friends are all stoners so it was easy to keep getting high with them.  However, soon I found myself dipping low in money because I was in between graduation and finding a full time career.  Even with only a few dollars in my bank account, I still bought weed.  I began to feel guilty and started resenting myself for the behaviors I cannot control.

By this point, I was convinced getting high is part of me.  I felt I couldn't stop because it was all I had.  As my anxiety about graduation and finding a job grew, so did my appetite for pot.  I started buying cannabis in ounces just to make sure my jar was always full.  I would feel panic attacks whenever my jar was getting low.  

This anxious/self-punishing behavior went on for many more months before I realized I was becoming a piece of crap.  I didn't like my messy appearance and wasn't happy with myself anymore.  It took me 8 years to realize what the effects of marijuana had done to me.  BUT I still loved getting high (especially alone in my house) and struggled a lot.

I attempted to ""quit"" on my own.  It was a total lie.  I would pretend if I only smoked 2 bowls in the morning, I was ""decreasing"" my amount.  However by mid afternoon, I would be so anxious that I ended up smoking again.  Night time was the worse- I cannot be alone with my thoughts and felt I needed cannabis to control my emotions.  Every time I thought/felt/experienced any kind of stress or anxiety I would pack myself a bowl.  Nothing mattered... as long as there was weed I was okay and it was all I cared about.

One day as I was discussing my future with my BF I realized... wow I didn't have a future.  He was making great income and I was behind because I couldn't piss clean to qualify for an actual job.  It hurt to think about the future I was giving up on.  I realized I could keep smoking weed and find a shitty part-time job, OR I could face reality and accept the fact I needed to quit to get hired.  

The funny part is my degrees are both in the medical field.  I have extensive training in substance abuse, neurological biology, THC metabolic pathways, and know all about treatment and recovery.  It was easy to advise another person- yet I couldn't help myself.  

I finally made the difficult decision to allow this cannabis jar to run out and I would not buy anymore.  Every day as I watched the amount dwindle, I would feel anxious.  I had questions like ""What am I gonna do?  How do I pass time?  WTF this hour has been going on forever! I just need a hit"".  

Then one day it happened- my jar was empty.  I woke up and stared at the jar.  Then I did something bad- I began scraping for keif first and then resin.  The resin balls were disgusting, and I used a paperclip to dig around the insides of my bowl piece.  I would pull out the resin and then roll it in a ball to put in my bowl and light it.  The taste was nasty but I was living for that ""little bit"" of highness.  I probably pulled out more resin that week than I ever have in my life.  

I felt embarrassed about it and lied to others that I had already quit.  It was easier that way... to pretend I stopped getting high by saying resin isn't weed.  Then the resin ran out and I completely stopped.

I thought about smoking every 15 minutes, every single day and night.  All I wanted was a hit.  The first night without pot, I was angry and then I started crying.  I never felt so worthless about myself.. here I was a grown, professional woman crying because I can't get high.  The first night was hell- I probably slept less than 2 hours.  I threw up, had a headache, and just moped around the living room.  I had no appetite.  I couldn't shut off my brain from its cravings.

At around 3am, I secretly got up and started scraping for resin again!  I found a little piece, smoked it and finally slept.  I felt so dirty because I lied to myself.  Still, I kept telling my friends that I had already quit.  The next day would be a new day, I lied again.

After 3 unsuccessful attempts to not look for resin at night, I managed to break the paper clip because I was scraping so hard.  As the paper clip snapped in half, so did my drive for marijuana.  It finally registered in my head- NO more means NO more.  I put my bong, grinder, and lighters away.

I started up my dusty treadmill and got on a low speed.  I had a new plan- to exercise every time I had a craving.  Exercising and drinking water has been the biggest help to my recovery.  Every time my brain got stuck on thinking ""I need to smoke... just one..."" I would force myself to run.  The harder I craved it, the faster I would run.  The idea was to knock myself out of breath so I'm distracted trying to breathe.  

Of course I still thought about weed.  All my friends still smoke around me so it has been tough making that personal decision for myself.  The first week was the hardest- it was all about thought control and self management.  I kept telling myself that I'm a piece of shit if I can't control my own behaviors.  This makes me no different than a baboon and the difference between humans and animals is that we have critical thinking skills.  I was on a mission to prove to myself that I can be human.

Now that I have been THC-free for a while, I can honestly say marijuana is harmless.  I look back and realize all those times I could have cut down on smoking but chose not to.  I feel EXACTLY the same as a person. I can say marijuana does not change you for the worse as a person- one must learn to harness the power of it.  If used moderately, it is an excellent sleeping/anti-anxiety aid.  However, if you start abusing it and smoke 1g a day, you will find yourself out of luck.  

I'm not ready to start smoking again (yet)- but I want to say taking a marijuana break is a good decision for anyone who is looking for a different perspective of life.  I am excited I had a tolerance break so when I do get high again, I will be 10x higher.  After 8 years, it is time to give it up - for a while.

As a former, heavy daily marijuana user- I want to say I am still in support of marijuana for its medicinal purposes.  If given the option in the future, I pick cannabis over any kind of prescription pills -anyday.  One thing I would do differently is to NOT wake and bake and only smoke in the afternoon-evenings.  I find it helpful to be ""sober"" during day time in order to get shit done at home and at work.  Good luck to anyone who is trying to quit, it's hard but it's definitely possible.

1wwmds,626,2014-02-03,"I just got an abortion, and I feel fine.",garbagemonster,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1wwmds/i_just_got_an_abortion_and_i_feel_fine/,"I know that before my abortion, I was super nervous and it helped me a lot to read the stories of the experiences of girls like me. I am 20 years old, I'm in college. I was on the pill. I had the complete support of my boyfriend, roommate, and my mother.

**When I found out:** I took a pregnancy test at home and the up and down line was very dark, but the other lines were fainter and my roommate and my boyfriend kept trying to convince me that it was probably inconclusive. I knew better. This was on a Friday night, so the following Monday I went to the health center at my college and they confirmed what I already knew. I was pregnant. 

**Finding a clinic:** My next step was to find the right clinic. Believe it or not I used Yelp a lot to make sure I was going to find a place that would feel safe and welcoming. I called many clinics to ask for a quote on the surgical procedure, and I was sure to make sure I asked if they offered sedation and how much more it would cost. All of the clinics wanted to know how much I made per month, and I was very honest about it, but honestly they won't ask for confirmation on your income, so I really could have said a couple hundred dollars less. Hindsight 20/ 20 right? I ended up choosing Women's Health Specialist's. They have locations all over Northern California. The cost was 400 for the procedure and 100 for the sedation, so it was 500 all together. I made the appointment over the phone, but plan to take the day off as you get whatever time they have available, and you'll be nervous beforehand and sleepy after.

**The first leg of my journey:** My roommate agreed to take me, as my boyfriend had to be at an internship the morning of my procedure. The trip there was a little more adventurous than I had planned. My roommate's car is a complete shit box. It has no windshield wipers and the drivers side window is completely missing. The passengers window doesn't roll down at all and the heater as well as the radio are both completely non functional. We had to drive over the ""pass"" through snowy mountains, and the car was freezing cold. We were both wrapped in in our winters warmest, and had blankets piled on our laps. It wasn't raining or snowing so we could see fine out the windshield.... until we got too close to the car in front of us and wet mud slush was sprayed over the entire window. We couldn't see anything so my roommate stuck her head out the window to navigate and I tried the best I could to guide her with what little vision I had out of my window. We were trying to get off at the next exit, and we ran straight into the sign indicating which exit it was. The wheels locked up when she tried to brake and ice didn't help the matter. I could barely see the sign in front of my side of the window and we crashed right into it. My door wouldn't open so we both climbed out the drivers side. The snow was stained with bright green coolant and part of the front right side of the car was dragging on the ground. Despite the damages we got out of there quickly, got off at the exit, and pulled to the side to deal with the damages. I called the clinic immediately to tell them I just got in a car accident and that I was probably going to be a little bit late. They were perfectly okay with it (probably because the wait time at the clinic ended up being 4 1/2 hours in total). My roommate desperately looked around the car for something to clear the window and only turned up some paper towels that smeared the mud around. Finally we were able to find some old iced tea that cleared the window up pretty well.... even though a lot of it froze almost immediately. I'm still not sure how we were able to pull this off, but we were able to drive slowly the 30 minutes to the nearest town, with our fender dragging against the tire the whole way. It was such a weird adventure, and we didn't have cell reception for most of it, but we finally made it to the town. Luckily enough we wound up about 10 minutes away from where my mom works, and THANK GOODNESS, my mom took the rest of the day off from work to drive me the rest of the way to my appointment. My roommate stayed in the parking lot with her beat up car to figure out what she was going to do with it, and how she was going to get home. 

**The second leg of my journey:** At this point I was still 50 minutes away from the clinic and we had an hour to get there. I piled my comfort blankets into my mom's car and I was able to fully appreciate how comforting a working heater and good radio can be. Thankfully the rest of the drive was pretty uneventful and we got to the clinic safely. There were protesters outside of the clinic but I quickly hid my face so I couldn't see them. I only got a glimpse of one woman who had a baby sling around her body and she reached her arm towards our car as we pulled into the parking lot. Luckily there was a highway patrolman standing guard near them preventing them from coming any further than the side walk. A clinic escort met us at our car to walk us to the front door. We were only 5 minutes late. There was a garden path up to the front door of the clinic and from the door you couldn't see the protesters at all and I was very thankful for that. I filled out some paperwork and my mom and I waited in the waiting room. Prepare to do a ton of waiting. We were in the clinic for a total of 4 1/2 hours, and they told me when I got there that a 4 hour wait was pretty normal. I heard that other days of the week they had a shorter wait time because Friday's were the only days that they offered sedation.

**The waiting:** My mom and I did a ton of waiting. I would definitely bring a book or something to do for yourself, AND for the person who brought you. The actually procedure is very short and the vast majority of your time will be nervous sitting. After the first period of waiting they asked me to pee in a cup. That normally wouldn't be too hard but because of the anesthesia I wasn't able to to eat or drink (including water) for 8 hours prior to my appointment time. After I gave them my cup there was more waiting, and then they took my blood pressure and temperature. More waiting, and then they took me to a room to talk to me so I would understand what the procedure was going to entail, and I had to fill out more paperwork. If you do get anesthesia you'll need a driver to take you from the appointment, and the clinic will want to know their name and phone number so they can call them to pick you up. There are two waiting rooms by the way, the public one, and the one for just the girls actually needing services at the clinic. The second room was much nicer with leather chairs, but I chose to wait with my mother in the other one. 

**Ultrasound:** The next time they brought me back they did an internal ultra sound. Definitely one of my least favorite parts of the whole experience. A women lead me into a room and instructed me to take off everything from the waist down when she left the room and to knock on the door when I did. I had a thin papery sheet to cover me up but it wasn't that much of a comfort. I also left my socks on because it was kinda freezing inside. She instructed me to sit up on the butcher paper while she took out a long, skinny plastic probe (the ultrasound wand I guess) and she put a jelly filled condom over the wand. I had to scootch to the end of the table, and the lady strapped my ankles into two stirrups attached to the table. As you probably guessed, it's an INTERNAL ultrasound... so yeah that process was not the most fun and unfortunately I was not knocked out for it. When she was done I told her that I didn't want to see the results of the ultrasound, but she did tell me that I was 6 to 7 weeks along. I got dressed again, and went back outside to wait... again.  The next time they called me back was for a finger prick (very oddly painful) to check my iron levels. The woman in this room told me that the next time I would be called back would be for the actual procedure.

**The procedure:** The wait between the finger prick and the actual procedure was one of the longest waits. I'm not sure if it was because I was nervous, but it seemed to take much much longer. The doctor was a woman, and this time she didn't leave the room for me to undress but was very polite about keeping her back turned while I undressed. This time I had to take my scarf and sweatshirt off (cold!!!) and she gave me a pad to put in my underwear now because she said I wouldn't be with it enough to be able to do it myself after the procedure. I had to do the same process with sitting on the butcher paper, and she helped my legs into stirrups so I didn't ""kick her while I was under"". She pulled down the front of my shirt and put two patches on my chest, one under each collar bone, and she pulled up my shirt and put another patch on my inner left hip. She attached cords to the patches and I watched my nervous heart rate jump around on the monitor. Vagina in the air, I had to made conversation with her while we waited for the anesthesiologist. I'm not sure why but at the time I worried that maybe she was feeling awkward that I was half naked, or maybe she felt bad that she was making me so nervous that my heart rate was jumping around and beeping a ton, so I made an effort to make small talk about her job so she wouldn't feel so bad. I was her first abortion of the day, Friday's are more busy because it's the only day they offer anesthesia, she likes her job, and the recovery shouldn't be bad at all. When the anesthesiologist finally came in, I couldn't help but notice that he was a guy. He was very polite though and asked me a couple questions to make sure I followed my instructions from earlier, no eating 8 hours before procedure, and no drugs 24 hours before. Putting the IV in didn't hurt too bad, it was the rubber band around my arm that pulled my hair that hurt the most. I'm kinda skeptical about needles too so I had to look away when he put it in the back of my hand. He told me what the name of the drug was that he was putting in the IV, and said that in a few seconds it'll feel like I've had a couple of drinks. I focused on the ceiling tiles above me and when they started to blur and slip a little I tried to tell him ""It does feel like I've had a couple drinks and then... I had a... bowl of maraj..... weeds"" and that was the last thing I remember.  

**Recovering:** The doctor lady woke me up and told me I could get dressed. She helped me up slowly and I didn't feel any pain but I was very sluggish and needed help navigating back to my clothes. My underwear was missing, but she told me she already put them on me, and I felt under my collar bone for the patches but they were gone. It was an odd feeling not remembering how clothes got on you, or remembering someone peeling patches off your skin. I remember having difficulties with my sweatshirt, but I don't remember how I got to the recovery room. They told me that they wheel chaired me in but I don't remember it at all. All of us in the recovery room were sitting in big armchairs with puppy pads across the seat. The IV was still in the back of my hand but without a tube so I was very careful not to wiggle it or touch it because I didn't want it to hurt me. Two of the girls had heat pads across their stomachs but when I asked the attendant in the room if I could have one, she told me that they only had two left and the other ones broke. There wasn't any pain but I did feel oddly out of it. I sat there for awhile until the woman asked me to go to the bathroom to check on my bleeding. It was minimal. I finally asked for some water because it now had been a lot longer than 8 hours since my last meal, or drink of water. I tried to make conversation with the other girls in the room, but they all were too out of it. After about 30 minutes they said I was free to go if I felt okay, and someone walked with me as I slowly made my way back out to the waiting room where my mom was. She gathered up my things and another attendant escorted my mom and I out to our car. 

**Driving home:** The drive home was super uneventful. I completely bundled myself up in my comfort blankets and fell asleep. At one point I woke up suddenly and demanded that we stop at KFC because I was ravenously hungry from not eating for 18 hours (it was a lot longer than the 8 hours because I ate before I went to bed but not up until the point where I had to stop). After eating we stopped at a target and I picked up a heating pad and a lot of pads because they told me that I would be spotting for the next 2 to 3 weeks. 

**TL;DR:** I had an abortion and I am 100% okay with my decision. This is an extremely long winded account of my abortion because I want people to know exactly what they are going in for with no surprises. Please feel free to PM me to ask me questions or you can e-mail me at abortionfriend@live.com"

However by mid afternoon, I would be so anxious that I ended up smoking again. Night time was the worse- I cannot be alone with my thoughts and felt I needed cannabis to control my emotions. Every time I thought/felt/experienced any kind of stress or anxiety I would pack myself a bowl. Nothing mattered... as long as there was weed I was okay and it was all I cared about.

One day as I was discussing my future with my BF I realized... wow I didn't have a future. He was making great income and I was behind because I couldn't piss clean to qualify for an actual job. It hurt to think about the future I was giving up on. I realized I could keep smoking weed and find a shitty part-time job, OR I could face reality and accept the fact I needed to quit to get hired.

The funny part is my degrees are both in the medical field. I have extensive training in substance abuse, neurological biology, THC metabolic pathways, and know all about treatment and recovery. It was easy to advise another person- yet I couldn't help myself.

I finally made the difficult decision to allow this cannabis jar to run out and I would not buy anymore. Every day as I watched the amount dwindle, I would feel anxious. I had questions like ""What am I gonna do? How do I pass time? WTF this hour has been going on forever! I just need a hit"".

Then one day it happened- my jar was empty. I woke up and stared at the jar. Then I did something bad- I began scraping for keif first and then resin. The resin balls were disgusting, and I used a paperclip to dig around the insides of my bowl piece. I would pull out the resin and then roll it in a ball to put in my bowl and light it. The taste was nasty but I was living for that ""little bit"" of highness. I probably pulled out more resin that week than I ever have in my life.

I felt embarrassed about it and lied to others that I had already quit. It was easier that way... to pretend I stopped getting high by saying resin isn't weed. Then the resin ran out and I completely stopped.

I thought about smoking every 15 minutes, every single day and night. All I wanted was a hit. The first night without pot, I was angry and then I started crying. I never felt so worthless about myself.. here I was a grown, professional woman crying because I can't get high. The first night was hell- I probably slept less than 2 hours. I threw up, had a headache, and just moped around the living room. I had no appetite. I couldn't shut off my brain from its cravings.

At around 3am, I secretly got up and started scraping for resin again! I found a little piece, smoked it and finally slept. I felt so dirty because I lied to myself. Still, I kept telling my friends that I had already quit. The next day would be a new day, I lied again.

After 3 unsuccessful attempts to not look for resin at night, I managed to break the paper clip because I was scraping so hard. As the paper clip snapped in half, so did my drive for marijuana. It finally registered in my head- NO more means NO more. I put my bong, grinder, and lighters away.

I started up my dusty treadmill and got on a low speed. I had a new plan- to exercise every time I had a craving. Exercising and drinking water has been the biggest help to my recovery. Every time my brain got stuck on thinking ""I need to smoke... just one..."" I would force myself to run. The harder I craved it, the faster I would run. The idea was to knock myself out of breath so I'm distracted trying to breathe.

Of course I still thought about weed. All my friends still smoke around me so it has been tough making that personal decision for myself. The first week was the hardest- it was all about thought control and self management. I kept telling myself that I'm a piece of shit if I can't control my own behaviors. This makes me no different than a baboon and the difference between humans and animals is that we have critical thinking skills. I was on a mission to prove to myself that I can be human.

Now that I have been THC-free for a while, I can honestly say marijuana is harmless. I look back and realize all those times I could have cut down on smoking but chose not to. I feel EXACTLY the same as a person. I can say marijuana does not change you for the worse as a person- one must learn to harness the power of it. If used moderately, it is an excellent sleeping/anti-anxiety aid. However, if you start abusing it and smoke 1g a day, you will find yourself out of luck.

I'm not ready to start smoking again (yet)- but I want to say taking a marijuana break is a good decision for anyone who is looking for a different perspective of life. I am excited I had a tolerance break so when I do get high again, I will be 10x higher. After 8 years, it is time to give it up - for a while.

As a former, heavy daily marijuana user- I want to say I am still in support of marijuana for its medicinal purposes. If given the option in the future, I pick cannabis over any kind of prescription pills -anyday. One thing I would do differently is to NOT wake and bake and only smoke in the afternoon-evenings. I find it helpful to be ""sober"" during day time in order to get shit done at home and at work. Good luck to anyone who is trying to quit, it's hard but it's definitely possible.

1wwv18,7,2014-02-03,Am I [23F] setting myself up for failure with my bf [23M]?,throw13away13x,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wwv18/am_i_23f_setting_myself_up_for_failure_with_my_bf/,"**The Background**

He and I met on OkC  and then started dating in mid-October 2011. Relationship was met with protest from my mom [55/F] since day one, mainly due to his lifestyle (i.e., city student life riding bikes as transportation) and appearance at that time.

Despite the constant pressure from my household at that point, including my mother not talking to me/aggressively ignoring for weeks, I continued to see him and pursue the relationship as I completed my undergrad studies.
The relationship was intense from its onset. I pulled away from a lot of my friends and submerged into the new bf quickly. Truth be told, a lot of them needed to be shed.  We met a lot in the city during my internship and by February 2012 he even took me to a jeweler for a ring fitting. Marriage was talked about often.

My parents met him in January, shortly after I met his. My dad found him to be alright; my mom was convinced he was disrespectful. 


**The First Move-In**

Around the time I graduated in spring, he had a bike riding accident which led to a broken bone. As he was returning to his apartment for the recovery, he offered that I officially leave a lot of things in the space and, basically, a softly move in.

After graduating, I got a job and worked in the city. I stayed with him a lot, though I would lie to my parents or exclude details about him here and there.

We enjoyed some really great months, despite his stress over his injury preventing him to complete school on time and my parents. There were issues with him using social media to flirt with other girls at some points, but he made amends quickly and vocally when that occurred – “I don’t care about having an account on X; I’ll delete it for us to be my priority!” I found that stuff by stalking online, so I accepted my wrong-doing there and was upfront about it.


**The First Break-Up**

By the fall, we were really living domestically as a unit at his place. There was a wedding coming up – my cousin – which he was invited to go to with me, against the usual judgment of my parents.

That wedding comes up and he seems to really stressed with school, so I offer him the chance to not attend and, instead, suggest he enjoy a trip of his own or hang out with friends. He seems reluctant, but agrees. His plans are to go to NYC for a photography adventure – a hobby he was growing fond of and getting good at. I go to that wedding with my dad and see family without the ability to introduce the bf.

I decide to start some hobbies of my own during that time, including committing to my yoga practice. Boyfriend gets mad that I’m doing that to distance myself. Things are tense and I start stalking for things online again. I find them – including that he met up with a girl during his NYC daytrip.

When I bring that up, he gets defensive. Later I find more information – more stalking – that he had been flirting with her for weeks. I tell him I need to talk since I learned of this; I say that even if I didn’t find something, I was not acting in a way that felt like a healthy relationship, so I wanted to break up.  I bring bags and pack up my things from the apartment.


**First Back Together**

After two and a half months of finding my own way of life after things ended, he reached out via text. I was seeing people socially at that time and had had some successful dates, but his message was impactful. It was apologetic and sincere.

It was December and we re-united in time for Christmas and we then spent  a lot of my vacation time from work together connecting. I hid this from my parents.

But by start of 2013, I told my parents. They disapproved but were appreciative that I was honest.

Things felt better than ever after we realized what it was like to be apart. I opened up to him about everything that occurred with the other dates during our breakup and I felt it was reciprocated. We worked to stabilize.

During the coming months, things normalized again and I brought clothes and my things back to his place. We talked about moving into together and began looking at places.

We were really set to move in together at the start of that summer. It was finally coming together!


**The Second Break-Up**

Things began to get tense around spring. His libido was gone and he was stressed a lot. One night, while I was at the house alone, I go to leave a message to surprise him in his computer’s file titled “work.” I discover that it is a file of p0rn. My heart sinks – mainly since he has always been vehemently vocal about his feelings against it (though, I always take guys saying that with a grain of  salt, just because I know that humans are conflicting). Later that same night, he comes home and falls asleep. I look at his phone and find texts of a deeply sweet nature to his first (ex) gf.  They hint about trying to arrange to see each other. I don’t sleep that night and he realizes I’m not in bed. He asks if something is wrong. I, though not wanting to wreck his night and steal his rest, opt to be upfront instead of lie. He gets angry, but then incredibly apologetic.

By the end of that week, we break up.

He and I arrange a time I can get my things. I use my key, get my things, find that his computer already has conversations with other girls—and leave the key, as determined.

We do not see each other all summer. I work very hard to move on and find a place of my own in a different part of the city.

I move into my place – the last day of August.


**The Second Back Together**

He emails that very move-in weekend. It’s a long, long letter about how much he ruined the best thing he had and what’s changed.

I wait a week and then respond, against my own advice to myself.

We get back together.
I stalk everything of his I can find online.
We break up because I get paranoid about his exes and him lying again.

We get back together. I feel that we pour our hearts open and then things are re-kindled. We talk about moving out of state together and really getting married and moving ahead.

Spend most of my Christmas vacation together, as well as New Years.

I then find out, by stalking, that he was hooking up with an ex all during our last mini-break up. She writes very sexual things and took pictures waking up in his room for her Instagram.

We have a fight and I don’t see him for almost a week as I think about things.


**Now**

We’ve been back together and things are working well now, so I wanted to be open. I just told my mom yesterday and she flipped out. “I trust your judgment on everything but this.”

EDIT: He also now wants me to move in with him. I see that as a big offering of his honesty.
_____________

**TL;DR: How much significance should I place on past infidelity and a parental disapproval? While I am finally in living situation and financial place to say “none,” I feel like I need to ask myself that since I’ve [23F] been hurt multiple times in the past by my bf [23M] of almost 3 years and by my own paranoia/jealousy.**

I ...honestly feel a bit crazy from this all, so I appreciate anyone offering a POV to get me outta my own head."
1wx2p8,18,2014-02-03,Me (25F) and my Boyfriend (26M) is still in love with his ex,ucdsh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wx2p8/me_25f_and_my_boyfriend_26m_is_still_in_love_with/,"Yeah, I feel like half the posts here are pretty much this exact situation, so I tried to take notes on the advice other people have gotten from similar situations, but I kind of feel like I have to get this out even if it sounds cliché/boring, but it's really weighing me down and I don't really have any good friends these days who I can talk.

I need to say this... I'm sorry, but yes, I snooped. I'm a terrible person and I snooped on his laptop :(

My boyfriend, let's call him Chris, and I have been together over 2 years. About 3-4 years ago, he was seeing another girl (let's call her Teresa). Let me give some backstory... it's a bit complicated but I should give some background.

Teresa and I went to the same college and were co-workers at one point, casual-good friends. Chris, went to a different college about 6 hours away. One summer he took an internship at the college Teresa and I both went to. While he was there for the summer, they met and got involved and he fell pretty hard for her. They attempted a relationship after the internship ended, but Teresa rejected him because she was ""scarred by her last boyfriend who was 'abusive'"". 

Fast forward a year-- I met him (not knowing initially that he had dated Teresa) and we started dating. He always assured me that he was over her and wanted to be with me. He was really the model boyfriend, we had (have) a great relationship. We even re-located together... unfortunately really close to where Teresa now lives....

For the past 3 months or so after we moved, he's been acting a little distant and off. I figured that it was just because we were both new to the area and still working on making friends/settling in. But a few days ago, he was in the shower and he left his phone on the coffee table and I saw his phone light up as he got a facebook notification-- a message from HER. Yeah, I feel guilty about what I did next, but I couldn't help it... I snuck on his laptop real quick (SHAME ON ME!) and checked his facebook. 

Turns out they have been messaging each other pretty regularly 1-2 a month. I know... no big deal, right? And for the most part the messages are pretty innocent except for a couple... They also referenced a series of text messages so I guess they've been texting (NO, I didn't check his phone although I was severely tempted) too. Some examples... he said he still listens to playlists she made him and that it makes him miss her. He referred to the summer they spent together as ""the best one of his life."" They both said they have regrets.

I have to be honest, these messages feel inappropriate. Am I crazy? He seems to send them or text her when he's drunk. As much as I hate to admit it, she hasn't REALLY said anything that ""crosses the line"", it's mostly him. I don't know what to do and the flashback I keep having is that a year ago on New Years Eve, Chris and our friends partied and got drunk (with a lot of people who are also good friends with Teresa) and she came up as a conversation topic for some reason. In private, one of his friends said something along the lines of Chris never fully being able to get over Teresa. That Chris would never leave me on his own but that if Teresa dumped her boyfriend and told Chris she loved him back, he'd go with her. 

I feel so petty for rambling about this, but it's been haunting me. Am I being paranoid and should I just let it lie?

EDIT: Thanks for your input, everyone... I will try to work up the courage to talk to him tonight. Thanks for letting me rant and being supportive.

1wxwie,0,2014-02-03,I [21M] met a girl [19F] on a cruise four years ago. We have always wanted to be together. I've been dating my girlfriend [20F] for 1.5 years.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1wxwie/i_21m_met_a_girl_19f_on_a_cruise_four_years_ago/,"Hi /r/relationships
Four years ago I met a girl on a week long cruise. We had so much fun together in the limited amount of time. When I first laid eyes on her I instantly approached her (which I have never done to a woman I was fond of before). After the cruise we both went home. I went back to Nor Cali, and she went back to the east coast. We have always kept in very close contact, we would write letters, video chat, mail items, etc.

Presently, she now goes to college in Arizona and I go to college in southern California. (6 hour drive from one another). We are finally getting closer to finally be together again. We are pursuing our BA's having internships, really maturing. We would like to have a relationship once we can physically be together long term. However, I've had a girlfriend for a year and a half now that I also really adore. I love her family so much and her as well. They take great care of me and my girlfriend loves me so so so much. I love her too, but I feel like the girl from the cruise is my soul mate. I dream of the girl from the cruise and have her always in the back of my head. Despite only hanging out with her for one week, we've kept in such close contact for over 4 years now. We always wanted to have a relationship and we finally live so close to each other!!

I don't know what to do I truly adore these two woman and they adore me. I don't want to break hearts. I don't know which woman is the right one for me :(. I love both of them so much. I don't want to break up with my girlfriend to potentially be with the girl from the cruise, because what if it doesn't work out?? Or if I continue to be with my girlfriend, I will always think about the girl from the cruise.. I will always still talk to her. I'll continue to wonder ""what if we met up together again."" I don't know Reddit... has anybody been in this situation?

**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question!

Met a girl on a cruise a few years ago. She lived on the east coast I lived on the west. Always kept in contact, always wanted to have a long term relationship. We now live 6 hours away from one another. I've been dating my girlfriend for 1.5 years now. I adore both of them so much. They are both in love with me. Don't know what to do.."
1wxzmt,1,2014-02-03,[Crit: Heavy] Personal Narrative on First Date Experience (1900 words),[deleted],write,https://www.reddit.com/r/write/comments/1wxzmt/crit_heavy_personal_narrative_on_first_date/,"I am sitting in the driver’s seat of my mom’s green jeep at midnight in Canby, a farm town two hours south of Portland. I can hear the jeep’s v6 engine hum its low tone and the wiper blades pulsing away the rain, too slowly. I should turn the speed of the blades up a notch, but instead I turn them off. The rain gets louder, like a rolling curtain of applause above me in congratulations for turning eighteen years old moments ago. She left me. I know that now as I look out the passenger window, into country darkness, at the tiny porchlight above her door and the window with closed curtains to its right. 

“May I walk you to the door?” I remember weakly asking. My body was frozen in the driving position when I asked this—hands on the wheel, head aimed foreword with the headlights—poised for either a yes or no, my heart thunking in my ears. I wanted her to say yes. Truth is, I wanted to embrace her at the steps, bring her close, tilt her head and cup her chin just below the ears and kiss her. Just like in Gone With the Wind, or any other romance. Dating her never would have worked out, but kissing her to see what kissing’s all about, and to fulfill the promise I made in seventh grade to kiss a girl before turning eighteen, could have worked. She politely declined and got out and went inside. I remember watching the front door close and looking at the clock behind the steering wheel glow a dim 12:03.

A sensation like molten iron runs down the center of my back and up my arms to the steering wheel. My hands grip the wheel so tightly they are shaking. I want to tear the thing in half. “What’s the point… nothing matters… it’s all nothing in the end, why live” I say, gushing the words incoherently in a string together. I abruptly switch off the headlights, release the park, and slam the gas pedal. Blindly, I accelerate down one of Canby’s empty roads fit for tractors and chicken trucks, away from her, away from failure. Somehow I remain on the road. Maybe it is the orange black sky contrasting the trees and road like a flattened yinyang that keeps me from dragging the wheel left or right too sharply into a tree, sign, or the river. Nothing matters, I am thinking again. I did not even ask her to prom in person. 

A month back, I had a friend stuff a tennis ball with my name on it into her backpack during lunch.  That day I drove home early from school and waited for her call in the kitchen, cooking macaroni on the stovetop. When the phone rang, a surge of excitement hit me like an electric fork poking me in the chest, and I answered her call without saying anything. “I’d love to go with you,” she said. It was as if she said it in person. 

While eating the pasta, I thought about the events of the day. I was annoyed with myself for not staying at school. Going home early felt like an act of cowardice. Why not just man up, I thought. Yet again, my shyness got the best of me. On the first day of high school, I approached a group of classmates who were discussing a topic that interested me, probably video games or the latest technology, but I do not remember. One of them noticed me standing in the back and asked, “Why are you here?” I felt like an intern walking into a room full of CEOs discussing financial strategy and chomping at cigars. Another memory cropped up of the high school bully shouting, “Fatty fatty!” at me in the locker room. I should have asked her in person, should have taken her hand when she accepted the tennis ball or, better yet, should have done so with flowers, in class, singing with a guitar in my lap and a song composed with her name in it. 

The next day, I went with my mom to Men’s Wearhouse to find a suit. I wanted the best rental I could find, the eyelash batting kind, one that would dazzle her. In the store, rows of suits in red and pink and white hung on the back wall, exquisite among the black and gray ones. The white suit reminded me of my grandfather who had received a white rental on accident for my parent’s wedding. As the family story goes, he looked resplendent on the dance floor doing the waltz with my grandmother. Better yet, they had not spoken to each other in years and there they were, dancing. 

A tall, maybe six foot eight, man with gages for earrings and a pink bowtie guided me through each style of suit. When I asked him about the more colorful options, he laughed and said I would stick out like a sore thum. He helped me settle for a black tuxedo with a vivid green vest, color enough to at least stand out, and dazzle. 

After driving a mile, I pull off to the side and shut the engine off. To my left are fir trees and railroad tracks running parallel to the road. The rain on the tracks sounds like an overfilled gutter. Occasionally, a large splash rings out on the metal. My eyes are closed.

My date and I began the prom night arriving forty minutes late to Rose’s Restaurant because I had driven to the wrong location. The four other couples we were supposed to sit with had already finished eating by the time we sat down to order. I did not eat much of my caeser salad, the quickest meal on the menu, and neither did she eat hers. I felt nauseous.

Less than an hour later, she was leading me with her hand onto the dance floor. The ballroom was massive, with two story high ceilings and curtains hanging to the floor. The DJ in the back lit up the darkened room acoustically with four refrigerator-sized speakers and visually with strobing reds, blues, greens, and yellows and disco balls and lasers.  Macklemore’s “Can’t Hold Us” blared into the throng of dancing, twerking, and moshing teens, their bodies an undulating mass of arms with one another. We joined them for the next few songs. 

By the third song, my stomach ached. It was when I was caught in the middle with a shoulder gouging my chest and someone’s knee kicking me down low that I realized it was too much. I was going to be sick. My tie felt like a burning rope around my neck being dragged and yanked around by the dancers. I ditched my date for the bathroom in a sprint, straining for air. 

For an hour I hid in one of the stalls with my shirt off. My bald government teacher had seen me surfing the walls with my hand toward the bathroom and gotten me water. At least in the stalls the music took on a muffled, soothing sound where I could recoup for the last dance.

Knowing I could not abandon my date, especially for the last song, I gulped a last bit of water, put on my shirt, minus the tie, and punched open the bathroom door. This last dance was serious business, as everyone knows that at the end, all dates kiss. I strode down the hall to the ballroom with my shoulders back and chest out. There she was, leaning on the wall to the right of the main doors with a glass of orange juice up to her lips. Her flame orange hair shimmered in the disco light escaping from cracks of the doorway. For the first time I noticed the emerald green dress she was wearing, simple in design but fitted precisely to her track-runners frame. Without words, I took her orange juice and promenaded her onto the dance floor.

The DJ had turned all the lights off, save for the disco ball which cast a slowly drifting starscape of lights on us. “I Won’t Give Up” by Jason Mraz began to play. I had never been this close to a woman before. My ear touched her ear while we slowly turned step-by-step in the darkness. I felt every detail of her body vividly as she pressed close to me. Her head was a scratchy blur on my shoulder, like winter wool too close to see clearly, and her perfume gave off a hallucinogenic melody of vanilla and high-desert pine. I was gone, in another place of unrivaled peace.

Gradually, the song came to a close. In the pleasant silence after the lights came on, I looked into her eyes and she looked into mine. We stood there, motionless; my six-foot frame in an unbuttoned, shiny green vest complemented her dress and her soft, slim form, like Beauty and the Beast gone twenty-first century. I did not want the moment to end. Rather than kiss her, like the rest of the couples around us were doing, I leaned forward to where my lips touched her ear and gruffly whispered, “Your ear is wet,” which was the first thing to come to mind. Bam, like a gun, the moment fell apart. She shoved me away to get in the exit line. I followed after a few seconds of hasty introspection, tried to grab her hand, but she crossed her arms and looked away. 

Fat raindrops pelt the window hard, sounding like TV static. In the darkness I suck in salty tear drops and gurgle out, “That’s just not me.” My ears ring with the echoes the students I sit next to every day narrating their encounters with parties, alcohol, women and men, sports, kissing, and loving. The coil inside me snaps. In sudden fury, I punch the steering wheel and dashboard, bang the windows and claw at the seats; I lose it there and calm only when I’m gasping to breath under all the self-pitying tears. Minutes pass with me sagging in the driver’s side—I think of the birthday cake tomorrow morning, which I choose not to eat as punishment.

“Sometimes,” I start before taking another breath, “Sometimes you got to be someone else first to find out who you really are.” A surge of rain collides onto the roof of the car. It’s strange how rain sounds just like the ocean, well down to the cresting waves and shoreline. I roll onto my side and wipe the tears from my face to see out the window. I feel better then. Relaxed. I know I am not that suave guy I spent so much time donning the mask of during the school days. The social guy, the attention seeker and partygoer—a half mask, more correctly, like the Phantom. Silence is not my sin; it is part of who I am. Off in the distance I see a blurry yellow light coming down the tracks, flash, flash, flash between the trees. It is one of the big brown trains with cars spanning as long as a mile. I do not wait to count how many. By the time the train passes, I am going home.

I'm a 26 year old wanting to go to WGU for my BS Human Resource Management degree.

In 2005-2006 I attended one year at Pennsylvania State University. Its decently difficult to get into - I only remember I had an 1180/1600 SAT.

The largest issue about that experience is I probably passed 4/10 classes, with the remaining 6/10 as failures (F's). The others were probably B's, and C's. At the time the brick and mortar wasn't right for me, and in fact still is not for me. 

My career as a web programmer though has gone very well! I went from an intern to a vp level in a small business in 2 years. However, I realized it wasn't right for me. 

I am 100% an independent learner and Google taught me everything about my IT career. That is why I feel WGU is right for me. The HR business degree will bring me to where I need to be in my life.

Will it harm my chances pulling my college transcripts with 6 failures and 4 passes? I *know* they want some college experience, but mine was terrible!"

First and foremost, happy belated new year! I hope you have been doing well since we last spoke in November.


I just wanted to reach out to you with respect to an internship for this upcoming summer. I remember XXXX mentioning to me that you all discussed having an intern last summer, and weren't sure if that meant a firm wide or investment banking intern, but as you know I am interested in investment banking. While I understand that an intern might not be needed, I know that I have some exceptional skills and qualities that would be worth considering.


With that being said, I would like to set up a meeting to speak with you, and anyone else necessary from the investment banking team, to discuss my qualifications, experience, and value that I would bring to the table as an intern.


I appreciate your time and look forward to your response.


Best,

I don't have any special notoriety or claims to fame under my belt and I know I still don't have that much experience, but I have grown so much as a competitor not only in the game, but as a person. Here are some tips that I have learned over this past year that I hope will be helpful.

**Lose**

If you don't lose you'll never get better. I used to get down on myself because I couldn't beat anyone I faced. Heck, even some random person who hadn't played the game in a few years was beating me. I was really bad, and I knew it. However, I didn't realize what my problem was until I started appreciating my losses and what they taught me. I became conscious of why I lost, I asked questions, took notes, set up training routines. Losing is the only way you will know how you can improve.

**Attach yourself to your main character**

When I used to play Smash Bros for fun there were three characters I played most often: Kirby, Mario, and Ness (Lucas in Brawl). I only needed to worry about beating my brother and my friends, so as long as I got good enough to beat them I was happy. Tier lists were nothing, only house rules stood between the viability of a character. When I revisited my childhood to enter into the competitive realm, I abandoned Ness, my favorite character, for Dr. Mario. As the months passed I changed mains quite a bit: Dr. Mario to Ice Climbers to Peach, to Ganondorf, to Peach again. I thought I was going to stick to Peach because she was the only top tier character I really understood. It wasn't until recently that I realized that I actually hated Peach and I couldn't play more than 30 minutes without getting bored of her. I re-found my love for Ness and have vowed to get good with him no matter how badly he sucks. Let me tell you, it feels great to kick butt with a disadvantaged character, especially when you have a sentimental connection to said character.

**Play every day**

I tend to be obsessive over games I want to get good at. It's just in my personality. Even through a summer internship and a grueling college senior semester I couldn't help but divide my attention to Melee. I don't recommend sacrificing grades, but unfortunately that's kind of what it lead to for me (thankfully I still passed them all, by the skin of my teeth). Fun fact: I play with the online dolphin community and I owe them for everything I currently know about competitive Melee. We have some pretty skilled players and I was definitely thrown into the deep end right away. However, the community was great and considering my social anxious tenancies I feel I wouldn't have been able to learn and grow as well as I did from a community in-person. Online play definitely strengthened me for the real world of Melee, and being able to play someone every day was a huge plus.

**Analyze videos**

This is actually a really important step, and something I can also be a bit obsessive over as well. Every day for lunch during last semester I would get something to eat and find a competitive Melee video to watch. I questioned techniques, how players baited or combo'd. I learned all the terminology, the rules, the strengths and weaknesses of a character. When I wanted to know a specific match-up I would search for it. Videos are an amazing source of knowledge. There is no reason you shouldn't take advantage.

**Have fun... OR ELSE**

They're not kidding when they say this is the most important rule. When you're having fun, you play your best. There would be times where I'm just having a bad day and I find myself feeling worse after getting beat by someone. If you start to find yourself in this situation STOP and either fix it asap or just take a break and come back tomorrow. If you're not having fun you will start to become predictable as well, starting to lean on bad habits and reflexes and not giving 100%. Trying too hard will never allow you to play at maximum potential.

Thanks for reading, I hope it was worth all this typing. Feel free to ask any questions or whatever.

**TL;DR**: Read the bold words."
1wyxc0,3,2014-02-04,"[Critique: Heavy] Narrative on first dating experience. Does anything glare off the page? Is the pacing okay? Do you see a ""thesis"" of some sort? (1900 words)",[deleted],WritersGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1wyxc0/critique_heavy_narrative_on_first_dating/,"I am sitting in the driver’s seat of my parent’s green jeep at midnight in Canby, a farm town an hour south of Portland. I can hear the jeep’s v6 engine hum its low tone and the wiper blades pulsing away the rain, too slowly. I should turn the speed of the blades up a notch, but instead I turn them off. The rain gets louder, like a rolling curtain of applause above me in congratulations for turning eighteen years old moments ago. She left me. I know that now as I look out the passenger window, into country darkness, at the tiny porchlight above her door and the window with closed curtains to its right.

“May I walk you to the door?” I remember weakly asking. My body was frozen in the driving position when I asked this—hands on the wheel, head aimed foreword with the headlights—poised for either a yes or no, my heart thunking in my ears. I wanted her to say yes. Truth is, I wanted to embrace her at the steps, bring her close, tilt her head and cup her chin just below the ears and kiss her. Just like in Gone With the Wind, or any other romance. Dating her never would have worked out, but kissing her to see what kissing’s all about, and to fulfill the promise I made in seventh grade to kiss a girl before turning eighteen, could have worked. She politely declined and got out and went inside. I remember watching the front door close and looking at the clock behind the steering wheel glow a dim 12:03.

A sensation like molten iron runs down the center of my back and up my arms to the steering wheel. My hands grip the wheel so tightly they are shaking. I want to tear the thing in half. “What’s the point… nothing matters… it’s all nothing in the end, why live” I say, gushing the words incoherently in a string together. I abruptly switch off the headlights, release the park, and slam the gas pedal. Blindly, I accelerate down one of Canby’s empty roads fit for tractors and chicken trucks, away from her, away from failure. Somehow I remain on the road. Maybe it’s the orange black sky contrasting the trees and road like a flattened yinyang that keeps me from dragging the wheel left or right too sharply into a tree, sign, or the river. Nothing matters, I am thinking again. I did not even ask her to prom in person.

A month back, I had a friend stuff a tennis ball with my name on it into her backpack during lunch. That day I drove home early from school and waited for her call in the kitchen, cooking macaroni on the stovetop. When the phone rang, a surge of excitement hit me like an electric fork poking me in the chest, and I answered her call without saying anything. “I’d love to go with you,” she said. It was as if she said it in person.

While eating the pasta, I thought about the events of the day. I was annoyed with myself for not staying at school. Going home early felt like an act of cowardice. Why not just man up, I thought. Yet again, my shyness got the best of me. On the first day of high school, I approached a group of classmates who were discussing a topic that interested me, probably video games or the latest technology, but I do not remember. One of them noticed me standing in the back and asked, “Why are you here?” I felt like an intern walking into a room full of CEOs discussing financial strategy and chomping at cigars. Another memory cropped up of the high school bully shouting, “Fatty fatty!” at me in the locker room. I should have asked her in person, should have taken her hand when she accepted the tennis ball or, better yet, should have done so with flowers, in class, singing with a guitar in my lap and a song composed with her name in it.

The next day, I went with my mom to Men’s Wearhouse to find a suit. I wanted the best rental I could find, the eyelash batting kind, one that would dazzle her. In the store, rows of suits in red and pink and white hung on the back wall, exquisite among the black and gray ones. The white suit reminded me of my grandfather who had received a white rental on accident for my parent’s wedding. As the family story goes, he looked resplendent on the dance floor waltzing with my grandmother. Better yet, they had not spoken to each other in years and there they were, dancing.

A tall, maybe six foot eight, man with gauges earrings and a pink bowtie guided me through each style of suit. When I asked him about the more colorful options, he laughed and said I would stick out like a sore thumb. He helped me settle for a black tuxedo with a vivid green vest, color enough to at least stand out, and dazzle.

After driving a mile, I pull off to the side and shut the engine off. To my left are fir trees and railroad tracks running parallel to the road. The rain on the tracks sounds like an overfilled gutter. Occasionally, a large splash rings out on the metal. My eyes are closed.

My date and I began the prom night arriving forty minutes late to Rose’s Restaurant because I had driven to the wrong location. The four other couples we were supposed to sit with had already finished eating by the time we sat down to order. I did not eat much of my caeser salad, the quickest meal on the menu, and neither did she eat hers. I felt nauseous.

Less than an hour later, she was leading me with her hand onto the dance floor. The ballroom was massive, with two story high ceilings and curtains hanging to the floor. The DJ in the back lit up the darkened room acoustically with four refrigerator-sized speakers and visually with strobing reds, blues, greens, and yellows and disco balls and lasers. Macklemore’s “Can’t Hold Us” blared into the throng of dancing, twerking, and moshing teens, their bodies an undulating mass of arms with one another. We joined them for the next few songs.

By the third song, my stomach ached. It was when I was caught in the middle with a shoulder gouging my chest and someone’s knee kicking me down low that I realized it was too much. I was going to be sick. My tie felt like a burning rope around my neck being dragged and yanked around by the dancers. I ditched my date for the bathroom in a sprint, straining for air.

For an hour I hid in one of the stalls with my shirt off. My bald government teacher had seen me surfing the walls with my hand toward the bathroom and gotten me water. At least in the stalls the music took on a muffled, soothing sound where I could recoup for the last dance.

Knowing I could not abandon my date, especially for the last song, I gulped a last bit of water, put on my shirt, minus the tie, and punched open the bathroom door. This last dance was serious business, as everyone knows that at the end, all dates kiss. I strode down the hall to the ballroom with my shoulders back and chest out. There she was, leaning on the wall to the right of the main doors with a glass of orange juice up to her lips. Her flame orange hair shimmered in the disco light escaping from cracks of the doorway. For the first time I noticed the emerald green dress she was wearing, simple in design but fitted precisely to her track-runners frame. Without words, I took her orange juice and promenaded her onto the dance floor.

The DJ had turned all the lights off, save for the disco ball which cast a slowly drifting starscape of lights on us. “I Won’t Give Up” by Jason Mraz began to play. I had never been this close to a woman before. My ear touched her ear while we slowly turned step-by-step in the darkness. I felt every detail of her body vividly as she pressed close to me. Her head was a scratchy blur on my shoulder, like winter wool too close to see clearly, and her perfume gave off a hallucinogenic melody of vanilla and high-desert pine. I was gone, in another place of unrivaled peace.

Gradually, the song came to a close. In the pleasant silence after the lights came on, I looked into her eyes and she looked into mine. We stood there, motionless; my six-foot frame in an unbuttoned, shiny green vest complemented her dress and her soft, slim form, like Beauty and the Beast gone twenty-first century. I did not want the moment to end. Rather than kiss her, like the rest of the couples around us were doing, I leaned forward to where my lips touched her ear and gruffly whispered, “Your ear is wet,” which was the first thing to come to mind. Bam, like a gun, the moment fell apart. She shoved me away to get in the exit line. I followed after a few seconds of hasty introspection, tried to grab her hand, but she crossed her arms and looked away.

Fat raindrops pelt the window hard, sounding like TV static. In the darkness I suck in salty tear drops and gurgle out, “That’s just not me.” My ears ring with the echoes the students I sit next to every day narrating their encounters with parties, alcohol, women and men, sports, kissing, and loving. The coil inside me snaps. In sudden fury, I punch the steering wheel and dashboard, bang the windows and claw at the seats; I lose it there and calm only when I’m gasping to breath under all the self-pitying tears. Minutes pass with me sagging in the driver’s side—I think of the birthday cake tomorrow morning, which I choose not to eat as punishment.

“Sometimes,” I start before taking another breath, “Sometimes you got to be someone else first to find out who you really are.” A surge of rain collides onto the roof of the car. It’s strange how rain sounds just like the ocean, well down to the cresting waves and shoreline. I roll onto my side and wipe the tears from my face to see out the window. I feel better then. Relaxed. I know I am not that suave guy I spent so much time donning the mask of during the school days. The social guy, the attention seeker and partygoer—a half mask, more correctly, like the Phantom. Silence is not my sin; it is part of who I am. Off in the distance I see a blurry yellow light coming down the tracks, flash, flash, flash between the trees. It is one of the big brown trains with cars spanning as long as a mile. I do not wait to count how many. By the time the train passes, I am going home.

1wz9xb,19,2014-02-04,Confession Of An Asian [M24] Expectation From Family Memenbers,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1wz9xb/confession_of_an_asian_m24_expectation_from/,"Ever since, when I can remember, I was told by my mother and sisters that I will not amount to anything, that I'm dependent of them to survive. They have always bombarded me verbally about my behavior, my characteristics and goals in life. Especially my mother, whom has brought up her dissapointments in me every time we were together. Not one day goes by without her reconization of my failures. My mom, my sisters, aunts, uncles and even family friends are all part taking in this bombardment. They discuss how disappointed they are of my height, the way I ate, why I eat so little, why I'm dating out of our Asian race, why I gotten a degree in business and every possible bickering topic you can think of that relates to life. They compared me to other child of same age through out my teens and young adult life. My mom would ask questions such as ""You ""see such and such"" making this amount of money by doing ""such as such"". Why can't you make that much money? Everyday I experience pressure and consultant from my mother regarding my life and what I am supposed to do with it. When I was earning my 4 year undergrad degree, she constantly phone me and told me that going to college was a waste of my time and money. She explained that I needed to work in the family business and that's the only way to make a lot of money. She explained that even with a degree and getting a company job, I will only be slaving and earning shit. I won't be able to support my self and I won't even manage to support my wife if I had one. I appreciate the hardship my mother and sisters endured to provide for me. Without them, I wouldn't be able to stand where I stand today and have what I have. However, I can't be the person my mother want me to be. I want live an American dream. Have a degree, work a successful white collar career, have a loving wife of my choice, a few kids and a dog. I don't care for the amount of money I earn, just as long as I can support myself and a family. Moreover, A) I didn't want to spend 12 hours a day 7 days a week in the family business. B) I am tired of the family business, my whole life was surrounded by it. From the age of 7 to 20, I would always be present at the family business and help out until closing. And because of this, I never made many childhood friends, I never interacted with friends outside of elementary, high school and college. I resulted in having a few friends that I cherish dearly. I want to break away from my mother's expectations and crave my own career path. I now have graduated with two business subject degrees with money from a scholarship I obtained in high school. I'm making my dream come true. But there's still one more obstacle I need to overcome in achieving my independence. And that is finding a job with my degree, work and internship experience. I realized that finding a career was extremely difficult for me. Even with work and internship experience, I fail at getting a job. I'm prying and subjecting myself to several job applications a week. Hoping that, soon I'll be able to make my dream come true. It has been about 9 months since my graduation and search for employment . My time is limited, I know my mother is demanding me to switch gears soon. I fear I am unable to live a life style I want. I am so close to the finish line."
1wztp1,2,2014-02-04,Trying to overcome so much,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1wztp1/trying_to_overcome_so_much/,"So I broke up with a girl that I loved about a month ago.  I'm in my mid twenties, have only had 3 relationships.  None of the relationships were very healthy, all of them ended poorly.  Growing up, my father had a domineering personality so I never was allowed to contact girls before college, much less have a girlfriend.  As a result, I'm constantly insecure/uncertain about myself when I'm in a relationship.  I tend to rush things in a relationship and this usually turns girls off.


My first gf (or at least a girl I thought was my gf) was in first year of college.  She would come over to my room to watch movies on weekends, we'd hang out and eat together, over Christmas break she visited her grandma who happened to live 15 min from my parents’ home and we went to the theater together.  I tried to hold her hands during the movie.  After we got back to school, her friend told me that I was moving too fast for her in trying to hold her hands.  It didn't help that another guy on my floor who I considered a friend started making moves on her.  Before long, the two of them hooked up.  I was disappointed, but more at my guy friend than the girl (we had already signed a lease together for our sophomore year of college).  Also, for someone who was scared of holding hands too fast she certainly was comfortable making out with him pretty quickly.


The second girlfriend I got (and again, I don't know if this really counts) started off towards the end of 3rd year.  Again, we did pretty typical date stuff: watched movies, ate meals together, talked all the time.  At the beginning of summer, I started an internship which happened to be near where she lived.  On our first date during the summer, there was a tropical thunderstorm.  Literally, street lights were out, trees were knocked over, most restaurants were closed.  She was trying to take me to her fav restaurants, but bc everything was shut down we ended up eating at McDonalds lol.  We held hands as we walked to the car though and I was really happy.  Everything was going well until she went on a study abroad program in France.  Before she left, I thought it'd be cute to give her a stuffed animal from my childhood, to remind her of me.  However, when she came back, she changed so much.  I tried to stay off social media bc I know I can get jealous, but I had to know why she stopped talking to me, being really short with her answers, etc.  I thought she had found another guy; later I found out this wasn't the case but whatever the reason she just made me feel like I was doing all the work in trying to talk with her so I just gave up.


So...basically during these first 2 ""relationships"" I hadn't even kissed a girl.  I think the first girl made me fearful of initiating any type of physical intimacy with a girl, since her friend told me that was the reason she got scared off.  Thinking back on this, this was probably a bullshit excuse and I just didn’t recognize that I was friend zoned.  
Between the 4th year of college and my most recent ex, I managed to make out with a few girls and have unsuccessful sex with 3 girls (unsuccessful bc I have ED and PE).


Enter my most previous relationship.  When we started off, I had to pinch myself.  I couldn’t believe a girl like her existed.  She was smart, funny, liked video games, was a triathlete (amazing body), read the same books as I did, liked the same TV shows, cared about the future, etc etc.  She was an inspiration to me so I started eating better, exercising more, and started studying the GMATs for business school.  We started dating sometime this past September.  I probably would have fucked up our relationship quickly, but I actually have become best friends with another girl who helped me tell me when to hold back.  My girlfriend and I hung out nearly every week.  We made out several times, and tried to have sex as well.  However, this time my ED was so bad I couldn’t even get any lift off.  After this experience, I tried explaining what my issue was but she seemed to think it was just performance anxiety.  


I know I had porn induced ED though, so I started NoFap.  Unfortunately, this was also the time our relationship got rocky.  Several things coincided at once: (1) She started this training program at work which made her inaccessible to talk during the day (2) she also was dealing with her ex hassling her (3) she was in the middle of moving apartments (4) I think I started growing super anxious due to NoFap throwing off my brain chemistry (5) I started falling in love with her since she was the first girlfriend I tried to have sex with (6) I was also probably dealing with inadequacy issues since our first attempt at sex sucked so bad that I wanted to explain.  
Ultimately, what happened was that the 2 weeks heading into the holidays, we were unable to meet up (she kept canceling/being too busy to hang out).  She also had already made new year’s plans which did not include me.  I thought this meant we were broken up, so I basically told her we should just be friends (I actually meant it bc at this point, I still really liked her).  I also read a relationship book at this time, and it basically said that if things are heading for a breakup the only way to potentially rescue it is to make the other person feel a sense of loss.  Her response to the breakup was that I was projecting my insecurities, and seemed angry at me for breaking things off.  I actually took this as a positive sign, and called her.  Basically we agreed to meet up and talk about our relationship.  Foolish me.  After the new year, she was busy the first two weekends.  The third weekend, she blocked me on social media and stopped all communication.  I sent her a message saying she was a hypocrite.  Her response was basically, “yeah, good-bye.”


So the reason I’m venting all this stuff out is lately I’ve been fantasizing about her more often.  I know we only went out for 3 months, but as I’ve admitted, I haven’t had a whole lot of experience with girls or relationships so I think I probably fall harder and faster than most guys.  It’s also a pretty stressful time in my life.  I’m on Day 60 of NoFap, I’m studying GMATs to prepare for business school, I’ve been training for a 10k, I have some issues with my health, and I’m also dealing with one of my few good friends in the area being mad at me.  On top of all this, I think I deal with a bit of an identity crisis when I’m dating.  Due to my insecurity (which I think stems from abandonment/emotional unavailability issues from my parents as a child), I tend to only try to date really hot girls (like 7s or above).  I believe I’ve had the opportunity to date more women (actually…if I’m being honest I know I have) but I only really feel vested to pursue a girl if she’s an 8 or above.  The thing with me is…on the inside I’m a nerd.  However, I do know how to dress well (I’ve been asked if I’m a metrosexual which would make my roommates crack up cuz I’ve worn stained clothing around the house), and I can be fairly charismatic when I have the energy to  (studied PUA material).  Basically, I think the girls I go after tend to be ones who are more difficult to deal with on the account of them being chased after their entire lives, and it doesn’t help that I’m so terrible at navigating relationships.  


TLDR: haven’t had much experience with dating/being in a relationship.  I rush things which leads to me ruining things.  Trying to do a lot right now, feeling overwhelmed.

1x08ih,9,2014-02-04,GF in New York and me traveling Europe. My LDR situation...,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1x08ih/gf_in_new_york_and_me_traveling_europe_my_ldr/,"I just found this subreddit. Thought I'd share my situation and get everyones thoughts. I also would love to know success stories etc. 

My gf is 20 and I am 24. I met here through a friend. She is Swedish and I am Australian. I had been living in Europe 4 years and took a trip to Sweden where I later met her after she played a music gig at a town festival in a city called Uppsala. It's important to note the my gf is a musician in a pretty well known band. 

I ended up staying and moving to Sweden from England to simply stay with her and because I love Sweden (Scandinavian lover). We were together 5 months and I had to move from my apartment (Stockholm apartments are very expensive and hard to find). I ended up moving in with her, we lived together for 10 months.

My gf left for her internship just before New Years. We never thought we'd end up doing a LDR but we fell in love and well why fuck something up that makes you both happy? We decided to go through with a LDR and it's been nearly 6 weeks, to be honest it's easier than I thought.

I decided to travel around Europe (again) and left on the 2nd of Jan. I wanted to visit some countries I hadn't seen and because travel is awesome. My gf and me find it super hard at times and for a while I was being a paranoid fool (this however passed a few weeks back). I miss everything about her but skype, facebook and other social media outlets and apps allow us to maintain heaps on contact. 

Things that bother me:

Firstly, I sometimes feel I am restricting her from having fun and being 20. I feel like her having a bf while abroad makes her have less fun. 

Second, I worry about other guys hitting on her, I know she would never cheat on me but don't know how to overcome this thing about other guys making their moves and my girl. 

Third, will things be different when I see her again in April? will she still love me? will it be awkward?

Fourth, what's the best way to keep the spark while apart?

Any advice, success stories and/or questions feel free.

1x0aio,274,2014-02-04,Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Mindcrack,Chilangosta,mindcrack,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1x0aio/everything_i_need_to_know_i_learned_from_mindcrack/,"**Intro**

A year and a half ago I wasn't doing so well. I'd gotten married just six months previously, and while our marriage was great, I wasn't doing so well in the rest of my life. And it wasn't a sudden thing; my life had kinda been sliding for a while before that as well.

I had a number of responsibilities that I just was letting slide. School, work, community stuff - I just couldn't get it to all juggle. Once in a while it would seem like I was getting things going again, and then boom, something else would happen and it felt like the whole Jenga tower just would fall over again...

**[Drowns Sorrows in Youtube]**

Then I started watching Mindcrack. I was an avid Minecraft player, but I was getting so busy that I wasn't able to get my Minecraft fix in by playing :0 and so I started watching first Etho, then SethBling (before he was one of the guys) and then I got sucked into some epic UHC episodes and because of that, started watching Pause and Beef and Doc and then I discovered Bdubs and fell in LOVE with his building style, and I went back and saw King of the Ladder, and Guude's Fun House, and the pranks, and I just started watching the community in general.

**Warm Fuzzies**

It may seem like it's all fun and games, but underneath it all lies a lot of really good, heartwarming stuff that I believe sets a good example for those that need someone to look to. It was really neat to see the livestreams to donate to charity, and the community response to help out with GennyB's cat care, and Baj's cats when he needed to find a place for them, and more recently the Bdubs family announcement! and it just is great.

More specifically though, as I started to watch these guys I became impressed with the amount of dedication and preparation it took to ""play"" like they do. This is work, and while I know it sometimes weighs on them, it also is really inspirational. I started to notice how the Etho and Bdubs (and the others as well) would start a project by gathering resources, preparing the terrain, setting up co-ops with other players, and getting it all set up in general *before* starting to work. And it had a profound effect on me. I started thinking through my days more, my future more, and almost without realizing it I began to plan the more important things in my life. It started off with my meals ('cause food is near and dear to my heart!) and with my notes from class, little things like that. Then I started to work on bigger projects in my life: organizing my desk, cleaning up after myself more, actually preparing for class beforehand so I wasn't so lost. I started putting more into my work, looking at my future career and what I wanted to do with my life. I even started to enjoy the preparation, because I knew that in my small preparations I was preparing the ground for something great.

Because there was something behind all the preparations that the Mindcrack guys make. They knew that after all the hard work came the rewards, and they had the discipline and foresight to stick to it, even when it was a *lot* of work in some cases (e.g. Ad's Casino, the Arena, the Great Flood, and many, many more). And that stuck with me. And it's made a significant difference in my life.

**Takeaways**

* My grades have gone from a D-C average to a B+-A average
* I actually understand what's being taught in class because I come prepared
* I enjoy school *soooo* much more now, which is a bigger deal even than the previous points to me
* My living conditions are much cleaner, and it makes me happy
* My relationship with my wife and friends is better
* I remember important events and dates much better
* I'm in my second internship and looking forward to a third this summer
* I have potential job offers awaiting me in a field that I *love* to work in
* I know what I want to do with my life
* I have time for my hobbies (including Minecraft) without feeling guilty for not doing other important things

In sum, I'm really, really grateful to the guys on the Mindcrack server for showing me how to live up to my dreams and meet the challenges of life. I know they don't have it easy, but they made it easier for me. I'll keep watching and keep donating for as long as they are around, because they've made me a better person, and I bet they make life better for all of you too. In more than just entertaining ways.

Oh, and we recently discovered we're expecting a baby, right around when Bdubs is! I'm stoked to be a dad with Bdubs; every time he says something about his kid it makes me happy because it reminds me of what I have to look forward to. And I hope to share these videos someday with my kids because I really believe that they are some of the best the Internet (and the world) have to offer!

###TL;DR Everything I need to know in life I learned from Mindcrack.###

1x0bel,1,2014-02-04,Tech writing intern. My boss asked me to do something that seems off... is this normal?,pleasehelptechwtr,techwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/techwriting/comments/1x0bel/tech_writing_intern_my_boss_asked_me_to_do/,"I recently accepted a technical writing internship at my college. I'm supposed to document a software process. Unfortunately, I am the department's first intern, and they didn't think through how to handle interns. I only go two days a week, but it's week four, and they still can't decide the purpose of the document or the intended audience. It's extremely frustrating. But that's not what I need to ask...

The person I work under is taking heat from someone a few levels up the org chart. I don't fully understand the issue, but I am being asked to move ALL of the work on my hard drive (including personal notes) to a SharePoint folder that can be viewed by everyone above me. I am being asked to work on a live server that can be viewed by them at any time.

My work isn't a secret, it's just that I am not accustomed to every word being tagged and monitored. I have to make every mistake in public. 

Is this how you guys work? This is my first paid tech writing gig, so I really don't know if this is normal. There's nothing I can do about it (I'm just an intern), but I'd like to know if this is a common practice in the industry. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

1x0f2s,3,2014-02-04,I have a goal and I'm going to see it out.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1x0f2s/i_have_a_goal_and_im_going_to_see_it_out/,"A few days before NYE, I was delivering a pizza to this one girl's house. When I opened the door, some guy with a Brooklyn accent gasped when he saw me and dragged me into the house. Weird shit happens to me every day so I just roll with it without freaking out. He sat me down and wanted to know what my story was, where I'm from, how my life is, yada yada. So I spill most of my beans. I tell him about my shitty childhood, losing all of my friends in college, how I just graduated and have been looking for a job. He goes off on a tangent about how they weren't really good for me anyway, how I should just let the bad wash off of me, and build my own family from my current friends. He tells me that 2014 is going to be the best year of my life and he's going to put as much energy into my future as he can. Not being much of a spiritual person, I just nod and smile. We then get up and hug each other before we go our seperate ways. 

The thing that's still bugging me about this is that I didn't tell him what would make my year the best ever. My depression has evolved over the last year to the point where my goals and ambitions have fallen to the side for a proper chance at a quick death. I used to want a family, close friends, and a happy life like the guy said but I don't want that stuff anymore. Not saying that this stranger's words are the truth or anything like that, but I'm just entertaining the thought. Because honestly, I can see me dying this year as my best year ever. 

Buuuuuuut, I don't have a decent job or a peaceful place I want to do it in (yay homelessness). I have this image in my head that I can't shake of my suicide and I don't think I would be able to get away with it if I was to cut corners. Ergo, I need money. So I've got a plan set up. There's a few things I still kind of want to experience before I die so I've got a list of goals in order to help me get there. 

1. Volunteer more, especially at my former internship site. A position is going to become available in March as one guy is going to leave for Oklahoma with his family and all of the people who have interned there before have gotten jobs when a position became available. Plus, I'm one of those people who has free time as their worst enemy so I think more time helping others is less time for self pity. 
2. Apply for jobs for only an hour a day. All this job hunting and failed interviews (HR people are straight up evil in my personal opinion) is probably stressing me out more than I need to be. Unlike others, I have a deadline on my unemployment so I shouldn't be stressing me out with my 20+ applications a day. Plus, I work about 15 hours a week at the pizza place. I don't bring in tips anymore but it's enough to where I can afford to eat.
3. Acquire an actual job.
4. Fix my car (reason I'm only working 15 hours a week).
5. Get an apartment. Preferably only a single. 
6. Buy a motorcycle. I've been wanting one for a few years now and I want to see what it's like. If possible, I want to get a black one and do a pain job on it with a few pink flowers/stars/waves. 
7. Read all of the books on my to-read list. This is going to take the longest. I'm kind of a slow reader and I have about 30 different books on my current list. Books are about the only thing that give me any joy anymore and the day I lose interest in them will be the worst day of my life.
8. Buy a gun and my favorite bottle of wine. You know the rest. 

The way I see it, this gives me enough time for something to happen to change my views/priorities to where I actually want to live another year or two. If not, I get what I want and no one loses.  "
1x0f7p,2,2014-02-04,My girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) almost completely broke. I'm trying to hold it together.,girlfriendtroubles21,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1x0f7p/my_girlfriend_21f_and_i_21m_almost_completely/,"This is pretty long winded so bare with me:

I have been with my girlfriend for almost four years. We immediately started dating our Freshman year of college. We both came from some real difficult backgrounds that are pretty relevant to our relationship. 

She comes from an abusive household (both physical and mental) which also translated into her relationships throughout High School (physical, mental and sexual). She basically spiraled out of control the summer before college and hooked up with anyone she could because of this. She came into college feeling completely broken and unloved.

I came from a family with an absent father and spent most of my high school life helping my mom keep our family together and work to pay rent. That left me unconfident in myself, very socially awkward and extremely lonely. I never had luck with girls and I never had too much time to dedicate to them with my family. I dated sparsely but came into college an unconfident, lonely man who was looking to turn things around.

So I met my girlfriend and we became fast best friends and a fast couple. We pretty much went from meeting briefly at orientation and together and had sex in 15 days. Yes, looking back it was an absolutely terrible time to get together with both of our backgrounds and we have had our troubles because of it. Our whole first year together she treated me like garbage, but I stayed with her and wanted to help her through her problems. It was an incredibly hard first year but we got through it. I had made great strides in helping her, she no longer wanted to give her body to anyone, she had more friends, was more confident, and she realized how bad she treated me and felt horrible.

She did an incredible amount for me as well. I was no longer lonely, I was incredibly more confident, my finances and life are more in order and I was more sociable. However, to help her I pretty much dedicated all of my time to her. Classic get absorbed with my Freshman year girlfriend and disregard friends.

Our sophomore year we worked more on rebuilding our social lives. She is part of a sorority and became closer with them. I did not stay friends with the group of people I hung out with them. This created a rift between the two of us because she would want to hang out with her friends and it was ""weird"" if her group hung out with me or something like that. I was always very sociable with her friends and from what I could tell they liked me.

The end of sophomore year and the start of our 3rd year I made a true group of friends. However, we both got significantly more busy with classes and work. We both focus hard on school, from our backgrounds we don't have much money of support form out families so we would just work. Our lives pretty much became work, see each other at night and pretty much just stay in because of our exhaustion. This has carried on mostly up to this point. We still did lots of fun things with her sorority events, we went on a bunch of vacations, but things were, what I realize now, very boring. 

We had lived apart for all of this. However, for this fall my girlfriend needed a roommate. She couldn't find anyone to live with and had been hinting heavily that I should ask her, since I would probably be most nights anyway. We came to a mutual agreement that we would. I began contacting realtors and sending her listings which she never commented much on. So now we get to last week.

I had made a comment about emailing a realtor and she lost it. The basic gist was she said she wasn't happy. She said she was bored all the time and our relationship didn't feel special anymore. She would comment how she would feel excited talking to older guys at her internship and when they went out after work as a team. She also dropped she didn't want to live with me and only thought it would hopefully fix our relationship but realized it wouldn't. She also said I was ""too sweet and kind, not manly and forceful"" and wasn't attracted to me anymore. Of course to send totally mixed signals she said she still loved me and cared but the passion is gone.

I wasn't completely shocked, but I was pretty shocked when she said she needed a ""break"" to sort out her feelings. The conversation ended with is agreeing to not really see each other for a little while and talk sparsely as she figured out what she wanted. We met up for brunch last weekend, talked some more, hugged, made out, and I convinced her to agree to dinner on Thursday and to consider going on a Valentine's Day trip I had planned.

I will preface the next part by saying I love my girlfriend with all of my heart. I literally think the sun shines out of this girls ass. I would and have done anything for her. We got past the bad places we were in before and I have loved her through them. I don't want this relationship to break. I realized I wrote a lot of bad about her, but she is the most caring, funny, kind, smartest, sexiest person I know. I don't know what I would do without her.

I do understand her complaints. I know if I just sit back and let her think it would be a no brainer. I need to show her that things in our relationship will change. I want them to change too, it is getting boring just coming home exhausted. So I am taking her out dancing and dinner Thursday (she LOVES to dance) and hopefully skiing next weekend. I know these gestures won't be the deciding factor but I need to show her I am dedicated to making things better. I am not going to let this just shatter.

I guess I am just really looking for advice on the situation. I love her so much, but at the same time I am mad at her, yet I understand. I just want my best friend/girlfriend back. And if it doesn't work out I don't just want to roll over and let it.

tl;dr My girlfriend says she is not longer ""in love"" with me but loves me and cares for me. I need to re-ignite that spark because she is the most important thing to me and I still feel that spark for her."

I am a current Macc student graduating in December of 2014.

I am looking for opportunities in Big4 firms after my graduation.

However, I have had not had an opportunity to do any internship in accounting field (I studied abroad instead). 

So, here is my question.

Does Big4 hire accountants with no professional accounting experience? Or do they hire interns who are recent graduates? Because I would not mind doing internship after graduation and do full-time after that.

I am interested in working in Advisory (risk, risk assurance, IT audit) field mostly.   

Thank you in advance, have a nice day everyone!





P.S. I trying get ready for the CPA exam, and it looks like the Becker review is the way to go. BUT THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE! does everybody pay it with his/her own expense? Is there a less expensive way to purchase the material?

I am fairly new in the working world. I graduated in May of 2013 with a BSBA &amp; Management, minor in economics. I have had about a year of customer service experience. This year consisted of a management internship with a hotel group. This was a great internship where I delt with customers on a daily basis. I am also very knowledgeable when it comes to Microsoft based computers. I actually would LOVE to have a job where I got to work with them / on them because after the 6-7 months I will be starting my Computer Science/Computer Engineering Degree (not sure which I will go for) from NC State.

I took my first real programming job 6 months ago. It is a programmer's dream job. Relaxed environment, free snacks/soda/coffee, really smart coworkers, awesome boss who treats us like his family. I absolutely hate my job :(

I'm not a programmer, and I don't want to be. I'm not a horribly smart guy, and I don't like to stare at code and solve pretty complex problems 8+ hours a day. I've started to hate my life. I cry at least once a week (before this job I rarely ever cried, even under great stress), I don't sleep well even though I still exercise 5-6 times a week. 

The thing that makes me want to kick myself is that I knew I didn't like programming while I was still in school. I took 2 internships during college and HATED them both. Unfortunately, they were both over for more than a year before I graduated so I thought I'd end up liking it when I got out of school. Now I just feel like I wanna die. 

Every night I come home and research other careers I could get into. All I really know is that I was the most happiest in my life when I was tutoring other kids in college in beginner Computer Science courses. I get unbelievable satisfaction out of helping people. I feel like I'd really enjoy being a therapist of some kind, but what the hell do I really know?

I just don't know what to do :( The company I work at is a small one, and my boss has done so much for me I don't want to try to abandon ship so soon, but my mental health is really deteriorating. Oh shit, what should I do? "

1x1y05,3,2014-02-04,I'm a credit noob with some (several) questions. Please!,nlw92,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1x1y05/im_a_credit_noob_with_some_several_questions/,"I just found out about this subreddit, and I can already tell it's going to extremely useful. I've been trying to research credit options and decide what kind of credit card I should get, but it's all sort of going right over my head. 

About me: I'm a recent college graduate (graduated in December), still employed at the tutoring center I worked part-time but looking for something full-time.  I have no student loans because I got scholarships out the ass. I just got married (also in December, big month for me), and my husband has a year of college left (he also has no loans). I'm 21, he's 24. He works full-time (paid internship at a chemical company, and he makes roughly $13/hr). We're financially comfortable because we're frugal and live in a town that has a really low cost of living.

I've got a car loan which will be paid off in April (woo!) that my grandpa co-signed for. I've never missed a payment, but I have been a few days late before.  No more than two days late, tops, but still late. My husband has all of our bills in his name, but has never taken out a loan for anything. Other than my almost-paid-off car, we have no debt.

We're looking to trade in his car he's had since he was 18 for something newer and a bit more reliable. We have a bit of money saved up, but we really want to build credit. We want to take out a &lt;$7,000 loan in one (or both? does that happen?) of our names, and we're also looking at credit cards to build credit so we can have a decent credit score for when we want to buy a house in two or three years. 

So I have some questions:

What kind of credit cards do you guys suggest for a young couple? We've talked about it, and we would only use the credit card to pay our bills, and then pay off the balance monthly on the  due date. I went to a website, but I was lost on all the different types of cards and interests and APRs. 

Does it ruin your credit score if a car payment has been a couple of days late? I've never been more than 2 days late, and it's only happend maybe twice in the 3  years I've had this loan, but I don't know how this stuff works. At all. 

Would a five year loan build more credit than a three year loan for the same amount? Or vice versa?

Would it build our credit faster if we both had seperate credit cards? In this situation, I would use mine for gas and he would use his for bills. We're both responsible and understand that these cards would be used for NOTHING else but bills and gas, and only for amounts that we can pay off monthly.

What kind of loans can a young couple with hardly any credit get? I have very little credit (I don't know an exact number) and I'm pretty sure he has none. 

Where can I see what my credit score is that's safe?

I'm sorry this is so long, but I'm so new at this. In college, it was just make sure my checks get to the right places at the right times, but now that we're planning on buying a home in a few years I want to get a head start so that we're not screwed when it comes time to apply for big loans. "

By SigmaQuotient",SigmaQuotient,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1x2dpu/there_and_hopefully_back_again_a_vapors_tale_by/,"In a room in a house there lived a Vapor, not a nasty dirty wet room, filled with... Oh.. sorry.
Hi all, I am sigmaQuotient and I am here to share a fun little adventure I had today pertaining to the advancement in my vaping experience. Well.. Enjoy! or don't. 
So today..I suppose technically yesterday since it is 2am EST. I had to get up far earlier than I normally awaken to this world. I was on a quest to take my beloved to the Philly airport for a plane to an internship. Living in the Berks County area, this was a good hour and a half escort quest. So no mindless mob killing or collection quests mind you.
I successfully dropped her off, with a departure filled with kisses and promises of some sweet sweet candy (BAM!) later. As I took the wrong turns, leading me deeper into the city of brotherly love...mayhap carnal.. who knows, but I hope not. Anyway, I was sitting at a traffic light contemplating where being swept out my door may take me. I figured.. HEY! I can go visit The Vapor Chef! After slambamming the coordinates into my phone, I realized ""Bummer, its kinda out of my way, and I have to go to work in a few hours.."" So, sadly I made my way back to the road that goes on and on, down to the door where it began.
Something blasted my mind with rays of intrigue and past memories of a vape shop in Phoenixville. I thought, ""well.. why the fuck not eh?"" So with my trusty steed, Sheila, The Dodge Neon, I plotted my course to lands only partially known. My destination was Liberty Vapor. While this may not seem like much to most, I have only been vaping for 4 months and have never visited a true shop. 
My vape life was a collage of websurfing for the best prices and information. With a hodgepodge of parts from different corners of the Interwebs. My vape at my side is my trusty Vamo V5 with a pink Protank II(I was under the assumption it was red, but the wonderful woman in my life has pointed out.. it is pink) with a rebuilt coil I did myself!
So I drove up the snow drifted streets of Phoenixville to find a wonderful little shop with a sign saying ""Liberty Vapor"" So I dismounted, leaving Sheila to her own accord, and proceeded to enter the shop...
I am immediately hit my the sweet sweet smell of juice. Oh and BY THE GODS it was glorious. It is a clean, beautifully put together store. I kick the snow from my boots and head inside. I sit at the bar and discuss I am a vapor and happened to stop in while on a journey. I was welcomed with open arms by these Cadillac's of men, these...Adonis's of Vapor. I set to discussing vaping while sampling their juices. All of which were lovely. 
I was tempted to purchase myself my first mech, but thought long and hard. Being reminded that I still had a journey, and Sheila needed food and rest. I decided against the purchase of batteries, mech, and RDA. Instead, I indulged myself in their Stars N Stripes juice, which is a wonderfully fresh blend of Strawberry, Blueberry, and Cream. I felt Uncle Sam firmly patting my buttocks as I decided upon it. I smiled and internally shuttered with an orgasm that George Washington probably felt as he beat up British kids. I also picked up my first RDA! an IGO-W4. So after trading currency for supplies, I said my heart felt good byes. In hopes that on my return to the airport, I will return with my lady love and show her the wonders of the shop.
 I mounted my vigilant metallic steed Sheila and drove off into the west... and kinda North. I returned home after many miles, and made my way into the room that is not nasty or dirty. I proceeded to level up my coil making skill and build my first RDA(From 28ga Kanthal and Sterile cotton) which I then took to work with me. I have been using it all day and night, and Love it!
So now, here I sit, recapping my journey with you all, and puffing away on my juice and new RDA. I hope you enjoyed my journey. It was quite fun, and mayhap in the next week, I will venture forth to the cozy tavernesque wonder which is Liberty Vapor. 
Take Care and have a wonderful night.

1x2h5u,2,2014-02-05,My [23 F] girlfriend cheated on me [23 M] after 3 years...,provoked_pinion,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x2h5u/my_23_f_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_23_m_after_3/,"So a recap on the relationship... my ex Sarah always had a crush on me, we have worked together at the same store for 7 years, and go to the same university, in the same hall. I always guessed she liked me, I wasnt too attracted to her. I dated one of her friends for a year, but there was significant time (year plus) before anything started to happen between Sarah and I. Over this time we became good friends, and one night, drunk she came from her room on the couch I was sleeping on, and started cuddling me. Confirming through mutual friends she had feelings for me, I drunkely decide to accept cuddles....This stirred some feelings up for me.. I was confused, feeling guilty and figured I would ask her out, and simply end it if I chose to. I was her first boyfriend, and her first sexual partner

My feelings grew and we dated for three years, going on multiple trips, some with her family, one to Europe. Going to school she gots a 8 month long co-op internship in a city two hours away. We make it for 7 months but by this point I know somehing has been wrong for about 2 months and I am trying to keep it together knowing she will move back within a month...hoping this will help. Halloween rolls around, I have school assignments due and I idiotically tell her to go party with friends. I trusted her

Sarah is sometimes the type of drunk girl that loves attention and will do anything to get it, usually drinking herself into a puking mess. Halloween I figure was one of those nights for Sarah and she decides to kiss her brothers best friend. She texts me at 1130 saying how much she loves me... A week roll by and the distance between us is growing. I barely get any response from texts, and she won't answer my phone calls. (I don't know yet). 

She comes home on the weekend and I immediately ask her if she wants to hangout or is she going to dump me? She starts crying shouts ""YES... ""
I ask her why? 
""Because we have been growing apart....""
""Well we have been long distance, and it has been hard but we are so close...""
""But yes but we don't share the same politcal or religious views..""
I now start getting angry and suspicious and ask her what the real reason is... After bugging her for a half hour she finally blurts out I CHEATED..I flipped out, going off in a manic rage. I go to my friends house and tell him the news. He looks really guilty and says...
""ya, I know she called me the night it happened, she was really drunk... She wasn't going to tell you... I had to give her an ultimatum of either her or me, tell you.""

So now it has been 4 months and she decided to come work at the same store as me. Awkward. I didn't talk to her till last week. I saw her at school she waved and I said hi, like a moron. I don't want to give off the impression I forgive. I can't forgive she betrayed me, and did something all her friends, all my friends, and even myself thought I was the more likely to do. Cheat. Betray everything. We were slowly talking about marriage! In this frame of mind I texted her saying I still haven't forgave. The conversation evolved into the topic of if we could be friends. Truth is I miss her, all I want is random coffee hangouts. She doesn't think it is possible and we are back to no talking. I know, I am pathetic

Now after this story I have two questions...
1. Do you think I should be friends with her?

To piss you off I will close with this stupid question... 

Should I delete her from facebook? I don't know the ettiqute of the web...

So yesterday my ketostix finally arrived in the mail (damned local pharmacist wouldn't give them to me!) so this morning I said I'd give it a go as I'd a sneaking suspicion that I was out of ketosis.

I've been on keto for about three weeks, I'm really enjoying it. I'm liking the new recipies and I lost 10lbs in the first fortnight. The only issue is, this week I've seen my weight slowly creeping up and I've gained another 3lbs this week. I really don't know what gives.

When I peed on the stick this morning I got a dark shade, roughly between the last and second last colours. Kind of a dark reddy purple. Does this mean I'm in ketosis? If so shouldn't I continue to see weight loss? The only factor I can think of that I didn't have these past two weeks is that I started an internship so have been having coffee in the mornings at work (almond milk &amp; stevia) but I track everything in MFP and I don't seem to go over 50g of carbs.

I'm not really sure if this post makes any sense, it's a bit rambling. I guess what I'm asking is what does my ketostix reading mean and what can I do to boost my fat burning again?

**TL;DR** Ketostix were dark, but I'm gaining weight. Wondering what I'm doing wrong?"

1x2p8d,10,2014-02-05,Sometimes there's just too much to overcome: reflections a month after my ex [23F] and I [25M] of 2 years broke up.,ElColombo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x2p8d/sometimes_theres_just_too_much_to_overcome/,"##tl;dr: We met, we loved, we tried, we lost, I will miss her dearly and wish her all the best.

---   
Almost a month ago, my ex (23f) and I (25m) broke up.

We met in college about 3 years ago and after developing a very intense and involved friendship, we started dating about a year later. She was an international student from Taiwan and I was a guy from the suburbs just north of NYC. We spent a year together dating at the university together before I graduated and moved back home in December of 2012. This was when our long-distance relationship started.

The year was filled with its ups and downs. Being apart after having essentially lived together for almost a year tested our relationship, our trust, and the love we shared. Her graduation this past December became the turning point in our relationship.

Before we started dating, we realized that there were feelings brewing and we discussed what would become of a relationship given the possibility that she may have to return to Taiwan after graduation. We decided that we would make the most of it and deal with whatever hand we were dealt when the time arrived. If she needed to leave, so be it; we would deal with it then if it came to that. Neither of us wanted to get married for papers; we wanted to do this by working towards our own stable lives. We slowly began working towards a future for ourselves.

Truth be told, I did not help our cause by starting my year terribly. I took a break for a few months to sit back and relax, not realizing how hard it would be for me to find a job, much less in my own career field. Months passed and the odd jobs I took didn't last. I was stuck in financial limbo, clawing my way to stay afloat. It was a constant source of stress. The feeling of working consecutive low-paying jobs did nothing for my self-esteem. It wasn't until September that I landed a steady job at a factory in another state for just above minimum wage. I was not the happiest, but it provided stability. It lasted up until about December when I left that job to work as a Chinese delivery guy throughout the month of December, a job I still have on weekends. I work a second during the week now too.

Her year was very different. She balanced internships and jobs, all while studying hard to graduate early. She lived a busy schedule. We met just about once a month for anywhere in between three days to a week at a time. Considering what other long-distance relationships have to work through, we had it pretty good. Nonetheless, the distance slowly affected us and changed the nature of the relationship. I could manage, but it was never something she was really comfortable with; we were a dynamite couple together in person and a different couple apart. We looked forward to those monthly visits and always had a blast together up until the moment we had to part again.

The weeks leading up to graduation were stressful. I provided all the support and love I could as finals and deadlines for papers loomed ever closer. Soon, she would finally be able to reap the fruits of her hard labor. To celebrate her graduation, her mother arranged a trip from Taiwan to be with us. It would be the first time I'd meet either parent. I drove us up to school. The week I spent with them at and after graduation was fantastic. We would see her mom off two weeks later and spend the New Year together in my city.

Upon arrival in my city, it was clear that something had changed.

&gt;""Last month, I was sure that you were the one for me. Now, I'm not sure if we're gonna last the year.""

It hit me as a complete surprise. That night, she asked me if I was sure that she was my forever girl. I didn't hesitate answering.

On our last night together, she told me:

&gt;I wish I didn't have to leave because when we're together, everything is perfect.

By the end of her visit, she wanted to take some time to think about things. My heart sank in fear of the worst. About a week of waiting later, the video call came. It started off well; we shared stories of our days apart. She asked if I had done any thinking over the break.

&gt;""I want you to know that whatever your decision is, I will understand and accept it because I know that you'll have thought it through.""

My chest tightened as the conversation led closer to the moment I had been dreading since the break.

&gt;""I spent some time thinking about it and I realized...that I love you...but only as a best friend.""

Heartbreaking doesn't even come close.

&gt;""I want to us stay friends though because I don't want to throw away the years and memories we have had up to this point.""

I felt the same way. I accepted that this must have been a very difficult decision for her to make. We continued talking and even managed a few smiles towards the end. We made plans to chat again soon.

In a separate letter to my mom, she wrote that she and I didn't have the same goals, priorities or expectations anymore and that for her our romantic relationship was at an end. She saw us taking different paths and thanked her for accepting her into our family and for the hospitality she received over the years.

We sent reddit links to each other almost daily just like we used to and sent a few texts back and forth, but that important feeling that we shared was gone. It was a big loss. I was shaken. Her absence in my heart was deafening. It was really over. The relationship was really done and gone. She was no longer my girl. I held onto those messages and links because as much as they hurt, they held a certain comfort, a familiarity that made me feel as warm as much as they brought me to tears. I later realized that this was very unhealthy, so a few days later I sent her this message:

&gt;Hey XXXXXX,

&gt;I hope you've been well.

&gt;The messages and links you've been sending me lately have been great and entertaining, but I'm sorry to say that I made a mistake in wanting such casual contact so soon.

&gt;I'm still in a lot of pain and as exciting as every link you send me is, it really hurts. I need some space and time to heal.

&gt;I know this may come as a disappointment to you considering you were hoping to have all of us play League together again soon, but it's for the best that I have time to myself to help me get my emotions all sorted out. Wouldn't want to get into team fights late into a match and have your carry unable to carry on, you know.

&gt;I want you to know that I'm still interested in being friends in the future if you are too; it's just not the right time for me.

&gt;With your web class probably in full swing by now, your job starting soon, your editing position filling your days with awful writing, and god knows how many other things you're planning on throwing yourself into, I wish you lots and lots of success with all of it. Know that I'm rooting for you.

&gt;I'll be working my butt off too. And browsing Reddit.

&gt;Your friend, ElColombo

I must have read through that letter 400 times, trying to build up the courage to send it. It was hard penning it but I understood that it needed to be done. I didn't expect to receive a letter back, but one came.

&gt;I understand completely. To be honest I've been thinking the same thing, but was too stubborn to admit it because I was the one who insisted on remaining friends. I'm sorry that the contact has been causing you pain; you're right, it's still way too early.

&gt;Take all the time you need. When you feel good and ready, I will be here.

&gt;Thank you, XXXXXX

I broke down reading that last line. I still do.

I don't believe I was a very bad man. My successes were far and few. I struggled with depression and long strings of consecutive failures. But I can sit here and tell you all that I never wavered in my love for her. In my support of her and her goals. In the belief that we could work through these hard times and come out the outer side stronger, together. I tried my best to give her the comforts of family and friends here in the states. In the face of so many obstacles, I really tried.

Now, a month later, I sit here after what feels like an eternity of thinking, talking, listening, crying, and moping to say that as sad as I still am that she is not in my life nor love me anymore, I believe the breakup was the best thing to happen to us. It served as the great motivator to keep improving myself, but not for someone else this time. I'm doing it for myself now. I also came to understand that as we were, we were never going to succeed. I was stuck in a terrible place and she was at a turning point in her life with so many roads available to her. We had discussed getting an apartment together, but we had no end date or solid plans. We didn't cheat, we didn't fight, we were always supportive but the circumstances beat us.

I promised myself that I would only consider contacting my ex not only after I had the financial and social stability I want to have, but can also accept that she will also move forward and do what's best for her, in love and in life. I want to make sure I can be happy for her own success and happiness. Because she deserves it and our relationship was completely worth it. It will be a long time. I will miss this girl not just as a lover, but also as my best friend.

If I could talk to her now, I would tell her this:

&gt;Thank you for all the great memories and moments we were able to share together. The love we had will find its place in our pasts and I will treasure it and remember it fondly. Thank you for giving me your support through those rough times last year. I told you how much your words and kindness meant to me then and I want you to know that your encouragement has helped me get to this point. I hope that we can both grow from this.

&gt;It's alright that we didn't last forever; I'm just glad we had the chance to meet and experience life with each other for a while. I don't know when we'll talk or if our paths will cross again, but I wish you all the best.

&gt;Take care.

&gt;Your friend, ElColombo

They underpaid me by about 20% for a software development intern. I got hired full time. They underpaid me by about 20%. I found another job, they gave me a raise, still low considering experience and skills. I stayed.

But today I got an offer they can't beat. My current job keeps me 10 years behind the current standard--the new one won't. The new one is going to START me at a 15% raise with better benefits. They're a huge company, great name on the resume. Its development in a niche that will result in my market value doubling in a few years and they're going to train me. 

But I'm almost shaking, I've been working here for 4 years now. They're going to do good things and its scary leaving. I'm good friends with the other developer here and we're going to have a poker night the weekend before I'd start a new job. This is my first job out of college and I love the people I work with, it just doesn't pay well and its actually hindering my career. And I've been job hunting for so long, it wasn't an actual reality that I might leave and it all hit home 20 minutes ago. How will they function without me? 

I'm scared and happy and excited and worried and nervous all at once. Holy shit holy shit holy shit.

I'd be more than happy to answer any questions or go over more details.

I was just offered a position to work for an NBA team as their in-house graphic designer without even having to apply for the gig. Here's how:


* Earned Div. 1 athletic scholarship - allowing me to network within inside my school's Athletic Dept.

* Got injured my senior year, with all the extra time I still wanted to help out my school and the Athletic Dept.

* Noticed a major need for graphics and visuals 

* Begged and pleaded for the head of marketing to allow me to help out with designs

* Basically created my own internship position

* Created graphics and visuals for athletic dept. for the remaining 6 months of school.

* Cold-called EVERY single pro sports franchise/college with Div. 1 sports to see if I could intern after I finished school

* Created a Behance page to showcase my designs and to further network with professionals

* Follow and tweet at professionals that are doing what I want to do - pick their brains!

* Out of the 300+ or so I contacted, I'd say 90% didn't even bother responding and the most that did so ""no"". But it was those handful of connections that yes/maybe/or let me connect you with someone that might, that got me where I am today.

* Graduated school with a degree in Education/Pyschology

* Ended up accepting a paid internship with an NFL team for 9 months.

* Got a call from one of the same connections I made while still in school that said ""Hey I have a position open, it's your's if you want it""

**Main takeaway from my experience = have a solid/relevant portfolio and NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK**


Like I said, I'd be more than happy to answer questions or go over some more details

I need help, or just someone to talk to. I'm only thirteen, and today my boyfriend (now ex boyfriend) broke up with me. I don't want to hear ""You're too young to date!"" Or whatever else you can come up with, because I know. I believed that with all my heart. But I gave in and dated the guy. 

Today I he told me he wants to break up. I told him that it was fine, and we went our separate ways. I teared up a little, but I wasn't sobbing, I didn't beg him to stay with me. I thought it would be hard, but I was okay.

Was. But I went to my closest friends and told them what happened. I told them that ""I thought it would be hard, but I'm okay."" And that ""I can do better."" At that point, I was feeling pretty good about myself. But then two of the three friends I confided in started yelling at me. Saying how I didn't appreciate him enough, and that now I'm acting like I don't care. I felt (and still feel) incredibly hurt and upset, that the people I trusted are turning against me because supposedly ""I wasn't a good enough girlfriend."" At thirteen. He was my first boyfriend. I don't know what I should of been doing. I didn't even know I was doing something wrong. Eventually, my closest and most trusted friend sent me this: 

okay, here is what im going to say:

i understand that sean broke up with you, not the other way around. i know exactly why he did it too, because i was the ONLY one he talked to about it. he wasnt happy because no matter what he did for you, you didnt seem to care. AT ALL. i think you were too blind to see it, or you didnt see it because you didnt give a shit about him in the first place. dont worry, i know that you told riley that you werent sure if you liked him for him, or because you liked the thought of him liking you. think about that...what do you say now? also, think about this, not only during your relationship did you hurt sean by not responding to his feelings, but during your relationship you hurt the group. your ego has grown too strong, otherwise i would be taking partial sides with you, but due to what has been going on the past few weeks, it needs to stop. want to know what it was that has been happening? well, things have been awkward because you think so highly of yourself that everybody else has to go last. your ego! dont even get me started! ""Im a barbie, i am cute, i am perfect!"" your ego...has ruined our friendship...this has come to an end. i chose sean because i knew he could be happier, i know pretty much everything about him, things that only tom and i know, etc. also because you said you could do better. HE GAVE YOU EVERYTHING A GIRL COULD POSSIBLY WANT! HOW COULD YOU HURT SOMEBODY WHO WOULD SACRIFICE THEIR LIFE TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE HAPPY?! *sigh* dont be sad. be happy. you have such burdens, like me and sean, out of your life now. oh, and he could do WAY fucking better than some cold hearted...no. im done. fuck you, and goodnight.
And look on the bright side, now you can focus on your career.

So now I'm crying because I lost my best friend, when I didn't mean to do anything wrong, and I feel bad that I'm more upset over loosing  her than I am about loosing my first boyfriend. But at the same time, I don't get why it's a problem to like myself. I know it makes it seem like every five minutes I compliment my self.  I don't. But I am comfortable in my developing thirteen year old body. I do think that I'm beautiful.  I do think that I'm perfect, but I also think that everyone is perfect in their own way. I didn't know it was a problem to love yourself. And about the whole ""And look on the bright side, now you can focus on my career. "" that came about because I'm applying to a internship at my local zoo, which is something I've been wanting to do since I was three.

Two X, I feel hurt and betrayed. The people I trusted turned against me, and I feel completely alone. My closest friend used my dreams against me, and I am just lost and upset and I don't know how I'll go to school tomorrow.

Plus I have awful cramps right now.

I'm an intern at an office, and I've worked there for a month. I'll be there until August, so about 7 months I'll be there.

Anyway, my coworkers are cool and whatever, and we talk about shit and hang out right? Well my 21st birthday is coming up in the next few months, and of course they want to take me out to celebrate (I'm in a new city, too far to meet up with college friends).

It sounds like they're pretty set on taking me to a strip club. 

First of all, they don't know I'm gay (and single). Second, Most of them are pretty republican, so I'm not sure how shit will fly if I told them (or if they found out somehow?). I have no idea how I would give them the fyi in the first place.

But here's another thing: I think going to a strip club sounds like a blast. Seriously, having a naked woman sit on my lap and titties in my face actually sounds pretty fun, despite my sexual/relationship preferences. Sounds like an adventure to me.

So it's an interesting situation. I don't know how they, knowing my sexual preferences, would feel about taking me to a strip club. Would it be like a big joke? Or would they be uncomfortable, resulting in me being uncomfortable? It's a great mystery. 

If I did nothing until my birthday, they would take me assuming I'm all straight and shit. And while I would probably have a good time, it would likely end up being a big act on my part. And if they found out *after* they took me? How would they react? Would it be funny, or would they feel bad...? Hard to tell- how it would go down might partially depend on my own actions.

So, readers, without even knowing these people or the dynamic of the office, **any ideas?**

I am going to post this from my main account, not a throwaway, because screw it. I have nothing to hide. LOL.

I am feeling a bit ashamed and pretty panicky when I write this. I just realized something, it dawned upon me and HIT ME, and now I need to take deep breaths. Here goes. (Haha why is this so dramatic?)

I graduated college in Spring 2013 and have been underemployed ever since. I was employed for the summer in a paid fellowship that I loved and learned a lot from. In the fall to now, I took on a paid internship in a field that I would like to work in the future. During other times, I job search and have submitted hundreds of applications and interviewed with dozens of companies with no full time job at the moment.

Here I am. Despite my usual full time job searching routine, I have been applying to these exciting fellowship opportunities that last a summer or year at most. For a long, long, time I was scared to apply to a full time job because I didn't want to commit. I was scared that I would feel chained down to my full time job, and that would be the rest of my life.

I sought to apply to these temporary internships and fellowships that last a couple of months because that seemed exciting and dynamic to me.

However, I believe I am heading down the road of being a **perpetual intern**. I started interning (unpaid and paid) in college and am still continuing today! Where will it end? Yes, there is something wrong with the current employment system that punishes recent college graduates for not having enough ""work experience"" that seemingly only be filled with internships (many of which are unpaid).

**My realization at this moment:** I need to actively demand for work. I need to move beyond my fears of being ""tied down"" to a full time job, because a full time job provides security, stability (for the most part) and much more. I would respect me if I had a full time job. My family and friends would respect me a lot more if I had a full time job. 

My dear readers, thank you for your time. Does anyone else feel this way? Let's rant/rage/talk/laugh/CRY???! together. **To all unemployed/underemployed recent graduates out there, I feel you!!** "

The movie starts with a tour of the new Metropolis “Memorial” Museum in honor of those who passed away during the “Terraforming Incident” of the previous film. We later see that from the crashed Kryptonian ships, radioactive crystals have broken off and been displayed in the museum and are said to be worth millions of dollars. After an explosion, we cut to a news report being told by Viki Vail in Metropolis where 6 guys are holding the museum hostage. The first appearance of Superman will be shortly after Clark Kent disappears from reporting on the current robbery and from there we can have a classic superman transformation scene (Minus the whole phone booth thing). Superman then, swoops into action making another big example of his immense power for intimidation. But as the robbers start loading up the bags, he begins to feel the same way he felt on General Zod’s ship, with his body slowly becoming mortal and dyeing away. Cut to Gotham city where Billionaires Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor attend a gala in honor of the Wayne Foundation helping rebuild Metropolis with Lexcorp. In this instance we see what business men Lex and Bruce are exchanging ideas for the future of their cities whilst they give their thoughts about this new Superman who effectively caused the destruction of half a city.

Lois Lane and new Daily Planet intern, Jimmy are there out of interest for Lex but then Lois gets distracted by Bruce.

EDIT:
-I may add some conflict in the relationship between Lois and Clark, making it seem like he’s being an arrogant, overprotective boyfriend since he can’t hope to lose her – Kind of like the relationship between Connor and Megan in “Young Justice”.

This will show the audience how much of a ladies man Bruce is and will show an even stronger difference when compared to his night life. Then people instantly get silent, as a TV screen displayed at the gala switches to the news report and talks about Superman’s weak mental and physical state. Bruce then makes up an excuse and leaves Lois alone with Lex and runs off into the night. At this point, Lex could look at the screen and give a small smile indicating that there’s a weakness to this menace that he can exploit. Cut back the robbery, Superman is tied up and is slowly dying whilst the police have the place surrounded. All the lights turn off and we get our second action scene. Although Batman would not be seen in this sequence (Being a myth in the eyes of the citizens), we’ll know who the robbers are dealing with by seeing the cape, Batarangs and quick-cut fighting scenes. So Batman, through some “Arkham City” action, picks off the robbers one by one and ties them up. He looks over at Superman and says, “You’ll be alright… Clark!” The cops then storm the museum and see Batman lurking in the shadows. Here we’ll see than Batman is indeed, an outlaw as he’ll beat up the cops attempting to arrest him and then escape with a gas bomb. The cops then untie superman, put the deadly crystals back, but notice that one is missing, Superman has an idea of who might have stolen it.

In the next scene, Bruce is in the Batcave analyzing the Kryptonite and Alfred could remark, “I haven’t seen you down here in quite some time” since this is an older and seasoned batman. He also notices the many bruises and cuts on his body and the torn up Batsuit. We then get a wide angle shot of the entire cave. As bats swarm all around, the camera pans down and we see Jason Todd’s (The second Robin who died in “Under the Red Hood”) Robin suit and the Bat-Tank. Then Alfred sees the Kryptonite, looks to the left, and says “Quite the collection you’ve made since his discovery”, we see Kryptonian scout ship parts, General Zod’s armor, and Jor-El’s command key he gave to Kal.

EDIT:
-The command Key thing may change in time as Lex Luthor might need it to access the vessel’s holographic recordings

So Batman has basically been hording this new alien tech and analyzing ways in which Superman can be sustained, should he ever turn on the public (Like in the animated film “Justice League: Doom”). Cut to Lexcorp, Lex Luthor has also done his share of scavenging as he was able to salvage the Kryptonian vessel with Jor-El’s holographic recordings salvaged. He learns all about Kryptonian history and Superman’s true identity along with his weakness when exposed to the green crystals. Cut to the daily planet, as Clark is laying down on his desk, tired and weak from the other day, Perry White comes in and tells him he should take the rest of the day off and is quite frustrated how he wasn’t there during the robbery to take photos.

Lois Lane gets invited to the Wayne Manor on her last night in Gotham before she returns to Metropolis.

EDIT:
-Now, Lois is not an idiot, she wouldn't blindly accept a dinner date with a guy she just met the other day, but seeing as how she’s angry at Clark, and we could add in a moment where on the TV she sees Superman carrying a wounded woman out of the crime scene after the robbery, she agrees out of jealousy.

This will transition into a scene that reflects the original Batman film from 1989 where they’re having dinner together. It starts to rain and though the window, we see Superman looking with a face of envy and flies off to his mother’s farm to visit. He tells her how he’s haunted by the events of the last film what with breaking Zod’s neck and allowing thousands more to die in the process. She tells him that he shouldn’t be too hard on himself and should focus on making the world a better place. Then, Lex Luthor himself comes down on a helicopter with a swat team and they attempt to arrest Clark for being Superman.

EDIT:
-This scene varies in my head in terms of who should be the one to arrest Superman, I had the idea since there has to be a Wonder Woman in there somewhere, it could be CIA Agent Diana Prince who steps out of the chopper saying “Mr. Kent, Agent Prince CIA, you are under arrest for crimes against humanity, you have the right to remain silent etc.”

Clark of course thinks its Batman who figured out his identity and told Lex/the government seeing as how they’re business partners with connections. So he flies back to Gotham city to grab Lois but sees that she’s not there. He instantly assumes she was kidnapped (When really she’s on a plane headed back to Metropolis). He receives a note telling him to head to the Indian Ocean (The location where the first Terraformer hit in the first film) which has now been reduced to a barren wasteland with dunes of sand and rock. This is where the fight between Superman and Batman will take place, seeing as how both the gravity levels have not yet evened out and there’s some nuclear fallout which effectively caused the Kryptonite to be formed and the sky to blackout and block the sun.

So Superman lands and looks around at the crumbling mountains, and uses his X-Ray vision to see if he can track Batman’s location. Suddenly, out the sand, the Bat-Tank jumps out firing countless missiles at Superman knocking him down. The tank then accelerates towards him and Batman ejects and extends his cape briefly making a bat symbol in the sky and dives down. The tank then rams Superman and explodes. After Batman lands, Superman then flies towards him ready to attack. The gears in Batman’s right arm grind back and lunge forward punching Superman, creating a big shockwave with every hit. Superman gets angry and punches Batman a few meters back. While he flies back, Batman does a backflip and throws 2 Batarangs with Kryptonite tips, stabbing Superman in the arm and chest. They then detonate and Superman loses balance and falls to the floor. He looks up and Batman lands another punch, jumps over Superman, grabs his cape, and then slams him on the ground. Superman then gets pissed, and picks up Batman, this then reveals that he’s wearing a modified version of Zod’s armor which he salvaged. He then gets a flashback of Zod removing his armor. After seeing who Batman is under his mask (With X-Ray vision), he creates a possible scenario in his head where Luthor reclaims the armor and gives it to Bruce Wayne. Superman then slams Batman through the ground and they end up in a cave. Batman disappears into the shadows right before Superman lands and then throws a sonic radar onto Superman causing hundreds of bats to swarm him. Superman then throws punch after punch but keeps missing batman. Batman’s and Superman’s fists then collide causing another shockwave but cracking Batman’s bones and breaking through the modified gauntlet. Batman then raises his left hand and sprays a longer lasting agent of powdered Kryptonite and then kicks Superman in the face.

Bruce then, takes off his torn mask and says his famous line, “I want you to remember, Clark, in all the years to come, in your most private moments, I want you to remember my hand at your throat. I want you to remember the one man who beat you."" Lex Luthor, in a later scene announces a nuclear doomsday weapon headed for the United States launched by Russia (Which he, himself launched in order to get credit for stopping it) and is laced with tons of Kryptonite so Superman can’t stop it.

EDIT:
-Now we’ve already had alien threats made in the previous film and using that as an excuse would keep the audience wondering why we haven’t seen anything introducing this threat to begin with. Russia is a more likely foe, being the main nuclear opponent/rival to the United States. Plus, in Frank Miller’s story, it was the Soviet Union who launched an EMP missile at the US cutting all the power.

We then zoom out of a TV screen inside Wayne Manor where Superman is healing and Batman is repairing the Batsuit. He then tells Clark his whole story and how he is in no way affiliated with Lex and that he isn’t the problem they should focus on (The irony being, that Lex is clearly pulling all the strings in this big plan) Superman asks Batman why he couldn’t just talk it through with him rather than having a big meaningless fight, Bruce tells him it’s because he wanted to show that Superman has weaknesses and that if one man can discover his identity and a way to defeat him, then it’s possible others will in time (Showing how incompetent and vulnerable Batman thinks he is). Superman remarks “I have to go save them” then zooms into action and Batman gets into his jet and follows.

Superman tries to get close to the nuke but gets weakened and starts falling through the air, crashing into Batman’s jet wing on his way down. Batman then ejects and fires a grapple gun to the rocket and latches onto it with new magnetic attachments on his suit. He sees that it’s been laced with Kryptonite and manages to disable the rocket, shortly before a Lexcorp counter weapon guns it down and destroys it after Batman disables it. Cut back to the Batcave, Bruce is analyzing data he collected from the rocket after disarming it and sees it was launched by Lexcorp and the nuclear war threat was a hoax. The movie ends at the daily planet where Clark is reunited once again with Lois, Perry then turns on the TV and we see a presidential campaign held by none other than Lex Luthor saying, “Where was Superman at our time of need? He destroys half of our great city, and nearly lets the Russians finish the job! Thanks to Lexcorp, we were able to avoid the attack and I promise to keep this country safe should an event like this ever occur again.” And that’s my general theory craft.

EDIT:
-Now you can see that since the last film, the steaks have gone up. Not only have the morals of the first film been addressed, but the plot wholes and inconsistencies have been wrapped up. People weren’t too sure about trusting Superman, he then saves the world (Although at a terrible cost) and everyone’s happy. In the second film we see him become an outlaw just like Batman and the fact that Luthor becomes president makes him even more powerful than the both of them combined (Politically)."
1x5xjg,0,2014-02-06,"My (M/22) fiancee (F/21) and I are getting married in a year, and I kind feel like a bum.",MyFakeProfile,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x5xjg/my_m22_fiancee_f21_and_i_are_getting_married_in_a/,"I've (M/22) been together with my fiancee (F/21) for just over a year and we plan to be married next year. 


Basically, we have been given $2000 by my fiancee's parents towards the wedding. They implied (from what I could tell) that if we needed any more help that we should definitely ask them, but that we should take very close care of how we budgeted that money because, ""Hey, there might be more, there might not."" 


A condition that they gave us with the money was that they ""preferred"" we used $900 of that $2000 for the venue that they were wanting. Fine. Totally cool with that (on account of the fact that over a month ago they said that they were not even coming to the wedding). 


If they want to give us money and pay for the venue/whatnot- cool. Awesome.


But now my fiancee and I are butting heads a little about where money is coming from. 


I just started working at a 15 hr/week making $13 an hour (part time possition that will hopefully turn into a full time job by the time that we get married next year) that is also counting as an internship. I am also living with my parents back at home for the moment now that I don't live on my college campus anymore. 
It's a rough commute (over an hour), but I don't have to pay rent, food or laundry (and a few bucks to help with gas isn't too bad either).


My fiancee lives on her campus Monday-Thursday, comes back to the area and stays at her parents' house Thursday-Sunday where she works in town at her job as much as they will allow her before she goes back to campus again Sunday night. Her parents are slightly less helpful towards her, but it's just a difference in culture between her family and mine.


I've been trying to help out as much as I can with wedding planning while working and taking online classes to finish my degree (final semester of undergrad taking 26 credit hours to finish degree on schedule- May of 14. Woo!) I feel like there are times where she says she wants my help, but is just saying that out of obligation.


Photography. We've looked into a couple of photographers (mostly personal friends who have their own photography businesses) and the cheapest they would give us was $950. Woof. But! Her older brother and sister-in-law told us a little while ago that if we used the photographer that they used for their wedding, they would pay for it. 


That's all well and good, but we both looked at the pictures on the photographer's facebook page and neither of us were too terribly impressed. They were...good. Acceptable if someone else was paying for them. But we were still wanting to look around. 


After finding we couldn't afford any of the people we were talking to, we decided we were fine with what we had and would survive. A couple days ago, I saw a friend of a friend online who we had not considered for photography. I sent him a message and asked if he did weddings, and if so, how much. I then let my fiancee know that I had contacted him and things went from there. 


I told her about the guy, she said that she thought we had settled for her brother's photographer. I told her that we had, but we had been doing research and I figured we hadn't looked into this person yet and it wouldn't hurt to ask. She told me that if she is paying for it, then she is going with the free option. This caught me off guard because I was under the impression that we were BOTH paying for our wedding. She told me that one of us needed to be saving money and that it was a lot easier for me to save money since her parents don't help her out as much as mine help me. 


She then told me that traditionally, the bride's parents pay for the wedding, and since they were *only* giving us $2000, she was taking the responsibility of the rest on herself and because, ""That's traditionally how it's done"" (that the bride's side takes care of the wedding). She then added in, ""And by the way, when are you getting another job?""


I told her that I was under the impression that we were both paying for things but she said I needed to be saving my money for when we get started as a couple. True. And I plan to do that. And pay for our Honeymoon and work out an apartment. But I also feel like she is treating money as an all or nothing deal.


Is this really a money thing or is this a control thing? Should I worry about it either way? OR! Should I try to work out another job so that I can put her mind at ease, showing that money, though potentially difficult, will not be impossible? Should I try to see if she is willing to rely on my help or should I just continue saving?


**tl;dr; - Fiancee claims she is the only one who is paying for our wedding (and is stubborn and won't accept very much outside help). Can't decide if she is using that as a final word on decision making for our wedding or if she is concerned and I should try to get another job to put her mind at ease.**

1x61pi,4,2014-02-06,Man of Steel Sequel Fan Fiction,TheRadReticle,FanFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/1x61pi/man_of_steel_sequel_fan_fiction/,"So since the Man of Steel sequel has been pushed back to 2016 with a rather questionable cast of actors, I thought it would be a good idea to take another look at a possible theory of how I think this film will play out.

The movie starts with a tour of the new Metropolis “Memorial” Museum in honor of those who passed away during the “Terraforming Incident” of the previous film. We later see that from the crashed Kryptonian ships, radioactive crystals have broken off and been displayed in the museum and are said to be worth millions of dollars. After an explosion, we cut to a news report being told by Viki Vail in Metropolis where 6 guys are holding the museum hostage. The first appearance of Superman will be shortly after Clark Kent disappears from reporting on the current robbery and from there we can have a classic superman transformation scene (Minus the whole phone booth thing). Superman then, swoops into action making another big example of his immense power for intimidation. But as the robbers start loading up the bags, he begins to feel the same way he felt on General Zod’s ship, with his body is slowly becoming mortal and dyeing away. Cut to Gotham city where Billionaires Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor attend a gala in honor of the Wayne Foundation helping rebuild Metropolis with Lexcorp.

Currently I study psychology in an European country. However, my goal is to work in China after graduation. Therefore, I would like to take the necessary steps now and acquire the skills which will help me in China. 
Besides psychology (which mostly prepares me for a career in Human Ressources) I am also interested in computer science. Please note that teaching English is not an option for me since my native languages are German and Russian (was brought up bilingual). 
In conclusion: what can or should I do now to prepare for a career in China? What level of Mandarin should I have? (are intermediate skills an advantage?) Should I aim for Foreing Companies or Chinese companies? Is it possible or advised to do an internship in China?
Thank you very much."

I started in May for my internship and got an offer and started full time in December after I graduated. 

I work at a financial center and the main guy and my boss gave me a great offer in the long run, but terrible pay up front. The plan was for me to go through a few tax seasons and get experience as well as my CPA and MPaCC. Then they wanted me to open up a tax and insurance office in another town close by. It sounded like a great opportunity and I took it.

But now, as I am seeing how the small business works during tax season and others I do not see myself wanting to be here long term or have my own firm in the future. The pay right now is not good and no benefits do not help. They said they would help pay for Becker and MPaCC. But when I was talking to my boss the other day she said she didn't know if they could help at all. 

I majored in accounting because I really loved the financial part of it and bookkeeping and payroll for small businesses is not anything I would like to do as my career. 

Sorry I am rambling, my question is: should I start studying and pay fully for becker on my own like I was planning to do right after tax season or wait until I find a new job and then see if there would be any help. I am willing to pay for becker and start studying for CPA but do not want to waste my time or money if it would not help in this job search.

So I want to start lifting weights. I'm a very overweight 20/f and I don't want to lose it all through cardio because I'm afraid of loose skin.

I have no problem going online and finding some beginner workouts (I think I'm going to go with bodybuilding.com's Jamie Eason's LiveFit Trainer!) and I have no problem figuring out how to do them and all that.

The only problem is the gym... I'm a university student and I work for our school's media company... I have 25 people working under me and EVERY TIME I'm at the gym I see at least one of my interns, and some of them clearly lift. And usually I see other people I know from class, etc.

Also, the area where I want to lift, is in the middle of the cardio floor and near the lockers so literally EVERYONE passes by there.

So how do I get over my embarrassment? I'm worried my interns aren't going to take me seriously at work if they see me at the gym looking like a moron trying to figure out how to lift. And it's embarrassing to see people I know."
1x6x0r,1081,2014-02-06,I got pregnant at 19 and chose to keep it.,mn270411,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1x6x0r/i_got_pregnant_at_19_and_chose_to_keep_it/,"I have been seeing a lot of posts from women who have gotten abortions and were happy with their choice, and that right there makes me proud to be a woman, that we have that right to choose what we can do with OUR bodies, whether people like it or not. I never had an abortion, but it was helpful to see what the details were that went into it. I think a lot of women are uninformed with that and it’s great that there are resources to understand better. On that note, I chose the opposite of an abortion. I kept the baby and I am going to tell you how it can work out this way as well. Just to let you all know, I am NOT against abortion AT ALL. It just wasn’t the choice I wanted to make. So here it goes:

**Finding out:** I got pregnant at 19 years old by my boyfriend. He lived in Europe and I lived in the US. I was living and travelling in Europe before this and that is how we met and fell madly in love. We kept the long distance thing up because we knew it was worth it and when he came to visit for a summer it happened and then I didn’t find out I was pregnant until after he left. I was just over 2 weeks (maybe 3) late with my period. At first I was concerned why I didn’t get it, but thought, “oh, it will come eventually”. Then my boobs started to get very very sore. I told my mom about this and how I was late and she told me to take a test. I skyped my boyfriend saying that I thought I am late with my period and I will take a test tomorrow morning. We were both convincing each other that I am definitely not pregnant.  The next morning I woke up, went to the store, got home set up skype, peed on the stick and came back to the computer sobbing. My boyfriend knowing that from those sobs, I was in fact, pregnant. We had sex “only” a few times unprotected, but that’s all it took. I told him that I am going to keep it and if he wants to stay with me he can, but at the same time if he doesn’t, he totally has the choice to have no part in it if he wants. Since he was from a different country, it would have been very simple for him to say that he doesn’t want to do this with me, but he didn’t, he said, “We will be together and do this together because I love you.” 

**Being Pregnant :** I went to a doctor who told me again I was pregnant . I said I was keeping it and he said okay. At 8 weeks I heard the most beautiful sound ever, my baby’s heartbeat. We decided that my boyfriend would stay in his country to finish a year of uni and then he will move here when he is done. I told my family of our decision and they freaked out and for months threatened to kick me out of the house and telling me they were going to force me to get an abortion. They did not agree with my decision at all and said none of this will work out. I was devastated and along with the INSANE pregnancy hormones I was a wreck. I was alone without the love of my life and my family shunned me. They did not speak to me or help me through a very hard time in my life. My friends were there as much as they could be!  I decided that I know that I am keeping this baby and I will be as happy and healthy as I can be regardless of all the negativity. I loved being pregnant. I did not have much morning sickness and realizing this little baby was growing inside of me was one of the coolest things I have ever experienced. The bigger my belly grew the more beautiful I thought I was. I did get horrible heartburn but that was it. I was also lucky enough not to get any stretch marks! My boyfriend and I skyped every day, spoke for hours, called each other, emailed, messaged ,etc. He was very supportive the entire time. It just killed us both that we were across the world from each other. We decided when he visited for Christmas that we will get married. We did and it was one of the best days of my life. He went back to school then came back again for the birth of our child. 

**The birth:** I had to find out by myself (along with the many other doctor visits I went to alone) at 20 weeks that I was having a girl!!!! The ultrasound was so perfect. She LOOKED JUST LIKE A REAL BABY!! It was wonderful. The last month I was HUGE! Soooo big and uncomfortable. I worked 30 hours a week standing up and was at school for 4 hours every night my entire pregnancy, so I was miserable towards the end, but so ready to have this baby!!!! My husband came in for the week of my due date. The doctor said that if the baby isn’t here by a week after my due date then I will be induced. Which means they will start to put me in labor. She did not come on her own during the week so we had the day scheduled that I would go in and have this baby! We went in at 6 am and I was so scared, but my husband calmed me down and we were talking about how we finally get to meet this little one. I was 1 cm for 6 hours and the pitocin was taking forever, so they popped my water bag to get it going quicker. That was one of the weirdest feelings ever. I was layed on the bed and they put a mat underneath me and when it popped it was just this warm uncomfortable liquid everywhere! Haha it was horrible!! No pain, just very very uncomfortable. Then 2 hours laterI started to contract. I am not kidding when I tell you that it was the worst pain I have EVER experienced in my life. It felt like knives were going in and out of my back. I was swearing like a sailor and begged for the epidural. They gave me the epidural (burned so bad!!!) which was also one of the weirdest/ best things I have ever had done to me in my life. The pain immediately stopped. It was heavenly! I went to sleep and then HOURS later they came in telling me I am 9cm and the baby will be here any minute. The doctor rushed, the nurses rushed in, I was in no pain and so ready. They told me to push, I did. Push again, I did. Once more, I did. Then BOOM this alien looking thing was in the doctor’s arms!!! I felt not a single thing the entire 10 minutes of pushing this baby out. Me and my husband were crying and he told me I was his hero. This was the best moment of my life. We got to hold our beautiful 9lb 2oz 22in long daughter, at last!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

**Recovery:** They stitched me up, because the baby was so big it tore down there. They gave me really good pain killers, so it was fine. Just kinda weird knowing I have stitches there, ewwww, but worth it. We were in a recovery room for 3 days and at night the baby went with the nurses so I could sleep and get my hormones all back in place. We were on cloud 9. So happy and so in love with this person we only just met. My family came around and so did my husbands (alllllll the way from Europe!) because during the last few months of my pregnancy they realized that they should have supported us in whatever decisions we chose. They came in the room and saw the baby and all started crying and they were also so in love with her. 

**How we made it work:** I had one year of school, but realized I needed something else to support my baby. I enrolled in an 8 month certificate program at a school that promised to get you a job after it’s finished. I had to go every day for 4 hours and couldn’t miss a day. It did exactly that though! I had the baby during my program and they gave me time off to have the baby. I got back into it and then I interned at an office and got the job after my internship. I also worked 30 hours a week as a “barista” making minimum wage, but it was something! I saved every penny and I also got medical help through Public Aid and was qualified to receive WIC (women infant children) that gave me checks to use at stores to buy baby food and formula if I needed it. I advise every young pregnant person to try to use the government help, because it is for people like YOU. There are so many resources to use. Food stamps, WIC, childcare assistance, housing assistance, financial aid, etc. Do not feel embarrassed, etc because this is how you get on your feet and then you can try to get a job and make your own money (best feeling ever!). I used it for a year and then finally made enough money so I didn’t need anymore help. I DID IT!!!!!!!!!!!! I worked my ass off, I was alone a lot, I studied and did everything I could to make sure me, my husband, and baby would have a good life. 3 years later and I am at the same job supporting my family while my husband works part time and is in school full time and watches our daughter in the day. I love them more and more every single day. Like the women who have said they do not regret getting an abortion, I do not ever regret keeping the baby. They are both very hard and both can work out! 

Sorry it’s so long and all over the place! Feel free to ask any questions.

1x7p1f,1,2014-02-06,Im 24 (M) She s F(22). In so much pain.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x7p1f/im_24_m_she_s_f22_in_so_much_pain/,"I met my girlfriend working for the Disney internship program. We were together for 3 months before her program ended and 

she had to go back home and i stayed for another 2 and a half months without her.We decided to move in together after my 

program ended.


A few weeks before she was to move down here , she saw a high school friend she was in love with in a park at 3 am (she was 

honest about seeing a guy not the love part). She told me they ve never been together because he s in the air force and she 

didn't think she was good enough for him. The guy told her he had feelings for her. It wasn't till she moved here that she told me 

she loved the guy.


In Miami she was miserable , hated her job , hated the people , the traffic,Everything.

The reason i went to disney was to have fun and have the college experience i never had. At work i start to notice their s a girl 

who likes me. Didn't really pay attention to her , not my type and i was hanging around another girl at that time.


I meet my gf in a club and we start to hang out. We were official a week or two after we met. But my roommates throw a small 

party later that month and they tell me to invite girls. So i invite my coworkers and they also bring the co worker who likes me . 

We all start drinking and dancing and suddenly im kissing the coworker. We kissed a few times that night and one more time 

at work about two weeks after . ( i felt terrible after , my ex cheated on me with a friend and i always thought cheating was 

the most disgusting thing ever) I was tired of being the 

safe guy , the nice guy.


Throughout my program nothing else happens with this girl or any other girl. The co worker found a bf and i had my gf. Her bf 

did cheat on her and she started talking to me more at work and through text late in my program (her program ended before 

mine)


My gf tells me about the feelings about her guy friend and i freak out . When i get mad i don't really scream, want to talk , or get 

physical. What i do is just ignore the person until my anger passes.So she doesn't get the point of being honest with me if im 

gonna treat her like that. I was really great full she was honest with me.


I receive a Facebook message from the co worker saying how much she loved me , and that she wishes that we would of been 

single when we were in the program because she felt that i was her ideal guy and that we were similar and stuff.

So the coworker texts me from time to time about school and parents and stuff like that , occasionally the drunk texts about 

wanting too be with me. I pay little attention , she s 2000 miles away and it felt good being appreciated when my gf told me 

about the guy friend. My gf tells me about the guy friend and packs her bags a few times and i start texting my coworker more 

.My gf finds out and tells me to stop texting her. So i do tell my coworker to stop texting me , even though she does send me a 

handful of texts, it wasn't anything like the texts before and she got bored because i only texted her one letter or one word 

answers and she told me i suck and she also sent me group holiday messages.


We r still having some problems because she hates miami.


But things get a bit better , a few hours before new years she tells me she loves me and that she wants to stay. We go back 

home make love and i start to get a few happy new year messages. I open it in front of her not thinking much of it . But one 

reads ""Happy new year can't wait to see you"". My gf gets furious. I ask what she meant and she responds I want to see you but 

my gf doesn't see this message.After that night i promised to cut all contact with the coworker. I told the coworker i wanted zero 

contact from her , so I erased her from FB and my phone.We kind of work things out , but then she tells me that she got in 

contact with her guy friend after she saw my co workers text.


I forgave her and right when i was taking her to the airport she tells me that they had talked about getting together . I got 

furious and ignored her the whole way. (she went back home for a week to visit family). While she was their we patched things 

up. She told me she wasn't gna see him. When i pick her up from the airport she tells me they had breakfast together and 

talked. I got angry and had a huge fight that night.


Again we make up and demand she erase his fb and number which she did.

We decided to move back to her town. She s in Jacksonville and the plan was for me to meet her their and then drive together to 

her town. I was suppose to go today . But she called me yesterday saying she wants nothing to do with me because the 

messaged the coworker and asked if we ever did anything and the coworker said we did kiss. My gf had asked me that very same 

question like 3 times , And i always said no. She said she would have forgiven me for it but i was too ashamed and afraid she 

was gonna leave me for it.

tldr: Gf caught me being dishonest about a coworker . She moved in with me being in love with another guy. I forgave her and 

she chose me , she told me she loved me.I love her so much , but she says she can't trust me. I love her so much, i know we

 would of been so happy back in her hometown 

. I'm going to  regret losing her for the rest of my life. She s the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't want to give 

up on her . She s so special. "

1x7rll,12,2014-02-06,"Anxiety is a state of mind that can be exacerbated by the antagonizing need for answers. We're all human and honestly a little bit of hypochondriacs, especially with the access we have. Story inside",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1x7rll/anxiety_is_a_state_of_mind_that_can_be/,"Anyone in agreement with my title? I know it seems slightly pessimistic and for all of the ""suffers"" probably a bit misconstrued because, ""we're actually inflicted!"". I have recently been tossing this idea around in my head considering that I have been in a struggle with what I believed to be depression/anxiety/ocd...etc, and I thought that my life wasn't in my own control anymore. It seemed that I might as well hand over my ability to reason to my newly anointed ""crazy, endlessly-running, sad"" mind. This was my exact thought process for a year and a half up until now. 

I found the idea to call myself mentally unstable after I seemingly lost control of my thought process and allowed dark, repressed thoughts to take the reins over a couple weeks time until one day where I caved. The year before this I had walked onto a Division 1 mid-major swim team without prior training aside from dedicating every minute of my previous summer to transforming myself into a grade A athlete. My mind was focused on nothing else and this was good for me, as I had finally found a way to disassociate myself from my half year of sadness after a breakup and a shitty freshman roommate. My sophomore year was promising, as I began the year with the least experience, the best build and a whole lot of room for improvement on the team. Come the third month of training and my season is plagued by a very fucked shoulder and I was forced to watch my teammates succeed from the bench, not to mention I had just recently tried to find happiness in one of the most beautiful girls I have ever known. I tried to repeat my prior relationship the same way as my first and immediately my infidelities came out. She obviously was excited at first but saw my sad motives and moved on. At the end of the year I knew that my athletic career was over and I had literally no clue where I stood with women, not to mention I had developed a weird anxiety where I was constantly checking to make sure I wasn't going to piss myself in class. God Dammit. I basically thought I had no hope for anything. Later on I broke down to my parents about how scared this made me feel while omitting the anxiety issues. I lost all hope for life and I was sad as shit. 

Enter the summer before junior year and I have started my first internship with a broken ego. My boss was quite possibly the most abusive person I think I will ever meet and one of my coworkers was a closet homosexual. I know that's a brash thing to say but it was discussed around the workplace and it was quite obvious. The reason that is relevant is because of a developed new thought process that made me terrified of becoming gay. Funny, right? I had never had these thoughts previous and became terrified of myself. The sheer thought of homosexuality destroyed my well being and it made me turn from a confident individual who had never had any issues being outgoing into a nervous, shy person who would have rather sat in my room and stare off into space. Fast forward past the summer and I had scavenged the internet for the ""answers"" to what was going on. This was on top of the fact that I had entered myself into a peer-pressured lifestyle of a fraternity. I unfortunately and fortunately am one of the better looking guys at my school and felt pressure from everyone I knew, even when it wasn't as present as I made it out to be. I would later on learn that this pressure was a self-pursued fantasy. Good-looking people can still be scared shit-less, when approaching the opposite sex when sober.

H.O.C.D. and Depression: ""A debilitating combo that affects very few OCD sufferers around the world. The normal patient has constant spikes in anxiety when placed in a situation involving sexual contact or where possible sexual connotations are present. Usually the patient is not gay and has never had previous desires for homosexual contact. The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."" Perfect, I found my answer. I was an OCD kid who simply couldn't get rid of some thoughts. Now remember, I was so deep into my own thoughts that the ""H.O.C.D."" was actually ruining my life. I kept reading deeper and deeper into my issues and decided to couple my new life with a bad habit of smoking weed 2/3 times a day, even after a previous bad experience with pot immediately following my first breakup. I thought to much, cast my health to the dregs and made bad decisions all year. I played friendship like it was an instrument and didn't really hold anything dear. It was like I had thrown in the towel and allowed my thoughts to capture who I actually was. 

I knew I needed help, so I went to see a therapist at school. It seemed like the perfect chance to take a step to recovery, even though I still had no genuine understanding of my issues but still a good opportunity. The only issue was that I was assigned a gay therapist. Perfect. I gave him half assed answers the entire time and eventually gave up on the sessions without disclosing my OCD fears. 

Fast-forward into the spring and was at a loss for what I was going to do with myself. I hated myself, It felt like there was nothing I could do and the fact that I kept reading into my issues from other peoples, similar but still subjective problems, did not help. The next summer came and my anxiety was at an all time high. I vividly remember having horrific panic attacks, where my body was almost uncontrollable. I hated where I was and I hated who I had become. 

This past fall, I finally found some courage to change my life. I went to a new therapist and a psychologist at school and told them everything. It felt good and honestly even though I honestly thought I was insane, I definitely noticed a change in my thoughts the day after my sessions. This revelation did come with a price though. The price was a new sense of purpose in life and my submissive anxiety filled character started to fade away. Once I harnessed that, I started smoking less and eventually became more engulfed in my health. I tried acid a few times too, which I thought was just going to make me crazy but it actually did the opposite, It allowed me to grow even when I did have one bad trip. Continue up to now and I have apologized to the people I have hurt, removed some bad seeds from my friendship group and stopped grasping others specific issues as answers to my own issues (I'm looking at you reddit). I have begun to write occasionally and although I still suffer from the occasional bad thought, I find it now more subjective in my case and I rely on myself to change my life and thought process. The things that finally brought me back to some sort of reasonable mental state were not relying on my thoughts to predict my happiness and making my actions key in defining who I actually am. I'm not going to say I'm happy all the time and I'm not going to say I'm sad all the time either, but I have changed and have embraced my growth from youth to manhood as a beautiful part of life, no matter how terrifying it is. I have also realized that being shitty to women and collecting sexual partners is a terrifying way to live life and it won't collect happiness for you, especially if thats not how you lived life upto college. Taking note of the world around me and not fitting all of my problems into each and every single moment of my life has proved key in my recovery. Moving moment to moment is better than continuing a thought filled, action-less life, but then again that's subjective for me. 

P.S. Acid is a beautiful drug and you won't go crazy from it unless you have a legitimate family history of schizophrenia or something of the like. 

TL;DR: OCD and other mental health issues are real, but become exacerbated to the point of finding yourself in a horrible pit of despair. Don't rely on reading others experience to change you, change yourself and trust your instincts over your harmful thoughts. 

I commend you if you actually read all that. Also please note that this isn't my full story, I had a wild year and a half dealing with this so there is more than just this page."
1x7x0l,0,2014-02-06,"An accountant by the skin of my teeth, is there hope?",accfledgling,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1x7x0l/an_accountant_by_the_skin_of_my_teeth_is_there/,"I just got my BSBA in accounting (actually, with a concentration in CPA-prep taxation). Not to get overly personal, but I've had some circumstances in my personal life over the course of 2013 that were, at best, very difficult for me. As a result, my GPA is a 2.5. I have an associates in computer science in which I graduated with a 3.87, sigma kappa delta, phi theta kappa, mu alpha theta... There's just a very clear distinction in the way I've performed at this level and the way I performed before I had those concerns in my life. As a side note, between the change from CS and accounting, I think I have enough total semester hours (153) to sit for the CPA exam in some states.

I have experience volunteering for a tax site that served low-income families, and this will be my 3rd year doing so, but I feel afraid. I'm afraid that my GPA is too low and that I won't be able to find any where to get practical experience beyond tax prep. Most internships I've seen want a 3.0 or higher, so I haven't been eligible to even apply.

I guess I'd just like to ask /r/Acccounting as a collective, what would you advise me to do?"

1x88sq,17,2014-02-06,A few words from the past year. One year today.,superusah,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1x88sq/a_few_words_from_the_past_year_one_year_today/,"On this day 1 year ago I was on a snowfilled beach in northeren Denmark in a car with my SO.
I had a big lump of hash and a bag of beers. A few kilometers in-land was the rehap facility that I'ed  requested a spot in. I was very scared. We drove passed the place three times. Every time I said ”Go past, I'll just have one more joint and a beer before I go in.” 


The first 10 days were horrible. My anxity and prejudice were working overtime. My SO came to visit the 2nd weekend, and when she was about to leave, I ended up in a panic attack behind the facility. A state of snot, tears and uncontrollable breathing made my SO refusing to leave me. The fear in me saw an oppotunity to get away and took it. I got in the car with her and we left. The addict in me was relieved. Not because I would now go home and feed him, but because he'd get a break from the beating he took daily in therapy. 4 days later the head of the facility came to our house. We had a long talk and I went back up north with him. 

The next 2 months were rough. Again, anxity and prejudice were my biggest issues with my fellow 'inmates'. I was one of those clients that expected a rehab clinic to be a round the clock operation. ”What am I suppose to do outside of therapy?!”. I was signed up for 6 months. 

3 months in we were going on a trip. To this sports/activity place. To have fun. I lasted 24 hours, then called my SO, packed my bag and started walking. I couldn't handle the social aspect of it. I wanted (sometimes demaneded) treatment! Not fooling around in a swimming pool or on a badminton court. I was home for a week that time. Yet again, the head of the facility come to our house. This time with a propersition: Instead of living at the facility, I would live in the halfway house that was part of the facility, attending therapy every day, but go and live with people who had already done their time in rehab and were now moving on.

With relieve I said yes. Weighing my options which were 1) stay at the facility, in misery, maybe even bail entirely. 2) Go to a ”safe place” but miss the chance of actually dealing with the issues that made me miserable in the first place. 

Thankfully my therapist was not as black and white as I, and said that we'd have a much better platform for dealing with my issues when I felt more comfortable. 

And he was right. 

The next 3 months were incredible. While still attending therapy everyday at the facility, I also started as an intern at a bikeshop. With all cards on the table which felt so nice. I was becoming a proud addict instead of a deceiving and shameful prick. 6 months in and my gratuation ceremony was comming up. I was granted another 6 months in the halfway house were I already was, but I kindly refused.

 One day in September I toled everybody that I was done. I was ready to move along. I wanted to move back home, build a touring bike, and go cycling in Europe for a month. 

I only met support. Which felt great. I was – maybe for the first time in my life- proud of myself.

I spent October plannning, buying and building the bike. 
Took off and rode around in Germany for a week, and decided I couldn't do this by myself, yet. 
I was scared, cold and lonely. The neon beer signs were getting more and more bright. So I called my SO and she drove down and picked me up outside Hamburg and we drove home. 

Next few days were filled with dissapointment, regret, anger and relief. 

These last couple of months have been a challenge. This was not what I thought beeing clean would be like 10 months ago in the dark northen Jutland. I am slowly re-entering society, starting an internship at a bikeshop on monday. I've started a mobile-bike-repair company and everything is scary and unknown.

 And I guess that's what it's suppose to be. I've just never realised it because I've been safe and warm in my addiction- But I must say, this new scary life is pretty rewarding. And loving myself for the first time is absolutly incredible. I've started my new life now. One year clean today.

1x8y8t,3,2014-02-06,Oh my god WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE. [non-trad],[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1x8y8t/oh_my_god_what_am_i_doing_with_my_life_nontrad/,"My entire life, my parents pushed me to be a doctor. That's why for the ensuing 27 years, I did my best to avoid it. Now I'm rethinking that.

Let's just cut to the chase here: I flunked out of undergrad, twice. When I finally went back, I barely graduated. I've failed and retaken classes MULTIPLE times. Cs get degrees, you dig? I think my cumulative GPA is something like 2.9 and my science GPA around a 2.7(?) -- I've actually been a little too afraid to calculate it. It took me 6 years to graduate.

If I have one thing going for me, though, it's that I'm a damn good test taker. Despite my shit undergrad GPA, I scored 98th percentile+ on the GRE, which got me accepted into grad school on probationary status. All I had to do was maintain a 3.0+ and I would be fully accepted. I managed to do that. I actually graduated last year with a MS in Neurobiology and a 3.67, pretty much all science courses. Only blemish on THAT is that I took a research credit and my advisor graded me as ""nonsatisfactory."" (We didn't really get along. Also, it was computational neuroscience and I'm a poor programmer. Give me wet lab work any day.)

Post graduation, I got a 6 month internship in a cancer research lab at a medical school. Turns out, I'm good in the lab. Really good with my hands, especially when it comes to mouse surgery. The gears started turning: sure is a waste to use this on mice and not on people... 

So I'm seriously considering applying for medical school now. I actually took a month off after my internship ended to do some shadowing at the medical school. I shadowed some neurosurgeons, though I understand they don't have quite the workload other doctors do. But I totally dug it - I love interacting with people, I think I'm pretty bright and can handle the intellectual rigor...

I don't really care for money or prestige. I mean, they're nice to have, but I don't need to make tons of money. Bank of Mommy and Daddy said they would finance my med school education, if I managed to get in. I have no desire to work 70 hour weeks to earn $400,000 a year to pay back med school debt. Actually, I think I would be happiest as a hospitalist, 14 shifts a month, plenty of other time to pursue other interests. For me, that would be volunteering at a low-income women's clinic at least one day a week. I've been married for 3 years, and we're thinking about starting a family soon, too.

My cancer research internship got my name on 3 papers, 1 already published and 2 coming out sometime later this year, hopefully.

In my current unemployed state, I've signed up to volunteer at a feminist women's health center. It's probably going to be mostly administrative, but I don't mind, I'm actually pretty dedicated to the cause. I suspect it might look kinda shitty that I didn't start volunteering until this year though, just in time to apply to med school. My excuse: I've been self-employed (while in school) and paying my husband's way through college, and now grad school.

But then there's that undergrad history holding me back. It seems pretty insurmountable, to be honest. Should I even really try? I've already signed up for the MCAT and started studying. I have a feeling I'll do pretty well -- I took a cold practice, having not done any chem, o-chem, physics or basic biology in ~5 years, and managed a 25. Pretty balanced, too. I've signed up to take the MCAT on May 22nd this year. Currently working my way through Examkrackers, and perversely, finding it kinda fun. (Where was this motivation in undergrad??)

I keep wavering back and forth on whether I should go for it. Part of me says that with my undergrad, there's no way I'd get in, so why am I wasting my time and energy? Another part of me is all Rob Schneider, ""YOUU CAN DO EEET!"" as long as I get my MCAT squared away.

Sorry this is so long. I know low undergrad grades aren't uncommon, but I think the rest of my situation is pretty different, and I need all the advice I can get. All my friends who ended up in med school went the traditional route, so they're not much help."
1x94q7,2,2014-02-07,I don't know how much long I [M19] can live with my parents.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1x94q7/i_dont_know_how_much_long_i_m19_can_live_with_my/,"I'm sure this problem has been raised before. I'm in a fog right now and I just need to get my thoughts down and some feedback.

I'm 19 years old. I'm the last of 2 boys (So I have a brother who is 23). Growing up, I was a complete mama's boy. I love my mom, my dad equally but my mom is my favorite person in the world. My brother moved out when he was 18. I commute to my University, meaning I still live in the same 10ft x 10ft room I have spent the past 16 years of my life.

All of my friends, with the exception of two of my closet guy friends, have moved out. Living at home has some awesome, awesome perks, but I am slowly suffocating here.

I'll run some examples. I spent a solid 3 or 4 months back in 2013 planning to partake in a Study Abroad opportunity with my University. They were going to send me to Tokyo, all expenses paid, to study at Waseda Univeristy which is a very prominent school in Japan. I sent over 200 e-mails, drove to countless Study Abroad fairs, met with counselor after counselor after counselor, crammed my first three semesters so I would have free time during my 4th semester, all just to hear my parents say ""We don't think you are responsible enough"". 

Classic excuse, and for most kids my age, a viable one; but the thing is I am responsible. I've never become involved in drugs, maintained a 3.4 GPA, I'm part of student government and 4 clubs on campus, never been in a car accident or have been pulled over or have had any troubles with authorities, and at the age of 16 I got an internship in politics which I still hold today. I have only the highest ambitions, but my parents continue to claim that I have no responsibility because I have never lived in a dorm or on my own for any period of my life. As true as this is, I have spent so much of my life alone and to myself. Thinking about it, it's really depressing me. If I was allowed to follow my dreams, I would be in Japan right now, exploring a culture that fascinates me; but rather I am sitting in my box shape room, spending my nights on reddit until 2am, thinking about my life and my future as my youth slowly disappears. I have brought this up to a lot of people. Family, friends, colleagues, advisers. Most people tell me that, yeah, i'm missing some awesome opportunities. My academic advisers have even attempted to persuade me to just pursue Study Abroad without my parents permission.

Anyways, it seems like every day something happens here. We have had a lot of respect issues in the past. Yesterday I ended up walking 3 miles in the midst of a snowstorm to the house of one of the two friends who I still have. I needed to get out of the house after my dad took my keys because I slept till 1:30pm and never woke up to shovel the snow. Tonight, I was planning on going to the gym. They wouldn't let me leave because it was past 10pm and the next town over has a ""Heroin Problem"".

I'm not sure what it is. I think it's just the typical Last-Bird-Leaving-The-Nest situation and mom doesn't want to let go, but I just want to get out there and experience the world while I am still young and not tied down with a family or job. I just feel like they have one arm around me, and the other arm is out swinging at all the dangerous things that can harm me in life. The world is a mean, mean place and the only way I am going to toughen up is if I take a few punches and stick my finger in the fire to realize ""wow, that shit is hot"". I do not want to tip-toe through life just to arrive safely at death.

It will come in time, but... I'm fighting a pretty intense battle by myself right now. I don't feel like anyone is on my side. Every night I think about this, about my independence and individuality, about if I am not following my dreams now, will I ever follow my dreams in the future? Or will I just wash up in the 9 to 5 grind and end up paying off my mortgage for the rest of my life. I'm not sure but thanks for reading.

---

Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Fringe

There’s a lot to be said in a really impersonal sense for being an undergrad at an Ivy League School.  The potential for increasing numbers of emerging luminaries in the arts and sciences to come is unlimited, as long as the saturated state of opportunities to meet the desires and aspirations of young minds is preserved at institutions like Brown.  A situation like ours can only be understood as the latest of many renaissances that dot recorded history.  

They tend to mark paradigm shifts in the sciences, semantics, religion and the arts.  

Our generation is waking up to a similar age of regeneration in which the creative power of our minds and our hearts can be amplified exponentially by unprecedented new access to information and communication.  

Much as the progenitors of occultism since the Italian Renaissance resurrected the corpus of paganism, christendom, the classics of philosophy, mathematics, and music, *because they had the tools to do it,* today we stand at the focal point of the fulfillment of one grand cosmic cycle, and the beginning of a newer, longer one.
 
Our hand in shaping the future is doing so at the most crucial of such moments to arise so far in what is widely held credibly to be the history, unprecedented, manifest in the awakening of a sentient planet.  We stand at the turning point.

So what?

Our predecessors discovered how to distinguish between a science of the mind, and one of bodies; with any luck, we will discover how to unify those now disparate pursuits.  Parapsychological research and emergent, previously inarticulable possibilities among quantum phenomena are receiving a coherent voice and silent patronage as they become legitimate fields of inquiry and speculation today.
Science has recognized how to think quantum in a number of ways and expresses it in multiple voices about not what’s out there and in here, or over here and not over there, but something common to both and animating them.  

We see traces of this kaleidoscopic vision from nanophysics to biology, the virtual violability of laws of thermodynamics in dissipative systems, and the recent cross-pollination of information theory and ecology.  None of these resemble Newton (a dedicated bastion of renaissance esotericism in his own time) and no one quite knows how to put it without immediately either accepting an enormous proof to demonstrate a new paradigm immediately, or look very silly.

But in all earnestness, we’re experiencing today more than ever, the proverbial farce to the purported tragedy that the occult, sometimes defined as “rejected knowledge,” has sustained in its history.  Syncretic explanation of the past forms presentist affirmation and autonomous thought in the present expresses and influences the future.  

Copernicus and Giordano Bruno were both minds that could traverse three engagements with time: they could be in time, outside of time, or against time, as it fitted them to articulate a spirit that was alive and being reborn into culture and society around the time of their work.

We’ve long since integrated the Knowledge=Power book report of the sociological humanities and are dimly aware of it; but do we know how the restructuring of these things for social change feels when we purge the same prejudices and illusory sources of separation from ourselves?  We can build memory palaces at the stroke of a key yet we’re bored of “changing the world.”  

We go through the motions and try to get a non-evil internship or publish research that hopefully non-evil people will use to non-objectionable ends, the silent, hidden ideal being one of creating a worldview and a project of inquiry that is impossible to misuse.  A universal measure of ethics, autonomy, action, space and time.  At any one time we may find ourselves trying to stop the world from changing, trying to transcend change, or try to be with change.  We need a centered consciousness conversant with all these forms of becoming.

None of us realizes that one of us will, probably very suddenly, be the victorious typewriter monkey and make the discovery that breaks capitalism, finance, famine, shortage, meaning, apathy, life the universe in everything all wide open orbiting around a coherent point.  No one remembers that that is the constitution of a fully integrated individual, one who can respond to everything.  

Renaissance People are in growing supply, and it’s as if we legitimately fear house arrest or public execution, so much so that we all hesitate to express ourselves creatively, hesitate to approach the unknown every day in our disciplines.  When, in fact  the worst fate possible would be to die regarded as somewhat silly, only become a reservoir of insight, wisdom and instruction for a similar, future soul.

Or we can fear the inquisition; remain complacent and insist that theory best left refined until it magically sprouts legs and takes to the grassroots level of its own accord; ruminate confidently how this whole mind business is inside the skull and it’s only a matter of time before science cracks it wide open; vegetate in the orthodoxy and maybe find peace in old age; and perhaps be of quaint interest to casual genealogists and nostalgic displaced aristocratic family vestiges.  

*But by no means should we realize that the world out there and the world inside us is the same process doing the same thing, and begin to think about it in a way that might just harmonize it and help it express unity.  That’s for the new agers, the totalitarians, the monists and the nihilists, all those people whose worldviews are radically attuned to experience, and their bibliographies a little spotty, not resembling real scholarship.  Because they’re talking systematically at length about telepathy, astrology, UFOs, intelligent design, astral projection or psychokinesis.  They don’t know anything about the wonders of our theory, or else they wouldn’t be wasting their time on what’s actually nonsense.  All that stuff is in your head or on paper, how could it change the world?*  

Only once it passes through the hands of scholars like us and into the mind of future innovators.  Giordano Bruno speculated that ours was not the only world orbiting the only star, anticipating the full consequences of Copernicus and Galileo’s formulations by whole centuries.  

If we all take the same potshots and be radically close with the changing world while we have both the chance and the will, we can actually take part in the healing of the world and do our part ushering in the beginning of a new age.  

See the change you want to be in the world and manifest your contribution accordingly.  

Express interest in the occult, ask questions about hidden things, embody love for the unknown and the mysterious.  Read and write, think, live and act the analogical, the irrational, the mythical, the enlightened.  

If you can donate to a university whose merits, future, and purpose are all uncertain from a cosmic perspective, you can afford by chance to take part in the speculation and action that will set examples for those yet to come, who might foster a new world, stoked by the faith we had in them, as our forebears had in us.

Raid Report: Failure

Emboldened by my previous raiding victory, I decided to raid sector 14 again. I figured that if we beat them once we could totally do it again. I was hoping to gather building supplies so I could start to build a town for my citizen slaves to live in. Living in tents kinda sucks... Turns out I was wrong...

My army is completely awful at being an army. I suffered major losses to the party I sent out. Turns out that my Interns do not know how to fight like at all... The only reason why we won the first raid was because we had the element of surprise. Today sector 14 was ready to fight back... The Tigers are still fierce warriors so today wasn't a complete loss and I managed to loot some building supplies but the death toll was far to high for my liking...

In other news, a weird disease is spreading throughout my camp. It's probably from the radiation but I have no idea... If there are any doctors out their who would like to join my forces, you will be promoted to a position of power. Since my society is based on slaves you will have slaves waiting on you hand and foot... It'll be pretty cool...

I hope this, my first substantial post, proves worthwhile. Here's what you need to know.

- I am a graduate student training to be a counselor. I have been doing an internship at the counseling center at our university's campus since early January. I see about 10 ""real"" clients a week, all university students. Early returns are that I'm very good at what I do.

- I have been dating a lovely woman for a couple of months. She is also training to be a counselor.

Here's the fun part.

My 30th birthday is in 10 days. As a gift to me, my GF wants to act out some of my sexual fantasies with me. Teacher-student has always been kind of a big one for me, with me being the teacher. Something very hot about that power differential, and my GF loves to be dominated. However, a couple of days ago, she made a counter-offer: Counselor-client. The scenario she laid out for me is this:
 

*She is a senior in high school (she'll be wearing a schoolgirl outfit), and she comes to see me for counseling around a teacher whom she tried to seduce. Something went wrong, but that's for me to find out about in our ""session."" I would be a particularly unethical counselor, getting her to admit she has a insatiable need to be fucked by a powerful man, making her describe everything, etc., clearly getting off on it myself while appearing to be helpful. Eventually, I would indicate that she needs a different kind of treatment which will require meeting in a hotel, and we would schedule a time to meet in the hotel a few days later.*

*In the hotel (and again she'll be a schoolgirl), I would dominate her progressively. My special brand of therapy. I haven't figured out the details, but eventually the black leather will come out, and she will be bound and fucked as part of her treatment (my GF is very much into that, it's definitely growing on me).*

 
So, that's what my GF has proposed. She is awaiting the green light from me. I'm very intrigued and turned on by the idea, but I have some hesitation as well. I am a newly-practicing counselor, and I am working hard to establish an ethical practice. I need to be able to separate this sexual fantasy completely from my real life as a counselor, and I would love some advice from you guys about that. Are these waters a little too murky to enter? Have any of you successfully compartmentalized a fantasy wherein you inhabit a role that you normally play in life (maybe your job?), but in the fantasy you do things in that same role you would never ever do in real life?

Also, let's say I go forward with this fantasy, which is how I'm leaning now. I would love some more ideas about how to play it out. Anybody have a fantasy of being taken advantage of by a psychologist or counselor?

**tl;dr:** I'm a counselor in real life. My gf wants to play out a fantasy with me where she's a student and I am her counselor and I take advantage of her sexually. I'm very intrigued by the idea, but concerned that it will mess with my mind and possibly affect my real practice. Want feedback. Also, I want advice and suggestions on spicing up the fantasy further assuming I go forward with it."

I am 36 and the father of three children all under 10 and I live in central Wisconsin.

Working for your organization is important to me because I believe what you believe.  I believe in
the power of sharing knowledge.  I believe that free and accurate information can change the world.  If we
can teach a farmer in a hungry country a better way to grow potatoes, then people don’t starve.  If we can
get computers into the hands of children in underdeveloped nation, then those children can grow up to be
engineers.   If we can help tweet information on where to protest, we can overthrow a vicious dictator.  If
we can spread a video exposing atrocities, then we can help stop genocide.  You’re not going to hire me
for what I can do.  You’re going to hire me for why I do it.  I do it, because I believe in it.  It’s what I’ve
always done.  I’ve always been a dreamer, a talker, a thinker, a writer, a doer, and a teacher.   Information
has the power to change the world.  It’s what we do with that information that matters.  Do we keep it to
ourselves?  Or do we put it out there, for the world to use?  Do we sit around hoping?  Or do we go
around helping?  I believe I’m going to look back on my life and regret nothing.  I’m going to say I made
the world a better place than how I found it.  I want my children to be proud of me, to be proud of the work
I’ve done.

So I used to post on here sometimes, and now days I usually just lurk..

My backstory:
 I started losing weight at the end of my sophomore year of college. By October of my junior year, I had went from 265lbs all the way down to 165lbs.... Basically 100lbs in less than  year. I did through vigorously counting calories and picked up running...

I had to learn how to ""maintain"" quick, and damn was it hard. I kept putting myself down time after time for eating anything remotely bad.. I was pretty good about it though... I kept around 160-165 for a good solid year, throughout my junior year of college. 

Through out this whole process I picked up a love for running, and it has taken off. Now I run usually 5 days a week averaging about 20-25 miles a week. I used to run 7 days a week, but quickly found out that while I wasn't seeing issues with my body, it still wasn't good to be running 7 days a week..

Flash forward to today.. I'm in the middle of senior year of college. This semester, I have an internship, school, girlfriend, and being an RA on campus to juggle on my plate. I have noticed I stress eat sometimes now, and that while at work even at times when I pack my own lunch, my coworkers will say that they are bringing lunch back and I'll feel forced to eat that. Also we have special meetings or events where stuff will be catered and all that jazz. I hadn't weighed myself since August, and I weighed in last week at 170lbs.. While not bad, I just feel nasty.

I feel like I can do better, and I should do better. I still usually fit in my 20-25 miles a week, and I still log my calories.. However, I notice A LOT more days of where I go way over my calorie limit, and just over eat.

I'm so afraid of going back to the old me, the fat me, the unhappy me. I don't want it, but at times it feels like I'm on a burning plane, and there's nothing I can do."
1xbxyz,3,2014-02-07,Lonely man in a new city (MF),Bibbleisthetits,Erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/1xbxyz/lonely_man_in_a_new_city_mf/,"Lexington, or Lex,  didn’t know where his life was going, all he knew was he needed to get back to California one day. Life hasn’t been easy for him this past year with his fiancé of 8 years leaving him for one of his interns, his dad dying from a stroke at such a young age and moving away from his family to follow his dream job. But even the job wasn’t panning out the way he had hoped. From day one it was obvious that his boss had it out for him so to make a friend in the office was a huge help to take away from the stress of having his every move picked apart and analyzed. Hannah was a bright young face, always able to see the humor in every situation and it didn’t hurt when she joked about his sexual prowess and gave him that look that would even make a baker lose his cream filling. So, being miles from home and having only one real friend, it was obvious why he started to develop feelings for her. 

	One night after work he decided to bridge the gap and ask her out for drinks, she didn’t seem too anxious but it was plain to see on her face that she had been waiting for his invitation for quite some time. It was a casual date, joking about work and their childhood, parents and siblings, it was almost too good to be true for Lex. He had noticed her from the first day he stepped into the new job when she dropped some paperwork next to the copier. When she bent down to collect the papers, her blouse opened up just slightly to reveal a hint of her beautiful breasts but the moment was over as fast as it began. She looked up, smiled at him and walked away. So Lex did his best to be subtle but to “accidentally” run into her around the office. Now as the night progressed they lightly teased each other with slaps on the arm and winks from behind their drinks. But now it was getting late and last call was just behind them. To Lex’s surprise Hannah actually suggested they go back to her place, she had an apartment with a nice view and a new bottle of wine that she hadn’t opened yet.  The sexual tension between them was palatable as they made their way across the crowded city and up to her 60th floor apartment.  As the elevator rose to her floor he decided to go for it and try to kiss her but timing was never Lex’s strong suit and as he leaned in, the elevator doors opened and she walked out leaving him puckered up to thin air. But she looked back and with that same sly grin that she gave him on his first day at work, nudged her head towards her place. She playfully ran off towards the door as he gave chase and as they got there he reached her and wrapped his arms around her and held her close. She felt like a summers day, like when you’re laying on the beach with no cares in the world. He spun her around and gently pushed her against her door, he wasn’t going to miss this time. She looked up into his kiss and gave back the same emotion that he had for her. They stood there holding each other and seeing nothing but the other ones lips for what felt like hours but must have only been a minute before she pulled away and grabbed his hand and led him into the room. 


	It was a very nice house, small entryway that led down into a nicely sized living room. Staring ahead was a glass window that was open from one wall to the other and you could see the New York skylights twinkle in the distance. As he was standing there enjoying the view, Hannah came back with two glasses of wine. He felt like just throwing the wine aside and taking her right there for all of New York to see but calmed himself down. This woman was amazing and if anything was to happen tonight, he wanted to enjoy more of her company first. So they sat and got comfortable on her couch as they danced around small talk for a few minutes before Hannah threw her leg over him and stared into his eyes and said “I’m not one of those quiet women that let something good pass by, if I want something then I take it”. Then she pulled his hair back and kissed his neck, slowly at first but then she eventually moved back to his lips and started grinding against his hard cock. She could feel it getting bigger as she slowly teased him with her tongue and hands. And as he kissed her back he started slowly unbuttoning her shirt and teasing her back and hips with his hands. Lex then stands up, carrying Hannah into her waiting bed and lays her down as he kisses her from her cheek, to collar bone, down to her hard pink nipples. She squirms and lets out a soft moan as each inch he moves down her body sends a line of electricity through her head and finger tips. She lifts her cute ass up as Lex slowly pulled down her pants and kisses his way up from her ankles to the inside of her thigh to her cute little button. Hannah arches her back as he pleases her and runs her fingers through his hair with each passing lick. He hears her breathing faster and as she starts to scream out he grabs her hips and pulls her towards anxious mouth. Lex moves up in the bed to lay right beside her and she looks down, somewhere along the way he took off his pants and she was surprised at how big he was. It was her turn to please him but he insisted on tasting her as well, so she threw her legs over his head and went to town on him. Hannah enjoyed this part of the game, feeling the man shift under her mouth and reading his body to know what he liked more. A few minutes go by and Lex picks her up and spins her around with his masculine arms and sets her on his lap. They are both out of breath and sweat has just started pouring down their faces. They smile and lean in and enjoy the passion that is so evident between them as they kiss. Hannah stands up ever so slightly and stares into Lex’s eyes as she grabs his hard cock and slides it gently inside her. Her gasp is so slight and sexy that they both just stop for a moment before she pushes him on his back and takes him just how she wants him. He looks up at her body, eyes closed and hands on his chest and lets her take command of him. This is new to him being with a dominating woman but he enjoys knowing that she knows what she is doing and doing it with such force and recklessness. He grabs her supple ass and flips her over and she giggles. This woman is sexy, funny and utterly adorable in every way. He pulls out and slowly slips back in, teasing her because he knows that she wants him to just pound her like a nail. Hannah can’t take it anymore, “Please take me, I want you to cum for me. I want you now!”.  He stops teasing and just goes for it. Minutes pass with their legs wrapped and their faces pressed together, breathing heavily. She was breathing faster and faster, he was pulling her close and right when he felt her approaching climax he came and collapsed next to her. They laid there in the sweat and heat of their passion and just let the quietness of the night take them in. 

	They must have fallen asleep because it was now morning and she was getting out of the shower. He laid up and was captivated by her beauty, it was a sight that he could quickly get used to. They had to get ready for work before they were late but the question was, could they keep their passion in their back pocket while they were at work or was this office romance going to get a little more exciting?

1xcfcb,1,2014-02-08,"Me [24F] boyfriend [22M] 1.5 yrs, why do i feel so worthless &amp; what do I do?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xcfcb/me_24f_boyfriend_22m_15_yrs_why_do_i_feel_so/,"I don't know what's going on anymore. Half of me thinks he just doesn't give a shit and the other thinks I ask too much or I've stretched him too thin. I just want some outsider advice. 

Let me start off by saying how wonderful my boyfriend is. I appreciate so much all the good in him and have so much respect for who he is as a person. I know I’m blessed to have gotten to know him and I want him to feel respected and loved. I've fucked that up in the past, but I've taken responsibility and I have really been trying. Everything just keeps getting messed up and  I just don’t know if that matters to him anymore. So if it doesn’t I want to give him the freedom to move on.

When I first met my boyfriend almost two years ago we bonded over being music loving/creating people whose main desire was to be professional musicians making our own stuff and touring. We had a ton of musical taste in common, which not to sound like some indie assholes, was a bit astounding. We’re both admittedly urber-nerds for roots blues, bluegrass, folk, rock, metal, afro-beat,world music, prog rock,jazz ect.  More than music pretty much every area of our life we had a freakish amount in common. Our outlandish, goofy, sarcastic sense of humor was the same as well. Movies, art, books, life-experiences whatever it was we seemed to mesh really well. We both expressed our amazement at this and over the next few months more and more surfaced that we had in common. We just got each other, and even our differences were interesting to each other and somehow worked. I’ve never been as physically attracted to someone till him (he sort of looks like Andrew WK and that’s my motherfucking jazz, plus he slays at every instrument and is 6’4”…basically my wet dream) and the feeling was mutual according to him. Except I look slightly less like Andrew wk and cant play the harmonica like Sonny Boy Williams. Fucker… In the beginning it was bizarrely awesome how in sync we were. Our close friends saw it and commented on it so we knew we weren’t crazy. Now when we bring it up we realize how much we've taken it for granted. Or he has, because it just has become old news I guess. I still appreciate it a lot, in fact I feel sort of gooberish for bringing it up in front of him….

He used to love my voice and music. We have so many songs and unfinished projects together. We were in a band together but it broke up because some other members were flakey.  We’ve argued over it, stupid bullshit that blew up. Now seems like he could care less and we never make music anymore. He was derogatory about a project I’d worked on and knocked me down a few times about the way I had been singing. Usually I’m good with criticism but it was heavy in addition to the space growing between us. I had lost confidence in myself, maybe for good reason. But I'm still working, still trying any way, on my own. Sucks a lot we don’t do anything together. I’ve brought it up in different ways but he just blows it off or has an excuse. Well, I’m finally in a band that I’m stoked on and he’s been supportive, I guess. It just feels hollow, like he doesn’t mean it and is uninterested. So I see no point in sharing anymore, but I really wish he still believed in me and was even ¼ as excited to do things together as he was in the beginning. Maybe he didn’t even mean it then, who fucking knows.

My views on religion and his clashed pretty hard 8/9 months in. but he and I worked on it and decided to go on a spiritual journey together of sorts. After all, I recognized I didn’t know everything and I was still growing and learning, but bickering over other bullshit knocked us off course. One of the big issues was from a boozy night where one of his asshole high school friends called my friend a ""bitch"" when we had been nothing but kind to him all night. It was really out of the blue and I sort of lost my shit when the guy continued to yell at and threaten my best friend with physical violence. In my boyfriend's defense he hadn't really been paying attention and was playing guitar and talking with some buddies at the beginning of the argument. Still once I caught his eye and he tuned in he took a long time to react and defend me. I was sore about that for a while. I don't want to get any guy in a fight, but fuck this guy who yelled at us did so with no provocation. That incident haunted us for a while ,but we got over it. He proved himself in other ways and we worked through it. He isn't a pussy by any means. The guy is 6""5' with hands like baseball mitts, he's not scared of a fight he just truly wasn't aware of what was going on till it was very heated.  Honestly, I gave him a lot of shit about it. 

Things got really bad when we went on a two vacations in a row. We didn’t mean to schedule it that way it just happened. The second was with his family on a tiny island he was burnt out on from too many family trips in his youth. It got to be that all he wanted to do was get high or sleep. I spent time with his family away from him or walking around the island by myself, which was nice. But it sucked that I was there with his family having to do all the explaining as to why we weren’t together and what was up with his mood.  We both were a bit sick of each other afterwards, but he was cruel about it and it really threw me for a loop. I really just tried to make the best of it and he was a stick in the mud. Which was up until that point, really unlike him. He’s hyper and had always been a lot of fun. In fact at times I found it hard to be around him because he was too go-go-go, but I saw that he was trying to entertain me and make me laugh and had a lot of self-confidence. He didn’t care if he looked like an idiot if it made me smile, he was secure in himself and I appreciated that. Then he became quiet, passive aggressive and was always tired. He admitted he was depressed didn’t want to be social but it seemed fishy because he wasn’t like that with his friends. Friends he had expressed dissatisfaction with because they “brought him down” were “only into partying” ect ect…his words not mine. But it bit me in the ass when I started agreeing with him and ever since it seems like he chooses them over me. 

I have expressed concern over a few of his friendships and even went as far to say as I really disliked them, but 90% of his friends I love. In fact I’ve become really close with them and their girlfriends. They invite me to parties that it seems he just wants to ignore me at for the most. He used to be my buddy, my partner in crime. Now he wont let me leave but really makes me feel like shit about myself with this distant bullshit. I don’t have as many friends as him but I have close ones I focus on more. I get along really well with my family so I spend a lot of time with them. My older brothers and sisters are hilarious and rad and love him, but while I really go out of my way to spend time with his family (even though I don’t have much in common with them) he snubs mine a lot. 

I never see him check out other girls, but I see them check him out. I don't think he's cheating. 

In the beginning I could relax around him immediately, I was enamored with him and still am but he's drifted. I've pointed it out. Tried a million approaches. Lots of openness and talking on my end…just trying to find a solution, but he tapers out of the conversation pretty quick and doesn’t seem to listen or care. I’ve tried to leave but he tells me he doesn’t want that. So what then? I cant seem to do anything right anymore or make him happy. And that hurts and leaves me feeling so powerless and shitty, but I cant walk away…
Is he just trying to get me to leave because he doesn't want to do the work? I don't seek out confrontation by any means. I just speak up when I feel it's important. Unfortunately I've it's felt ""important"" for months now. I've exhausted him, but he doesn't ever say much and I just get more and more upset. I feel like a drowning person and he's just watching complacently from the shore.  

All he says he wants is me to ""Relax"". I try. I want to! So why does he get so passive aggressive with me and ignore me? It seems like he's pushing me away on purpose, or maybe I'm just not important to him. I don't need to be the fucking center of his life, but he used to be so fucking into me it was almost too much. He used to not care what anyone thought and bounce off the walls trying to make me laugh and we had so much fun together. 
I'm a naturally relaxed, easy going person, but it sucks when you're with someone you love and you feel like they make you do all the work. How did the roles reverse so much?
I constantly wonder if he'd even talk to me if I didn't initiate a conversation. I pretend so much that everything is fine and I'm happy but the sadness in me builds and builds. I've never been this depressed in my life. Mostly I just feel so embarrassed of myself, so worthless and pathetic. I don't want sympathy I just want to respect myself and I'm such a weak piece of shit I can't fucking figure out if I should go or stay.  

He never makes the plans anymore. I mean I don’t need a fucking candle light dinner, never have, but shit even if he said “babe lets go to Del Taco then play air hockey” I’d be down as fuck. I’m pretty easy to please. He asks what I'm doing and I tell him I'm not busy, then nothing… I'll invite him to shows I'm playing or suggest we do something and he'll agree. But I drive to him constantly. He drives from orange county to LA to work every day so he’s complains about the drive. I offer to drive, whatever. I know he’s tired from work and my work isn’t as physical as his. But fuck, I’m tired too dude and I’m still trying. We will have fun, but I always feel like he'd rather be somewhere else and I've told him that


This has been going on for over 6 months.  I’m convinced that 90% of that is his unwillingness to just snap out of it and be in a better mood. Or be present or stop phoning it in. Why tell me to stay? Why tell me you love me? Our good times seem shorter and shorter. I can't tell if I'm reading into everything he does too much because I'm so stressed and it all has felt unresolved for months or if it really is this fucked. Am I over-reacting? Maybe if I didn't bring it up every week…god I just get so beat down thinking about it. Ive become too sensitive maybe &amp; I hate how he's changed but realize some if it is my fault from cruel shit I've said.

Is this because I struggle with manic depression? He’s called me co-dependant a few times.  I give him space a lot. We see each other maybe twice a week. Recently we’ve gone a week or two not seeing each other at all, my choice. But only because I thought space would help, it hasn’t and I wish we could just relax together. I don’t need to be entertained. I can read a book or entertain myself, I just like being with him. We don’t even have to talk and he knows that.
I have a full life on my own too…I work full time and I have friends and hobbies (I’m in a band, I take drum lessons, I intern at an art shop, I read, I write, run, yoga, have a great relationship with my family) my life is exceedingly full even without the time I spend with him. But I choose to make time for him, it’s not because I HAVE to have male attention.  I'm self-sufficient but I miss this piece in my life where love was, as cheesy as it sounds. I've fucked things,I can be angry, a mean drunk, cruel, contentious I’m not a saint.I have apologized and tried to really change for the better, for him, but also for myself. I've been trying very hard to grow as a person because I want to…and I've said sorry and tried to take responsibility when I was wrong. We’ve had so many good times, is it over? I just don't know what to do anymore. 

If anyone can make sense of this please leave me a comment. 

tl;dr Are things over, they are so back and forth from amazing to blaaah?"
1xcgp4,2,2014-02-08,South African looking to legally immigrate to the USA. Any advice?,[deleted],immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1xcgp4/south_african_looking_to_legally_immigrate_to_the/,"Hi Reddit,

I am a South African, age 23 living in Cape Town. I have completed high-school &amp; got my certificate. I didn't study any further as I always wanted to study filmmaking in the United States but never could as I never saved up enough money to do so. 

I have been working in the show-business (television) for my eighth year now. I started out as a timekeeper when I was 16 &amp; moved through all the position's to end up doing what I'm doing now, which is VT playout. So that means I play out all pre-recorded content whether it be from a non-linear editing application or hardware. I have two jobs currently working on a live breakfast show as well as a live kids show. They are the only two daily live broadcast's in Cape Town so I have exhausted my work possibilities. I see myself as being extremely fortunate to have a job, though. 

I have always wanted to immigrate to the US. My mother is a British citizen as she married a British guy a couple of years ago &amp; my father is a South African. I've been googling around recently to find ways that I could enter the great country of America but things aren't looking that positive. 

So the reason I gave up looking to go to the US before was that I was arrested with A joint on me. I payed a fine back then (to not get my dad involved seeing as he would've kicked my lilly-white ass into a blueberry colored paste) which was actually an admission of  the crime , that I signed &amp; I was charged with possession (not minor because it was a joint only- posession). That was a week after a turned 18. Two years later I was caught by police holding a banky of weed (about 10 grams) &amp; wow, I was held overnight because it was the second time I had been caught with weed! Went to court to contest it this time but my green horn lawyer was the joke of the courtroom &amp; I was found guilty. ( the case I watched while waiting got my hopes up seeing as the guy also got caught with weed except two garbage bags FULL in the township &amp; he got off without a charge! There I was for a banky! [but got charged anyway])

This killed all hope within me to be able to go to the US (or any first-world country) because I believe that with a criminal-record my life was as good as over. I am doomed to live &amp; die in South Africa regardless of whether the country was doing okay or not. 

Now my need to go to the US to work &amp; live is burning stronger than ever. I need a new start, I want to be able to flourish &amp; not just get by. There doesn't seem to be a way to get into the US without huge bulk sums of cash. I want to leave everything &amp; everyone behind &amp; live my own life in the greatest country in the world (USA). But I don't have huge amount's of money just lying around. I have an apartment I bought when I was 21, the bank technically owns it because I haven't payed it off yet but I believe I can make a good R200 000,00 ($18047,00) profit if I sell it now. 

I didn't study here because I always wanted to study filmmaking in the US, seeing as studying a film &amp; television here in SA would've been a waste of time &amp; money. 

What route could I take to become a US Citizen or get a green-card? I have no one in America that would sponsor me, no family, no ties whatsoever.  

I have seen on the internets that joining the army is another way of getting into the US but I cannot do so without a green-card? So I would have to apply for a student-visa to get a green-card &amp; then apply to be recruited in the army? As you can see this must be pretty dire as I am a stoner who is willing to join the army to show my allegiance to the US. 

Is there any advice any one could offer? I have thought about calling up all the television stations US-Side &amp; stating my experience &amp; saying I am willing to work as an intern forever! With two jobs &amp; working hours from 4AM to 5PM, I am working myself to the bone &amp; I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. 

I have went through the immigration subreddit &amp; it seems impossible to legally immigrate to the US. I can't seek asylum because South Africa actually isn't as bad most of the other countries in Africa but I'm hoping someone could suggest something, anything! 

I could go to the UK I guess because my mom is there but that isn't the fresh start I want. I want to live &amp; work within the USA. 

ANY advice or input will be greatly appreciated even the sarcastic ""cool story, bro"" comments. Thanks in advance.

1xckbo,10,2014-02-08,Do you ever feel like you need overcompensate for INFP weaknesses?,cowmoo,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1xckbo/do_you_ever_feel_like_you_need_overcompensate_for/,"Hi /r/infp peeps, 

Do you ever feel like you need overcompensate for the INFP weaknesses? Despite that fact that we are apparently suppose to be ""smart, creative and idealistic,"" we are also reportedly ""emotional moody, prone to lateness, confusion, irresponsibility; focus on fantasies?"" (http://similarminds.com/jung/infp.html)

Vincent Van Goh cut his ear off because he couldn't take it anymore; Princess Diana acts brutally to her compassion and insecurities without care for the proper Royal presentation. I wonder if they were ever self-aware to the point that they either accepted their erratic personalities to embrace both the good or bad, or somehow managed to mitigate their lulls to keep their creative cycles rolling. Please discuss your personal experience/take on this. 

My take: I dropped English in favor of CS in undergrad because I thought that I fancied myself too much and instead should go for a steady career to ""have a more realistic dream and keep on dreaming."" But after pursing that career for 5.5 years, I realize that I couldn't care less for the ""startup passion"" nor the ambition to climb the ladder and care more about helping interns learn programming or daydreaming myself at work than coding some crap so that people can consume more on the Web. 

Being a skinny guy who had mostly creative and geeky interests in college, I thought that I was more provoked by the novels, movies and music to ""daydream what could be"" instead of ever finishing or following through on any concrete plans I daydreamt about. So I took up basketball to try something different and concrete. But I find that I enjoy the creative process of basketball the most, the part where you discover, become slowly aware of your own body's mechanics and tweak them when you are shooting hoops or practicing a move in the gym all by yourself - more than playing with other people! Even in games, I get off more on a good pass or contributing to a ""good vibe"" to my teammates than actually winning the game or scoring points.  

Have you guys or gals tried to ""fix"" or ""mitigate"" parts of your INFP personalities and what sort of results/reflections have you come away with? "
1xcpbe,8,2014-02-08,Funding for Unpaid Internships,absurdfatalism,Drexel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drexel/comments/1xcpbe/funding_for_unpaid_internships/,"So my girlfriend goes to UPenn (you know, that small community college across the street) and she just found out about an awesome program they have there. Some context:

The Social Work program she is in encourages internships, sort of like Drexel has co-ops. Now as you might imagine, some of the most interesting internship options are unpaid. In Social Work this is due to the fact that the most interesting, policy changing, community centric, grass roots, life impacting (the list goes on...) organizations do not have the funding to pay interns as they are usually small and underfunded. Either that or the internship is with such a well known company that the prestige is enough to allow them to not pay (ex. ACLU over a local soup kitchen - though, in that example neither would pay probably).

UPenn has started to offer money (I've heard, starring at $3,000 for a summer -&gt; ~ $7.50 an hour...) to encourage their students to take unpaid internships. The catch?:

Those students that receive that funding must keep/update an online blog documenting their employment experience. Do you see where the 'marketing department' at UPenn must have been involved with this?

Now, those 'oh I wish I could work there, I just can't afford to be unpaid' awesome job opportunities are being filled with UPenn students. First, it is now even easier for UPenn to get their name in the door of all of the most interesting/great organizations. Second, they get an entire summer of personalized online advertising (the blog) that just repeats the message 'UPenn students have employment opportunities with great companies'.

You can stop reading hear and just think, wow, Drexel should try that for their Social Workers. However, being an engineer (not a social worker), I started to think that this may even benefit 'us' (the other majors) as well.

Having done 3 co-ops, I can tell you there are a couple of unpaid co-ops that normally get laughed at by the engineering students. I've heard the unpaid co-op is more common for liberal arts majors but is still often looked down upon as a last option. 

But think about this next time you see an unpaid internship: if that place peaks your interest then you shouldn't have to worry about money stopping you from working there. It's reasonable to think that more people would be happy if their employment was based more on interest than on financial reward.

I assert that Drexel should attempt a similar program. Drexel should get their students out into those fantastic opportunities and prosper from the essentially massive advertising campaign.

1xcv0d,2,2014-02-08,"I'm [22F] in a serious relationship, but my friends/family don't think my boyfriend [23M] is as serious about me.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1xcv0d/im_22f_in_a_serious_relationship_but_my/,"My boyfriend [23/M] and I [22/F] have been together for almost 10 months  now, and since 3 months ago we have been long distance. We love each other and have talked about being serious. Recently we talked about ending the long distance part of our relationship by moving together to a different state. He is currently going through a variety of military training, but knows he is going to his first station on November of this year. The idea is that I would move with him when he goes in November. By November, I would have graduated from college with great grades and internship experience. I also have money saved up, and have already started thinking about the city that I plan to move to. He will be more established in his job as he'll no longer be in training phase, and he has a steady and comfortable income. 
Although this change in my life is scary, I am excited for many reasons.  I'll get to experience a new place, I will finally be with my SO and basically it's a start to a new adult life. 



I expressed this idea to friends and family, and a lot have them have been less than supportive. I am a person that likes to get the opinions of the people I love in these situations. I think it's better to be ""at harmony"" with them. I know I should make my own choices, which I ultimately am, but the dissonance between the choices I make and the views my loved ones have really gnaws at me. Friends and family have been less than stellar for a number of reasons. 



* This is my first relationship. I feel like people often discredit or look down on my situation because my SO is my first, and they automatically conclude our relationship will end eventually. While I understand most people date around before they settle down with a person, I don't think this has to be a set ""rule."" I don't feel the desire to see if ""the grass is greener."" I also think we're both pretty mature and have a good ""base"". We have career goals and direction. 



* There have been some bumps in the road, and like any other person, I talk to my friends and family about them. I think from talking about so many negative aspects, my friends and family have concluded that my boyfriend isn't serious about me, or isn't making me happy. They often see me upset, but I have come to terms with myself (and am seeking therapy for it) that I am an emotionally reactive person. Happy things make me cry. Sad things make me cry. I have an issue with anxiety. I think, like most people, I talk about the bad more than I talk about the good. 


I just think, it would be unnatural if my relationship were the regular ""normal"" kind where people saw each other often and I was always upset, but our relationship is long distance as well as military. Yes, I may be a little unhappy now, but that's because I am away from him. 


With our bumps, we always try to talk it out and resolve it that way. I always bring up issues I feel we're having. For example, early on in our relationship, we had a talk about religion. His family is fairly Christian, whereas I am agnostic. I was worried he wouldn't accept that about me, but he said he would love me regardless. 


During Christmas/his birthday, I planned an expensive dinner and a show and treated him out. He didn't get me anything. When I brought it up at the end of the night, he apologized and said I was totally right about the issue and that it would never happen again. I chalked it up to him being caught up in his busy training, as he had just moved away and got started doing that, and I understand it is very stressful and he was still adjusting.


Last time he came home to visit on break, he had 3.5 days. He spent a fair amount of time with me, but he also had to see his family, friends and grandparents in those days. I was sad I didn't get to see him more, but I also respected that he wanted to spend equal time with his friends and family. On the day before he was to leave, he came over and brought his best friend over unannounced. His best friend lives about 5 mins away from me. I was upset because I wasn't expecting his friend, and I expected to spend time with my SO alone, not hanging out with his friend also. I told him this, and he said he just wanted to introduce me to him, since he always talks about how serious he is about me. My friends and family have told me that if he were serious, he would make it a priority to see me most, but I think that's unfair. 


For the last two situations, I know, and he tells me, that he never deliberately does things because he doesn't care or he wants to hurt me. And I think he does things without thinking about them. I can tell sometimes he doesn't think things through and he's a little absentminded, and I understand that about him. Whenever something bothers me, I make sure to let him know so that he understands.


From situations like the last two, I think my mom or my friends think he's not serious about us. But I feel like he is. I just don't want to be blinded by love. I'm afraid that all the things I say to defend him are not validated, and it's only because I want to convince myself. 


I brought up the moving idea to my parents last night, and my dad told me I should concentrate on my career first and not make such big decisions like moving after dating for such a short time. But I can't see how it's making anything progress and work with my SO if I chose to stay in my current city and continue long distance. It's not like I am moving to a city with no opportunities in my field; in fact the city is larger. My parents always tell me not to put 100% of my feelings into this because they don't want to see me get hurt. They harp on the fact that most people go through 3 or 4 relationships before they settle. But I don't think it's fair to withhold my feelings to save myself. That's selfish. And I'm sure those people who've had 3 or 4 relationships have been brutally hurt. That's why they have the experience. If I stay in my current city and get a job, I will have dug even deeper roots. When, then, will I make a decision to finally pick up and leave? My view is that I just need to take the risk and move. I never intended to stay in my current city anyway, and this is a good reason to branch out and experience a new city.


Actions speak louder than words, and if he were serious, his actions will show, but as long as we're a military relationship, the dynamic is that I will have to bend to him. He gets ordered where to move to, and I must make the decision if I want to follow, which I am OK with. So how else are his actions supposed to show that he's serious about me? He tells me he loves me more etc. but my friends/family says that is all talk. 


My SO always tells me how much he loves me, he's affectionate, and he tries to call/text me often. He always keeps me in the loop about his military stuff, because those things affect us. We've talked about me moving with him, and he's always hesitant, saying, ""IF you still want to move with me."" He's let things slip in the past that hint he sees a future with me. 




TL;DR - Even through the bumps along the road, I [22/F] feel that my boyfriend [23/M] is serious about us and our future, but my friends and family are doubtful. Now I'm unsure if I am making the right decisions and it's putting a strain on my side of the relationship. How do I know if I being objective and making the right decisions, or if I am just blinded by love? "
1xdhco,340,2014-02-08,"[f/m/m/m] Sex after a party (not sure how to do the tag, but there was no male contact haha)",LSUgirl90,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1xdhco/fmmm_sex_after_a_party_not_sure_how_to_do_the_tag/,"I just stumbled across this subreddit and figured I would post one of my wildest stories. A brief bit about me: I’m 23 years old with brown hair and green eyes. I’m 5’5” about 115 pounds. I have a nice butt (look at my post history for pics of it) and B cup boobs. I’ve always been told I’m “very cute.” I’ve gotten “sexy” and “pretty” more in the last couple of years it seems like. I grew up in a very straight-laced family and I have for the most part always appeared to be straight-laced as well. I’m kind of your typical all-American girl, was in a sorority in college etc. I realized in my teens that I have an abnormally high sex drive. I acted on it some, but didn’t start sleeping around a lot until I turned 20. I’m pretty much what most would describe as a sex addict now, but my family and friends would never suspect. So, on to the story, this happened about two years ago. 

I moved to New York City for the summer for an internship. The internship was pretty boring, but some of the people that I worked with were really fun. It was the first time I had lived away from home, so having people around that were welcoming and fun was nice. There was a girl from work we’ll call Heather that I got to be pretty good friends with and she would invite me to hangout with her on the weekends. We would usually go out to bars with a group of her friends, which was definitely appealing to me since I had just turned 21. 

The weekend before my last weekend in NYC Heather invited me to go to a party at this apartment. She was friends with a girl that was friends with the guys that lived there. I met up with her to go eat dinner at this sushi place before the party. I always dress fairly conservatively and that night was no different. I had on skinny jeans, some flats, and a top that wasn’t too revealing. We got to the party and it was a madhouse. We could barely find room to squeeze in, but we managed. We worked our way over to where the drinks were and started drinking. There were quite a few attractive guys there, but there were also quite a few attractive girls. I was thinking how I probably should have dressed a little more revealing if I wanted to attract any attention. A couple of guys came up to talk to us early on, but we weren’t really into them. Heather actually had a boyfriend, but he had other plans that night. She was my official “wing-woman” for the night. 

Later on in the night there was a guy named Max, who was a law school student, that came up and started talking to us and I thought he was pretty attractive. He was tall, a little muscular, and had a cute but not amazing face. He was really funny too, which helped. He talked me into taking a shot with him and after that we were kind of attached at the hip for the next couple of hours. He started being more flirtatious and bold, even occasionally teasingly grabbing my butt. I acted slightly offended and would slap his hand, but in reality I was really turned on and liked it. Like I said, my sex drive is always insane, but when I drink my hormones jump to another level. I really wanted him to take me in one of the rooms and have his way with me, but I’m never that bold about instigating. I like to let guys take the lead. 

The party started winding down and eventually there were only about ten people left. Heather told me she was ready to leave. I told her I was going to stay and hang out with Max a little more. I found out earlier on that he was one of the two guys that lived at the apartment. She just laughed and told me to have fun. 

Heather was only gone for about ten minutes before Max asked me if I wanted to go to his bedroom, so we could be alone. I said yes and we headed to his room. He shut the door behind us and just as soon as it closed he grabbed my face and we started kissing. He walked me back to the wall until my back was up against it. We continued to kiss and before I knew it he was unbuttoning my jeans. He slid them down slightly and slid his hand down and began rubbing my wet pussy. I wanted him inside me so badly. I reached down with my right hand and began rubbing his cock from outside his pants. I quickly became bored with that and unbuckled his belt and pants. I slid his pants and underwear down and dropped to my knees. I was staring at his cock. It was nice and very thick and probably around seven inches long. I stroked it a few times with my hand before taking it into my mouth. His thickness made my mouth feel very full and I loved it. I began sucking long and hard strokes. I tried taking all of him in my mouth until his cock nearly hit the back of my throat. He was moaning and making very sexy noises. I released his cock from my mouth and began licking and sucking on his balls while I stroked his cock. I wanted him inside me. 

He said we should go over to his bed. We walked over to his bed and I took all of my clothes off and so did he. I climbed onto his bed and he was still standing on the side. He grabbed me and flipped me around facing away from him and bent me over on all fours. He buried his face in my pussy from behind. I love it when guys do this, so it was really turning me on. I could feel his tongue maneuvering trying to find my clit and I was moaning wildly. Finally he couldn’t take it anymore and he got up behind me and slid his thick cock in my pussy. He was going slowly and it felt wonderful. I could feel every inch of him filling me up. After going slow for a good while he began fucking me harder and harder. I felt an orgasm coming on and I braced myself before exploding. I began moaning and screaming as I came. He began being more rough and pulled my hair as I came. It made me scream even louder with pleasure. 

He flipped me over onto my back and slid his cock back in my pussy again. We were both covered in sweat now and I felt his sweat drip down onto my body. It always turns me on feeling a guy work hard at fucking me and feeling him sweat. There is something very manly about it. He continued with the rough tone he began setting moments before. He was thrusting in and out of me quickly. He was pulling my hair with one of his hands. He kept saying, “You like that don’t you sexy?” I would respond, “Yeah, fuck me hard. Please fuck me hard.” I wasn’t just saying that to turn him on. I really wanted him to. I felt insatiable at that point. I just wanted to be fucked all night. After slamming his cock in and out of me for a while longer he told me he was about to cum. He pulled out of me and shot his cum all over my stomach. It was a lot and it felt so warm. I love that feeling of warmth on my skin. I asked if he had a towel. He said he’d have to go to the bathroom to grab one. 

He left the room and went into the hallway to get to the bathroom to grab a towel. He came back and I wiped his cum off of my stomach. I put my panties back on and threw my shirt on. He asked why I was putting my clothes on. I said I needed to pee. He said that everyone was pretty much gone. He said there is one guy on the couch watching TV with his roommate and that’s all. The hallway was away from the living area, so I just stepped out into the hall and went into the bathroom with my panties and shirt on. 

I was in there for a few minutes and when I walked out I heard Max in the kitchen, which was at the other end of the hallway. I looked down that way and Max and his roommate Kevin were standing there. I didn’t realize that Kevin was his roommate earlier, but I saw Kevin earlier at the party and I was extremely attracted to him. He was really tall, dark hair, ice blue eyes, and in really good shape. He was just almost modelish looking. He was a fellow law school student. Kevin said, “ohh damn, looking good!” Max laughed and said, “She looks even better naked.” Kevin said, “Oh really? Hmm I want to see.” I stood frozen. I didn’t know how to respond. I knew I should try to act offended for being objectified. In reality I wanted to be really slutty. I wanted to just take my clothes off right there, but I didn’t. Max said, “Sorry, didn’t mean to embarrass you.” Kevin said, “but really let’s see.” I looked at Max and he looked back as if to tell me he was cool with it. I was drunk enough still to be bold, so I just lifted my shirt up and quickly showed him my tits. He said, “Damn, that’s it. Come to my room.” 

I thought he was joking at first, but he walked into the hallway and grabbed my hand and he led me into his bedroom. My head was spinning. I felt so dirty, but I loved it. I wanted to resist to make myself seem more ladylike, but deep down I didn’t want to. He walked me over and laid me down on his bed. Max stood in the doorway and laughed and said, “you son of a bitch.” He definitely didn’t seem to mind what was happening. Kevin slid my shirt off and began kissing my neck down to my chest. He was teasing and sucking on my nipples. My nipples quickly got hard and I was gushing wet. Max was still standing in the doorway watching. Kevin stood up and unbuckled his belt and dropped his jeans. He stood beside the bed and I leaned up and took his cock in my mouth. His wasn’t quite as thick as Max’s, but it was longer. He was probably around eight inches. I felt so slutty that Max was watching this, but it was turning me on. Kevin just stood at the side of the bed and was basically face fucking me. During the course of this he reached down and slid my panties off. He continued to slide his cock in and out of my mouth occasionally hitting the back of my throat and slightly gagging me. 

He finally got up on the bed and he slid his cock in my pussy as a I lay on my back. I put my legs up on his shoulders and he started pounding me. He felt so strong. He was grunting and I could feel his hips slam into me. I felt my body begin to tense up and shockwaves flowed throughout it. I orgasmed harder than I had earlier. My pussy was gushing wet. The sounds of his cock slamming in and out of me began getting sloppier and sloppier as I continued to get more turned on. He flipped me over and got me up on all fours. His cock slid back in me with ease. I felt like a wild animal just wanting to satisfy all of my desires. He continued pounding me hard. 

A couple of minutes later Max appears beside the bed. I think he was watching the whole time, but I’m not sure. Either way, I guess he was recharged and decided to try to join in the action. He was beside the bed naked and rock hard. The angle was awkward, so I felt like I couldn’t really take him in my mouth. I told him to get on the bed in front of me. He sat down on the bed in front of me with his back against the wall. Kevin continued to fuck me from behind as I took Max’s cock back into my mouth. This was really not how I expected the night to turn out. I felt so full on both ends. It was an amazing feeling. The harder Kevin pounded me the harder I sucked on Max’s cock. If he was going too hard I had to take Max’s cock from my mouth, so I could moan. We stayed in this position for a really long time. 

Eventually Max and Kevin switched out. Kevin knelt in front of me though and was face fucking me as Max fucked me from behind. At some point I began screaming that I wanted both of them to cum for me. A few minutes later Kevin told me he was about to cum and I braced myself and waited for his warm cum to start entering my mouth. A few moments later I felt him twitch and felt his cum start to shoot out and hit the back of my throat and fill my mouth. I swallowed every drop. Not even a minute later Max said he was about to cum. I moved forward and turned around taking his cock in my mouth. A few moments later he began unloading his cum in my mouth too. I fell back into the bed. I was exhausted. Max and Kevin sat there for a while catching their breath. 

They started talking about food and asked if I wanted any. I said sure. They said they were going to go to this pizza place and grab some food and bring it back. They left and I passed out lying there naked on Kevin’s bed. I woke up about 10 minutes later to the other guy, whom I had completely forgotten was there, standing in the doorway. He was really cute. He was about as attractive as Max, but in a different way. He was shorter, about 5’10”, brown hair, in shape, rugged cute look. He looked like he just walked up. When I looked up and looked at him he just looked kind of dazed. He kind of chuckled and said, “what’s up?” I said, “what’s your name?” He said, “Jeff.” I said, “come here.” I knew what he wanted and I felt like I had broken the seal that night. I was in wild mode and I was still ridiculously turned on. 

He walked over and I got down from the bed and onto my knees. I unbuckled his pants and pulled them down. He had a look of amazement on his face. His cock was actually a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It was around seven inches, but super thick. Like even a little thicker than Max’s. I took it in my mouth and started sucking him hard and fast. He kept muttering dirty stuff to me and had his hand on the back of my head. 

After a few minutes I got up on the bed and bent over in front of him. He entered my pussy from behind. I was beginning to be sore, but not sore enough for it to not be pleasurable. He was so thick it felt like he was stretching me out. I wondered if Max and Kevin would be home while this was still going on and what their reaction would be. They couldn’t really say much. They basically started all of this. Jeff was fucking me harder than Max or Kevin did. He seemed like he loved being in control. He had his hands on my hips and was pulling them hard back into his cock. He didn’t last long. It was only about seven minutes before Jeff started losing control and pulled out and came all over my ass and pussy. He got up and put his pants on and walked out of the room. He didn't even grab a towel for me, but he was drunk and I wasn't being very ladylike. Can't expect much in that situation. I just laid on my stomach and let his cum dry on me.

Max and Kevin came home about fifteen minutes later. I don’t know if they ever knew that Jeff fucked me. I’m sure he told them at some point, but I didn’t. I slept in Kevin’s bed that night and fucked him again early the next morning. I left NYC to head home after that next weekend. Also, I know it was really dumb of me not to use protection you don’t have to tell me that. My first shot at telling one of my stories, be nice. :)  Also, thanks to a fellow gonewildstory teller that really turns me on for inspiring me to tell my story, you know who you are ;)

1xdpcc,4,2014-02-08,My bf [25 M] almost broke up with me [26 F] &amp; I'm in shock! Need an outsiders view of the situation!,nmh111112,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xdpcc/my_bf_25_m_almost_broke_up_with_me_26_f_im_in/,"Background: My boyfriend [25 m] and I [26 f] have been together for 1 year &amp; 3 months. 


Our relationship has been tricky, yet fun, rewarding, &amp; remarkable. He immigrated here 5 yrs ago with his family from Cuba, and together, we have learned how to compromise and make adjustments. We have grown as a couple, share similar interests, we have taught each other patience, want the same things in the future, laugh, &amp; our sex life is great, etc. 


Our biggest issues: 1) We are both financially strapped as students and part-time employees. I had a full-time job when we met and left that job for a grad school internship. He was unemployed when we met, struggled to find work, got a job working 4 hours per day at minimum wage, and just got fired for not hearing his phone ring at 4 AM to come to work on Saturday. He was supposed to move in with me this fall, but it didn't happen because he could not find a full-time job. Mind you, it is tough for a lot of immigrants in the job market. 


2) Working through cultural differences. When we first started dating, he spent WAY too much time with his family and put them before me all the time. He lives at home (he helped his family buy their house by working 40+ hours per week in a factory for 3 years). He made adjustments for me and I for him. I am now very close with his family, especially his little sister. Made it work! 


3) He is more of a loner than I am. However, after undergraduate school, many of my friends moved far away and my new friends are typically women with families. I have had difficulties finding the time or energy to expand my social network and the friends I do have left are not dependable. Therefore, we spend a lot of time together. I guess maybe too much. And when we are together, we don't do very much because we cannot afford to go out and its snowy and cold here. 


I did not see this afternoon coming. We had a fight yesterday. He has been incredibly irritable and distant on &amp; off these past couple of weeks, overwhelmed with school, finances, &amp; work. I am getting over a spout of depression, yet, never got mean toward him. I have tried everything I can to help him feel better, but yesterday, he screamed at me on the phone because I asked him 2 questions. I hung up and told him to contact me in the morning when he could control himself.


He came over this morning, very defensive. When I explained that I understood he's struggling, but it isn't right to take it out on me, he said he was sick of it. I asked him if he was breaking up with me, and he said ""Basically"". I was in absolute shock. After trying to get to the root of his issue, he said he just wants to be alone (revealed he lost his job and a pipe broke in his bedroom - last straw). He deals with his issues by closing himself off, while I want to talk it out. He lets things build up and then hides or loses it. He said he needs space, and doesn't know how long he will need space for. I asked him why we couldn't be together while I gave him space, and he said he didn't think I could handle us not seeing or talking to each other as much, and he thought it would hurt me more to have to be together and pull back than to just completely pull back or emotionally tolerate it. Doesn't think I have it in me to not pressure him. He feels smothered by me always obsessing about his happiness and well-being. He gets tired of seeing me too much. He said he doesn't know how long it will last until he figures things out, but said that if we want to work, he needs me to back off a bit. He said he feels too much pressure from me to get work, move in, take things to the next level, etc. It boils down to him needing less pressure. I asked him what he needed, and I agreed to it. 


I guess I am in shock because I didn't realize I was doing this. I realized that once again I have lost myself in someone else. I feel horrible and scared. I am willing to do what it takes to preserve this relationship, and honestly, I could use some space too. I need to find myself, and I need something more besides him in my life.He assured me that he really loves me, wants a future together, we will still see each other, and be a couple like we are, but not always in contact, and that I have to respect that he wants a lot of time to himself. I'm in shock over the situation, but more so scared and confused. I didn't see it coming. I feel crushed. 


He is often true to his word, and I trust that he really does want to be with me. I want to prove that I have the capacity to give him what he needs, that I can back off and not pressure him. I have my own needs, yet I see this as a pattern in every relationship I have had. I have given him much more space and understanding than I did in the past. He said he has seen a big change. Yet, I'm still too co-dependent. I don't want to fuck this one up! Yet, I don't want to be lead on only for him to randomly decide that yes, he really is done. 


TL;DR: Boyfriend of 1 yr 3 months almost broke up with me because he wants to be alone to figure things out and not pressured, and doesn't think I can handle giving him the space he needs without becoming depressed or just not being able to give him space at all. We are going to try it, and I am willing to back off for the sake of us. Do you think he will drag me along and then end it? 

What do I do? Sorry for the long rant! "

I feel a lot better about the situation just from writing the letter and getting some validation from you guys. It probably isn't worth risking harassment from the police department. You all fucking rock, have a wonderful night.**

My landlord (who is a cop) caught me and my fiancé smoking in the apartment, and we are now getting evicted. I understand why he has to evict us, he's a cop and all, but he treated us like absolute lowlifes and screamed at and intimidated us for a good hour. We have been great tenants up until now- always pay our rent on time, have made repairs to the place, clean up after our dog. I want to leave him this letter when we move out, do you think it is too much? Sorry in advance for the wall of text:


Dear Landlord, 
I will not attempt to deny that what we did was wrong. We knowingly broke the terms of our lease agreement and you had every right to evict us. One could easily argue that your profession obligated you to do so. We took the risk, knowing that this was a possibility. I completely understand your anger and frustration. The righteousness of your actions is not a question for me in the slightest. 


What bothers me about what transpired on that night is the treatment we received. As soon as the topic of marijuana came up we were treated as lowly criminals, losers, “potheads”, immature. I enjoy using marijuana recreationally and medicinally. That does not make me a criminal. 


Let me give you some background on myself for a better perspective. I was born and raised in a working class Irish Catholic family in upstate New York. Due to psychological manipulation, emotional, verbal and physical abuse throughout my childhood, I have battled both depression and severe anxiety for over 20 years. Perhaps I have a genetic predisposition to these conditions, but I cannot deny that my upbringing was a large contributor. 


Regardless, there were positives from my childhood. I was heavily involved in volunteering through Girl Scouts. This fostered a strong sense of compassion and appreciation of differences in others. The situation at home enabled me to hone skills in reading others emotions and understanding their motives, needs and wants.


I left my parents home at 18 and finished my Bachelors in secondary education at 22. I continued my coursework and in a year completed a Masters in special education. The financial burden for these degrees falls on me and me alone. I graduated from my Masters program at the top of my class and received an award for excellence. I managed to achieve this while working two jobs and completing a full time internship at a middle school. I found my passion and calling in working with students with emotional and/or behavioral difficulties. Maybe it is because I see some of myself in many of them. I used marijuana almost daily throughout this time, always after my obligations were finished. 


I have been a special education teacher for four years. I am usually more humble about it, but I am an excellent and dedicated teacher. Special education is my niche and I truly enjoy going to work everyday. I have coached extracurricular activities with no stipend, sometimes giving up entire weekends to travel. I am only reimbursed for gas milage. I arrive at work early and stay late at least 3 times a week to provide extra help for students. Nobody pays me to do this, nobody asks me to do this. I do it because it is the right thing. I volunteer at an animal shelter on the weekends. I continue to use marijuana on a somewhat regular basis. It helps me relax and manage my anxiety. It helps me let go of some of the stress that is a given in my line of work. I love my job and cannot imagine doing anything else, but that does not mean it isn’t horrendously stressful at times. Some days I come home feeling absolutely heartbroken, knowing full well what some of my students endure at home. As an officer of the law, I am sure you can relate to this sentiment. 


I am a responsible user. I do not drive under the influence. I do not talk about my usage with students; I actively encourage them to hold off on alcohol and other substances until they are older and their brains have finished developing. I have never used before work or a school function. I would liken coming home and smoking a joint to coming home and having a beer after work. I do not enjoy the “stoner” culture and believe it gives responsible users a bad name. It undermines the extensive evidence showing that marijuana is no more dangerous or destructive than alcohol or cigarettes. 


That night you told us that marijuana is the “worst drug on the street”. My fiancé was taunted and asked, “Are you an adult?!” You threatened to call my employer and tell them about this incident in an attempt to have me fired. You said, “as a teacher, you shouldn’t be doing that”. I wanted to ask why, but when you have a 6’4, 250+ lb. army reservist/cop standing over you, you try your best to diffuse the situation. You threatened to get a warrant and send us to jail if we had any more in the apartment. Fortunately, possession under an ounce is merely a civil violation, so you would not have been able to do that. I think you know that you basically lied to our faces in an effort to intimidate us. 


Why shouldn’t I be using marijuana as a teacher? Is it better for me to manage my symptoms by having a few drinks when I come home? By going to a doctor and getting pharmaceuticals with horrible side effects? The answer I hear most often is simply, “because it is illegal”. This seems to be the strongest argument against marijuana right now. The stigma surrounding it is, quite frankly, preposterous. There is an abundance of young professionals without children who responsibly use marijuana, but out of fear for their jobs or reputations, they don’t feel safe discussing it with others. They won’t support groups like NORML for fear of being recognized and judged. 


With the legislation recently passed in Colorado and Washington, it is only a matter of time before the rest of the country gets on board with full legalization. Dave Zuckerman, one of our state Senators, has already introduced legislation that would give the state of Vermont the ability to tax and sell marijuana. They do not expect it to pass until 2015, but it is a start. New Hampshire’s House recently passed a bill to legalize marijuana. I doubt it will make it through the Senate, and the Governor has promised to veto the bill, but it is a step in the right direction.


We deserved to be evicted from the apartment for breaking the terms of the lease agreement, but we did not deserve to be treated as criminals. We are not losers or leeches on society. We do our best to improve the community and care deeply about it. 


It isn’t all bad though. Your reaction has inspired me to go public with my support of sensible marijuana legislation. It horrifies me to think that anyone else is at risk of facing that kind of prejudice over a plant. I am in the process of gathering board members for a Vermont chapter of NORML. I refuse to hide or be intimidated any longer. I will do everything in my power to ensure that the citizens of Vermont are well educated on this issue, and when it does come to a vote, it will pass. 


Thank you for your time and for the opportunity. The apartment was lovely and we will miss living here. I wish you all the best and hope you understand that I hold no ill will towards you or your wife.


Sincerely,
Ballsack Avenger"

My pay will be:

$28k in 2013 from campus job, internship, signing bonus

~$55k in 2014 as I start working this summer

~$125k to 2015 from my first full year of working (assuming stock units retain their current value and are sold on schedule)

Right now I have $25k in a money market savings account earning 0.85%. It seems like a good idea to start saving early, but I'm not totally sure how the law works. Since this money is post-tax, I should be putting it in a Roth. Do the annual contribution limits start on January 1st, or some other date? It would be nice if I could put money in for 2013, and 2014 before I start running into the income limits in 2015 and have to deal with a backdoor roth. Also, it would be one more early year of tax-free growth. 

Would it make sense for invest in any other way, other than my employer 401(k) when I start working? A 6% contribution will get me a 3% match, no match beyond that.

Will I be able to do a full year's contribution to my employer 401(k) in 2014?

Bonus question: One of my parents has full health benefits, the other has a high deductible plan. Can I do an HSA? I'm currently on the plan with full benefits but could switch."

1xeyxl,1,2014-02-09,Trust Issues (Feel Free to Psychoanalyze or Whatnot),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xeyxl/trust_issues_feel_free_to_psychoanalyze_or_whatnot/,"Hello everyone. Forgive me if this post becomes rather unnecessarily long. For those of you who are not interested in wading through my forthcoming rant, I present to you a summary.

**TL;DR: I think I have trust issues stemming from a heart-wrenching breakup.** 

In my first year of university I fell in love. She was an upperclassman student who I had met through a cultural club that we both happened to be members of. We started dating around April, near the close of Spring semester. 

She had her host of troubles, and I certainly had mine - we were both human after all. Her's was a strong personality that led many of our mutual friends to label her ""controlling."" At the time, I dismissed these charges as her ""controlling"" ways were quite endearing to me. 

Needless to say, when one partner in a relationship is seen as making all the calls, then the other is soon to be pitied as whipped. That role fell onto me, I suppose. Though perhaps it would be more precise to say that I relished the role and wound the noose that was lain across my neck tighter and tighter with every act of submissiveness that I had shown to my girlfriend. 

Before the end of the semester, I would say that our relationship was fairly normal. Although these aforementioned qualities were indeed present in our relationship, they were not definitive in the very least. However, as the semester came to an end I found myself traveling abroad to partake in a work-study internship over the entirety of the summer. Stripped away from this newly-formed relationship, I desperately tried to maintain it via a long distance relationship in which I found myself increasingly giving in to her wanton acts. At one point, she made me write out a list of things that I were prohibited from doing. This must sound queer, but at the time I found I merely saw this as endearing. I suppose this must be that cliché situation in which one lives in a state of denial, repressing the negative comments of close friends in regards to one's relationship with another. 

Anyways, this story seems to be going nowhere soon, so I will cut to chase and say that I was kicked to curb a few weeks into the following academic year. This girl had been my first love and the first woman I had ever known. Is it strange that I would have such deep feelings for her? 

I realize at this point that this sounds like the case of a girl dumping an obsessive guy who does not give her any breathing room. I certainly agree with this judgment: over the summer our relationship had degraded into one where I tried to appease her and make her smile at every waking moment. From answering her multitudes of messages (Facebook Mobile is an amazing app btw) while frantically working and staying up every night to answer her skype calls from the States, I was running myself ragged and miserable trying to keep our relationship afloat so as to restart it the following academic semester.

Though I guess the habits that were ingrained in me over the summer did not die out and I might have been suffocating her. To be honest, I do not know. Perhaps I missed the cues in her body language or something, but she had never clearly indicated this to me so any speculation on the subject is merely that - speculation. 

I was dumped for the reason that she was busy with her studies as she had entered into a prestigious business program at our university. Understandable. Except she started seeing another guy right after she broke up with me. I was of course, bitter, but it's not her fault if she came to like another guy. We were both human after all. 

It's strange for me to say this of myself, but I think I am quite dense. Perhaps there were indeed signs that this break up was coming, but I had not seen them. It felt as if all the wind was taken out of my sails. I remember feeling empty and yet having this peculiar feeling of needing to vomit.

Anyway, the next week or so we chatted and I made a fool of myself asking, or should I say begging for a reason. Why? Or rather... How? How could this happen? I thought things were going well for us? Did everything this past summer mean that little to you? I'm sorry.

It's been about a year since then and I've not wallowed in despair and self-hate. I flirted around with other girls and have dated four others after this personal tragedy. Yet, these relationships were all short-lived, with the shortest lasting less than a night. 

I seemed to panic. Anxiety and stress were all I felt whenever I was with these girls. I felt disgusted when we exchanged kisses and had sex. The smell of their bodily fluids lasting in my dormitory room made me want to vomit at the mere thought. I resorted to spraying febreeze around the room multiple times. 

These girls that I dated were not unattractive girls. Though they certainly were not as dazzling as her. They each had their own quirks that I found endearing and I found myself questioning why I could not find the energy or willingness to date and keep a steady relationship. In the end, I would always break things off suddenly and vaguely, blurting out some incoherent reason such as that damned line: ""It's not your fault. It's...me..."" 

Stupid, really. Most of the time that line holds the exact opposite meaning. I don't like you anymore so I want to break things off. But this idea of ""not liking something anymore"" is an internal feeling, no? So perhaps, it is really me.

That is the conclusion that I have rambled thus far to attain. Utilizing those good-old internet psychology pages, I find myself questioning whether or not I have commitment or rather, trust issues. Has the pain of that first love made me weary of opening myself up to others? Perhaps. I certainly do not want to date, if that is any indication of anything. 

I've lost a lot of friends and I've made a few girls cry. It's a horrible feeling, really. Emptiness, yet again. I don't want things to last this way. I too want to find companionship. I fear however, that with the way things are, I cannot. I will not. 

Thanks again. Have a lovely day. :)"
1xfu64,0,2014-02-09,Im a (M24) asshole who cheated on the best thing that ever happened to him gf (F22),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xfu64/im_a_m24_asshole_who_cheated_on_the_best_thing/,"I met my girlfriend working for the Disney internship program. We were 

together for 3 months before her program ended and

she had to go back home and i stayed for another 2 and a half months 

without her.We decided to move in together after my

program ended.


A few weeks before she was to move down here , she saw a high 

school friend she was in love with in a park at 3 am (she was

honest about seeing a guy not the love part). She told me they ve 

never been together because he s in the air force and she

didn't think she was good enough for him. The guy told her he had 

feelings for her. It wasn't till she moved here that she told me

she loved the guy.


In Miami she was miserable , hated her job , hated the people , the 

traffic,Everything.

The reason i went to disney was to have fun and have the college 

experience i never had. At work i start to notice their s a girl

who likes me. Didn't really pay attention to her , not my type and i was 

hanging around another girl at that time.

I meet my gf in a club and we start to hang out. We were official a 

week or two after we met. But my roommates throw a small

party later that month and they tell me to invite girls. So i invite my 

coworkers and they also bring the co worker who likes me .

We all start drinking and dancing and suddenly im kissing the coworker. 

We kissed a few times that night ( i felt terrible after ,

my ex cheated on me with a friend and i always thought cheating was 

the most disgusting thing ever) I was tired of being the

safe guy , the nice guy. Then 2 or 3 weeks after that we kissed again 

at work.


Throughout my program nothing else happens with this girl or any other 

girl. The co worker found a bf and i had my gf. Her bf

did cheat on her and she started talking to me more at work and 

through text late in my program (her program ended before

mine). I have zero feelings for this girl.


My gf tells me about the feelings about her guy friend and i freak out . 

When i get mad i don't really scream, want to talk , or get

physical. What i do is just ignore the person until my anger passes.So 

she doesn't get the point of being honest with me if im

gonna treat her like that. I was really great full she was honest with 

me.

I receive a Facebook message from the co worker saying how much 

she loved me , and that she wishes that we would of been

single when we were in the program because she felt that i was her 

ideal guy and that we were similar and stuff.


So the coworker texts me from time to time about school and parents 

and stuff like that , occasionally the drunk texts about

wanting too be with me. I pay little attention , she s 2000 miles away 

and it felt good being appreciated when my gf told me

about the guy friend. My gf tells me about the guy friend and packs 

her bags a few times and i start texting my coworker more and get 

flirty with her. I was so upset my gf was going to leave me for another

guy.But then my gf said she chose me and has no feelings for her 

friend.

.My gf finds out i was texting with her and tells me to stop texting her. 

So i do tell my coworker to stop texting me , even though she does 

send me a handful of texts, it wasn't anything like the texts before and she got bored because i only texted her one letter or one word

answers and she told me i suck and she also sent me group holiday 

messages.


We r still having some problems because she hates miami.

But things get a bit better , a few hours before new years she tells me 

she loves me and that she wants to stay. We go back

home make love and i start to get a few happy new year messages. I 

open it in front of her not thinking much of it . But one

reads ""Happy new year can't wait to see you"". My gf gets furious. I ask 

what she meant and she responds I want to see you but

my gf doesn't see this message.After that night i promised to cut all 

contact with the coworker. I told the coworker i wanted zero

contact from her , so I erased her from FB and my phone.We kind of 

work things out , but then she tells me that she got in

contact with her guy friend after she saw my co workers text.

I forgave her and right when i was taking her to the airport she tells 

me that they had talked about getting together . I got

furious and ignored her the whole way. (she went back home for a 

week to visit family). While she was their we patched things

up. She told me she wasn't gna see him. When i pick her up from the 

airport she tells me they had breakfast together and

talked. I got angry and had a huge fight that night.

Again we make up and demand she erase his fb and number which she 

did.


We decided to move back to her town. She s in Jacksonville and the 

plan was for me to meet her their and then drive together to

her town. I was suppose to go Friday . But she called me wednesday

saying she wants nothing to do with me because the

messaged the coworker and asked if we ever did anything and the 

coworker said we did kiss and i had told her i had feelings for her. My gf had asked me that very same

question like 5 times , And i always said no. She said she would have 

forgiven me for it but i was too ashamed and afraid she

was gonna leave me for it. She s the most important person in my life

, theirs no way i would have cheated on her if i was nt in Disney in my 

college experience mode. I Love Her , she brings out the best in me. 

She told me that if she doesnt ever talk to me or see me again she s 

ok with that. She doesnt even want to be friends because ""why would

i be friends with someone who i dislike as a person"" . She said that i 

wasted a year of her life. It pains me so much knowing i hurt the best 

thing that ever happened to me.


TL;DR : Im an asshole who cheated on his gf with  a coworker. And 

kept on lying to her about it because i didnt want to lose her. I love 

her so much . I dont know what to do ? Everything reminds me of her 

and she wants nothing to do with me."

1xfzmn,1,2014-02-09,Feeling stuck,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1xfzmn/feeling_stuck/,"As the title suggests, I am feeling stuck. I am stuck in an endless loop, a rotary of problems with no exit. 

My life has had its ups and downs over the past few years. I’ve struggled since childhood with weight/self-esteem issues, and throughout college I’ve had to deal with my mom’s declining health issues. Just a short background, my mom had a stroke during the summer of ’09 (I was a sophomore in college). I would go home on the weekends to help my dad around the house since I lived close enough to home. Finally in the summer of 2012 after I had graduated, she had major brain surgery. I almost lost her, but luckily she lived and is back to a slightly independent state.

A few short weeks after her surgery, I received an internship offer across the country and decided to take up the opportunity. I moved out for 6 months to Florida and absolutely loved it. I gained new friends, lost 30lbs, gained financial independence, new awesome surroundings, and basically started my life over. However, I always had guilt for not being with my family and for not being next to my mom during her therapy. She was well-taken care of by my father, but the guilt was still there. That’s why I chose to move back home once my internship ended. I could have easy stayed, working a close-to minimum wage job for a while, but I left.

Which leaves me here, feeling stuck a year later. I am currently living at home with my family, financially independent, grabbed a full-time job in the Fall, but still left empty and unsatisfied. I left behind that ‘new life’ and the opportunity to continue working for a dream company because I felt that I needed to be at home with my mom and dad for support. 

My current job leaves me drained at the end of every day- there’s always something wrong or passing blame onto the “lesser” people in the office (ie. Me). It is mentally draining to say the least. If I don’t have to stay and work overtime, I go home, make dinner, then I go to sleep. My line of work isn’t related at all to my degree and I find no passion in what I currently do.

When I come home, you can smell the stress and anxiety in the air. My mom, who is now finished with therapy, can’t really talk or express anything. My dad and I are her main caretakers. I feel guilty when I cannot understand her and get upset when my frustration skyrockets. I have no control over my emotions and I shut down easily. My dad is depressed the same way I am. We both have a look of defeat, and have guilt riding on our backs for feeling this way. 

To make this a little shorter, I have such an urge to move away. I crave my independence back, especially since I’m in my early 20’s and my life is that of a 50 year old. I miss working for the company in Florida too, although the compensation wasn’t anything to boast about. I miss my friends, the sunshine, my physical health, and the adventures I would constantly be on. One of my friends has an apartment vacancy in March, so the opportunity is there. But I’d be trading my income, full benefits, health insurance, and job security for what seems to be a great opportunity/financial suicide.  I would instantly feel regret and guilt when I leave my dad behind to take care of my mother alone. Just thinking about his mental health in all this upsets me. 

I honestly don’t know what to do.
I guess I just need some general life advice. My support system dwindled away since it’s been almost 2 years since my mom’s surgery- everyone suddenly isn’t as attainable for comfort and my friends seem to have their own issues, that I can’t even talk to them about it.

I need to get away from it all."

1xgnbx,1011,2014-02-09,The day that TiTP leaked...,[deleted],fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1xgnbx/the_day_that_titp_leaked/,"Hello again FatPeopleStories! Nutritionist here!! 

I promised more stories and today I was reminded of one of my favorite humorous ones so I needed to share it here. But first, some introductions! I've worked at the same hospital for 3 years now (2 employed, 1 as an intern) and so there are the same cast of reoccurring characters. 

~Me: Known to my co-workers as ""Kyo"". Registered Dietitian, relatively new to the job. I'm also relatively young as I graduated from high school and college a year early. I'm no genius, I was just a hard worker and got sick of school^ tee hee. I'm 5'6"" and 135 lbs. I also do personal training on the side.

~Dr. B: A dear dear friend of mine who is a newly hired doctor at the hospital. He is an FtM transgender and is completely transitioned, aka he ""blends"" perfectly and you'd never know he was transgender. He's 6'0"" and around 195 pounds; aka, a buff hottie. (Literally, every woman in that hospital has her panties dropping.)

~Dr. Johnson: An attending. He is diabetic and a total sweetheart. He's dedicated his whole life to curing diabetes and helping people from developing it. 

~Hayley: A heavier nurse, but the sweetest and most intelligent person you'd ever meet. She wants to lose weight to be healthier to have a baby, but it's hard for her with the long hours of nursing. She has absolutely no fatlogic, but weightloss is mentally hard for her. Completely understandable. She's a new client of mine. 

~Benjamin: MALE NURSE. He's also a personal trainer with me and takes care of the patients in the ""Obese hall"" where I'm stuck on a daily basis. He's 6'2"" and around 200 pounds. He does amateur body building on the side. Aka, has no life between nursing and bodybuilding. 

~Ms. Jade: Our receptionist for the front hospital desk. Very sassy black woman who don't need no donuts. She's tall and slender and beautiful, but also doesn't take shit from the people who come into the ER/hospital screaming. 

~Dezzy (aka Sunshine): My boyfriend/fiance. He's on the heavier side and like Hayley has no fatlogic what so ever. He is just way too attached to Pizza, Beer, Pasta and Pretzels. He's a mechanical engineer and coaches kids lacrosse in his free time. He's around 6'4"" and 250-255 pounds. 

And ~Hayden: A skinny male nurse who has literally no tolerance for obese patients. All the doctors understand this so he usually trades off for patients ""that are actually worth helping"". A little harsh, but that means Ben and I get more people to help. 

So ONTO THE STORY:

One day I was called to the front by Ms. Jade and handed a folder for a female patient who was just admitted for strange heart palpitations, abnormal sudden weight gain, frequent urination and numbness in limbs. 

My heart dropped, it had to be Type II diabetes. I glanced quickly over to her sheet; she was only 35. A wave of sadness fell over me. I went to deliver the folder to Hayden so we could go see her before either Dr. B or Dr. Johnson came in to formally diagnose her. 

Hayden took one look at her folder and scoffed at me. 

""Look at this, she's a monster."" He pointed to her weight. 

I sighed, ""Give her the benefit of the doubt, would you? She's probably got diabetes, and gained weight, became depressed, gained more. You know how this works.""

He rolled his eyes, ""You're too nice. If you were a nurse you wouldn't be this understanding. Sometimes they need tough love."" 

There it was; the ""hypocritical"" oath. Honestly it never happened to me except with Hayden and a couple of nurses in my first year. They think that since I only had to obtain a bachelor's degree, take an internship and take a test to become accredited, that I was the scum of the earth and thought I was a nurse myself. I had a good feeling in my gut about this patient, that she could be helped and reasoned with. 

I shook my head and made a beeline for Ben. 

He was standing right outside a closed door, shaking his head.

What did that mean? Ben was always so chipper.

I handed him the folder and whispered, ""What's up Mr. Schwarzenegger?"" 

""Fuck this whore."" He hissed in my ear. 

""Please don't leave, pleaseeeeeee Ben,"" I begged. He was always my partner in crime. I needed him for this. He's a gold medalist in combating fat-logic. And it was obvious this woman had fat-logic. 

""No."" 

He had never been so angry and stern. At this point I couldn't even imagine why everyone got to this patient before I did and hated her. 

Luckily after a little cajoling and begging I got Hayley to help me. She took the folder and walked into the room to talk with the patient. 

I waited a bit, because nurses take all the vitals, etc, etc then inform the patient that a doctor and a nutritionist are going to come see them, especially in forms of sudden weight gain/loss. 

Hayley left the room with a big smile on her face. ""She's a sweetheart, you'll be fine."" She patted me on the shoulder. 

I couldn't help but smile, I KNEW someone had to have an objective opinion on this woman. I took a deep breath and entered the room. 

The lady was bigger, about 5'4"" and around 210 pounds if I remember correctly. She had fake red/purple hair and cute cat-eye make up and red lipstick. I swear it's exactly how I now picture every single fat activist in one stereotypical person. She had a pencil skirt on and a sweater covering a loop neck sweater (I know none of these are probably what they are called. I live in sweats and scrubs so fashion isn't my strong point.) 

She smiled at me and shook my hand. We'll call her Donna. 

""You must be the nutritionist, I'm so happy they called you in here.""

My heart lept for joy. She was going to make it!!! 

""I am, call me Kyo, I'll be your nutritionist while we figure out what's wrong with you and how to fix it."" 

Her smile stayed constant as she calmly informed me, ""Oh, I know what's wrong with me.""

I stopped. Hayley couldn't have diagnosed her... so what? Had she already seen another doctor and was coming for a second opinion?? 

""Um,"" I couldn't help but be dumbfounded, ""So, um, what exactly is wrong with you??"" Super professional, right? 

She literally didn't stop smiling, ""I have hypothyroidism. There's no way that I would be gaining this much weight on my current diet."" 

At this point I could feel all professionalism flying out the window of the room. Why was she at a hospital then? And where did she get these symptoms? Where did she get this conclusion? Was she really diabetic? She didn't look or act or behave like the traditional untreated diabetic patient. This whole time she hadn't gone to the bathroom? Something didn't add up. 

I took a deep breath and continued my questions until Dr. B could come in and save me. 

She got more and more insistent on her being right and loved answering my questions like I was an idiot who knew nothing. My patience was wearing thin^ teehee.

Finally, she flatly told me, with that fucking smile still on her face, ""Perhaps I could see a real health professional.""

I almost snapped and killed her. 

And just when I thought that I couldn't take it any more, the wonderful and handsome Dr. B came in to save the day. See, Dr. B is a handsome man. He's got dark hair and bright blue eyes, and has a perfect amount of stubble on his face. His eyebrows are thick and he's just gorgeous. Normally women patients are quiet around him because he's just ""too beautiful."" (Direct quote from Man Nurse Ben.) 

He smiled and smacked down his copy of the file on the desk. 

""So what seems to be the problem Ms. Donna?"" He commanded such a presence that her smile was wiped off the face of the planet. (no pun intended) 

""I-um, well, you see,"" 

He cut her off with a hand in the air. ""We're going to test you for everything, to see what the problem really is. Now, please cooperate and tell my dietitian here what you eat, how much you eat and what your exercise is like. I'll be taking blood and sending it to the lab. I suspect you may have Type II diabetes.""

She turned bright red. ""Th-there's no way!"" 

He snapped his head to face her, ""You were admitted in saying that you had heart palpitations, abnormal sudden weight gain, frequent urination and numbness in limbs. These are symptoms of diabetes, and with your weight-- well, I wouldn't be surprised.""

Apparently that struck a nerve with Donna, and before I even knew what TiTP was, it leaked. The dam fucking burst. 

Her jowls started flapping and spit went everywhere as she exploded with her ""perfect diet"" filled with ""salads and fruit"" and how she was ""healthier than all her skinny friends"" and that ""her numbers on her tests should be perfect"" and ""she was just naturally fat"" and ""weight loss was impossible unless she literally starved herself"". 

At the end of her spitting rant, I probably looked like an owl. I literally had never heard that many excuses come out of one person. 

Luckily Dr. B was my rock. He sat in disbelief with his hands intertwined under his chin until she stopped spitting. 

""Well, if you insist on all of this--"" he shook his head and sighed, ""The outcome could be much more severe.""

She looked scared.

""What do you mean?"" Her tough girl act was gone, an effect Dr. B usually had on people. He had horrible bedside manner but like fuck if he couldn't get people to be honest. 

""We'll have to keep you here a few days for more extensive testing. Hypothyroidism is no joke, but if your diet is really this healthy, and you are active, it could be something much more serious and we need to get to the bottom of it, so you can continue to be healthy.""

She swallowed hard. ""Um, well, I...""

""Unless you're lying to me...? But I doubt you would do that."" He looked down from his thick glasses directly into her fucking soul. I was scared for her. Dr. B had never been anything but nice to me. I couldn't imagine feeling his rage. 

She looked frantically around the room for some act of someone to save her. 

I looked absently toward the wall. I couldn't handle the obvious one sided war that was going on here. 

Dr. B stood up and took his folder. ""Well, if that's the end of your concerns, I'll go get your tests to the lab. We should have answers for most things in a couple of days."" He flashed her a winning smile. ""Hopefully we'll have you out of here in a couple of days."" 

I had never seen a human being look so defeated. She knew that all those tests were going to come back negative. She knew that all those symptoms if she even had them were a result of her obesity. She knew. And that's what was so sad about it. 

Flash forward 3 to 5 days: Surprise surprise, everything came back negative and Donna was sent home with a huge bill for pointless tests and a defeated ego that she wasn't a special snowflake who knew everything about medicine, but in fact an obese woman who had some thinking and working out to do.

I hope you enjoyed this!! "

I graduated school a couple of years ago with a degree in business and focus on finance and accounting. My gpa and internship experience were great,but Unfortunately, I was not able to land a job in the finance field although i did land interviews and superdays at various places.

Based on this, I took a job at a big 4 in the audit practice. I knew i didn't like accounting, but i took the job because:

-I needed a good salary in order to pay back my student loans.
-The company looks good on your resume
-I never had any accounting experience, so I figured it couldn't hurt to have experience in public.

I've been trying to transition to something less accounting related for about a year now but no luck.

Currently, I am studying for level one in June,I always wanted to take the CFA earlier but because the audit practice doesn't pay for it, I always hesitated. I figured passing the CFA exams would show recruiters and employers that I am serious about getting a job in the field.

What are your thoughts,  Do you think passing the exams can help me transition out of accounting? 

Many thanks for taking the time to read!"

I could use your advice,timeandspace11,NewOrleans,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1xhegu/will_be_interning_in_new_orleans_over_the_summer/,"Hey everybody. I just got an offer to intern in New Orleans over the summer in a practice area I am very interested in. The job is in Mid City. 
I just have a few questions.

Basically, I am looking for living arrangements. Living in Mid City would be ideal. I will not likely have a car by then so I would like to live near transportation.  I would like to keep my rent at $850 Max. Living alone is desirable but I am not at all opposed to having roommates. I would also like to live in a neighborhood that is relatively safe and has access to bars, restaurants, and a good nightlife scene.

I have been looking up places online, but basically everything seems to be focused around Mardi Gras right now, so I am having trouble finding what I want. Do you think Mid City fits the description of what I am looking for? If there are any other nearby neighborhoods with access to public transportation that you would recommend feel free to let me know.

The internship is from the end of May to mid August so I am trying to start my search now. I'm really excited for the opportunity and any insight you have to offer would be great. Thank you!"

1xhq63,17,2014-02-09,"[M/23/USA] This is my life, and it's ending one minute at a time",[deleted],lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/1xhq63/m23usa_this_is_my_life_and_its_ending_one_minute/,"So, I guess in a way, I was a really sheltered kid. Always kind of a loner. Never played any sports in school, and generally spent most of my days inside in front of my gaming console. I always felt like this hindered my social development as a human being, and I felt uncomfortable in different or new situations which lead me to turning a lot of people down. When I got a bit older and started going through puberty things got worse. Now girls were in the equation.

I remember the first girl that I had a thing for, I guess we'll call her Mandy. My friends had asked me if I was into anybody, and I always lied to them and told them I was into Mandy's friend, Jackie. Over time, that became my reality. Eventually, I asked Jackie out and she said ""yes"". Of course, this particular story has no happy ending. The raging hormones and general social anxiety lead me to chicken out and attempt to try to reconcile, but choked whenever I got near her.

That awkward experience was one of many to come for me. I was raised in a Catholic household so up until a certain point in high school I was raised to believe that there was some mystical being that died for my sins and was generally looking out for me. Eventually high school rolled around, and I met a girl that completely changed all of that for me. See, I learned to play a guitar freshman year and met a kid who asked me to be in his band. Well, my friend promoted the shit out of that band which lead to me being contacted by a girl (we'll call her Lindsay) that lived about an hour away from my house during my senior year. We would message each other on AIM for hours at a time, and I got to know her fairly well that way. She challenged my beliefs and made me think of things from a different perspective. I had eventually come to the conclusion, coincidentally after seeing Donnie Darko that I really felt that I identified as an agnostic. Eventually, the topic of relationships came up as she told me an anecdotal story about some kid spilling his guts to her that he had feelings for her. She had told him that it was too bad because she was into somebody else. At this point my heart sank, but she had then revealed that it was me.

So we planned a day to hang out. This was more difficult than it sounds as I had a part time job at a local grocery store, and my parents were pretty damn near NSA level on me growing up. Also, the news that it was my grandfather's 80th birthday party was on the same day that she and I decided to hang out. I said ""fuck it"" lied to my parents that I was working and hung out with her all day. It should also be said that this girl was moving away before the month was up. I spent all day with her though, doing cutsey 'We're into each other' type of shit. The night ended, and I got a sweet good night kiss with some hardcore tongue action, which, as it turns out, was my first kiss. This story doesn't end very happily either because in the weeks following that she messaged me that she loved me, then the next day proceeded to tell me how she's a terrible person and that I should probably forget everything she said.

The rest of my senior year sucked. I graduated and went to college in Central Florida where I met a bunch of new people. We'd hang out, smoke, play Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart, and life was good. All the while there were girls that I probably could have made a move on, but didn't because I was a scared piece of chicken shit. My one friend, Thomas, on the other hand would get with girls like it was nothing, and then have them call me after they finished having sex. Fucked up, right? Anyway there was one night in particular, the night of my 19th birthday, where we went out, drank and then I called it a night. Well, my friend called me at 3am and wanted me to go to this girl's apartment with him that he met at the club. Fine. Long story short, I ended up in the apartment above the two of them while they were getting it on and watched a guy get punched in the face for stealing some guy's beer. I never ran so fast in my life and all the while my friend was getting laid. Twisted world that we live in.

So after a year and change, I transferred to a school in Philadelphia that was closer to home, not because it was closer to home, but because it was actually better for my major to be there. I wasn't happy about leaving Florida, all my friends were there and now I had to make new ones. Transferring to a new school is hard. You don't have that group of friends that gels together after orientation, and the people in your classes already have that established group. I was also pretty introverted and shy so I had that working against me. I did get to meet one of my best friends, Andy, who I ended up rooming with the semester I transferred. There was another kid that we lived with named Connor that was cool at first, but after a while and a LOT of drama failed out and we lost contact with him. Probably for the best because he punched Andy in the face.

So, life continued. The supermarket that I worked at had since closed down, but I ran into one of my managers at another store in Southern New Jersey. I got a job there and life was lonely, but good. It got me enough to live off of in the upcoming semesters and I had a whole house to myself. I was once again faced with the problem of finding friends since I still was not of age to drink.

The following fall semester, I had an interesting experience with a girl named Jessica. I had made out with her one drunken Sunday night and was really into her. I tried to start something with her, but she said that she wanted to be friends. And yet, she let me kiss her after that. She had been stringing me along a bit and one night it was made apparent that there was a third party involved. It was around Halloween and she showed up with some guy. Now, we were nothing at this point in our experience together, but that didn't stop me from being extremely jealous. One night at a party, I blew up on her because I was insanely drunk, but I felt that I had to prove a point. I left that place and barely talked to her again.

Coincidentally, Andy and I lived in an apartment for a year that was right down the street from her place. It was beyond weird. Life continued though. I got an internship turned part time job. Andy did the same, and we'd hang out on weekends. Meanwhile, a friend of mine from high school, Geoff, would come visit every so often, and the three of us got to be pretty good friends and merged our social circles.

My last semester of college I spent in Los Angeles. It was a part of a study away program aimed at my major and I wanted to do it so bad because this was the moment my entire schooling career had built up to. Working in the mecca of the industry that I studied so diligently. As you could probably imagine, I hadn't made many friends in my major because of my atrocious social skills. So I was limited to square one. All of the kids in the program seemed to really gel together and sometimes I felt like an outcast, but there were legitimate times that I got along with everyone. It was awesome and everything that I thought it would be, at least at first. I had two internships that were particularly taxing, and on top of that I had classes that I had to attend. The traffic didn't help. I had secretly harbored the hope that one of these two internships would turn into something more, and that I would get an offer at the end and get to stay out there and live there. I talked with a producer for one of my projects for that semester and he gave me some advice that was basically ""if you want to make it in this industry, you have to be here.""

However, this story doesn't have a happy ending either. You see, my roommates, whom I had come to be very good friends with, had both secured jobs and were making plans to continue on living out there. They had asked if I wanted to be a part of these plans and I wanted to, but my money had been running out, and my 6 week job hunt had turned up nothing. I was left with no other choice than to turn back and go home, and abandon the very sage advice that the producer had given me.
My dreams shattered, I began the drive home and contacted my old boss to see if I could get some work in the interim. He told me that my old hourly position was filled, but that I could work on budgeted projects as a freelancer. This on top of my already destroyed ego because of my lack of success in securing work in L.A. put me in a very dark place. I spent most of the Christmas holiday drinking myself into a stupor and moping about. Over time, I came to accept this disappointing change and have somewhat adjusted to it. The only thing keeping me going is knowing that all I have to do is make enough to go back and try again.

So after 23 years, I have experienced and continued to struggle with my severely lacking social skills which, as a result, have kept me from reaching any real satisfying relationship. I was late learning the essentials, and looking back I can see just how lost and emotionally frustrated I was. In addition to having the social skills of a 13-year-old, I have never experienced sex, nor do I see it happening anytime soon. My two best friends now have girlfriends, and I sit in a corner with my own shadow of failure. While we're on the subject of failure, let's talk about how disappointing it is for me to work in the mecca of my industry across the country and be passed along at the tip of a hat to essentially be cast back home.

As I look out the window and see the mountain of snow in the driveway of my parents' house, I count the days until I can scrape together enough money to go back and try again. I've accepted that the job that I am pursuing is a lonely one, and that the ratio of men to women in Los Angeles is 6:1, but I cannot accept not giving a proper shot at my dream before succumbing to mediocrity."

This is her situation, and I was reading through it, because the post seemed similar to what I'm in, just there are some stuff different.

So full story on my end...

I had a short summer internship just the past summer of 2013, with a pretty small company. (Talking, 6 people at most. Because the manufacturing was all done in China. It became five about a month, or maybe less, into my internship when one of the guys left because he got a re-offer from a company he just left.) I was paid biweekly, the same schedule as the other employees from what I can tell. I was asked on the first day of my internship if filing me as an independent contractor was fine (he threw in 1099 at some point in the conversation as well); I immediately said yes, because really this was my first internship and I didn't want anything to go wrong.
Near the end of this stint, they sat me down and told me they would like to look for someone else to work for them during the school year, citing one of the main reasons was because I had no technical knowledge under my belt.
No hard feelings, I understand. For such a small company, they need someone that already has some experience and don't exactly have the manpower to sit down with me to teach me from their basics. From my standpoint, the drive isn't exactly a short one and the traffic was bad so I would be late to any classes I would be taking in the fall quarter if I tried to rush back.

So fast forward to now, FAFSA's deadline is fast approaching. (Yes, some people say you could turn it in past that March deadline, but I really want to make it to their 'priority' deadline.) Mom calls me up, and reminds me I need some papers from the company before she can go to our CPA to start the filing process. (For those wondering, our family owns a small business, so a CPA really helps speed up the process and minimizes our mistakes.)
This is really my absolute first time dealing with taxes. (yeah, whoops, last year of college, and I don't know anything; I shall remedy that soon.) So she tells me she can either give my pay stubs to the CPA or, ideally, the 1099 paper from the company.

Unfortunately, my last (third) paycheck was right on the last day of the internship. There was no paystub-paper attached to this third check I was handed. I kept the paystub-like portion for the first two checks I was given, but there was nothing like that for the third. And I for sure know I don't have the third paystub mysteriously laying somewhere because (like I said, never really had to deal with the taxes myself) anything that involved money and was printed on some form of paper, I immediately handed that to my mom the first chance I got.

As I type this up right now, I'm going through my online statements to find when I deposited said checks.

So I e-mailed the boss of the company last week on Thursday with the following, but still awaiting a reply:

&gt;Dear xxx,
&gt;
&gt;Happy Chinese New Year! May the new year bring in an abundance of good health and great fortune!
&gt;
&gt;I hope you are doing well! I was curious, is there a 1099 that I can pick from your office, or an electronic copy that can be sent to me?
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for any help and time!
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;xxx

I was going to call him tomorrow, and hopefully get an answer. If no one picks up, drop by for a surprise visit on Tuesday to ask in person.

I guess, to prepare for myself for a worst case scenario, what should I do? Worst case scenario, meaning the boss doesn't pick up the phone on Monday and he's not in the office on Tuesday. (I really hope the place has not closed; their website is still up.)

And if I'm understanding correctly, I should be paying the appropriate taxes out of the paychecks I received right?

Thank you so much for any help and advice, in advance!

So sorry for the long post! (I tried to include details so there aren't any strange gaps to my story.)

EDIT: I guess the reason why I posted this up, and panicking a little, is because I read (in the thread I linked above) that the company can technically file late on February 14th? Should I wait that long, or should I bother them now? I do want whatever-papers-I-need to appropriately file ASAP, seeing as FAFSA's ""initial awards"" deadline is March 2nd. I've never missed this deadline, and I've always gotten the appropriate amount of financial aid I need; I don't want to mess that up in any way."

1xjl44,3,2014-02-10,I got engaged two days ago and my parents are stressing me out with planning already - how do you keep boundaries?,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1xjl44/i_got_engaged_two_days_ago_and_my_parents_are/,"I don't know how coherent this will be, so I apologize in advance! Basically my parents are getting WAY too far ahead in planning and it is stressing me out (I'm 25, fiance is 29). They are also not listening to me or respecting the boundaries that I put up. I'll sum this up in point form:

* when my now-fiance (!!) and I were asking my parents' blessing, afterward my mom was talking about planning stuff. My dad intervened and said it was probably a good idea that my mom can look into stuff, but not tell me about it unless I ask for help or advice, since I am in grad school and working and have a lot of stuff on my plate - I thought that was a great idea, and we all agreed to it
* my mom did not respect this, and was texting me ideas about centerpieces (we were not even engaged at this point) - I asked her to stop and she apologized saying she didn't respect my boundaries
* when we were engaged they told some people that I wanted to tell myself and I got pretty mad and firmly said that they need to respect this process as mine and my fiances, it is our news and it's our thing
* my parents were hurt by this, thought I came on too strong, and said that they will do nothing unless I ask
* I say that a balance can be struck, doesn't have to be overinvolvement vs. checking out - thought we came to an agreement where they are willing to help but respect my boundaries
* this morning I get a text saying that they were looking into some venues and a lot of them are booked up for this year - while I'm in class. 
* I can't deal with this stuff while I'm in class, while I'm trying to line up an internship, and while we've *only been engaged for two days.*
* I want my marriage to be clear that I am starting a new unit and I feel like if the planning goes on like this (not that it's even started) that will not get through to my parents
* yet I want my parents to be involved, because I see marriage as something as part of a community, and I don't want them to withdraw completely but holy crap how do I get them to listen to me 
* I have tried to nip things in the bud and be clear, but they do not seem to understand how texting me throughout the day is stressful and how we have completely different views of what kind of wedding we would want
* I don't want this to be a source of stress for me and my fiance as we both very much want a low key wedding, and this is why we don't even want to get into all this planning now and take things at our own pace and just enjoy this season, and prepare for marriage
* I also want them to be involved because I know I will need help - how do you strike this balance?

I hope these were not too disjointed - has anyone else had to deal with this? How do you navigate these relationships? I have tried to start things off clearly, but they are just not respecting my boundaries and I in no way want them to think that they have authority or this much sway in my marriage, if they can't deal with me taking wedding planning on my own time."
1xjqly,1,2014-02-10,Marketing Strategist Internship Interview - Need advice!,[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1xjqly/marketing_strategist_internship_interview_need/,"I am a sophomore in college and I've been applying for summer internships. The other day I had a phone interview with a start up company that does business development, marketing, web development, branding, etc. They contacted me saying that they would like to have another interview, this time in person at their office. 

The part I need some advice about is they asked that I create a fictional marketing campaign to present to them as part of the interview. The instructions are as follows:

*""Additionally, we would like you to prepare a fictional campaign to present during your interview.  We are giving you complete creative control over this project; however, you should remain under a 15 minute timeframe.  This campaign will not be considered based on your marketing and business prowess, but rather on your creativity, ability to work under pressure, organization, and communication skills.  Instructions:
1.       Go to our website and research either our company or any of our clients.

2.       Select one company.

3.       Create a pitch centered on a product, service, concept, campaign…etc and be ready to present it in under 15 minutes.

a.       Your interviewers will be your “clients” that you are trying to pitch e.g. at the end of this meeting you should ask us if we are willing to sign your “contract.”*

I have very little experience in marketing, and so I am wondering if anyone has suggestions as to how to go about this. Some ideas I've had so far:

-social media marketing (linkedin, facebook, twitter, etc.)

-create/update company website 

-promotions to incentivize awareness&amp;consumption of their product/service ('like' us on Facebook for your name to be entered in a drawing for a free ___)

-creation of a logo, slogan, etc.

-YouTube and Pandora advertisements

-booths with information and promotions at events (sports games, festivals, etc.) at which a significant number of members of the target audience will be present

-radio advertisements

The thing is, they gave me a couple days notice before the interview, so I'm not sure if building a website/designing a logo/creating a social media marketing campaign is even doable in that time, or if that is even what they are looking for.

Have I totally misunderstood what they are looking for here? I would ask them but I don't want to appear to be ignorant, indecisive, or needy.

If anyone could point me in the right direction I would be very grateful."

She goes to school 5 hours away, I live and work near our home town. Most of the first year we spent together, eventually ended up in a LDR due to her schooling. and though we've had our rough patches, things have never been better. We were both happy, excited for the coming months, and moving forward.

Until a few nights ago. Lately, at my work, I've been pushing myself harder. There's a corporate meeting that my manager had nominated me to go to. Representing my franchise and managing group. A **huge** thing for my career, meeting the right people, shaking the right hands, just a big opportunity to work towards a better future. I never went to college after high school so something like this is even bigger for me. Someone my age in my industry wouldn't be doing much but sitting at a desk taking orders. More than that, I suffer from PTSD and a huge fear of mine is being somewhere i don't know. I've never traveled, and i've never felt strong enough to go. I want to go while I feel confident enough to go. &gt; *I can prove my PTSD wrong*

Also, the added benefit of a paid flight/hotel/rental car to go out there. Spending nearly a week in another city. Something i had never thought I would be doing. 

The only downside, it conflicts with the dates that she would be home and plans for a serious night out. Something we've been planning since christmas. 

I didn't tell her about the possibility of the trip, for the sole fact that if i didn't get it, i wouldn't have to worry about not being here on one of the short infrequent occasions that she gets to be home. It also could conflict with our plans. I wouldn't know if i'd be home the day of, or the day before. But during a conversation about how much i've been working, I let it slip that i was nominated to go. I wanted to go, but i was one of 10 assistant general managers that were nominated for my hospitality group. I said ""the probability is small, I won't end up going."" 

&gt; *Yes seeing as we've been planning this since september. Did you honestly forget about me coming home for spring break*

And follows an argument about her lack of support and the fact that i feel she thinks a broadway show is more important than my future. Taking a turn towards trying to make me feel guilty. 

&gt; *it breaks my heart to think you'd willingly miss The Lion King* 

&gt; *It doesn't matter anymore you've made your decision*

And after countless explaining about not knowing how long the trip back would be, nor how long i'd be stuck over there, I gave up and said, I'd turn it down to stay home for the show. Telling her that I was appalled at the fact that she believed some show was more important than an opportunity to go. Even then, something not set in stone. 

&gt; *Alright, I'll go to the play with someone else.*

Right there I got upset, saying ""I supported your decision to be a state away and not seeing you for months at a time, your decision to look at internships across the country, and being away for even longer and you can't support me on this? I support you and understand you wouldn't be home for certain holidays and dates and you can't be supportive and understanding that I'd be missing an event that can be seen other dates?""


The following day I was notified that another manager from another city was chosen to go instead of me. Sure, it sucked, but that just means i have to work harder next year. I left her a message saying I didn't get the trip, that i'd be home for the show. That all that fighting, all that guilt tripping and stress on our relationship was for nothing.

It has now been a couple days since i've talked to her, she messaged me last night wanting to talk, but i still have no idea how i feel about her reaction, or her attitude. Do i really want to be with someone who won't support me and turn to childish immature guilt tripping to make me stay? Or even then, choose to just make plans with someone else. 

Am i better off just calling it quits and moving on? Do i want to keep someone around who tries to manipulate me with guilt? Is a 2 year relationship worth saving if there's no support. I have to look out for my future, my mental health and my career. I can't support someone if they don't support me. A relationship is a two way street, right?


---   
**tl;dr**: LDR SO reacted horribly to the possibility of me going on a business trip conflicting with a broadway show. She tried to manipulate and guilt me into staying. I ended up not getting the chance, and haven't talked to her in days. The way she reacted hurt, and is forced me to decide whether to stay with her or leave. I have to look out for myself, my career and my mental health. Should i continue on and try to fix things or just be rational and talk to her about her emotions. and hope that she'll be supportive in the future?"

(suicide trigger warning)(Long as hell),self_throwaway123,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1xk13l/beginning_to_hate_myself_again_because_i_am_a_23/,"My six-month software development internship ended January 1st.  

Before that, I was let go from my job at a tech support call center.  The period of unemployment between those two positions had me feeling more positive than the one I’m in now because the tech support job was stressful.  I wasn’t dealing with it the way I should’ve been, especially still carrying the stress from getting my bachelor’s.  This stress reached a high enough level to where I attempted to take my own life in the January of last year.  After getting to the point where an easy movement would’ve done the deed, the frenzy roiling my mind subsided and left me with lots of fear and confusion.  

For the first time, I was afraid of myself and checked into a psychiatric ward.  The experience there was enlightening for I met people from all sorts of different walks of life who had ended up in the same place; most with different issues.  Given medication and let go, I went back to work determined to find something better.  The job I had was temporary.  I needed to pay bills somehow.  About five months later, I was let go because I had a moment where an irrational client pissed me off.  I was used to this, and it wasn’t the worst, but my reaction was to cry, punch things in my cubicle, and imagine I was strangling the life out of this idiot on the phone who had managed to delete his class’ roster on the day of finals (I will go as far as to admit, to this day, I would like to find the guy and tell him everything despite none of this being his fault.  A deeper part of me would like to stab him in the face, though).  I was let go gracefully, which is why I don’t refer to it as me being fired.  My manager was courteous and had a legitimate case against me and my tolerance for the stress the job came with.

Unemployed, I felt a weight float off my chest as I looked for jobs that caught my interest.  I ended up landing a software dev internship about two months after being let go from the tech support gig.  I was happy, elated, and on top of the world.  I finally landed something relevant to my interests that wasn’t a job an abused monkey could do.  However, this gig grew boring.  The first half of it was fine with me doing menial tasks like tracking bugs and reporting to the actual developers (I was with the QA folks so I suppose it wasn’t so much of a Software Dev position).  After expressing my interest in coding, I was allowed to help with test automation which was done in Python.  Seeing as how I had taught myself some fundamentals of Computer Science with Python using resources like Udacity, and how I had taken some CS courses back in college, I figured I would be fine.  I told myself showing interest and initiative would pay off in my favor.

Turns out I couldn’t write the scripts necessary.  Having to learn the api required to do the work was fine, but using the system setups while adhering to the team’s configurations stopped me.  Then I began to just show up at work, hoping no one would say anything to me, then leave.  Sometimes I would ask for help, and I’d get it for simply setting up little things like the virtual machine I was working inside or simply downloading a particular library.  When it came to talking to the system to do the actual work, I was lost and the most help I would receive would be to go to a basic tutorial page about the specific library I was working with, which didn’t have the depth reflected in the work I was assigned to do.

So the work didn’t get done.  I eventually was moved on to learning how to set up and configure virtual machines on a Windows and OSX environment, which was neat.  I got to spend time alone and away from the team, which had begun to irritate me from how quiet and meek they were, how they would always talk with their heads down, with no fun allowed and had a haughty know-it-all attitude that I willfully succumbed to for the sake of getting paid and having actual experience.

Now I’m here, writing this up, about a month after my internship ended.  I didn’t get any job.  There were no openings, but with how I was treating the opportunity I had and how there were no openings for someone in my skill level, nothing happened.  I’m at the point where it’s easy for me to forget what day it is.  The morning often passes me by and I wake up in the afternoon.  All income is gone except for whatever comes in when my taxes are complete, and if I get my unemployment claim approved.  There was a brief fad where I figured I wanted to be a web developer, but now just visiting Hacker News pisses me off because the level of knowledge and skill needed to be anything in the field is beyond my capabilities.

Everything I feel like I do is half-assed.  I can’t finish anything.  I can’t hold onto a job, and now I’m considering applying to a bank because the job may be easier than what I was doing in my internship.  This makes me feel pathetic because I feel I’m taking a step backwards in the progression of my life, but at the same time, going forward sucked because I felt like I wanted to either kill myself or kill everyone around me.  All the while, I simply can’t do what it is I want to do because I half-ass those attempts to.  Example: I like to write fiction, yet I have no complete story.  I can definitely show off a ton of incomplete works and first paragraphs of an abandoned idea.  I want to make a videogame?  Sure, let’s start something and never finish.  Also, what about that whole idea that making videogames is just a dream that goes nowhere?  It’s just a desire every manchild like myself has.  I even let go of my girlfriend because I couldn’t hold interest in her; I broke us off before I began to resent her.

So, if anyone reads all of this, I really appreciate the effort slogging through.  I don’t think anyone will though, honestly, and I can’t say I blame them since this is all a problem I have within myself.  Perhaps I should visit my therapist and psychiatrist again, just to do it and to get a better perspective on things than my current one.
If there is any positivity from the time I was at my internship, it was the volunteer gig I did in my free time.  I was part of an after school program teaching kids how to build and program the Lego Mindstorm robots.  It was neat, but I do know any interest in helping kids academically is not a way to go if one wants to make a decent living.  Besides, teachers are treated by shit by students, the higher ups, and helicopter parents.

Fundamentally, I’d like to create stuff to entertain folks, but sometimes I wonder if I have the maturity to do it considering how I’ve been floundering around my whole life without making any sort of effort for the most part.  And now I’m getting pissed at seeing some white woman on reddit sleep in her bed with a baby tiger.  If there was ever a candid photo of privilege, that would be it.

And now I feel like I’m just bitter.

EDIT: Broke it up from being the wall of text it was before.

People make their lives here doing research and science stuff. This shouldn't be a place where normal hardworking scientists have to fear not getting their research done(Fuck interns though... no one cares about them...). With all this political upheaval, this place has become an unsafe work environment. This naturally makes people wanna leave, and being the facility that it is that is impossible. 

Due to the Top Secret nature of this place, No one can actually leave here without being killed. The people in charge of the facility see this as a lost cause because no one can get their work done anymore. So they plan on shutting it down and reverting it back to a time when the facility was more profitable for them. That means Everyone in this facility will be killed, because We can't be left alive knowing the top secret stuff that we do.

If we wanna keep the facility the way it is right now, we gotta make the facility profitable by 2 days or else, well we die... That means we gotta go back to the way we were before everyone and their mother tried to stage their own coup(I was doing it before it was cool...). Go back to your old jobs and get these ideas of revolution out of your head.

We currently live together and share a lease and a dog.

Our relationship was always great up until this summer. I graduated from university and got a job in my career field as he entered his senior year of college. He left for the summer for an internship and we saw each other really frequently. We signed a lease and adopted the dog within a month of each other.

Soon after he moved back home though, school started again. He was incredibly busy with his senior project and a club that he is president of. During this time, we both are busy and I'm understanding of his situation. However, we both start fighting a lot around finals/Christmas time about anything and everything. He starts to complain a lot about time that he ""has"" to spend with me. For example, he pitched a fit about having to go to my office christmas party with me when I had asked him to go with me about three weeks prior. We patched things up and things were okay.

I feel like the whole cycle is starting again. This time, he has started hanging out with this other girl. She has a boyfriend who I have met, so I try to tell myself that she's just in a similar situation to him schoolwise and that's why they are hanging out so often. He's started inviting her to hang out with us during the one day a week we have to spend together. However, she has bought him some really nice presents and she's making me uncomfortable.

It all kind of culminated when we had sex yesterday morning and I started to cry after. I told him that I felt like our relationship had no spark anymore, and that he was spending more time with this other girl than he was with me. He left to go to his club meeting and I pretty much dwelled on it all day. Last night, he pretty much told me he was trying his best. He didn't actually make any promises about ceasing to hang out with this other girl.

I have asked him about four times now to try to invest some more time in our relationship, or at least to try to give us some more time where it's just us two. His graduation is three months away. I don't know if I want to wait until then to see if things will change, or if I even want to move with him if a job calls him to a new place. I'm sorry if this seems short... I've got a lot rushing around in my head right now. Help?

This has resulted in me having 2 W2s and 2 1099s. I've only ever filled out a single W2 and I'm not really sure where to get started.

W2-1: Negligible amount less than $100. (Only worked 1 day this year.)
W2-2: Over $30k from my current company.
1099-1: Less than $500 before the contractor company changed its name.
1099-2: $12k from about 6 months of work.

I have no idea where to start with filling this out, let alone what kind of deductions I'm entitled to for the 1099s.

Also, I have student loans and have been pumping money into them. Are they something I can only deduct from one of my forms? Which would be best or does it not matter?

This is my first year really having to figure out my taxes. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

##tl;dr: We met, we loved, we tried, we lost, I will miss her dearly and wish her all the best.

---
Almost a month ago, my ex (23f) and I (25m) broke up.

We met in college about 3 years ago and after developing a very intense and involved friendship, we started dating about a year later. She was an international student from Taiwan and I was a guy from the suburbs just north of NYC. We spent a year together dating at the university together before I graduated and moved back home in December of 2012. This was when our long-distance relationship started.

The year was filled with its ups and downs. Being apart after having essentially lived together for almost a year tested our relationship, our trust, and the love we shared. Her graduation this past December became the turning point in our relationship.

Before we started dating, we realized that there were feelings brewing and we discussed what would become of a relationship given the possibility that she may have to return to Taiwan after graduation. We decided that we would make the most of it and deal with whatever hand we were dealt when the time arrived. If she needed to leave, so be it; we would deal with it then if it came to that. Neither of us wanted to get married for papers; we wanted to do this by working towards our own stable lives. We slowly began working towards a future for ourselves.

Truth be told, I did not help our cause by starting my year terribly. I took a break for a few months to sit back and relax, not realizing how hard it would be for me to find a job, much less in my own career field. Months passed and the odd jobs I took didn't last. I was in financial limbo, clawing my way to stay afloat. It was a constant source of stress. The feeling of working consecutive low-paying jobs did nothing for my self-esteem. It wasn't until September that I landed a steady job at a factory in another state for just above minimum wage. I was not the happiest, but it provided stability. It lasted up until about December when I left that job to work as a Chinese delivery guy throughout the month of December, a job I still have on weekends. I work a second during the week now too.

Her year was very different. She balanced internships and jobs, all while studying hard to graduate early. She lived a busy schedule. We met just about once a month for anywhere in between three days to a week at a time. Considering what other long-distance relationships have to work through, we had it pretty good. Nonetheless, the distance slowly affected us and changed the nature of the relationship. I could manage, but it was never something she was really comfortable with; we were a dynamite couple together in person and a different couple apart. We looked forward to those monthly visits and always had a blast together up until the moment we had to part again.

The weeks leading up to graduation were stressful. I provided all the support and love I could as finals and deadlines for papers loomed ever closer. Soon, she would finally be able to reap the fruits of her hard labor. To celebrate her graduation, her mother arranged a trip from Taiwan to be with us. It would be the first time I'd meet either parent. I drove us up to school. The week I spent with them at and after graduation was fantastic. We would see her mom off two weeks later and spend the New Year together in my city.

Upon arrival in my city, it was clear that something had changed.

&gt;""Last month, I was sure that you were the one for me. Now, I'm not sure if we're gonna last the year.""

It hit me as a complete surprise. That night, she asked me if I was sure that she was my forever girl. I didn't hesitate answering.

On our last night together, she told me:

&gt;""I wish I didn't have to leave because when we're together, everything is perfect.""""

By the end of her visit, she wanted to take some time to think about things. My heart sank in fear of the worst. About a week of waiting later, the video call came. It started off well; we shared stories of our days apart. She asked if I had done any thinking over the break.

&gt;""I want you to know that whatever your decision is, I will understand and accept it because I know that you'll have thought it through.""

My chest tightened as the conversation led closer to the moment I had been dreading since the break.

&gt;""I spent some time thinking about it and I realized...that I love you...but only as a best friend.""

Heartbreaking doesn't even come close.

&gt;""I want to us stay friends though because I don't want to throw away the years and memories we have had up to this point.""

I felt the same way. I accepted that this must have been a very difficult decision for her to make. We continued talking and even managed a few smiles towards the end. We made plans to chat again soon.

In a separate letter to my mom, she wrote that she and I didn't have the same goals, priorities or expectations anymore and that for her our romantic relationship was at an end. She saw us taking different paths and thanked her for accepting her into our family and for the hospitality she received over the years.

We sent reddit links to each other almost daily just like we used to and sent a few texts back and forth, but that important feeling that we shared was gone. Her absence in my heart was deafening. It was really over. The relationship was  done and gone. She was no longer my girl. I held onto those messages and links because as much as they hurt, they held a certain comfort, a familiarity that made me feel as warm as much as they brought me to tears. I later realized that this was very unhealthy, so a few days later I sent her this message:

&gt;Hey XXXXXX,

&gt;I hope you've been well.

&gt;The messages and links you've been sending me lately have been great and entertaining, but I'm sorry to say that I made a mistake in wanting such casual contact so soon.

&gt;I'm still in a lot of pain and as exciting as every link you send me is, it really hurts. I need some space and time to heal.

&gt;I know this may come as a disappointment to you considering you were hoping to have all of us play League together again soon, but it's for the best that I have time to myself to help me get my emotions all sorted out. Wouldn't want to get into team fights late into a match and have your carry unable to carry on, you know.

&gt;I want you to know that I'm still interested in being friends in the future if you are too; it's just not the right time for me.

&gt;With your web class probably in full swing by now, your job starting soon, your editing position filling your days with awful writing, and god knows how many other things you're planning on throwing yourself into, I wish you lots and lots of success with all of it. Know that I'm rooting for you.

&gt;I'll be working my butt off too. And browsing Reddit.

&gt;Your friend, ElColombo

I must have read through that letter 400 times, trying to build up the courage to send it. It was hard penning it but I understood that it needed to be done. I didn't expect to receive a letter back, but one came.

&gt;I understand completely. To be honest I've been thinking the same thing, but was too stubborn to admit it because I was the one who insisted on remaining friends. I'm sorry that the contact has been causing you pain; you're right, it's still way too early.

&gt;Take all the time you need. When you feel good and ready, I will be here.

&gt;Thank you, XXXXXX

I broke down reading that last line. I still do.

I don't believe I was a very bad man. I struggled with depression from a long strings of consecutive failures. My successes were far and few. But I can sit here and tell you all that I never wavered in my love for her. In my support of her and her goals. In the belief that we could work through these hard times and come out the outer side stronger, together. I tried my best to give her the comforts of family and friends here in the states. In the face of so many obstacles, I really tried.

Now, a month later, I sit here after what feels like an eternity of thinking, talking, listening, crying, and moping to say that as sad as I still am that she is not in my life nor love me anymore, I believe the breakup was the best thing to happen to us. It served as the great motivator to keep improving myself, but not for someone else. I'm doing it for myself now. I came to understand that as we were, we were never going to succeed. I was stuck in a terrible place and she was at a turning point in her life with so many roads available to her. We had discussed getting an apartment together, but we had no end date or solid plans. We didn't cheat, we didn't fight, we were always supportive but the circumstances beat us.

I promised myself that I would only consider contacting my ex not only after I had the financial and social stability I want to have, but can also accept that she will also move forward and do what's best for her, in love and in life. I want to make sure I can be happy for her own success and happiness. Because she deserves it and our relationship was completely worth it. It will be a long time. I will miss this girl not just as a lover, but also as my best friend.

*I had a letter to her here; instead, I wanted to say this.*

Say you love them. Be upfront and honest; your words carry immense weight. Support them not just in their times of need. Be understanding and patient, even when you're the issue. If your LDR stops working and you go your separate ways, be gentle; they're the last memories you'll have of what once was. I've seen these sentiments in loss posts here. They should never be taken for granted. Remember that feelings change, just as easily as distance and circumstances can.

I'm still a believer in LDRs, even with this great loss. It just takes two special people to work through the hardest parts. The success stories here are proof enough.

Thank you for reading."

1xmi9z,0,2014-02-11,My Professional Smite Article,thegoldphish,Smite,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1xmi9z/my_professional_smite_article/,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With only 44 days until the release of their premiere MOBA game Smite, the team at HiRez Studios could not possibly be any more excited.  ""March 25th will change everything!"" said HiRez founder and CEO Erez Goren, ""This is a bigger accomplishment than that time Kelly completed a full match of assault without touching her hair.  You know who else has nice hair?  Lions.  We're gonna bring a lion to the release party!""  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Smite, for the unfamiliar, is a M.O.B.A. or Mediocre Online Battle Arena.  In this game you choose from a wide assortment of gods such as the big breasted goddess Aphrodite, the fishnet stocking wearing Athena, the half naked sideboobed Neith, and many more colorful characters to awkwardly touch or compare yourself to.  New Gods are released every two weeks unless it snows in Georgia and the whole state goes into a panic.  Smite Gods come in a few different archetypes such as Hunter, Support, Warrior, and Overpowered Bulls***.  New gods are released into the former group and are later fixed after hundreds of angry Reddit posts.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When asked about the release of Smite, Esports Manager Bart Koenigsberg eagerly asserted, ""I don't really know about that but they really need to buff Ymir tho*[sic]*.""  When asked to clarify he responded by playing a video from Youtube in which Willy Wonka informed me that I get nothing.  Then he gently placed his third pair of plastic sunglasses on top of his head and asked if I was ready for patch notes.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Smite has been described by some as a League of Legends clone with a different camera angle, but this is merely due to the fact that Smite is a League of Legends clone with a different camera angle.  Smite also presents a wide array of new challenges to the MOBA genre such as skillshots or getting grouped with people around the same skill level as you.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To mark the long awaited release of Smite, HiRez will be hosting a tournament on March 28-30.  HiRez has announced that along with a $100k starting pool, they have released a purchasable skin for the god Poseidon that will increase the prize pool by $5 for every unit sold.  When asked for comment, HiRezKelly, an intern at HiRez Studios and popular twitch.tv streamer exclaimed, ""Almost $175,000 for a pool?  My friends got one in their back yard for like $25,000.  What a ripoff!  I could buy soooooo many hair products with that kinda moolah.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The professional scene could not be any more pumped for the release.  ""I haven't been this excited since I found a pair of Kyary Pamyu's used underwear on ebay!"" said professional Stepmania and ok Smite player PonPonULaLaChingChangWallaWallaBingBang.  Fellow Smitegame streamer Drew ""I can't spell Laissez-faire"" Boyd produced a longwinded and beautiful recount of the evolution of Smite over the past years but I was unfortunately put into a hypnotic stupor by his beautiful gaze.  After a few minutes of questioning my sexuality I was awoken by a ferocious MANMODE cry followed by Mr. Boyd flailing his arms in the air and spilling his giant jug of drink.  Afterwards he made me swear I wouldn't tell his girlfriend Haliegh or he would be in big trouble.  Steven ""Napman"" Zappas could not be reached for comment at this time as he was too busy flexing into a nearby mirror and exclaiming, ""Damn I look swole!""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each day Smite is gaining more popularity on Twitch.tv, a popular streaming site formerly named after pop sensation Justin Bieber.  Smite will sometimes even reach over 2000 viewers at a time, competing with a wide variety of new and glamourous games such as Age of Empires III and Paper Mario.  For $5 you can subscribe to the official Smitegame channel and recieve free online Icons to spam in chat and genuinely annoy anybody over the age of 13.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With the release of Smite just around the corner the internet is abuzz with Smite hype.  I've had the pleasure of interviewing several big name Twitch.tv casters and they all agreed that Smite is a great item that should be used for jungling and getting last hits.  Upon clarification they hailed Smite as ""Oh yeah, I think I've heard of that once.""

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All in all, Smite is truly coming into it's own.  One day we will all be able to look back at this moment and just say, ""Wow...remember how much money I wasted on gems?  God help me."""
1xmirf,8,2014-02-11,Office 2010 vs Office 365 University,OneLove_A-Dawg,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1xmirf/office_2010_vs_office_365_university/,"Hey so I have been trying to figure out the differences between Office 2010 and Office 365 (2013). I have two devices (my laptop
and my surface pro) and still have another of 2010 Office premium license that I can use on my SP1. It seems to me like the 
University deal is very fair, and I do have money per say (but I don't like to spend it unnecessarily obviously). As of now, I haven' found any real reason why Office 365 would be worth it (it seems I can still Sync to Skydrive and Word and Excel have been fine for my usage). The only thing I don't really now about is OneNote, which I really want to utilize; So if there was a major change, I think it would be worth it. 
Open to all suggestions and thanks for any help.

As a note, last time I checked my University used 2010 (I am currently on an internship) so any added value there would be lost (though I plan on mainly using just my two devices only).

**Edit: I apologize for the confusion that it seemed I had, but I am fully aware of the differences between 365 and 2013 (I appreciate your help since I suppose I was confusing). Now my only true question is that Univeristy deal worth it when I have two licenses of full 2010 (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, Outlook, OneNote). My thinking is that my versions of Word and Excel should be fine for me (unless they were astronomically better which they don't appear to be), or if OneNote is a good bit improved from the last iteration then I am interested since I feel it can be a powerful tool for the rest of my studies. My main problem is I never used OneNote 2010 and am unclear how the 365 might be better.** "
1xmj49,8,2014-02-11,My University is having a career fair on Thursday. The attire is Business Professional and I've never worn a suit in my life. What do I do!,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1xmj49/my_university_is_having_a_career_fair_on_thursday/,"Firstly, I have done a search for information. Some information was helpful, and I am learning.

I am a business major and I am looking for an internship for this summer. I have a pretty tight budget seeing as I am a college kid so Men's Warehouse might be a serious stretch.

About me. I'm 6 ft 2in, 170lbs. Thin but I have been working out for 2 years now so I have some muscle. I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and i'm white.

I was planning to wearing something [like this](http://imgur.com/jK5oHap). My waredrobe is very limited seeing as I am still developing my fashion sense and I have such little money, but I know I have a sweater and a button up shirt + tie. My only concern is the dress code is ""Business Professional"", which means I need to look like I am on the set of Mad Men. They are saying ""Suits suits suits"", but I don't have any suits!

So now I am left with two days to prepare an outfit. I am considering going out to H&amp;M, seeing as they have clothing that, although of lesser quality, is cheap and decent looking. I am a Business major, so suits &amp; ties are probably in my future. 

It is a lot to ask from you guys, but I need some guidelines. I have spent some time around here and have a little idea of the basics of putting together an outfit. If anyone has any links, advisement, places to shop, ideas what to wear with considerations to budget, lay it on me! Please try to consider that I am on a serious budget. I would be uncomfortable going over $120 (I know!) but I am honestly open to anything, even just learning!!!!!

Thank you so much MFA. You guys are great.

Edit: The career fair got postponed till next week!!!!!!!!!"

Sucks, but I enjoyed what will have to be [my final bone](http://imgur.com/RgJP9fm) for awhile.

This is probably my fourth or fifth time quitting within my four/five year smoking career.  For clarification, they weren't failed attempts—the first few were because my parents caught me (back in high school) and the third was for a job.  Anyway, there's this really odd trend I noticed..

Every time I quit (each of the previous times lasted about 1-2 months), I start getting sick.  For the past three or so years, I generally smoked an average of twice daily through the bong (or vape).  In high school, I usually vaped at least once a day.  And this doesn't mean I didn't get sick while smoking, but it just seems odd that I get coughs and a stuffed nose for *at* *the* *very* *least* a few weeks following every forced t-break.

Any similar experiences or sci*ent*ists that have any idea what's going on?  Could it just be an adverse reaction to breaking a habit?

Thanks, and happy toking."

I took AP Computer Science A in sophomore year, but I never actually found out how to program things and /r/learnprogramming wasn't a huge help in explaining how to get back into practicing computer programming again.

I like space, but I never could understand any of the celestial mechanics textbooks I downloaded since I never took a physics course (Never fit in my high school schedule) and I tried to self-study for AP Physics B but it's incredibly difficult without a teacher to explain it to you, considering it's physics.

I never received my diploma in the mail, and i thought that it was just an address error and didn't make anything of it. Than about a month ago my friend told me that another friend of our's stole one of my papers, got caught, and didn't graduate. so i called the school last week and found out that my senior seminar class didn't have a grade submitted in to it.

I emailed the professor and he said that there was a problem with another student stealing my paper and gave me his phone number to call him. I called him six times over the weekend and he never picked up. I sent him another email today, and he wrote back that a friend of his had there baby die and he was delivering to funeral so he couldn't talk to me but would get around to it eventually. But this time he also said that the problem wasn't just the paper, but also that my writing was bad and that i had problems with my internship. But i already have a grade for my internship which was completed two years ago, and i never got below a c on any of my papers!

So here i am. I never received any notification that these problems existed, and I've been gone from this school for over half a year. I have no certainty of what the problems acutely are, or when they will be resolved. The professor wont schedule a time that i can talk to him, and i live two states away from the school. I am also having a bit of a anxiety attack right now.

currently i am working two jobs. One minimum wage job, and i have been doing work for a church for free as a college pastor. I also have a job interview on Friday for a very highly competitive position that i was narrowed down to two candidates, and i feel awful going to this interview with my degree on hold.

I know that he is busy dealing with tragedy that happened to his friend. but also i cant help feeling wronged that the school and the professor never told me there was a problem. they let me walk on graduation, without bringing up any problems. when i hinted that i felt like this was wrong in an email, they said that it was the students reprehensibility to check on and take of these issues, but how would i know there was a problem since i never failed a paper or a test?

What am i supposed to do?

Edit 1: This is the email i just sent the Professor.

No, i'm sorry didn't leave a message. I actually thought i might have the wrong phone number, but i checked it with the email three times. I am so sorry that tragedy happened. I am praying for you, and that family; that is heartbreaking news. Please take the time to deal with issue, and than we can talk about what happened with 

I don't remember you ever sharing things like this with the class, but i have heard from others that a lot of really tough things have happened to and around you in these last two years on top of stress that comes with teaching and taking care of a church. I know that you are extremely busy and your time is stretched thin, and my heart goes out to you. I pray that God will give you the words to say at the funeral. I don't know how you are exactly dealing with the situation but the psalms always help me to grieve ""I am benumbed and badly crushed; I groan because of the agitation of my heart. My heart throbs and my strength fails me ... I will hope in You, O Lord; you will answer o my God ... Do not forsake me, O Lord; O my God, do not be far from me! Make haste to help me, O Lord,my salvation"" sections from Psalm 38.

I know that you have been dealing with issues like this for much longer than i have and it might not mean much, but after being a college pastor for a short while i can sympathize with the pain that comes with ministering to others especially in times like this. One of the things that our staff does every week is pray for situations like this. Our congregation is dealing with several deaths right now as well as the loss of a child and it can be debilitating. I will add a prayer for you into tomorrows meeting just asking that God gives you the right heart and the right words to deal with the situation,

So please call me when you get the chance, because i am having a bit of an anxiety attack with this whole grade thing, and I don't know how big of a deal it is and how long its going to take to resolve it. I'm getting especially freaked out since i have a job interview on Friday my knowledge of whats going on with this whole thing effects that. so please remember to talk to me when you get the chance, but please take care of this other situation of first.

Sincerely,
Matthew Ortman"

1xonty,4,2014-02-12,I'm (24F) with bf (31M) in a 2.5 yr relationship. I'm unhappy and I don't know if it's just me and how I can fix it. Need perspective...can't tell if I'm wrong for feeling this way and I'm just immature or my concerns or legitimate!,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1xonty/im_24f_with_bf_31m_in_a_25_yr_relationship_im/,"I've been dating my bf for about 2.5 years. Lately I've been feeling unhappy and just need perspective. Am I being crazy or do I have some valid reasons for feeling this way? And how can I go about fixing it? I want this relationship to work. My main worry is that he doesn't recognize that he doesn't know what's wrong and what's right and that just because nothing physical happened, nothing happened in his mind, although I feel otherwise. 

**Why (I think) I'm feeling upset:** I haven't been feeling like I can completely trust my bf due to an incident that happened a little while ago. I've tried to forget it but sometimes I will think of it and it will flare up these trust issues, and it makes me go into a bad mood swing, which negatively impacts our relationship. I'm not very good at talking to my bf about my concern b/c I'm unsure that I have anything to be upset about. 

**What happened a little while ago to make me lose trust:** While I was abroad for 3 months, a new neighbor moved into the same building. I didn't meet or hear or her until I got back. I wasn't worried about anything, I just personally did not like her that much when I met her. However, things started to annoy me. She calls up my bf crying about something, calls and texts him about missing the party he throws, calls him to help her move her stuff, and maybe other stuff I don't know about. She did move to here from another state but I know she has friends because I've seen them and I know that my bf is not the only guy friend she has who can help her move. I believe she has been going to school here for a few years so...I really find it hard to believe she has no friends and she can only look to my bf to call him crying about this. Basically, I don't like or trust her, my bf is very very nice to everyone, to the point of paying for drinks or cabs for people. Anyway, I didn't react well to my bf telling me this, I'm very upset. The next day he shows me the text, that he hadn't responded to her. So I feel bad for overreacting and wish I had just calmly said that I was upset with this instead and I apologize for my reaction and thought that this was over. However fast forward a few weeks, I see that he has still been talking to her and I ask him to see his phone. He reluctantly gives it to me and I look at the texts they've been exchanging. So I find out that:

**1)** They've met up for drinks, he made the first move to ask her out
**2)** They've been sending texts back and forth over the holiday season, to me with a flirty tone
**3)** HE ASKED HER IF HE COULD SLEEP OVER AT HER APARTMENT. IT IS A TINY ASS SMALL STUDIO WITH ONE BED. WHERE WOULD HE SLEEP? ON THE FLOOR? IN THE SAME BED AS HER? she was back at her parent's but...in response to this he said: I had a few drinks and I had to wake up early to go to work tomorrow. UHM. YOU HAVE A KEY TO MY APARTMENT. He says: oh, we were in a fight I didn't feel comfortable. THE NIGHT YOU ASKED TO SLEEP OVER WE HAD JUST HAD DINNER TOGETHER WITH MY FAMILY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE WERE FIGHTING?! 

Anyway this leads to a big fight. I'm crying. Instead of reassuring me he makes me feel really stupid for even being worried about ""this tiny little girl"". Calls me crazy (which he has been doing a lot lately), says he'll stop talking to her if that's what I want but very begrudgingly. I can't really remember the other details we eventually go to sleep. 

**Anyway, after this, I've been worried.** I'm not worried about him physically cheating. But I worry that he doesn't really see what he did wrong, that what he did to me broke my trust, and maybe it wasn't even emotional cheating but he made me feel bad when I don't think I had done anything wrong except not reacting calmly. He doesn't seem to think that he did anything wrong. He doesn't seem to get that he knew that I would be upset by this, and he did it anyway. And if I hadn't saw it on his phone, it would've been ok. Basically, by not telling me he wasn't exactly lying to me. 

**We were watching a movie and I saw his messages pop up on his screen.** I was able to see that he had been texting two other girls. And ever since then I can't help but wonder what's going on. I'm afraid of bringing this up again because it ended up so bad last time. I had honestly thought that I was being calm about it last time but I ended up crying. 

**We also have some other problems, mainly communication.** I'm very good with sharing things but it drains on me when I always have to ask him about things, he will never tell me things unless I ask. He has been working on it but it it's in spurts. It'll be good right after I ask him and then a little while later it goes back to one sided communication again. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to feel ambivalent. If he doesn't feel like talking, I don't either. I don't want to feel this way. But I just feel very very tired. 

I'm also getting another degree and the school work and internships are taking up a lot of my time. I do realize that I am stressed, and that I'm not the calmest person, I like to get things done and sometimes I forget to relax. I really miss my old lifestyle, where I could go out without a worry and hang out with my friends more. However, he has a much more flexible schedule, he works three out of the seven days and apart from seeing me, he spends a lot of his time with friends going out. I've talked with him that I wish he would share what he does with me but it hasn't happened. I can't go out with him but I wish I could. I was hoping that him sharing with me would make me feel better about being at home, showing that he thinks of me. It hasn't happened. And I keep growing resentful of his lifestyle vs. mine. And since my trust in him has been declining, this combined with this resentment makes me wonder what the hell he is doing all day and I get worried about him cheating. But at the same time I'm tired of asking him questions in order to get him to share, it makes me feel like a mom. It makes me want to not talk to him so that he has to ask me in order to get questions for me. It seems to be turning into a vicious cycle and I don't know how to get out of it. This has been a recurring problem and I don't know how to fix us!

I think that's all I have to say. I know I have my own problems. I'm probably not the most mature. He treats me very well, it's just emotionally, I'm not completely fulfilled.

1xoq8y,1,2014-02-12,Just got denied transfer admissions to my dream university,fuckeveryonee,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xoq8y/just_got_denied_transfer_admissions_to_my_dream/,"I don't have any idea what to even do with myself.  

My whole life I have wanted to study computer science at the University of Illinois in Urbana.  When I graduated high school, I went to community college for financial reasons even though I was accepted into UIUC.  My first semester at community college was very rough, as I was diagnosed with severe depression and moderate ADHD, which really hindered my ability to study.  Even so, my grades were all A's and B's in the majority of my classes that semester, all of which were honors courses, except for Calc I which I got a C in. Around the beginning of my second semester I got treatment for my previously mentioned medical issues, and everything has been going better since then.  I got a B in Calc II and an A in linear algebra, which was awesome.   I've managed to get my GPA up from what was a 2.8 after my first semester to a 3.4, taking all honors and 200 level and honors courses except for my English courses and an intro psych course that I had to take because they canceled one of my classes on the first day of last semester w/o any prior warning.  Apparently, not anywhere near good enough for UIUC though.  Never mind the fact that I got a 31 on the ACT, was named Technology Student of the Year for my graduating class, had a 4.5 GPA, worked three semesters as a computer lab aid, completed an IT internship while also doing over 40 hours of community service. Oh, did I mention I was also working 30 hours a week as well? I guess all this shit was for naught.  

One of the only reasons I was able to fight through my depression was the fact that I wanted to go to UIUC. When I was trying to go homework and my depression was trying in every possible way to distract me, I would use this goal as a way to focus myself. This is the reason I'm currently taking 19 credits this semester so I would have had all my courses in order to transfer.  

I literally have no idea what to even do anymore with regards to school.  UIUC is the only even half decent school for computer science in Illinois that I could afford to go to.  Sure there are private schools like DePaul or University of Chicago, but I can't afford anything near their price range.  The rest of the public schools are a cesspool of mediocrity in regards to their computer science programs. I feel completely crushed and as if there is no point in continuing in school.  The only reason I'm taking Calc III this semester is because I needed it to get into UIUC.  If I hadn't had my calc test today before finding out the news, I probably would have handed in the test blank.  I can already feel my depression creeping back within a couple hours after having finally been fully under control for the past couple months (down from a 43 to 6 on the beck inventory).  I feel like all my motivation has been sapped from me as I don't even feel like continuing my classes this semester.  I haven't missed a day of classes since I started community college, and I honestly just feel like dropping out.  It seems like there are three categories: schools I want to go to, schools that would actually accept me and schools I can afford to go to, and it seems like there is no overlap between the groups.  There is honestly nowhere else I want to go to school. I'm pretty much screwed for next fall, as most universities have already taken their transfer applications.  I by no means think I am a top 5% of the class student, but I feel my qualifications and experience merit at least a deference instead of an outright rejection.  I really just hate life right now.  It seems like with reading that one simple sentence, my life has lost all sense of direction.  

I really have no idea where I was going with this, I just started typing.

As interviews for summer internships begin, I'm currently looking to investing in a new suit. Obviously as college student, I have a limited amount of money, so since Express is having a 40% off everything sale, I plan on buying from there.

As I look to what suit to buy, I see two styles: slim fit, and modern fit, as well as suits made of wool and sateen. As an accounting major, I need to make sure that I have a strong look, but also make a great first/business impression.

To be completely honest, I'm not sure what is the most business accepted style is, but I also want it to fit me perfectly. I was hoping MFA could help me out and give me some advice and information.

Thank you again! I appreciate it!"
1xqjv0,1,2014-02-12,The Wife and Girls Night Out...,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/1xqjv0/the_wife_and_girls_night_out/,"alright guys/gals need some input on the steps I should take. Basically my wife is in her last semester of nursing school. She'll be 29 in a few weeks and I'll be 31 a few weeks after that. Been married 5 years together 8. I am a recent red pill convert in the past 3 months or so. We have a 2 year old girl.

Ok so found out last night wife is going on a girls night out with some nursing school classmates next Monday since they have it off. My wife almost never goes out unless it's with me or maybe to go wine tasting with her best friend.

I do not like this at all but haven't said or indicated anything. These girls are all single, mid twenties to mid thirties, some have multiple kids, and a lot of them ride the carousel hard. I've met a couple and one that I know is going is cock crazy. 

I know these girls are jealous of my wife deep down, she has the good looking husband who financially and mentally supports her through her schooling, she is top of her class, and she has a highly sought after internship with the local hospital.

My gut tells me my wife is going to become the target of these girls and knowing how bitchy girls are towards each other I could see them trying to set her up to fuck everything up.

What do you think I should do here?

My thought is to simply tell her that married women hanging out with single /divorced women is bad because of what I stated above. I would also state that I don't know most of these girls or the morals they have, but the ones I do know I don't approve of. I'd also like to know why she wants to hang out with these girls outside of school when she constantly complains about how much she hates everyone in her classes.  Whatever I do though I am going to make it damn clear that these girls nights out aren't going to become regular.

For clarification they are going to an upscale brewery on the marina. I don't know the time but it's likely going to be evening. So it's not exactly a club."

I would like to ask this group for some advice.  Been a decent lurker and read the items on the sidebar but now I'm at a point where asking for advice seems like the next logical step.

Here's some context first.  Graduated two years ago from college in the Bay Area, worked at an internship making 18/hr for a year after.  Working currently as a contractor in another company making 25/hr.  

Now here's where things change a bit.  I recently got an offer for a full time gig at a big tech firm at 95k/yr with a 15k sign-on bonus.  Of course I accepted and will start in less than two weeks, right before my 27th birthday.


Regarding debt, I have student loans totaling 10.8k (5k at 3.4% and 5.8k at 6.8%) along with a credit card balance of 1.7k at 16.9% and 100 dollars at 13.9%.

My current expenses are rent (inc. utilities) at 600, helping parents pay mortgage at 400, student loans at 150, gas at 250, food at 200, eating out/drinking at 300, health insurance at 100.  Car insurance and cell phone is packaged with my family and my parents foot the bill, however I'd like to pay for those myself once I start the new job.  Car insurance is at 100/mo right now.  Car is paid off and I'm sure I can drive it for a few years without any problems other than routine maintenance.  Eating out and drinking is that high since I'm single and dating.

With the new job, the company provides a shuttle service to and from so I will be driving the car only to the dropoff location and so I expect gas expenses to drop significantly.

Now with all that said and done, I would like to ask how to proceed with setting things up so I am on the right track to retire well while being able to do things I want in the immediate future, such as traveling.  Goals would be able to purchase a home when it's the best decision for me.  I believe it would be in my early-mid 30's.  However that can change as my knowledge regarding that is not adequate, along with the fact that home prices in the Bay Area are a bit expensive.  Also I do love traveling and would like to travel a few times a year out of the country.

The company provides a 401k with full matching at 3%, increasing 1% each year to a max of 6%.  They also have an ESPP at 10% which I plan to max out.  So that leaves with the rest of the money to do with intelligently.  I do not have an IRA account as of yet but have read up on them and believe a Roth IRA is the way to go.

With the sign on bonus, I'd like to get rid of all the credit card debt and as much of the student loan debt while keeping an emergency fund.  Currently I have 1900 in a savings account for an emergency fund but I'd like to increase that to 5k then to 10k.

So fellow /pf'ers, how should I proceed?

P.S: First time posting to reddit so forgive me if the formatting is a bit rough.  If there's other information you need, please feel free to ask.  And sorry for the wall of text!

Next thing I know he breaks up with me and I find out that he slept with **two girls (one the night we broke up) in two days**. I feel awful. But he is clearly happier with his freedom. 


I thought I was a girl one could cherish. I am really smart, pretty and have a lot to offer someone but I have lost all my confidence now. A month before the breakup I was going through some hard personal times. My bf was not very supportive and when I finally found the silver lining he was almost jealous of my success. (That's a long story for a different day). I realize now that I don't want to marry this unsupportive kind of person but I just feel so awful about myself now. So devalued and defeated. I also feel jealous that he is doing just fine and enjoying his freedom so very much.

1xr3rv,1,2014-02-12,Wife and Girls Night Out,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/1xr3rv/wife_and_girls_night_out/,"Ok need some advice on what to do here please. I a fairly new convert in the last 3 months. Wasn't a total beta but definitely got soft over the years. Married 5 years together 8, wife is 29 I'm 31. We have a 2 year old.

Ok so wife told me she was going on a girls night out to a local high class brewery/bar with some of her nursing school classmates next week, her wanting to go out normally isn't a big deal if it's with her best friend or some other girls she has known since high school who are the straight laced type. It's pretty freakin rare that she ever wants to go. The problem here is that I really don't know these girls going. The only one I know is a mid thirties single mom who talks non-stop about cock. She's pretty hot too but you can tell she's been rode hard and put away wet. Based on what my wife has told me most of the other girls in her classes are mid twenties to mid thirties single/divorced women with kid(s) who like to ride the carousel and/or have lots of issues.

They are all jealous of my wife, she's nearly top of class, has a highly sought after internship, has a good looking very successful husband(me) who takes care of her, basically the good life.

I think she's gonna be a target. I don't like the idea of her drinking with these girls or even hanging out with them in general. Misery loves company and I can see a situation where they intentionally try to sabotage her. 

I'm trying to figure my move here. I'm thinking I just tell her that I don't know these other girls and the one I do know I don't approve of her hanging out with in that atmosphere. I'm also thinking of telling her that married women shouldn't be going out with single women because they'll be constantly egged on to let loose and just have a good time, the whole what happens here stays here mentality.

Or I could say nothing act as if I could care less and just let her go. 

What do you guys think?

1xsgj6,4,2014-02-13,I [24 F] have been experiencing loss of libido towards my long-distance boyfriend [26 M] of 13 months.,halpmerhonda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xsgj6/i_24_f_have_been_experiencing_loss_of_libido/,"We began dating in January 2013. He is a current grad student and I recently finished my undergrad in December 2013. 

Our sex life was amazing, incredible, mind-blowing, throughout the spring semester of 2013, despite living 2 hours away. We saw each other about every other weekend. This past summer left us living 7 hours apart, but we would meet at our hometown in between the cities we were living in almost every weekend. Despite our busy weekday schedules and the 10 hours of driving for myself each weekend (and 4 hours for him), our sex life was still really good. It was difficult to have privacy as we were staying at one of our parent's houses when we were together but it was still fantastic when we could sneak away and we were both enthusiastic about being intimate. 

The last week before school started (in August 2013), I drove to his college town (only 2 hours away) to spend that last week of summer with him. It was preceding my last semester in my undergrad, and I took a lot of hours and had an internship, so I knew we wouldn't get to see each other as frequently as we had in the past. He was extremely drunk most of the time I was there - as in passed-out before dinnertime. He hadn't seen his college friends all summer, so I understand that he missed them so I didn't bring it up to be fair to him. 


He didn't ask me to go on a date the entire time, so I planned one. Knowing about the date, he agreed to meet up with his brother without asking me at all if I would prefer to hang out with him and his sibling. I then planned another date so we could at least spend a little quality time together. He was waaaay drunk the whole time we were out on this date but we had a great time, so no harm, no foul. 

I bring all this up as this week is when my sex drive just wasn't the same as it was. I loved sex before but this week he didn't seem interested in foreplay and we really didn't ever cuddle or do other things to emotionally or physically connect. We had sex once or twice at the beginning of the week but it felt mechanical and not full of love or passion.

After the initial lackluster and robotic sexual encounters that week, compounded by his attitude, I couldn't get excited about having sex again during the remainder of that visit. He kept bugging me (putting my hand on his erection in his room, hinting that we should go lay down, etc) for sex several times a day and would get frustrated when I said I didn't feel like it. I feel that lead to him trying to initiate sex more and more, which made me feel all the more anxious and shut down. 

We later talked about the pre-fall semester week and how my feelings were really hurt from his behavior, and he was defensive but then agreed that we should work on our bond if we spend time together by going on dates or just us hanging out alone. He brought up how I wasn't interested in sex that week and asked ""Are we (as in our relationship) getting old?"" and I told him that his behavior was hurtful and didn't make me feel turned on. Since that week, his attention to me and his drinking haven't ever been a problem since. We have quality time almost every day I am in his city and he has one or two drinks a night. I feel like all the issues since that week have been resolved entirely except for the sex thing.


We didn't see each other much during the fall '13 semester as we were both so busy. When we did have time to visit each other, my perception of our sex lives had changed. I still felt stressed and unenthused about sex, even though I had forgiven him for his behavior that week. He drinks only moderately now and every single weekend we are together we do fun stuff together, like go on dates, take our dog to the park and play sports. However, I still felt/feel paralyzed when it comes to sex. Whenever he starts trying to initiate, even now, I automatically feel uptight and not into it. 


I get anxious when I am getting ready to go to bed, because I want to cuddle and be physically intimate, but I always stress and then I have to turn him down, which leads to both of us being frustrated. That makes me feel really terrible as I really do want to have sex and I know it hurts his feelings and makes him feel rejected each time he tries to start turning me on. I don't know what is wrong with me. It's like I can't control it, and I can't relax, even when I consciously try to relax and get into the mood, my body/mind won't listen. I am so over that week, and have been for months and months now, and on top of that, I am really proud that we communicated about it and things have been incredible on an emotional level since then. 


I started to get worried when we were together 24/7 for a month over christmas, and I felt sure that I would be able to relax and things would go back to normal, and we only had sex a few times. During school, I thought maybe I felt too pressured to relax during small windows of time (one weekend per month) that we were together, or that I was having a hard time letting go of external stress from school and graduation stuff, and that was carrying over into our sex life. 

I want to go visit him soon. I miss him so much but I have been avoiding it because I don't want to be hurtful by turning away when I feel him getting turned on or explaining to him again that I love him but I am not in the mood. I feel so ashamed because I love him so much and I want to have sex, but there is an unknown obstacle there and I don't know what is going on. I feel like we are falling into a hurtful cycle where he pursues me, and I turn him down, which makes him pursue me more, which leads to me getting stressed out from being pressured, which leads to me rejecting him. Recently he has expressed that he really misses making out, cuddling and having sex, as do I. We have both recently been stressed, and lashing out at each other instead of going to each other for support, and I can speak for myself when I say I feel….disconnected or something. I think this lack of sex and nearness is impacting both of us, emotionally and sexually. It's not healthy and I don't want to do this to myself or him anymore. I am open to any advice, particularly on trust-building from a sexual perspective. 


**tl;dr**: I [24 F] had an outstanding and loving sexual relationship for the first 8 months of my relationship with boyfriend, [26 M]. Some non-major things happened that made me lose trust in him about 5 months ago and our sex-life has never recovered, despite my hurt feelings being healed months ago. I attributed it to a long-distance relationship and external stressors impacting our sex life, but after spending a month together recently I am worried. We are slipping into a cycle of rejection in the bedroom and I need some strategies to help stop it. I, personally, am interested in learning how to be more sexually/emotionally vulnerable so I can be a better girlfriend and lover, and also would like to hear any advice on how to rebuild trust and intimacy with a partner so that my SO and I can strengthen our relationship. Any insight on what you think might be going on and how to help me is very much appreciated. Thank you so much. "

1xsyk7,1,2014-02-13,[Request] Youtube fame and fans,[deleted],pbsideachannel,https://www.reddit.com/r/pbsideachannel/comments/1xsyk7/request_youtube_fame_and_fans/,"tl;dr: something changes in the way we think of and treat people once they become internet-famous.  It's almost the same as what happens when they become traditionally famous, but it's so close to home, it makes me wonder whether we should re-think this whole ""celebrity"" thing.  Sorry this post is crazy-long.

After looking into [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1xs45h/realtotalbiscuit_total_biscuit_of_youtube_fame/), comments from /u/realtotalbiscuit_ , /u/uberwolf0, and a few others in both the original and the bestof posts, I am interested in seeing how fan access to famous people is changing the already double-edged nature of fame.  

Much has been said already about the consequences of fame.  Actors, writers, musicians, politicians and others all get the benefit - the thrill of the spotlight - followed by all of the negative attention that comes with the territory.  The press digs into your private life, looking for anything interesting enough to sell alongside ads, and it's just business.  Critics and fans constantly judge you for your entire body of work, never miss a mistake, and expect more and more from you as you just do what you love for a living.  We've even seen a few famous explain in great depth why [celebrity culture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKboLTwzFTs) is so twisted.

But the audience is separated from traditional celebrities.  We see them on their chosen medium, say television, only as often as they are published on that medium, say once a week for 13 weeks in a season.  Beyond that we might see them for a few minutes during award shows and in interviews or ""lifestyles of"" specials.  If their PR team is good, you can leave a message for an intern when you send your favorite celebrity an email or letter or gift, you might follow them on Twitter, but you can never really be sure the interaction is genuinely *them*.  Sometimes we get lucky and learn something about traditional celebrities when they show us what they're really like ([for example](https://twitter.com/officialjaden)).

Now look at Youtube ""celebrities"" who are obviously just ""real people"" unlike traditional celebrities, polished and unattainable as they seem to be every time we get a peek into their lives.  Whether the internet-famous get that way by producing particular content (like /u/realtotalbiscuit_), sharing a window to their real lives (like /u/uberwolf0), or if they are accidentally thrust into the spotlight because someone decided to post a crazy video to the internet (like [these people](http://www.today.com/news/viral-accident-7-folks-who-didnt-mean-be-famous-6C10980738) for intstance), they get a special kind of fame because they are so much closer to their fans.  

Internet anonymity soon turns to people knowing your real-life identity.  It might affect your home, your job, your relationships, to a degree you weren't prepared for.  But the traditional celebrities at least have piles of money to distract them from these kinds of strains, while the internet-famous might get lucky enough to make a living off of their celebrity if they choose that path.  Inevitably, the people who love to watch you and talk about you start turning toward you with the same criticism they show traditional celebrities, but instead of a PR team reading it, it's you directly receiving this feedback.  Interaction with the audience is a common aspect of Youtube fame, but it can really get dangerous if you attract the wrong kind of attention.

Is the audience a bigger threat to the internet-famous?  Is the ""celebrity culture"" the same even if the celebrity isn't?  Do people deserve the kind of attention they receive whether they wanted it or not?  Should they just have a thick skin or should we re-think how we treat people who happen to captivate us?  Should our privacy laws be re-tooled for all kinds of celebrities?  What does it say about us when anybody can attain this kind of celebrity and we treat them so differently once they do?"
1xszui,11,2014-02-13,"Don't know what I'm doing, need support",gaybrothatsanxious,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1xszui/dont_know_what_im_doing_need_support/,"Hey guys, so sorry if this sounds self-pitying or debbie downer-ish but I've been having a really really rough couple of months and really need someone to vent/some support I guess.

So I'm a junior in college at a pretty good midwest public school. This is my second year living in my fraternity's house, I'm out to everyone. I love my roommate he's super cool, totally 100% happy with me being gay and everything. I hate living in the house though, it's always nasty, there's SO much negative energy I feel like from everyone. I don't know how much longer I can take it (I know only a few more months…). I have pretty bad OCD and generalized anxiety, I see a therapist once a week but I feel like it's not getting better really. I also take an SSRI daily. I wake up everyday feeling so anxious and so unhappy. I constantly have bad dreams that wake me up. I came out to my parents in October - I thought they would be super supportive because they're very liberal and whatnot but they've been INCREDIBLY passive aggressive about the whole thing, especially my mom. Ive been seeing my boyfriend now for over 6months and I feel like he's the only happy thing I have in my life at all. The past few semesters I've been doing poorly in school (~3.2 average) I'm majoring in math and economics. I've applied to 30 internships and have pretty much been rejected by every single one. I feel so worthless, I feel like I can't do anything, I feel so stupid and dumb for not being able to get an internship. I know it's the wrong thing to do, but part of me just wants to up and leave school, it's been so disappointing recently. I work my ass off in everything but all that ever has been happening is that I'm doing bad in school and getting fat. I hate it. Also there's this girl that is like in love with me, that doesn't stop bothering me, and makes me feel really guilty. I seriously can't stand it. I feel out of control of my emotions sometimes too (like now). I don't know what to do. I'm so sad and disappointed in myself and angry. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm just really anxious and upset now and needed someplace to talk about it all."

1xte4h,1,2014-02-13,"Historical Fiction, critique please?",drivinganindievan,AmateurWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmateurWriting/comments/1xte4h/historical_fiction_critique_please/,"Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.

The click of three pairs of boots stepping in perfect sync with each other cracked like gunshots, echoing in the tall, arching entryway to la camera dei dolori.  A trio of khaki and olive green-clad men-in-uniform were calmly, yet purposefully, striding towards a large oaken door set into the stone. 

The man in front was named Adolf Hitler.  The name, though innocuous enough, would soon be etched into the world’s book of infamy.  A rather brusque man, he was clean cut and his haughtiness demanded attention, even though he was of average size and not someone you would normally give a second glance to while walking on the street.  He had the loud voice of someone who was used to having to make himself heard; having ten siblings often commanded that.  German by blood and Jewish by birth, Hitler took pride in his nation first and always, but his mother’s religion was never as important to him.  As he was now the Chancellor of Germany, he had only the world to gain.  He carried a leather briefcase, emblazoned with the crest of the Third Reich.  The briefcase held the outline for his plan: segregation, isolation, and extradition. 

He stopped short of the door, slowing to a halt, eyeing the entryway with trepidation.  The portal before him seemed to grow larger with every beat of his heart.  Hitler turned to examine his entourage: his right hand man, Franz Von Papen, and alongside him, a small, nervous, young-looking translator that was brought along solely for this meeting and was expendable.

Von Papen was a taller man, with trimmed black hair and a mustache that would rival that of the world’s greatest carnival barker.  He held a sheaf of paper bound by a manilla folder stamped with the bold red word “vertraulich”.  It was this set of paperwork that outlined his plan for the Hunger Plan - a plan not even his superior knew fully.  This plan to eradicate his precious Germany of all problems, religious and political, was one that he knew would have to be presented carefully in the right setting.  Von Papen had severed his ties to these people: his Jewish grandmother died in the crossfire of the First World War, his Gypsy sister was disowned and those people he once called his parents were dead - victims of an “accidental” train crash outside Markdorf five years prior.  The fact that Von Papen had a hand in their murders was twisted, yes, but was he sorry?  Not in the slightest.

The third man in their party, a translator, was a younger man named Joseph Goebbels.  His actual position was intern to der Fuhrer, but nevertheless, he was chosen to be a translator for this occasion because of his knowledge of Italian.  He was confused at the reason why he had been brought along; there were plenty of other, more capable translators enlisted in the Nazi ranks, men with more experience and less fear.  But Hitler had chosen him personally, treating him almost like a son.  Joseph was not one to complain or question authority - he was well indoctrinated.  He grasped onto another briefcase, this one holding - what he so willingly believed - Hitler’s personal effects and miscellaneous papers.  Why he needed a bag such as this for a political meeting, he didn't know.  Nor did he ask; he knew better than to question der Fuhrer.  Sieg heil.

1xu084,1,2014-02-13,Art’s Guide to Obtaining an Internship in Public Accounting,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1xu084/arts_guide_to_obtaining_an_internship_in_public/,"Art’s Guide to Obtaining an Internship in Public Accounting
Hello everyone, I am Art and I put this guide out there to genuinely help students looking to land an internship opportunity while they are in college. If you are seriously struggling and really want to have a job lined up before graduating, you will read through ALL of this. I can guarantee you, if you follow this, you have a 95% chance of getting at least one internship. 
This guide is to help those students that are currently attending universities and are looking to land an internship with the big 4. Actually this guide is a great way to really land any type of internship with a company of your choice. However, since I have actually received offers from both the mid-sized public accounting firms and the big 4, I believe that I am better qualified to give advice in these areas. I am sure there are better guides out there and better ways to get into the big 4, but these are the steps that I took and hopefully they can assist you in landing an internship as well. 
If you are one of those people that are going to career fairs and handing your resume to 20 different companies and hoping someone will just call you, believe me, you are doing it all wrong. You will be very lucky if you land an internship that way. In this guide I will show you what channels and strategies I used to get in touch with companies/recruiters and how I built a relationship with them to land my first internship opportunity. 

JOIN STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS! (Networking)
I cannot stress this one enough. I myself joined Beta Alpha Psi (BAP), however, Accounting Society(AS) is a great student organization as well. Both of these organizations are geared towards landing accounting jobs. Being in these organizations will improve your chances of landing a job at the carrier fair by 10 folds. No, I am not exaggerating. Why? Because they(student organizations) give you the opportunity to get to know the professional out at carrier fairs way ahead of time. When you show up at the carrier fair, believe me you want them to say hi to you and recognize you before you go up to them to beg for a job.   
The great thing about BAP and AS is that they are always in contact with leading firms and are always having meet &amp; greet sessions with them. This gives you a chance to have exclusive time with the professionals as there are more professionals per student at any of their events.  
Become Active
Do not just sign up for the organizations and let your membership go to waste. Start attending sessions; these student organizations get exclusive time with the companies. They can help you get your foot in the door in all sorts of firms including, small to mid-sized public accounting firms, the big 4, and the industry as well. 
First thing you need to do is find out which companies you would like to be part of. Do your research on the firms that you would like to work for. You can be the type of person who doesn’t really care about which firm you go to as long as you get a decent job and that is fine too. However, at least make a mental note of the companies you plan to pursue. Next, grab an events calendar from the student organization to find out when your selected firm(s) will be coming to the university. Mark down every day that the company plans on meeting with the organization. You need to make sure that you are at all of those events. You cannot miss a single one, no excuses what so ever. If you have to push exam dates then do it. Just make sure you are at every company event without fail. Missing even one can hurt your chances.  
Focus (Most Important) 
This section I would like to believe is what helped me the most in obtaining an internship and is not something that most people advise you on. Your goal shouldn’t be to apply to the maximum number of companies possible. Start picking out certain companies and stalk them. Some companies show up on campus 5 to 7 times a semester. You need to get that schedule and be at every one of these event. Believe me, the more they see you them, the more they will be convinced that you are interested in them. Get them to remember you on a first name basis. 
You can obtain the company’s schedule on recruiting with your campus the following ways:
•	Grab a calendar from the student organization 
•	Ask the recruiter during one of the events “So when will you be coming on campus next? Or “when is your next recruiting event?” Write the date down in your notebook and burn it into your brain. 
 Start looking for the professionals that come to every recruiting event that the company hosts. For example, let’s say Company XYZ is hosting 5 events at your campus. During the first event a company might come with a staff of 3 recruiters (Bob, Tom, and Jane). In the next event the company might come with Michael, Ron, and Jane and the event hosted after that one you may see Dan, John, and Jane. You want to make sure that you focus on Jane at every event. Keep talking to her and get friendly with her. Chances are she is in charge of recruiting for your campus and has the most say in who gets a shot at the interview. If you see that there are 2 people that always come at every event from Company XYZ, then I recommend that you talk to both of the recruiters. Do not completely ignore the other employees, you never know who has the most say; just make sure you definitely speak with the person/people that attends the most recruiting sessions.
Remember since you plan on seeing them so many times; do not just keep asking the same old questions. If you have obtained all the necessary information that you need about the company, try to create small talk and get to know them on a personal level. Ask them about their weekend and try to remember what they plan on doing. It may not be such a bad idea to write it down so that you can follow up on their weekend the next time you see them. Leave your resume with them before you leave the event. After every single one of your events, email your recruiter and thank them for taking the time out and talking to you and educating you. This will allow the recruiters to hear your name when you meet them, to see it on your resume after the event that day, and allow them to see your name again when you email them. All this will go towards them remembering who you are.
Meeting with the recruiters/employees of a firm
Many people are really nervous about approaching a recruiter. My advice to you is, don’t be. These recruiters are there looking for you and you are there looking for them. It’s like going on a dating site, you don’t need to stress out about if someone is single or is not looking for a relationship. You know 100% that they are looking to date new people. Same concept is applied to recruiting. You know 100% that they are looking to hire someone and they know 100% that you need a job. It’s perfect match. Don’t be nervous, just go up to them and introduce yourself. 
What to talk about?
A lot of people have this problem of not knowing what to talk about with a recruiter. Look, you’re deciding what you want to do after you graduate and how you want to spend your 40 hours a week every week for a couple of months. Believe me; you have a lot to talk about. Here are some questions you can ask on your first meet. 
•	Tell me about your company?
•	What kind of internship programs do you currently have? 
•	When does the internship begin and end?
•	What qualities/qualifications are you looking for in a candidate?
•	When is the application deadline date
These are some great questions to begin your first meet with. Truly listen to them and think about everything that they are saying. Try to have some follow up questions to show that you were listening. 
Before leaving
Make sure you have given the recruiter your resume before you leave, it is another piece that they get to keep with them to remember you by and of course it highlights your accomplishments as well. Also be sure to grab their business card. 
After leaving
This is very important. So now the recruiter has seen your face, seen your credentials and has a resume to remember you by. That same day or the following day send the recruiter a thank you email so they can see your name one more time. Try to mention something unique from your discussion so that he/she can try to put a face to the name. They have met 100’s of students so it’s important that you try to distinguish yourself. Don’t write something really long; keep it short and sweet (about 3 lines). Your whole point is to get that name out there one more time. You need to do this after every meeting. Your goal is to make sure that the moment they see you, they should recognize you. 

Additional Advice
Major firms meet with the students on campus for about minimum 5 times per semester. You don’t have to ask them questions about the firm each time you meet the recruiters. Especially is you have met them multiple times. Sometimes your questions can all be answered and it is perfectly fine to drop and say Hi and see how the recruiters are doing. You can ask about their day and their weekend. Create small talk and try to maybe get to know them on a personal level. This will increase their likeability for you. I mean they get your point by the 5th and 6th meet. They know that you are interested. It’s okay if you still have questions but generally most people run out of them by that time. Take that opportunity to just drop by and say a friendly hello. 
Now I gave this advice assuming that people know what it means to be dressed professional by now and that they know how to write up a proper resume. I know that there are many additional areas that people can use guidance on so I am including a link to an excellent guide which I believe is very thorough and can help address some of the other areas that people can work on including the specifics of professionalism, resumes, thank you emails and other great advice.

Conclusion
I really hope this guide was helpful, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I will try to generally respond in a few hours, if not, then at the most the same day. Good luck on all your recruiting events.

I want to see someone i can get to know both on a personal level but also someone who wants to get to know me the same way

I graduate this May, and I'm currently seeking internships all over the country, but that doesn't mean that i cant commit. Im the sort of person that will stay loyal to someone no matter the distance between me and them, and regardless of the quirks and flaws of someones personality. 

Comment or PM with some of your interests, and hopefully we can work something out.

I was offered a place at Oxford but I'm hesitant in taking it up as I'm not sure about the job market for IT/CS students. 

Most US programs allow you to intern and get some experience while you study, but the Oxford course is an intensive 1 year course so when I graduate, I'll have a Master's degree and just a few months of work ex. So my question is, does UK have a ""startup culture""? Have students received offers from companies overseas? Are the salaries good? Do companies (not talking about Google or Amazon) hire immigrants and sponsor them or is there tendency to hire local talent?

I'm really confused because US is the best place for tech, but Oxford is Oxford. Everyone knows it.

Thanks in advance!

1xvp9x,3,2014-02-14,[Relationships][21M] My GF [21F] and I may possibly have some irreconcilable differences in our plans for careers/the future. What should I do?,arkofcovenant,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xvp9x/relationships21m_my_gf_21f_and_i_may_possibly/,"So, my GF and I have been together for 3 1/2 years, and everything has been going really well. We love each other a lot, we get along really well, we have similar and usually compatible personalities. We've been living together at college for about a year, except that right now she is out of state for an internship since January. Everyone that knows us always says stuff like ""you guys are such a perfect couple"" ""you really lucked out in finding a girl that you get along with so well"" etc etc. We are both kinda thinking its pretty likely we'll get married, but we've both got so much stuff going on I've decided its best to wait until we graduate in about a year before really making the decision to ""pop the question,"" and I know she's ok with that. 

Here's the problem: I am an Aerospace Engineering Student, and I want to go into the space industry, either NASA or a private company. I want to do this not only because it is interesting and important to me, but I *strongly* believe it to be objectively important to the survival of the human race. Right now, a catastrophic event on earth could end humanity in its infancy. It is a ways away, but I believe that the sooner we can gain a foothold out in space, the better, and I want to be a part of the process that will eventually lead us to that. 

It is very important to her to be physically near her family (midwest). She has a very strong connection with her family, and is very hesitant about living anywhere other than the midwest.

Problem: There are approximately zero spaceflight companies in the midwest. 

I was on skype with her earlier tonight when this came up. I admitted that this was definitely going to be a tough problem to solve, but there are so many unknowns right now that it isn't worth worrying about so much, and that we will probably be able to come up with some sort of compromise when the time came. I told her that I'd like to get my pilot's license when I can afford it, and I'd be able to fly her home to see her family whenever she liked. I told her that we'd probably be making enough money (she's engineering too) for her to buy a plane ticket back home every weekend if she wanted. Despite all of this, she seemed very worried about this, and said that she'd be afraid that she would regret deciding to live anywhere else. She said that right now, she feels like she absolutely couldn't live in California (where the highest concentration of space companies are). 

I find this to be really frustrating. 1) Because it seems like she isn't really willing to compromise in a way that would allow me to pursue this career path at all, and 2) Because I feel like this shouldn't even be a debate, as my goals are objectively more important.

I'm having an especially hard time with this because I really, *really* don't have that kind of relationship with my family, and I have a hard time seeing the issue from her perspective at all. I'd be very content being as far from my mother as possible, and while my dad is pretty cool, I'd be alright only seeing him very occasionally, either for her sake or for the sake of my career. 

She is by far the best thing that has ever happened to me, but the future of humanity in regards to space is so important that I feel like I have to pursue it, given that I feel I can make a significant contribution to it. I can't really imagine myself with anyone but her, but if I do have to end it, I feel like I need to end it *now* if I am even going to have a remote chance at finding someone who makes me as happy as she does.

Edit: A lot of people seem to be interpreting this as me being selfish. My perspective is biased, so I don't think that is impossible, but I'm thinking that maybe some people are misinterpreting the word ""objectively"". I'm talking about ""important"" in regard to how it can positively affect the world as a whole. When one option does positively affect the world, and the other does not, isn't it usually best to do the former?

Edit2: /u/victoria_woodhull (thank you) explained it in a way that actually got through my thick skull, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xvp9x/relationships21m_my_gf_21f_and_i_may_possibly/cff2nvk)
While I think I have a better perspective now, I still welcome further input (I'll try not to be so snarky).

I recently went to New Zealand for an internship, and I earned some money that I would like to convert into Bitcoin.

The thing is, even if I got a nice pile of NZD in my ANZ bank account, I can't seem to find a good solution to change then into Bitcoin. I can't use BitNZ because online deposits are on hold (and apparently it's not going to change soon), Tua doesn't seem to be available now, and I'm simply puzzled by how the market works in LocalBitcoins.com.

All advertisments on LocalBitcoins have pretty much ridiculous prices (the sellers want to sell for an absurd amount of money compared to the market prices, and so do most buyers apparently), and especially, many of them require not only a real name (I'm fine with that, I'm not a scanner) but also a *NZ* ID. I'm honest and I can provide any proof of identity, residence, etc., but I am french, I live in France and I can't deposit cash anywhere.

Any idea what I could do? If you know other exchanges accepting NZ deposits without huge fees, I would be interested as well…"

Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's The Lego Movie is exactly what its title promises, a kid-pleasing movie comprised of CGI renditions of the titular interlocking plastic bricks. The story is a self-aware riff on hero's journey and prophecy tropes: Emmet Brickowski (Parks and Recreation's Chris Pratt, who could make the National Union Catalog funny) is an ordinary guy in a Lego city who discovers that he's destined to Save The World, along the way meeting characters already owned by parent company Time Warner (Will Arnett as Batman) and newly proprietary (Alison Brie as Uni-Kitty). 

When I think about the house I grew up in — my football-themed bedroom, the big family room, the yard — there are always Lego bricks everywhere. And I’m clearly not alone, because everyone in my packed theater watching The Lego Movie this weekend seemed to have the same experience I did: a 100-minute exercise in nostalgia, rendered in RealD 3D.

It's the first big-budget Lego movie in the company's 80-year history, made painstakingly over five years in concert with writer–director duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Its cast list is riddled with A-list actors, its marketing is massive and unavoidable — and it's a shockingly fun, remarkably entertaining movie. Sure, it's an hour and a half of advertising for Lego, but if this is the future of marketing, sign me up.

The picture looks good, it has some yuks, and there are even early hints of an Idiocracy-style satire of a lowbrow culture — the most popular show on TV, Where Are My Pants?, is a PG version of Ow! My Balls! — but the overlong Lego Movie collapses in the third act, finally becoming an overt commercial for the toys while getting existential in a way that unfavorably parallels the Toy Story movies. Nor does it help that the screenwriters work out their daddy issues — what is this, 2013? — and the movie ends on a distastefully sexist joke. (Girls ruin everything!) Still, Chris Pratt gets to say, ""Abraham Lincoln, you bring your space-chair right back here!"" Classic Pratt.

The movie follows Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a normal guy with a normal job and a normal life. As soon as he wakes up, he breaks out the instruction manual. Jumping jacks? Check. $37 coffee? Check. Wave to neighbors? Check. He follows the speed limit, works diligently at his construction job, and every once in a while wonders if there might be more to life than this. One night as he's leaving his worksite he meets a pretty girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), and finds a mysterious object called The Piece of Resistance. The one who finds it, it's been prophesied, is The Special: the smartest, most talented, most interesting person in the world, and the one who will save everyone from President Business (Will Ferrell) and his evil plan. But to do that he needs to ditch the instructions and go freestyle.

Everything in the movie from elaborate cities to puffs of smoke is made of Lego, and it's all fair game: at one point Wyldstyle builds a motorcycle out of an alleyway in order to escape Liam Neeson's nefarious Bad Cop. It's this build-and-rebuild ethos that makes the movie go — the movie twists and turns relentlessly and often without any warning, as if there's a kid above acting like King Kong and knocking down the tower he's built before starting over on something different. It's a funny, quirky, weird adventure that has fun with the limitations of Legos while making clear that there's nothing you can't do or make with those interlocking blocks. Including spaceships.

It's not exactly breaking new ground — normal guy learns he's special, saves the world — and it does come with a fair amount of heavy-handed preaching about how everyone is special and we can all be anything we want. Like any good family-friendly movie, there's a love story, there are jokes both obvious and subtle, and there's a surprisingly tender third act. But everything about the way The Lego Movie unfolds feels fresh, with Lord and Miller doing their brand-building duty while simultaneously rolling their eyes at it. Where a movie like The Internship is one long bow at the altar of Google, The Lego Movie frequently cuts to awkward scenes where minifigures can’t quite figure out how to hold hands, or the revered ""relics"" that are mostly just gross things you might accidentally find in a box full of Lego bricks. It’s loving throughout, but it’s edgy and self-deprecating enough to never feel contrived.

""I think what we’ve really found is that Lego is a medium,"" Michael McNally, Lego's brand relations director, tells me. ""It’s not a toy, it’s a medium for other people to tell their own stories and create their own adventures."" To tell theirs, Lord and Miller (who wrote and directed 21 Jump Street and the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series) turned to Animal Logic, a well-known Australian effects studio. The result is stunning, a mix of stop-motion and photorealism that left me constantly forgetting and remembering the characters are Lego minifigures with claws for hands and as many personalities as they have outfits.

It's a movie made for Lego fans of all ages, which McNally reminds me are everywhere: Lego is the second-largest toy maker in the world, and there are even communities of Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL) around the world. ""It’s no different from Volkswagen owners or Apple enthusiasts or Disney fanatics,"" he says. ""We have Lego fans."" He grants that the movie seems designed to encourage and revive interest in Lego (and to sell bricks), but says that wasn't the point. ""A feature film was never really something we set out to make. A lot of people say, ‘Well, toy movies are just designed to sell toys.’ And that’s not something that was compelling to us… it wasn’t like we needed a movie to help us sell more stuff."""

In Ken Scott’s Delivery Man, Vince Vaughn plays irresponsible delivery truck driver David Wozniak – the naive, risk-taking, black sheep of his family. After a pyramid scheme leaves him with over $100,000 in debt, David discovers that, not only is his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) pregnant, he’s at the center of a high-profile privacy lawsuit. Twenty years back, David had regularly donated (in exchange for cash) to a fertility clinic under the pseudonym “Starbuck” - which in turn disproportionately distributed his “super” sperm to hundreds of women. As a result, David learns that his trips to the sperm bank resulted in the birth of 533 children that share his DNA – of which 142 have joined a class action lawsuit to unearth Starbuck’s true identity.

Curious, David goes undercover to meet his biological children and finds a bond with the diverse batch of young people, reveling in their talents as well as attempting to aid in their challenges. However, as the lawsuit becomes a trending topic on cable news channels, David must decide whether or not to reveal himself and take an active role in the lives of the “Starbuck Kids” – or focus entirely on his “real” family.

Vince Vaughn as David Wozniak in ‘Delivery Man’

Director Ken Scott helms Delivery Man, a Hollywood remake of the 2011 Canadian comedy Starbuck, which was also directed by Scott. As with any remake, there are small differences between the two films, but even with the same director, Delivery Man is a surprisingly close recreation of the same story – this time with an American star and a New York City setting. For that reason, anyone who enjoyed Starbuck (which was runner-up in the 2011 TIFF People’s Choice Award), Delivery Man will likely come across as a shameless Hollywood adaptation of a superior indie film. Still, the core premise is ripe with comedy and emotion, Bollywood and French Starbuck remakes have also been released, and Scott maintains a solid balance between humor and drama in his own (second) effort. Therefore, moviegoers who have not already experienced the Starbuck story will find plenty to enjoy in Delivery Man, even if there’s reason to be cynical about a director refashioning his original indie picture for a mainstream audience.

On the surface, potential viewers might pigeonhole Delivery Man as another formulaic Vince Vaughn comedy, where the actor goes through his usual underachieving man boy turned grown man arc (see: The Internship, The Dilemma, and Wedding Crashers, among others). Yet, as David stalks his biological children, the film actually includes some pretty weighty story elements that force the main character (and subsequently Vaughn) to take the entire situation seriously.

Britt Robertson, Amos VanderPoel, Vince Vaughn, and Jack Reynor

There are still a number of laugh-worthy jokes but American audiences will likely be surprised by the amount of sincere moments that Delivery Man offers. Few are quite as profound as Scott may have intended, largely because Vaughn simply doesn’t have the necessary range to sell the diverse set of deeper ideas presented in this story, but dramatic scenes are not simply one-note throwaways either. Delivery Man makes genuine attempts at earning its rumination on family and fatherhood – meaning that even when it falls short, the material has already aimed higher than standard comedy fare.

As mentioned, Vaughn isn’t doing anything new in Delivery Man. In general, David is an amalgamation of the comedian’s other man-child leads – an aimless, self-centered, and underachieving guy that is forced to grow up as a result of the situation at hand. To his credit, Vaughn delivers in a number of encounters that ground the film in meaningful emotional drama but other moments are less successful as the actor comes across stilted and over-eager in selling a few especially delicate scenes.

Chris Pratt as Brett in ‘Delivery Man’

Nevertheless, Vaughn is surrounded by a gripping group of young people that make up the four most prominent faces out of Starkbuck’s many offspring, namely David Patten as Central Park musician Adam (and organizer of the Starbuck lawsuit), Adam Chanler-Berat as philosophical lost boy Viggo, Britt Robertson as recovering addict Kristen, and Jack Reynor as aspiring actor Josh. Whenever Vaughn falls short, the enthusiastic cast of supporting actors is there to prop him up – with likable and relatable depictions of young adults in search of acceptance and family.

Several solid performers help round-out the Delivery Man storyline – including fan-favorite Chris Pratt (soon to lead Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy) playing David’s best friend and lawyer Brett. Pratt’s timing and understated approach to the character result in some of the film’s biggest laughs – ensuring there’s enough fun for viewers that might otherwise be overwhelmed by weighty drama in Scott’s film. Colbie Smulders (How I Met Your Mother) is equally effective as Emma, David’s pregnant girlfriend, but isn’t given very much to do. Despite her role in the larger story, Emma mostly serves as a motivator for David, and a reason to grow up, stepping into the plot whenever Scott needed to show a different side of his leading man – without tangible development for his love interest.

Colbie Smulders as Emma in ‘Delivery Man’

That said, it’s hard to fault Scott for keeping the Delivery Man plot focused on David and his extended family of biological children. In that effort, the remake succeeds at repackaging the smart Starbuck setup for a broader audience. Several plot threads get short shrift and it’s hard to escape the sense that this is a slightly watered down version of a unique original, but it’s still entertaining to watch the assembled pieces interact. Moviegoers looking for a laugh-out-loud Vince Vaughn dramedy in the vein of Wedding Crashers or Old School might be slightly underwhelmed by the amount of comedy set pieces in Delivery Man; yet for others, the competent mix of humor and drama should have no problem delivering a mostly fun (and even heartfelt) movie experience.

1xy65e,5,2014-02-14,I want to learn how to be happy while sober.,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1xy65e/i_want_to_learn_how_to_be_happy_while_sober/,"It's been something like a month and a half since I've had any alcohol apart from the small amount of rum that my roommate used when he was cooking baked beans the other night, but that all cooked out so I feel like it's negligible. Anyway, I'm proud of myself because since I stopped, my life has vastly improved. I've started seeing a therapist, I'm getting more responsibility at the newspaper where I work, I've become a founding father at a new Fraternity on campus, and I landed a great, well paying internship today. Despite all that, I just feel like a giant pile of shit, physically and emotionally, and I don't know what it's gonna take for me to become truly happy while sober. I guess maybe when I'm not under the influence of anything, I have to get used to dealing with my own mind as it actually is.

Edit: I truly appreciate all of the responses so far. I feel really weak tonight. My roommate and a friend were upstairs drinking and I stayed downstairs on reddit just feeling really low. The good thing is I know my roommate would put a stop to me trying to join them, but I still felt the temptation when the friend came down to talk to me with a bottle of tequila in his hand.

You guys are really a big help."

The world of The Lego Movie is enormous and meticulously detailed, and McNally notes that you could pause the movie at any point and build everything you see. (Lego’s own designers helped Animal Logic with the set and character design.) The film still feels very much like Lord and Miller, though, a constant string of winking references and off-topic pop culture jokes to go with crazy sight gags and physical humor. The cast may be needlessly star-studded — Channing Tatum’s Superman has all of about three lines — but it’s hard to imagine a lesser group pulling off this mix of irreverent and sincere. Will Arnett might be my favorite Batman ever."

Watch Endless Love Online Like many films about wholly misguided love affairs, consuming obsession, and criminal activity involving elephants, ‘Endless Love’ opens with a vaguely creepy voiceover. Apparently meant to be styled as the opening lines to some kind of modern fairy tale, David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) uses the first few moments of Shana Feste’s adaptation to introduce us his very own tower-bound princess, young Jade Butterfield (Gabrielle Wilde), a sensitive enough soul entombed in our own grief (or something like that, it’s hard to tell over Pettyfer’s creepy staring). Set at the pair’s high school graduation, David and the camera both spy on Jade as he vows to do, well, something to get to know her. Charming.

Despite its title, film bears little resemblance to its source material, and only scattered details have been plucked from both the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film and the 1979 Scott Spencer book – including character names, the destructive power of hormones, a lingering weirdness with Jade’s mother, and explosive fire (no, no, not of the hormonal variety). Surprisingly sanitized despite a hefty number of perfume commercial-styled love scenes, ‘Endless Love’ keeps most of the darkness of the novel and first film at bay, resulting in a throwaway romance that’s only memorable because of how tremendously and laughably bad it is.


""""‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad, cringe cinema.""""



Watch Endless Love Online Whereas the original film imagined the Butterfields as free spirits and David as a preppy kid from a wealthy family, Feste’s film flips the script – these bookish Butterfields are profoundly straight-laced (and profoundly wealthy, apparently) and David is from a broken blue-collar home, and his only interests seem to include partying and cars (you know, like any teen boy). Both devastated by and sequestered after her beloved older brother’s death when she was just a sophomore in high school, Jade has spent the remainder of high school studying and hanging out with her parents. It’s certainly a sad story, and, man, does Dead Brother Chris hang over the Butterfield house, but it’s also hard to swallow – did Jade not have friends before? Did no one think to go out of his or her way to be kind to the heartbroken teen? Did no other guy notice that Jade is, to put it mildly, wildly gorgeous? – and instead, we’re forced to believe that Jade has been left alone for two years and is simply bursting for some human contact.



Enthralled by David’s wild manner and bad haircut, Jade falls fast for her new beau, despite lingering concerns from her family, especially her overbearing dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood). Hugh’s wariness is well-founded, because all it takes for Jade to abandon her innocence is precisely one joyride in a filched Maserati, one party crashed by surly teens putting on dance routines (yes), and one truly terrible family dinner. Jade, for all her inhibition and inexperience, beds David in her family home – in an open-doored library with a roaring fire and her family sleeping nearby, making it clear early on that almost nothing about their love story will scan as believable, even as it is wildly and bizarrely amusing to watch. While neither Pettyfer nor Wilde look convincingly like teens (both actors are in their mid-twenties), Wilde does manage to intermittently nail the coltish innocence of Jade.



Watch Endless Love Online As over the top as ‘Endless Love’ is (and, goodness, is this thing over the top), Feste occasionally hits on real emotion and believable reactions – it’s just all obscured by a choking hormonal haze and a dizzying series of increasingly terrible decisions. Hugh’s desire to protect his daughter is entirely understandable given their background, but Feste and Joshua Safran’s script insists on turning his concern into a version of villainy, while also folding in a subplot that makes him look like a real bastard (and, yes, he is a real bastard, but it ultimately has zero to do with his feelings about Jade and David). Similarly, Jade, consumed by her love for David (and, again, the hormones, good God, the hormones) decides to skip out on an internship that is essential to her future career as a doctor just to spend the summer with her new boyfriend.



Make no mistake, ‘Endless Love’ is not a good film, but that doesn’t keep it from being compulsively watchable and deeply (if not accidentally) entertaining. The film is peppered with hammy, head-thumping visual cues (Jade lives in a literally gated house! She is gated up! Free her, David!) and a series of instantly quotable one-liners (few people will be able to resist the charm of David’s father Harry, played by Robert Patrick, screaming at Hugh about the legality of breaking into a zoo). Distilled down to its most basic elements, ‘Endless Love’ is about the battle between mature love and first love, which isn’t a bad thing to form a film around – in its execution, however, ‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad cringe cinema that seems destined to become a new wave cult classic (read: audiences will enjoy laughing at it for many, many years to come)."

The issue is, is that its a 1 hour and 45 min drive there and back. As it stands now during busy season I have an hour before I have to leave for work, and then when I get home an hour before bed.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And so the saga of Thor continues. We first met the mighty Asgardian in 2011, when he was arrogant, impulsive and full of hubris, only learning humility when marooned on earth and surrounded by puny humans.

He ended that film a more measured and mature warrior, which readied him to team up with The Avengers for 2012’s biggest blockbuster, in which he once again helped save our planet from alien invasion. And little over 12 months later he’s back for a third outing, this time in the entertaining if somewhat silly and derivative Thor: The Dark World.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film kicks off with a prologue that finds Thor’s grandfather doing battle with an army of ‘Dark Elves’, led by the menacing Malekith, a seriously angry elf who is hellbent on plunging the world into darkness.

His plan revolves around harnessing the power of ‘The Aether’, which is one of those mysterious destructive forces that films like this need in order to further their plot but
Chris Tilly Says

He fails in his efforts however, but not before sacrificing the majority of his people and sticking himself and a few survivors into hibernation.

Thor’s Gramps meanwhile, on realising that he can’t actually destroy the Aether, instead buries it where no one will be able to find it. Of course, it's found in the first 30 minutes.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Yet while it’s nice to learn about Asgard’s back-story and heritage, time waits for no God, and so we immediately jump forward to the present-day, where Thor’s brother Loki is imprisoned on Asgard following the events of The Avengers, his girlfriend Jane Foster is stuck on earth and wondering where he’s gone and why he didn’t call while said events were taking place, and Thor himself is travelling through the Nine Realms kicking ass and taking names with Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

It’s in these scenes that we first get an inkling as to why Marvel charged Alan Taylor with the task of helming the picture, his ability to stage and shoot a battle – honed while working on Game of Thrones – meaning that Thor: The Dark World has some of the best action sequences yet seen in a superhero movie.

Taylor has a more naturalistic approach than Kenneth Branagh employed on the previous flick, thrusting his camera into the heart of battle so that the fight scenes have a grittiness and muscularity that serve the story well.

But the Warriors soon complete their task, bringing peace to the Realms so that early on in proceedings, The Dark World is suffering from a severe lack of drama and conflict beyond Thor arguing with his Dad about the differences between a king and a man. And standing around with his top off for no apparent reason.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Praise Odin’s beard then that the Convergence is approaching, a beautiful but dangerous cosmic event in which all of the Realms align. And don’t worry if you don’t understand this aspect of the plot, as it’s explained over-and-over again throughout the film.

The event coincides with Malekith waking from his slumber and going after the Aether, putting him on a collision course with Thor on Asgard and Jane on earth. And then Jane on Asgard and Thor on earth. And as worlds align and portals open, the action traverses between these realms and several others on an all-too-regular basis, making for a somewhat schizophrenic viewing experience that at times confuses.

It doesn’t help that Malekith is a pretty weak antagonist, with much of the misery that drives the film’s villain seemingly brought on himself. There’s no doubting that Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but here he’s buried under mountains of prosthetics, and the audience spends so little time with the character that we never get a true sense of who he is or what his motives are.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And in spite of the fact that the film clocks in just under two hours, it also feels like we don’t spend enough time with Tom Hiddleston’s Loki. In The Avengers he was part of a hugely charismatic ensemble, but when it comes to Thor – where the title character is often the straight man – he’s pretty much the star of the show, and so scenes where he’s not onscreen feel like a wasted opportunity.

Indeed the film kicks up a gear when he and Thor are compelled to join forces, and rather than squabbling with each other – as they have done in previous efforts – their dynamic becomes infinitely more interesting; the film all-the-more fun because of it.

Which is more than can be said for the relationship between Thor and Jane, which may well be the least interesting aspect of the narrative, a potential love triangle between the pair and Lady Sif briefly thrown into the mix before quickly and mercifully being dropped.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Jane’s friendship with intern Darcy does allow Kat Dennings to once again flex her comedic muscles, and more of her one-liners hit the mark here than in the original Thor. Indeed this may rival Iron Man 3 for the title of ‘funniest Marvel movie yet,’ with Chris O’Dowd raising laughs in a couple of brief appearances, Stellan Skarsgard stripping off for a hilariously clothes-free cameo as Dr. Erik Selvig, and Thor’s ‘fish-out-of-water’ shtick still working three films in.

But perhaps the funniest character this time around – albeit unintentionally – is Idris Elba’s Heimdall, the returning Sentinel who possesses the ability to see and hear events in faraway galaxies. Heimdall has one job, which is to guard the gate at Asgard’s Observatory. And yet he fails on that front quite spectacularly in The Dark World, the character’s incompetence making him quite possibly the worst bouncer in the cosmos.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film’s biggest problem is that it fails to take the Thor franchise to the next level however. Post-Avengers, Marvel’s standalone superhero movies have to work doubly hard to make their mark, which the aforementioned Iron Man 3 did by raising the stakes and stripping Tony Stark bare so that you genuinely thought that it might be the end for him.

But Thor: The Dark World feels less like a dramatic escalation and more like bland continuation, the action improved but the story – which was written by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely – unimaginative and uninvolving, at times feeling like it’s been cobbled together from bits of other comic book movies. There’s a huge contrivance involving Jane Foster that’s somewhat unforgivable. And come on guys – Charing Cross to Greenwich on the Tube in three stops? Seriously?

Watch Thor The Dark World Online That said, the film does manage to avoid climaxing with the kind of cliché-ridden city-wide destruction that has become the hallmark of the genre in recent years. East London does take a bit of a battering during the finale, but the film nevertheless finds an alternate route to close out its narrative; one that cleverly combines comedy and action for something approaching a satisfying conclusion."

Watch The Lego Movie Online When I think about the house I grew up in — my football-themed bedroom, the big family room, the yard — there are always Lego bricks everywhere. And I’m clearly not alone, because everyone in my packed theater watching The Lego Movie this weekend seemed to have the same experience I did: a 100-minute exercise in nostalgia, rendered in RealD 3D.

It's the first big-budget Lego movie in the company's 80-year history, made painstakingly over five years in concert with writer–director duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Its cast list is riddled with A-list actors, its marketing is massive and unavoidable — and it's a shockingly fun, remarkably entertaining movie. Sure, it's an hour and a half of advertising for Lego, but if this is the future of marketing, sign me up.

Watch The Lego Movie Online The movie follows Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a normal guy with a normal job and a normal life. As soon as he wakes up, he breaks out the instruction manual. Jumping jacks? Check. $37 coffee? Check. Wave to neighbors? Check. He follows the speed limit, works diligently at his construction job, and every once in a while wonders if there might be more to life than this. One night as he's leaving his worksite he meets a pretty girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), and finds a mysterious object called The Piece of Resistance. The one who finds it, it's been prophesied, is The Special: the smartest, most talented, most interesting person in the world, and the one who will save everyone from President Business (Will Ferrell) and his evil plan. But to do that he needs to ditch the instructions and go freestyle.

Watch The Lego Movie Online It's not exactly breaking new ground — normal guy learns he's special, saves the world — and it does come with a fair amount of heavy-handed preaching about how everyone is special and we can all be anything we want. Like any good family-friendly movie, there's a love story, there are jokes both obvious and subtle, and there's a surprisingly tender third act. But everything about the way The Lego Movie unfolds feels fresh, with Lord and Miller doing their brand-building duty while simultaneously rolling their eyes at it. Where a movie like The Internship is one long bow at the altar of Google, The Lego Movie frequently cuts to awkward scenes where minifigures can’t quite figure out how to hold hands, or the revered ""relics"" that are mostly just gross things you might accidentally find in a box full of Lego bricks. It’s loving throughout, but it’s edgy and self-deprecating enough to never feel contrived.

Watch The Lego Movie Online Everything in the movie from elaborate cities to puffs of smoke is made of Lego, and it's all fair game: at one point Wyldstyle builds a motorcycle out of an alleyway in order to escape Liam Neeson's nefarious Bad Cop. It's this build-and-rebuild ethos that makes the movie go — the movie twists and turns relentlessly and often without any warning, as if there's a kid above acting like King Kong and knocking down the tower he's built before starting over on something different. It's a funny, quirky, weird adventure that has fun with the limitations of Legos while making clear that there's nothing you can't do or make with those interlocking blocks. Including spaceships.

Watch The Lego Movie Online ""I think what we’ve really found is that Lego is a medium,"" Michael McNally, Lego's brand relations director, tells me. ""It’s not a toy, it’s a medium for other people to tell their own stories and create their own adventures."" To tell theirs, Lord and Miller (who wrote and directed 21 Jump Street and the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series) turned to Animal Logic, a well-known Australian effects studio. The result is stunning, a mix of stop-motion and photorealism that left me constantly forgetting and remembering the characters are Lego minifigures with claws for hands and as many personalities as they have outfits.

Watch The Lego Movie Online The world of The Lego Movie is enormous and meticulously detailed, and McNally notes that you could pause the movie at any point and build everything you see. (Lego’s own designers helped Animal Logic with the set and character design.) The film still feels very much like Lord and Miller, though, a constant string of winking references and off-topic pop culture jokes to go with crazy sight gags and physical humor. The cast may be needlessly star-studded — Channing Tatum’s Superman has all of about three lines — but it’s hard to imagine a lesser group pulling off this mix of irreverent and sincere. Will Arnett might be my favorite Batman ever.

It's a movie made for Lego fans of all ages, which McNally reminds me are everywhere: Lego is the second-largest toy maker in the world, and there are even communities of Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL) around the world. ""It’s no different from Volkswagen owners or Apple enthusiasts or Disney fanatics,"" he says. ""We have Lego fans."" He grants that the movie seems designed to encourage and revive interest in Lego (and to sell bricks), but says that wasn't the point. ""A feature film was never really something we set out to make. A lot of people say, ‘Well, toy movies are just designed to sell toys.’ And that’s not something that was compelling to us… it wasn’t like we needed a movie to help us sell more stuff.""

Watch The Lego Movie Online It took more than two years for Warner Bros. to convince McNally and Lego to allow the movie, and more than four more to make it. ""We didn’t have urgency around it,"" McNally says. ""And I think that was maybe not such a bad thing for either party, because it made us all want to work harder to make sure it was the right film."" He says there’s no immediate plan to work on a sequel, though Warner Bros. might have other ideas.

The Lego Movie is one of my favorite animated movies in years, and it left me wondering about that big blue bucket of interlocking squares that’s still in my parents’ house. Suddenly I want to build something."

I have no family and parents that haven't talked to me in years because they are sick people. I learned to love myself from their lack of love, but when my life is on track and something happens, I have no fucking support.

Watch Endless Love Online Like many films about wholly misguided love affairs, consuming obsession, and 
criminal activity involving elephants, ‘Endless Love’ opens with a vaguely creepy voiceover. Apparently meant to be styled as the opening lines to some kind of modern fairy tale, David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) uses the first few moments of Shana Feste’s adaptation to introduce us his very own tower-bound princess, young Jade Butterfield (Gabrielle Wilde), a sensitive enough soul entombed in our own grief (or something like that, it’s hard to tell over Pettyfer’s creepy staring). Set at the pair’s high school graduation, David and the camera both spy on Jade as he vows to do, well, something to get to know her. Charming.

Despite its title, film bears little resemblance to its source material, and only scattered details have been plucked from both the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film and the 1979 Scott Spencer book – including character names, the destructive power of hormones, a lingering weirdness with Jade’s mother, and explosive fire (no, no, not of the hormonal variety). Surprisingly sanitized despite a hefty number of perfume commercial-styled love scenes, ‘Endless Love’ keeps most of the darkness of the novel and first film at bay, resulting in a throwaway romance that’s only memorable because of how tremendously and laughably bad it is.


""""‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad, cringe cinema.""""



Watch Endless Love Online Whereas the original film imagined the Butterfields as free spirits and David as a preppy kid from a wealthy family, Feste’s film flips the script – these bookish Butterfields are profoundly straight-laced (and profoundly wealthy, apparently) and David is from a broken blue-collar home, and his only interests seem to include partying and cars (you know, like any teen boy). Both devastated by and sequestered after her beloved older brother’s death when she was just a sophomore in high school, Jade has spent the remainder of high school studying and hanging out with her parents. It’s certainly a sad story, and, man, does Dead Brother Chris hang over the Butterfield house, but it’s also hard to swallow – did Jade not have friends before? Did no one think to go out of his or her way to be kind to the heartbroken teen? Did no other guy notice that Jade is, to put it mildly, wildly gorgeous? – and instead, we’re forced to believe that Jade has been left alone for two years and is simply bursting for some human contact.



Enthralled by David’s wild manner and bad haircut, Jade falls fast for her new beau, despite lingering concerns from her family, especially her overbearing dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood). Hugh’s wariness is well-founded, because all it takes for Jade to abandon her innocence is precisely one joyride in a filched Maserati, one party crashed by surly teens putting on dance routines (yes), and one truly terrible family dinner. Jade, for all her inhibition and inexperience, beds David in her family home – in an open-doored library with a roaring fire and her family sleeping nearby, making it clear early on that almost nothing about their love story will scan as believable, even as it is wildly and bizarrely amusing to watch. While neither Pettyfer nor Wilde look convincingly like teens (both actors are in their mid-twenties), Wilde does manage to intermittently nail the coltish innocence of Jade.



Watch Endless Love Online As over the top as ‘Endless Love’ is (and, goodness, is this thing over the top), Feste occasionally hits on real emotion and believable reactions – it’s just all obscured by a choking hormonal haze and a dizzying series of increasingly terrible decisions. Hugh’s desire to protect his daughter is entirely understandable given their background, but Feste and Joshua Safran’s script insists on turning his concern into a version of villainy, while also folding in a subplot that makes him look like a real bastard (and, yes, he is a real bastard, but it ultimately has zero to do with his feelings about Jade and David). Similarly, Jade, consumed by her love for David (and, again, the hormones, good God, the hormones) decides to skip out on an internship that is essential to her future career as a doctor just to spend the summer with her new boyfriend.



Make no mistake, ‘Endless Love’ is not a good film, but that doesn’t keep it from being compulsively watchable and deeply (if not accidentally) entertaining. The film is peppered with hammy, head-thumping visual cues (Jade lives in a literally gated house! She is gated up! Free her, David!) and a series of instantly quotable one-liners (few people will be able to resist the charm of David’s father Harry, played by Robert Patrick, screaming at Hugh about the legality of breaking into a zoo). Distilled down to its most basic elements, ‘Endless Love’ is about the battle between mature love and first love, which isn’t a bad thing to form a film around – in its execution, however, ‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad cringe cinema that seems destined to become a new wave cult classic (read: audiences will enjoy laughing at it for many, many years to come)."

Do I try and get better at thinking and coming up with things quick and under pressure or apply for certain jobs where they won't ask too much about situations I found difficult, or just scenarios that I just can't remember for the life of me?

I decided it was time to go to school for something I liked so I went to Tech school for CNC machining.  After only one semester I have been offered an amazing internship and I love what I am doing.  It has just been amazing how fast things can get better if you work hard.

Anyways, I have also always been the fat guy in my group of friends.  Everyone loves me, but the girls would rather go out with my friends over me.  I have had a couple girlfriends that didn't last due to various reasons, so now I am single. My life is in order and its also time to get my body in order. I know if i want to get women to notice me I am going to need to start looking better.

So here is my diet, I have started on Medifast, where i eat 6 small meals a day, 5 medifast meals and 1 that I cook myself that consists of a lean protein and 3 servings of vegetables.  So far I am down 5 lbs from 290 lbs.  In about a week I can start going to the gym.  It will be hard to resist all the crappy foods that I loved to eat, but I finally have the motivation and will power to not give in anymore.

I just wanted to be accountable to Reddit, so Wish me luck."

Lucky for me though, I actually know a few of the people who work at/through the production company from working on sets already, so I think that will help my chances.

I cold-called them about a month ago and the person I was talking to told me to call back in about a month or two before summer asking again, and gave me some pointers on how I could get in. Also, the guy I was talking to had actually heard of me before from someone else who works with them(so I guess that's a good thing, right?). He said it wouldn't hurt to have some of the people there I know vouch for me, so I'm going to try to do that.

But basically, I'm wondering, what else can I do to make myself stand out from others who are applying? I'm going to do everything I possibly can to get this internship."

I'm currently trying to work on deferred rendering and lighting and more complex scenes but I'm a little lost and wondering if I'm actually learning anything. 

Lately it feels like I'm doing less learning and more reinventing the wheel just for the sake of it. Which leads me to my question; How should I continue to learn OpenGL and graphics programming in general? Should I just go ""Oh that looks like a cool effect, how do I implement that?"" or is there a better and more structured way to improve? 

Right now I'm somewhat annoyed as I'm having trouble importing random online models and for things like volume rendering (light,shadow,etc) I'm needing to write something that provides immediate mode which just feels like more stuff in between me and actually doing things. I've also been having issues choosing GUI libraries as I'm having trouble finding something light and easy to integrate that doesn't conflict with any of my other libraries. 

I've found some promising ones, but they either don't work with glfw3, require glu or glload rather than glew or are very large libraries that would require a few weeks to learn and integrate. 

Ideally I'd like to get my skills to the point where I can apply for an internship in computer graphics but I'm not sure what exactly that would require. Should I attempt to create a 3D game as a way to improve my skills? Or would something more dedicated to computer graphics be a better path? What are some things I should focus on learning?

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And so the saga of Thor continues. We first met the mighty Asgardian in 2011, when he was arrogant, impulsive and full of hubris, only learning humility when marooned on earth and surrounded by puny humans.

He ended that film a more measured and mature warrior, which readied him to team up with The Avengers for 2012’s biggest blockbuster, in which he once again helped save our planet from alien invasion. And little over 12 months later he’s back for a third outing, this time in the entertaining if somewhat silly and derivative Thor: The Dark World.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film kicks off with a prologue that finds Thor’s grandfather doing battle with an army of ‘Dark Elves’, led by the menacing Malekith, a seriously angry elf who is hellbent on plunging the world into darkness.

His plan revolves around harnessing the power of ‘The Aether’, which is one of those mysterious destructive forces that films like this need in order to further their plot but
Chris Tilly Says

He fails in his efforts however, but not before sacrificing the majority of his people and sticking himself and a few survivors into hibernation.

Thor’s Gramps meanwhile, on realising that he can’t actually destroy the Aether, instead buries it where no one will be able to find it. Of course, it's found in the first 30 minutes.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Yet while it’s nice to learn about Asgard’s back-story and heritage, time waits for no God, and so we immediately jump forward to the present-day, where Thor’s brother Loki is imprisoned on Asgard following the events of The Avengers, his girlfriend Jane Foster is stuck on earth and wondering where he’s gone and why he didn’t call while said events were taking place, and Thor himself is travelling through the Nine Realms kicking ass and taking names with Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

It’s in these scenes that we first get an inkling as to why Marvel charged Alan Taylor with the task of helming the picture, his ability to stage and shoot a battle – honed while working on Game of Thrones – meaning that Thor: The Dark World has some of the best action sequences yet seen in a superhero movie.

Taylor has a more naturalistic approach than Kenneth Branagh employed on the previous flick, thrusting his camera into the heart of battle so that the fight scenes have a grittiness and muscularity that serve the story well.

But the Warriors soon complete their task, bringing peace to the Realms so that early on in proceedings, The Dark World is suffering from a severe lack of drama and conflict beyond Thor arguing with his Dad about the differences between a king and a man. And standing around with his top off for no apparent reason.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Praise Odin’s beard then that the Convergence is approaching, a beautiful but dangerous cosmic event in which all of the Realms align. And don’t worry if you don’t understand this aspect of the plot, as it’s explained over-and-over again throughout the film.

The event coincides with Malekith waking from his slumber and going after the Aether, putting him on a collision course with Thor on Asgard and Jane on earth. And then Jane on Asgard and Thor on earth. And as worlds align and portals open, the action traverses between these realms and several others on an all-too-regular basis, making for a somewhat schizophrenic viewing experience that at times confuses.

It doesn’t help that Malekith is a pretty weak antagonist, with much of the misery that drives the film’s villain seemingly brought on himself. There’s no doubting that Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but here he’s buried under mountains of prosthetics, and the audience spends so little time with the character that we never get a true sense of who he is or what his motives are.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online And in spite of the fact that the film clocks in just under two hours, it also feels like we don’t spend enough time with Tom Hiddleston’s Loki. In The Avengers he was part of a hugely charismatic ensemble, but when it comes to Thor – where the title character is often the straight man – he’s pretty much the star of the show, and so scenes where he’s not onscreen feel like a wasted opportunity.

Indeed the film kicks up a gear when he and Thor are compelled to join forces, and rather than squabbling with each other – as they have done in previous efforts – their dynamic becomes infinitely more interesting; the film all-the-more fun because of it.

Which is more than can be said for the relationship between Thor and Jane, which may well be the least interesting aspect of the narrative, a potential love triangle between the pair and Lady Sif briefly thrown into the mix before quickly and mercifully being dropped.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Jane’s friendship with intern Darcy does allow Kat Dennings to once again flex her comedic muscles, and more of her one-liners hit the mark here than in the original Thor. Indeed this may rival Iron Man 3 for the title of ‘funniest Marvel movie yet,’ with Chris O’Dowd raising laughs in a couple of brief appearances, Stellan Skarsgard stripping off for a hilariously clothes-free cameo as Dr. Erik Selvig, and Thor’s ‘fish-out-of-water’ shtick still working three films in.

But perhaps the funniest character this time around – albeit unintentionally – is Idris Elba’s Heimdall, the returning Sentinel who possesses the ability to see and hear events in faraway galaxies. Heimdall has one job, which is to guard the gate at Asgard’s Observatory. And yet he fails on that front quite spectacularly in The Dark World, the character’s incompetence making him quite possibly the worst bouncer in the cosmos.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film’s biggest problem is that it fails to take the Thor franchise to the next level however. Post-Avengers, Marvel’s standalone superhero movies have to work doubly hard to make their mark, which the aforementioned Iron Man 3 did by raising the stakes and stripping Tony Stark bare so that you genuinely thought that it might be the end for him.

But Thor: The Dark World feels less like a dramatic escalation and more like bland continuation, the action improved but the story – which was written by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely – unimaginative and uninvolving, at times feeling like it’s been cobbled together from bits of other comic book movies. There’s a huge contrivance involving Jane Foster that’s somewhat unforgivable. And come on guys – Charing Cross to Greenwich on the Tube in three stops? Seriously?

Watch Thor The Dark World Online That said, the film does manage to avoid climaxing with the kind of cliché-ridden city-wide destruction that has become the hallmark of the genre in recent years. East London does take a bit of a battering during the finale, but the film nevertheless finds an alternate route to close out its narrative; one that cleverly combines comedy and action for something approaching a satisfying conclusion."

Watch Endless Love Online Like many films about wholly misguided love affairs, consuming obsession, and criminal activity involving elephants, ‘Endless Love’ opens with a vaguely creepy voiceover. Apparently meant to be styled as the opening lines to some kind of modern fairy tale, David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) uses the first few moments of Shana Feste’s adaptation to introduce us his very own tower-bound princess, young Jade Butterfield (Gabrielle Wilde), a sensitive enough soul entombed in our own grief (or something like that, it’s hard to tell over Pettyfer’s creepy staring). Set at the pair’s high school graduation, David and the camera both spy on Jade as he vows to do, well, something to get to know her. Charming.

Despite its title, film bears little resemblance to its source material, and only scattered details have been plucked from both the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film and the 1979 Scott Spencer book – including character names, the destructive power of hormones, a lingering weirdness with Jade’s mother, and explosive fire (no, no, not of the hormonal variety). Surprisingly sanitized despite a hefty number of perfume commercial-styled love scenes, ‘Endless Love’ keeps most of the darkness of the novel and first film at bay, resulting in a throwaway romance that’s only memorable because of how tremendously and laughably bad it is.


""""‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad, cringe cinema.""""



Watch Endless Love Online Whereas the original film imagined the Butterfields as free spirits and David as a preppy kid from a wealthy family, Feste’s film flips the script – these bookish Butterfields are profoundly straight-laced (and profoundly wealthy, apparently) and David is from a broken blue-collar home, and his only interests seem to include partying and cars (you know, like any teen boy). Both devastated by and sequestered after her beloved older brother’s death when she was just a sophomore in high school, Jade has spent the remainder of high school studying and hanging out with her parents. It’s certainly a sad story, and, man, does Dead Brother Chris hang over the Butterfield house, but it’s also hard to swallow – did Jade not have friends before? Did no one think to go out of his or her way to be kind to the heartbroken teen? Did no other guy notice that Jade is, to put it mildly, wildly gorgeous? – and instead, we’re forced to believe that Jade has been left alone for two years and is simply bursting for some human contact.



Enthralled by David’s wild manner and bad haircut, Jade falls fast for her new beau, despite lingering concerns from her family, especially her overbearing dad Hugh (Bruce Greenwood). Hugh’s wariness is well-founded, because all it takes for Jade to abandon her innocence is precisely one joyride in a filched Maserati, one party crashed by surly teens putting on dance routines (yes), and one truly terrible family dinner. Jade, for all her inhibition and inexperience, beds David in her family home – in an open-doored library with a roaring fire and her family sleeping nearby, making it clear early on that almost nothing about their love story will scan as believable, even as it is wildly and bizarrely amusing to watch. While neither Pettyfer nor Wilde look convincingly like teens (both actors are in their mid-twenties), Wilde does manage to intermittently nail the coltish innocence of Jade.



Watch Endless Love Online As over the top as ‘Endless Love’ is (and, goodness, is this thing over the top), Feste occasionally hits on real emotion and believable reactions – it’s just all obscured by a choking hormonal haze and a dizzying series of increasingly terrible decisions. Hugh’s desire to protect his daughter is entirely understandable given their background, but Feste and Joshua Safran’s script insists on turning his concern into a version of villainy, while also folding in a subplot that makes him look like a real bastard (and, yes, he is a real bastard, but it ultimately has zero to do with his feelings about Jade and David). Similarly, Jade, consumed by her love for David (and, again, the hormones, good God, the hormones) decides to skip out on an internship that is essential to her future career as a doctor just to spend the summer with her new boyfriend.



Make no mistake, ‘Endless Love’ is not a good film, but that doesn’t keep it from being compulsively watchable and deeply (if not accidentally) entertaining. The film is peppered with hammy, head-thumping visual cues (Jade lives in a literally gated house! She is gated up! Free her, David!) and a series of instantly quotable one-liners (few people will be able to resist the charm of David’s father Harry, played by Robert Patrick, screaming at Hugh about the legality of breaking into a zoo). Distilled down to its most basic elements, ‘Endless Love’ is about the battle between mature love and first love, which isn’t a bad thing to form a film around – in its execution, however, ‘Endless Love’ is endlessly embarrassing, unnervingly bad cringe cinema that seems destined to become a new wave cult classic (read: audiences will enjoy laughing at it for many, many years to come)."
1y25u0,2,2014-02-16,Dive Master Internships in the Philippines,MikeHunt716,scuba,https://www.reddit.com/r/scuba/comments/1y25u0/dive_master_internships_in_the_philippines/,"Greetings fellow divers!

I have been lurking on this subreddit ever since I got my PADI Open Water in December 2012.  Well, I think it is safe to say I have been bitten by the scuba bug!  After doing my Open Water, I did my AOW a few weeks later and actually quit my job and moved to Australia for a year to make some scratch in order to buy equipment and do a Dive Master Internship.  

Fast forward to the present, I am a Rescue Diver who has just arrived, like 3 hours ago, in Cebu city, Philippines. 
I’m reaching out to our awesome community here to pick your brains regarding where I should pursue this internship.  I’ve done a fair amount of research and have narrowed it down to three locations in the Cebu area (I’ll worry about dive centers when I get there, although suggestions are welcome).  

The three options are as follows:

1)	 Malapascua – Home to Monad Shoal and frequent Thresher Shark sightings 

2)	Moalboal – Famous for their schools of sardines, turtles, and whale sharks, not to mention a laid back diving community

3)	Alona beach, Panglao Island in Bohol – Amazing coral reefs and similar vibrant diver community

So I’m curious if anyone of you have been to these destinations or if you guys run in circles with others who have.  

As an FYI, I have all my own equipment, perhaps I can get a break on the price of the internship, and I will be in the Philippines until the 23rd of May, roughly 3 months to complete the course. Any and all feedback/suggestions are welcome.  Thanks in advance!

1y2cgo,11,2014-02-16,"30 days, and it feels so good!",sergeant_awesome,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1y2cgo/30_days_and_it_feels_so_good/,"So I'm finally at the 30 day milestone, I guess I've earned myself some bragging rights now. This is the first time in a long time I've gone for 30 days without PMO, and given that I never really counted the days in my previous long streak it could very well be the longest streak I've ever had (I'll make it official at 60 days just to be safe).

A summary of the changes (positive or otherwise) I've noticed:

* I've been getting alot more sleep lately and my sleep schedule isn't out of wack anymore. Likely due to not staying up that extra hour or so to fap.

* I've been turning that pent up frustration into energy that makes me go harder at the gym (pun not intended). As a result I've for the first time in two years started regularly weighing in under 180lbs.

* I'm concentrating more on getting what's important. I'm able to focus a bit better on schoolwork now and I'm on top of the game when it comes to applying for internships.

* I didn't really have social problems before joining NoFap, nor did I feel inconfident around girls. Recently however I've been feeling *even more* confident around them. Now I'm seeming to get a bit more adventurous, and at a Valentine's Day party I danced with a random girl whose name I don't even know and got a kiss out of it (scratch that off the bucket list :P). In other words I was fine talking to women before, but only recently have I actually been able to act on making a move.

* Without watching porn I'm now able to see that there's much more to relationships than just having regular sex with women. I've recently been rejected by a girl but unlike previous instances I've been able to take the rejection positively. This time I'm actively choosing not to ""hate"" her to get over my feelings for her and she's still somewhat friendly towards me. I'm hopeful that at some point we'll be able to put it all behind us and resume a platonic relationship (which I really don't mind having).

* I'm feeling alot more in control of myself and my sexual urges.

Overall I don't think I've gained any ""superpowers"" from NoFap, but I attribute any positive changes to the fact that I'm now taking control over my sexual urges, and its this (so far) success with self control that's making me feel more confident. I've got some ways to go yet still but its been a hell of a ride just reaching this one milestone. Thanks guys and girls for all the support, I wouldn't have been able to get this far without this community!"

About halfway through Endless Love I made the unnerving revelation that this is, in fact, not a movie about young love, first love, or any kind of love. This is a vile and manipulative film about an abnormally malicious father and his unhealthy relationship with his daughter. That it is being sold as the next The Notebook is unsurprising, as director/co-writer Shana Feste’s trite and sappy sophomore effort contains the necessary components to dupe unassuming customers.

There’s a promising edge to the opening of “Endless Love,” which begins with a young man, David (Alex Pettyfer), speaking in voice-over about a young woman, Jade (Gabriella Wilde). It’s a high school graduation somewhere in Atlanta, and as the camera picks Jade out of the celebrating crowd, David reminisces about how he’s been watching her for years. From the way he talks, he seems to have been watching her closely. Closely enough to suggest that he’s been long nurturing a passion, perhaps an obsession — something deep, troubling and real.

The two attractive and compatible teenagers who fall for each other at first sight, Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer); the disapproving father (Bruce Greenwood) and the pragmatic mother (Joely Richardson); the rebellious brother (Rhys Wakefield) who constantly disappoints the patriarch of the family; and the limbo-like summer between high school graduation and college where one’s future appears to be infinite.

Shallow, timorous and unbelievable, alas, end up being more like it. Based on the 1979 Scott Spencer novel of the same tantalizing title (is “endless” a happy vow or a threat?), the movie relates what is meant to be the kind of feverish love that sends people into shudders of ecstasy. This is the love, or should be, of Antony and Cleopatra, Scarlett and Rhett and the couple in the 1950 film noir “Gun Crazy” who look at each other like “wild animals.” This is the love, or should be, that burns, consumes and spurs Friar Laurence to warn Romeo: “These violent delights have violent ends./And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,/Which as they kiss consume.”

All the necessary pieces for a predictable, but sweet love story are in place. Jade is an exquisite beauty – shy and ambitious – with plans to attend Brown and study pre-med (like her father) in the fall. Conversely David (although smart enough to receive a 2020 on his SAT) has no collegiate aspirations, instead deciding to work at his father’s car shop. The two young lovers soon begin a courtship of sorts. They run and scream and dance in the summer wind, laughing and making love as they please. Happiness and excitement is in air as the two embark on the type of whimsical summer most teenagers’ can only dreams of.

This story takes a sour turn after the sunny opening 25-minutes. One problem with this love is that it’s been difficult for filmmakers to translate it to the American screen, which has long been locked in the grip of a stultifying, Eros-killing Puritanism. In a superb film like “Gun Crazy,” which was made under strict industry self-cen6sorship, desire is expressed through innuendo, smoldering looks and the sublimating violence of erotically, ecstatically discharged guns. By contrast, American movies today often roil with orgiastic violence that’s a conspicuous substitute for sexual desire. That partly explains why this “Endless Love” falls so flat, registering as more neutered than even the kitschy 1981 version with Brooke Shields directed by Franco Zeffirelli, now best remembered for those newcomers Tom Cruise and James Spader.


Feste and co-writer Joshua Safran soon decide that Endless Love need not be a romantic film, but a conniving and contrived one. From the get go, Jade’s father Hugh — scarred by the death of his oldest son for years ago — has his qualms with her entangling herself in David. His complaints are reasonable: she’ll be leaving in two weeks for an internship, why bother investing herself in someone so soon before she has to pack up and leave? Moreover Jade has never been romantically involved with anyone prior to David – and so Hugh’s reservations about the whole relationship are natural. Plus, what good father is not at least a little concerned about the entrance of another man in his daughter’s life?

Directed by Shana Feste (“Country Strong”), this new “Endless Love” doesn’t have enough going on to make it memorably terrible: Banality is its gravest sin. Ms. Wilde and Mr. Pettyfer are very pretty (both have worked as models), and they’re certainly pleasant to look at, even if they’re also, often distractingly, too old for their roles. Jade is supposed to be 17 and sheltered, having spent most of her high school years giving comfort to her parents, Hugh and Anne (Bruce Greenwood and Joely Richardson), after the death of a son. Unlike Ms. Shields, whose status as a preternaturally sexualized child star imbued her with an otherworldly, almost celestial air (the celebrity who fell to Earth), the coltish Ms. Wilde mostly just suggests the supermodel next door. Ms. Feste responds accordingly and shoots Jade twirling and running as if she were in a commercial for an exciting new product.

But then the film decides to eschew naturalism and honesty, diluting the situation until it no longer bares any resemblance to reality. Hugh descends from a concerned parent to a nefarious one, hiring a private detective to look into David’s past while constantly being condescending for no legitimate reason. In an attempt to paint this character as some sort of villain, Hugh not only pathologically lies and yells at his family, but succumbs to infidelity. If Feste and Safran’s goal was to make Hugh a robotically diabolic husband and father with no signs of humanity, than they succeeded.

Also baffling is Jade’s turn from virginal high schooler to sexual hedonist. It’s natural for any teenager to be curious in something many of her fellow classmates have already dabbled in, but the malleability of this character lacks any sort of verisimilitude. One-minute an introverted, taciturn daddy’s daughter, the next a borderline nymphomaniac who disrespects her parents, investing her entire self into a boy she just met.

Of course the two run into some complications, as all relationships do. Their love, however, is not hindered by the standard problems of monogamy (geography, intimacy, compatibility, etc), but class. The Butterfields exist in the bourgeois, Elliot’s the proletariat. This non-issue is, like all elements of the film, manufactured to create tension where there is none. Think “Romeo &amp; Juliet” but written by someone who read Shakespeare’s opus briskly and carelessly.

Falling in and out of love is a cyclical cycle most of us continue (and will continue) to endure throughout our lifetime. I mention this because finding and maintaining a romance is an arduous undertaking — one that doesn’t need to be exacerbated by watching a shallow, regressive, and repulsive movie like Endless Love. This is not a film about love, and all the joy, pain and heartbreak that comes along with it; but it sure does feel endless."

I am in the process of applying for, and interviewing for different internship positions for the upcoming summer, and because of this have decided to take an indefinite break from partoking in the trees. Have you guys/gals found that many internship positions will drug test? And if so, when did they test you? Was it right after the interview or right before you start working? 

Second question I have is, what is the best way to store my dank until after my internship hunting smoking break? I currently have an O of some delicious blue cheese, and would like to keep it as fresh as possible. At the moment it is in a ziplock bag inside of a mason jar. Does anyone have any other suggestions to keep it fresh?

Thanks everyone!"

Don't get me wrong, all people suck, just some find excuses with their weight. Anyway this is a story that dates back to the summer of 2008. I was back home from my first year in college to start my first summer internship at a large tech company. I was always on the heavier side (5'6"" and 170ish) about mid summer I stepped on a scale and noticed 190lbs, so I went for a walk over one of the bridges. As I was getting back to my car a rather large man stopped me and wanted to chat. He said that it was good that I was starting an exercise routine then before my weight got too out of control like it did for him. He too worked at one of the rival tech firms for over 25 years. And in that time of having a static lifestyle he doubled his weight to over 300 and some sort of disease associated. 
6 years later and now full time writing software I use this encounter as motivation to never let my job get in the way of a healthy life. I wish him the best,whatever may have happened to him and a thankyou for showing me a possible outcome of my future.
For those curious, I'm at 145 and have never felt better."

I'm currently a hardware engineering student at uOttawa and I'm looking for an internship for this summer. I'm in third year and have a lot of academic and out of school experience. I thought I'd try this neat sub, it seems like it could be very useful!

If anyone knows a place that's currently looking for interns for the summer, I'd love to hear about them. Thanks! "
1y3l24,4,2014-02-16,I lied about my college major and wasted a good portion of my life.,temp_account_confess,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1y3l24/i_lied_about_my_college_major_and_wasted_a_good/,"I graduated from college almost a decade ago and lied about what I majored in.  There was a major I had wanted to pursue for most of my life, but I did terrible in a required class for this major.  I even took the class three times and withdraw every single time.  I was doing better the final time, but I dropped it because I was already a senior and the other classes were taking too much of my time.  At this point in time, I could only hope for this to be a minor, instead of a major.

I decided to settle for a different major and two minors.  I was not thrilled about the major and really preferred the two minors.  I decided that after spending so much time in  a somewhat prestigious college, that I might as well get a degree in something.  I told my parents, and others, that I was double majoring, instead of telling them that I had changed my major.

I got very depressed in college and after graduating I went to work for my father.  I have always hated working there, but I basically had no other choice.  I have always kept to myself and I have never been much of a people person.  I never got an internship in college.  I always spent the summers working for my father.  I have only had two short four day breaks since the last major one almost twenty years ago.  I had these because I was physically ill and could not work.

I have been so depressed after college that I would spend a lot of my free time just buying things and not saving a dime.  I ended up spending more than I had, so I racked up massive credit card debt.

So now I was a freaking liar, broke, and an all-around loser.

In the past couple of years, I guess I kind of woke up a little, and started to pay down my credit card debt.  Right now my debt is the lowest it has been in years and I just transferred the highest interest debt into lower interest credit cards.  I also started to take my student loans more seriously and finished paying two of them last month.

I have also decided to try and learn what I really wanted to in college, but on my own.  I want to do this through online readings and exercises, and by reading books.

I have been cutting down on my TV watching to around three hours per week and only on the weekends.  I have also been spending time in /r/GetMotivated/, /r/GetDisciplined/, /r/NoFap/, and other subreddits, but the first three are my favorite.  I have also been reading and watching Jim Rohn, James Altucher, Tony Robbins, and others.

I am not being very detailed and created this account just for this confession.  I am very grateful for anyone that read this and wish you well."
1y3pt0,1077,2014-02-16,"UPDATE on Tennessee bill to PROTECT E-Cigs &amp; vapor products from tobacco taxation &amp; regulation!! (PLEASE UPVOTE for visibility, &amp; READ!! THIS BILL NEEDS OUR HELP!!)",btq,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1y3pt0/update_on_tennessee_bill_to_protect_ecigs_vapor/,"###HISTORY &amp; GENERAL INFORMATION

Here's my [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/1winbf/any_tennesseans_here_theres_a_bill_going_through/) on the bill.

Here's a [summary of HB 1461](http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/billinfo/BillSummaryArchive.aspx?BillNumber=HB1461&amp;ga=108).

The bill's [main page](http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB1461&amp;ga=108) with more information, such as where it is in the TN General Assembly and a link to the bill's full text.

[CASAA's ""Call to Action"" page](http://blog.casaa.org/2014/02/call-to-action-support-tennessee-bill.html) to SUPPORT this legislation.

###WHAT'S NEW

The TN Department of Health (Read: Governor's Office) apparently [has some concerns](http://knoxblogs.com/humphreyhill/2014/02/13/state-department-health-frets-electronic-cigarettes/) about ecigs and, more importantly, HB 1461 to PROTECT and define ""vapor products"" so they can NOT be regulated and taxed like tobacco products.

 - [TN DOH's Official ""Health Advisory""](http://health.state.tn.us/downloads/PHA_ElectronicTobacco.pdf) - *A bunch of hyperbolic, ""slipper slope"" fear mongering; Citing outdated, inconclusive studies.* 

Earlier this month, the sponsor of the bill rescheduled it to be heard next week, in order to hopefully ""work out the kinks"", if you will, with the TN DOH et al in the meantime. HB 1461 is back on the schedule for the House Finance, Ways and Means Subcommittee next Wednesday (12/19/2014) at 10:30am.

The TN DOH (Governor) coming out ""against"" this bill is certainly another, fairly large, hurdle for it becoming law. But it does **NOT** make it impossible for this bill to pass. Do not give up! He hasn't said it's something he would consider a veto for, so there's no reason to think he wouldn't sign it, if indeed the General Assembly did pass it. 

**This can *absolutely* still pass.** But it has a long way to go, and the more we  do to show our support, the better the chances.

###HOW YOU CAN HELP

*(I'd love support from anyone and everyone on this. But* ***I am only encouraging those living in TN to make contact.*** *These are State Legislators we're dealing with, &amp; they only care about the interests of their constituents. It may frustrate them to receive a bunch of out-of-state calls &amp; emails.)*
-

1. **Contact members of the Subcommittee and voice your support!!**

    **First thing's first** - These members, listed below, will be the first in the General Assembly to vote on HB 1461. If it doesn't make it out of this meeting, it dies. This is where the battle begins.

    Representative's Name | Phone Number | Email Address
:---- | :---- | :-----:
Mike Harrison - Chairman | (615) 741-7480 | rep.mike.harrison@capitol.tn.gov
David Alexander | (615) 741-8695 | rep.david.alexander@capitol.tn.gov
Joe Armstrong | (615) 741-0768 | rep.joe.armstrong@capitol.tn.gov
Kevin Brooks | (615) 741-1350 | rep.kevin.brooks@capitol.tn.gov
Karen Camper | (615) 741-1898 | rep.karen.camper@capitol.tn.gov
Craig Fitzhugh | (615) 741-2134 | rep.craig.fitzhugh@capitol.tn.gov
David Hawk | (615) 741-7482 | rep.david.hawk@capitol.tn.gov
Gerald McCormick | (615) 741-2548 | rep.gerald.mccormick@capitol.tn.gov
Steve McDaniel (Bill's Sponsor) | (615) 741-0750 | rep.steve.mcdaniel@capitol.tn.gov
Gary Odom | (615) 741-4410 | rep.gary.odom@capitol.tn.gov
Dennis Roach | (615) 741-2534 | rep.dennis.roach@capitol.tn.gov
Charles Sargent | (615) 741-6808 | rep.charles.sargent@capitol.tn.gov

    (NOTE: The General Assembly is CLOSED on Monday, 12/17/2014, for President's Day. So don't expect an answer that day, but you can always leave a message. If you want to talk to someone, call Tuesday at the earliest.)
-

2. **Contact YOUR representative!**
 - Find your legislator [here](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/legislators/).
 - Right now, the most important members to contact are the committee members listed above, and you do NOT need to be their constituent to voice your support and help this bill pass. (Though it would help if you were) But it ***NEVER*** hurts to be in touch with your representatives and voice your opinion on legislation moving through the General Assembly.

3. **Come to the meeting in person!!**
 - With this being such short notice, it being so early in the fight for this bill, and understanding that people have a lot going on and can't drop everything to come to Nashville, I'm not pushing this. Not for this first meeting at least. 
 - If you can make it happen, awesome! It's certainly encouraged. If not, please show your support by the other methods listed. 
 - However, **please consider coming to Nashville in the future** if you can make it. This bill will have many more appearances in committee meetings if it passes on Wednesday. It will give you a chance to talk to members of each committee it has to go through, as well as YOUR representative. Plus, Nashville is an ***AWESOME*** city anyway! 

##Pointers for Phone Calls and Emails:

- **BE POLITE** - *If calling, you'll probably be talking to an assistant or intern. They aren't elected &amp; don't have a vote on the bill. Being an asshole only ensures your message isn't delivered &amp; makes them bitter toward other calls on the subject. So be kind.*

-  **BE CONCISE** - *These guys have a lot to do in a single day. Don't ramble. Nothing annoys them more than people who call or email &amp; blabber on incoherently with no end in sight.*

- **TELL YOUR STORY** ***(The 2 previous points still apply. Keep them in mind.)*** - *This is more for emails* ***OR*** *if you actually get a Rep on the phone, which isn't likely, but possible. (Doesn't hurt to ask if they're available to talk.) If E-Cigs have positively affected your life, tell them how. If you're knowledgable on the subject, answer any questions they may have. If they engage you, try to politely educate them about the positive benefits, and about the misinformation they may have been subjected to.*

- **LEAVE CONTACT INFO** - *Whether calling or emailing, leave your name, home address, phone number, email address, etc. This lets them know you're a constituent of their state, gives them a way to contact you if they have questions, and makes you seem more trustworthy; which is what we need: their trust.*

- **SUPPORT HB1461 By McDaniel** - *Most importantly, tell them to vote* **YES** *on HB 1461.*

##Pointers for coming in person:

 - **ALL ABOVE POINTERS APPLY** - *Be polite. Don't act crazy, rude, etc. Make a good impression and be a model citizen. We want these people to like us.*

 - **DRESS NICELY** - *This isn't a requirement, of course. If you don't own a suit, coat &amp; tie, or nice dress or something, don't let that stop you from coming. But if you* ***do*** *own something of the sort, I would highly recommend it. The Representatives, Senators, and employees have to dress nicely while there, and it makes a good impression on all of them if you are respecting the Capitol and don't look like a slob.* 

 - **DO NOT VAPE INDOORS OR IN THE COMMITTEE ROOMS** - *So help me god, I will slap someone if I see this. Many, if not most, of these members know absolutely nothing about ecigs or vapor. If they see a bunch of people vaping in the halls or committee rooms they will probably think you're smoking, find you disrespectful, and loath all of us as a result. This is a bad thing. Don't be that guy. Take it outside.*

###CLOSING

We, as a state, have a unique opportunity here, to create precedent for other states for the protection of the vaping community and industry. This bill is truly exciting and makes me extremely proud of Tennessee and of our Representatives.

**BUT IT NEEDS OUR HELP!!** I talked to some members of the committee after I made my last post, and asked if they'd gotten any phone calls or emails in support of HB 1461. They all said they hadn't. I know some of you said you intended to reach out, and I'm sure many of you did, but we **MUST REMAIN ACTIVE** to help this bill get momentum. Let your voices be heard. Make phone calls, write emails, and if you can, arrange meetings!! And do it all more than once! The more calls we make, the more emails we write, the more meetings we attend, the more they pay attention to our cause and learn about this wonderful product that has kept me off cigarettes for nearly a year. 

As I've said many times, this bill has a long way to go. But if we blow it off now, saying to ourselves ""I'll wait and see if it gets through this first hurdle, then I'll get active"" or if we make the effort now, then think ""Well I've done my part, it's up to someone else to make calls as the bill moves forward"" we'll be taking the wrong approach and using a losing strategy and thought process. 

**We have to get active now, and stay active!**

###P.S. - Just a few more things:

 - If you missed the link above, check out [CASAA](http://blog.casaa.org/2014/02/call-to-action-support-tennessee-bill.html)'s Call to Action for more info and pointers on how to show support! 

 - If you want to thank the members who are sponsoring HB 1461, and ask them to make it a priority:
    - [Steve McDaniel](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/members/h72.html) is the prime sponsor, 
    - [Charles Sargent](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/members/h61.html) and 
    - [Judd Matheny](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/members/h47.html) are cosponsors.

 - Oh, and don't mention reddit, or this post, if you do call or email. Just be an informed citizen participating in their democracy.

1y3wig,1,2014-02-16,How important is listing your education in online dating?,fivefootseven,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1y3wig/how_important_is_listing_your_education_in_online/,"I'm a Software Engineer that never finished my final year of college. My GPA was awesome and I had made Dean's List a few times, but before my final year started I received an awesome internship which turned into a job almost 1,000 miles away. I was making above market value for my job and have since transitioned closer to home at a better position, still living the dream.

If someone asks me about it in person (ie. ""What college did you go to?""), I tell them the truth and they are usually more impressed than bothered by it. However, I don't know how to convey this sort of thing in an online dating profile. I usually leave education and income blank, but I can see this might turn some people off. I also don't want to outright list the story in my profile because I don't want it to come off as insecurity or bragging, because I really don't feel that way. Also, some dating profiles require you to list an education--if I choose ""some college"" or something along those lines, it looks really bad, doesn't it?

**tl;dr: What is the best way to display my education in online dating profiles?**"
1y4dx9,1,2014-02-17,I have an interview coming up with my previous employer. What questions should I ask?,Browngrocerybag,business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1y4dx9/i_have_an_interview_coming_up_with_my_previous/,"Background:

Two years ago I was a part of a massive layoff in a start up company where 50% of the employees were let go. I was one, if not the top performer in my group, but was the only one let go because I had the least amount of work experience. I was just out of school with only an internship for job experience, while all the others had at least 2 years of work experience plus a bachelors or a masters.

I was employed by a much  bigger company two months later. Now, my old team members would like me back and we have a long phone interview coming up. I am considering it because I really enjoyed working with nearly all of my coworkers there and had many friends at work. My old team members are very good friends of mine and I would not mind working with them again.

What important questions should I ask? 

Thanks.

I have technical experience. I spent last summer in San Diego working as a backend server intern for a travel agency data consolidation company.

I served on the Presidential Selection Committee, which has the honor of screening possible presidential candidates. I am an Eagle Scout. I will walk first at graduation because I am the Senior Co-Governor, and announce the class gift, which I have been working all year to fundraise for.

Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption”

Episode Synopsis: Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption” – When some of Gabe’s (Sendhil Ramamurthy) acquaintances go missing, Cat (Kristin Kreuk) and Vincent (Jay Ryan) must come together to save them. Vincent ends up returning to the hospital where he was an intern, allowing him to see what his life could have been.

Detective Catherine Chandler is a smart, no-nonsense homicide detective. Several years earlier, Catherine witnessed the murder of her mother at the hands of two gunmen. Catherine would have been killed too, but someone – or something – saved her. No one has ever believed her, but she knows it wasn’t an animal that attacked the assassins…it was human. Years have passed, and Catherine is a strong, confident, capable police officer, working alongside her equally talented partner, Tess. While investigating a murder, Catherine discovers a clue that leads her to a handsome doctor named Vincent Keller, who was reportedly killed by enemy fire while serving in Afghanistan in 2002. 

Catherine learns that Vincent is actually still alive and that it was he who saved her many years before. For mysterious reasons that have forced him to live outside of traditional society, Vincent has been in hiding for the past 10 years to guard his secret – when he is enraged, he becomes a terrifying beast, unable to control his super-strength and heightened senses. Catherine agrees to protect his identity in return for any insight he may have into her mother’s murder. Thus begins a complex relationship between Catherine and Vincent, who are powerfully drawn to each other yet understand that their connection is extremely dangerous for both of them.

The series stars Kristin Kreuk (“Smallville,” “Chuck”) as Catherine, Jay Ryan (“Terra Nova”) as Vincent, Max Brown (“The Tudors,” “MI-5″) as Evan, Nina Lisandrello (“Nurse Jackie”) as Tess, Nicole Gale Anderson (“Make It or Break It”) as Heather, Austin Basis (“Life Unexpected”) as J.T., and Brian White (“The Shield,” “The Cabin in the Woods”) as Joe. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is from CBS Television Studios with executive producers Jennifer Levin (“Without A Trace,” “Felicity”), Sherri Cooper (“Brothers and Sisters”), Bill Haber (“Rizzoli &amp; Isles,” “Thurgood”), Paul J. Witt (“A Better Life”) &amp; Tony Thomas (“A Better Life”), Ron Koslow (“Moonlight”) and Gary Fleder (“Life Unexpected”).

1y4t3i,1,2014-02-17,Young Adult. Need advice. Reposting from /r/Advice.,HighJarlSoulblighter,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y4t3i/young_adult_need_advice_reposting_from_radvice/,"So, I've got problems and I'm pretty sure we all do. Anyways, I'll try not to sound like a whiny bitch.


I never enjoyed learning. I don't know how it initially started, but the school environment and the process of learning is a real drag for me. Is this a common thing? I'm in college and I don't even like what I'm learning. I haven't gotten into the higher level classes specifically for my major yet since I'm still taking care of some requirements.


I originally wanted to a science/engineering major, but I don't have the problem solving intelligence and motivation to get through the science and math classes. Also, there is a severe lack of interest in these gen ed courses. I enjoy solving puzzles and eventually solving math problems once I get the hang of it, but the problem is getTING the hang of it. I hate sitting down and nailing down these processes into my head. It's not just the STEM courses, it's literally every class. The act of doing it just takes so much out of me. I try to understand these concepts, but I just don't get it and I end up wasting my time.


I'm wasting my college experience and I just don't know what I want to do. I never wanted to come to college in the first place. I used to be a good student in grade school, but depression put quite a dent into my life. It's probably the main reason why I have an aversion to math and science courses now. My depression made it difficult for me to put the time and effort required to succeed in these classes in middle and high school; now I can never enjoy them like I used to. I'm still feeling the after effects but it's much better than before.


I feel outclassed by the people around me even though I know that I'm smart and can compete with them, but I'm not putting in the effort. I'm not absorbing all of the information so I end up playing on game day with half the equipment I need. I don't enjoy the challenge of these difficult courses since they require so much work to stay afloat.


I don't enjoy playing video games anymore; I haven't for years now yet I still do. That's what it feels like a lot these days. I don't enjoy doing it, but I do it anyways. Is this how life is? That's what it seems like when I observe my parents.


I don't like my family. There were a lot of arguments that I overheard while growing up. There would be multiple ones a day when I was young and continue on until I began high school. Then, they started to die down in frequency. Also the same time when the arguments began focusing on me. The first year of high school wasn't so bad compared to all the other years of my life. The previous years of my life sucked. The gist of it is that I was picked on a lot (kids are dicks, I'm pretty sure everyone experienced this) and school basically sucked. Especially middle school. I would say that my depression began around the middle of 6th grade due to a lot of reasons. Mainly because school sucked and family life at home wasn't so hot either. I was basically stuck in a rock and a hard place, feeling like I had no where to hide.


The basic gist of my schooling experience is that I felt forced into many things by peer pressure such as sports teams. There was a colossal fuck up in sophomore year that would screw me over to this day. I had chem after lunch and half the week it would be a double period for double the fun, especially since I could barely stay awake on a full stomach. I joined the swimming team, sucked at it (literally worst ""swimmer"" on the team"" and continued to lift weights. Went to China over winter break (for the first time in my life, to my grandmother's funeral, who I barely knew) and had bad jetlag that wouldn't be fixed until I started college. So I ended up over-trained, sleep deprived, and full of suicidal thoughts. Junior was worse than that. Senior year was better, but still bad.


I would begin to argue back at my parents in high school. Since I didn't tell my parents any of my problems, there was a huge gap in understanding and treatment (there was none). I felt that I couldn't tell my parents anything since I was ashamed of my problems and they weren't people you would open up to. I felt alienated. I always had social anxiety and was shy. It was difficult for me to make friends , especially after moving a couple times. All I felt that I could do was endure. I made empty promises that I would try harder and everything would be okay. That's all I could hope for. I would learn to hate hope since it prolonged my existence in this hell. I'm not saying that I lived in North Korean-esque conditions, but it felt pretty bad to me.
My parents would call me worthless and lazy when I didn't study. I played video games to help me get away from the problems at school and home, but my parents made that nearly impossible. I felt like the Gestapo were after me so I cold never enjoy video games. They still do this to me today, but are much more lenient. If they ever caught a glimpse of me playing, they would go into a raging fit. All I wanted to do was escape from my reality.


My mom would always act like she wasn't the problem. Everyone in my family has a problem with her. I feel sorry that she had to go through some difficult times with my dad in their early years, but she keeps bringing them up. She would always talk about how bad my dad is, how much of a piece of shit he is. Ever since I could hear, she began talking about him in that manner. She still does to this day. Maybe she's a narcissist. She always believes that she could do no wrong.
My dad is very well educated and hard working. Both my parents are. My dad should never have been a father, my mother either. My dad isn't close to my sister and I, he has always been that person who went to work early and came back late. He has always been that person who spanked me and I feared him because of it. I feared him for all my life until high school. I wished my parents never had me or at least they should have been divorced a long time ago. It's funny how I feel like my problems in high school have brought them closer together. I don't know if there are other problems between them that they aren't sharing, but I guess that isn't my business.


After high school, I didn't want to go to college. In fact, I don't even have my driving license. Mostly because, what's the point of learning if I'm going to die soon anyways? That was my mentality for a long time and I've paid for it. Anyways, I still feel like going to college was a wrong move for me. The only reason I'm still in is because I don't know what else to do. I tried convincing my parents to let me join the military but they think that I'm not mentally equipped to do it. That reason pissed me off since most of my anger and tantrums were focused on them. It nearly drove me insane as to how skewed their perspective of me was. Well, I didn't join the military and I hoped that college would be better. I would later find out that my dad's job pays for all of my tuition if I stay in for four continuous years and higher degrees, up to a point.


College is okay. It's better than the rest of my life, but still feels wrong. I don't like what I'm learning, I don't like the process of learning. I tried for so long to want to learn, but there is a mental block. I failed Calc I twice in college. I took calc in high school and did very well. I've got the intelligence to succeed, just not the heart.
I would quickly develop a crush for this cute brunette in college, mainly because she was the one who started getting interested in me first. We would look at each other across the room, but I would never do anything. We don't know each other. It's been over a year now. I feel like shit since I didn't do anything about it. I think she gave up on me last semester. I didn't make a move because I was afraid that my mental problems would hurt her. I knew that I hated myself and I tried fixing it. I hate myself even more now, but at this point I just don't know anymore. My life is a mess. I don't even go after what I want most.


Should I just suck it up and get through college? I really want to take a break and I know that it's hard to come back. I've always hated school and I need a disconnect with all the negativity of school that I have. I don't even have any valuable life experience. I never had a job, never really traveled anywhere. I want to get away from all of this. I feel trapped in my situation. I would be throwing away a paid education, but what's the point if I don't even pass?


I want to get away from my family forever. I'm not close to them at all. My parents have tried to reconnect with me ever since I began college. In fact, they started talking to me more when I began college than when I lived at home with them. My dad hugged me for the first time ever at the end of freshman year last year. I remember when I was around five and he didn't let me get hugged anymore since it was time to become a man. My mom is still crazy-ish, but trying to reconnect. She hasn't changed though. She's just delusioned enough to think that I have ""improved"". I barely talk to my sister. In fact, she texted me last night telling me that I should start looking for internships. Her birthday was over a week ago and my family celebrated it at home this past weekend. I didn't go due to a weather. My parents think that my life is turning around and seem proud. It makes me sad that they are actually proud of me for the first time in my life. I'm not talking about proud as in getting an A on a test in grade school. I'm talking about actual pride in them seeing me becoming a man.


I don't see myself staying connected with my family. I barely stay connected with my close friends. The only reason we're friends is because we do a lot of gaming together. That has been barely enjoyable for years now. They are close friends, but I don't feel like I could open up to them. I'm someone different to them than who I feel like I really am. I want a restart."

Episode Name: Redemption

Air date: 2/17/2014

Summary:
When some of Gabe's acquaintances go missing, Cat and Vincent must come together to save them. Vincent ends up returning to the hospital where he was an intern, allowing him to see what his life could have been.

Main cast :
    Kristin Kreuk as Catherine Chandler: As a teenager, she witnessed her mother's murder and was saved by a mysterious creature (Vincent). After her mother's death, Catherine set aside her ambition to become a lawyer and sought a career as a homicide detective with the NYPD.

    Jay Ryan as Vincent Keller: A former doctor who enlisted after his two brothers died in the September 11 attacks; while in Afghanistan, he was part of an experimental unit of soldiers who were subjects in a supersoldier program that was terminated. He is the only known survivor following the termination of members of his unit with extreme prejudice. Vincent's DNA was mutated and he developed the ability to transform into a creature very human-like in appearance but with a beastly mind; he turns into the creature whenever he is distressed. He checked in on Catherine once a year after her mother's murder, and went on to protect her in his beastly form many times, often inadvertently leaving behind DNA evidence.

    Max Brown as Dr. Evan Marks (episodes 1–18): Police morgue medical examiner who worked with Catherine and had a flirtatious relationship with her. Evan worked with Muirfield to capture Vincent.

    Austin Basis as J.T. Forbes: Vincent's childhood friend and a professor at a university in New York. He hid Vincent from the men who have been hunting him for a decade.

    Nina Lisandrello as Tess Vargas: Catherine's partner and closest friend who eventually discovers and reluctantly agrees to keep Vincent's secret. She had an affair with her boss, Joe Bishop.

    Brian White as Joe Bishop (season 1): Catherine and Tess's former commanding officer. He cheated on his wife with Tess. He is eventually fired for his vendetta against his brother's killer, which distracted him from his job. Originally credited in a guest role, the character was promoted to series regular by the second episode. In the series' second season premiere it was announced that the character of Joe Bishop lost his job as commanding officer, and actor Brian White's name was removed from the show's credits."
1y58wk,4,2014-02-17,"My [23M] girlfriend [21] of 5 months, wants to go travelling for a year and I am struggling to deal with it!",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1y58wk/my_23m_girlfriend_21_of_5_months_wants_to_go/,"A bit of background: When I met my girlfriend, she always talked about how she was going to go travelling after we finish our internships. Since then we have fallen hard for each other and have been living together since we started seeing each other. Because of this, she told me she was reconsidering going travelling in order to wait for me to finish my studies (a further 8-9 months).

Recently, however, she has changed her mind again and wants to go as soon as we finish in the summer- when I go back to university. The reasons for this are: she does not want to hang around doing nothing while she waits for me, and she wants to experience travelling solo (which I recommended!!) Neither of us want to break up and she says she will come back for a brief spell at some point but I am really struggling to deal with this. 

We have spoken a lot and she knows how I feel but it's not fair to talk her out of it. How do I know we will last through this? How can I accept it and deal with paranoid thoughts of jealousy? What do I do??

TL;DR; I really don't know how to deal with my emotions regarding my girlfriend leaving me to travel around the world

1y5ctz,1,2014-02-17,Say the words and Ill starve and stay,OkayWhiteShark,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y5ctz/say_the_words_and_ill_starve_and_stay/,"My entire life all I ever wanted to do was make movies. It was my dream and my passion for my entire life. And then I decided to move away from home and go to film school. 

I thought that it would be full of imaginative, passionate, and inspired people. Instead it was full of some of the most hateful and bitter people I've ever met. Especially the teachers. I didn't understand at all.

But last Nov. I graduated and now I understand. What was my dream has now turned into something I regret. The film industry is full of hateful and bitter people. And everyone on the lower end of the totem pole is willing to lie, cheat, steal, and sleep their way just to get a little bit further.

And now because I followed my dream I'm starving and would be homeless if it wasn't for some amazing friends.

But thats not the point of this post. The point of this post is my ex. Last August we broke up because my former room mate and his now wife put a wedge between us. It wasn't a messy break up at all. We both knew it was time, but we also knew if that wedge hadn't been put there then we would still be together. We both just needed time to heal.

And after months of waiting, heartbreak, just wishing she would look my direction, we've now reconciled and she told me she always loved me.

But we've decided to not get back together yet because she's at work and school everyday but Sundays. And me, well obviously I don't have a job.

And now I have a choice. 

My old boss back where I came from is trying to get me a job with his company. I was an intern there before I moved and everyone loved me. The higher ups all have given the thumbs, they're just waiting for the paper work to go through.

It would solve all my financial needs, I would have a roof over my head (The family I'm staying with and I decided I need to be out by March 1), and I would have something stable thats somewhat in my field.

But that doesn't matter to me. Even though I'm starving and I'm on the brink of being homeless, if she would just say ""Stay"" I would stay. I would risk it all and throw everything away. Because she's worth it and because there is no one on this earth that I have ever loved as much.

Say the words and Ill starve and stay."
1y5fvl,1,2014-02-17,[For Hire] 2014 CS Grad Looking for Sales Engineering / Product Management / Account Management / Anything! Can go anywhere!,[deleted],SFBayJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayJobs/comments/1y5fvl/for_hire_2014_cs_grad_looking_for_sales/,"Hi! I really appreciate you looking at this!

I'm 21, based out of Ohio, and I'm looking to pack up my things and join your company!

I will be graduating in May with a B.A. in Computer Science from Denison University, a small, private Liberal Arts college. I am completely open to working / training for you before that happens.  

*I am passionate about technology*, and I would love to join a company who shares this passion. Another passion of mine is being able to take really complex things, and explain them in layman's terms. This is why I'm primarily looking at Sales Engineering, as I would love to be able to travel with a sales team and be able to talk in depth about the technical aspects of a product. I feel that I could also do very well in sales, but I understand that my lack of any formal experience in sales doesn't help that claim. While I am a CS major, I don't feel that my calling is in development. While the mental puzzles offered by coding do intellectually stimulate me, I don't feel that I could be serve your company by sitting at a terminal all day crunching code. 

**About me:**  

I have technical experience. I spent last summer in San Diego working as a backend server intern for a travel agency data consolidation company. I mostly worked with SQL, and the data analysis was done with Crystal Reporting. In my computer science courses, I have learned C++ and Python, with some minor experience in C, Java, and Ruby. I have set up a few websites, and I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Ruby on Rails. 

I have extensive leadership experience. For example, I was the Vice President of the student body, and have served on the student government for all 4 years. I served on the Presidential Selection Committee, which has the honor of screening possible presidential candidates. I am an Eagle Scout. I will walk first at graduation because I am the Senior Co-Governor, and announce the class gift, which I have been working all year to fundraise for. I started my own organization on campus, whose mission it was to foster interpersonal relationships between students, and create a campus culture of respect and appreciation. I am a proud member of Beta Theta Pi, of which I served as the secretary. I was just nominated for the Distinguished Leadership Award, which is given to less than 30 graduating seniors for their accomplishments on campus. 

I am a very creative person. I work on campus in the media lab, where I tutor students on creative applications such as Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, and Logic. I actively read and write. I am very involved in my community. The summer after my sophomore year I spent in service, counseling juvenile delinquents in a restorative justice program centered around a community garden. 

I am ready and excited to work for you. I value work ethic and I value the relationships I form. I can relocate to anywhere you are based. I value professional mannerism, but I feel that I can liven up any office. 

Thank you so very much for looking at my posting. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me via pm and I can send you my resume. 

Thank you!"

I have been a 3D graphic designer for the past 5 years, and since I started my career it has been a struggle to get jobs. Things that graphic designers has been more and more confronted recently, from long internship to tests or unpayed jobs. Like most of us I got skills and knowledge, surely not the best in the world but I think I'm highly capable to deliver a good job. My career has been a bit chaotic, worked for video game, architects, interior design, communication agencies and recently contemporary artist ( I know, amazing they do 3D ). So here I'm with my 5 years of experience in 3DSMAX, VRAY, Photoshop etc... and that big question which is:

Is 3D graphic design worth all the sacrifices I done? Or should I reorientate my career? If yes what are the options?

Bonus questions: Maybe I done something wrong like choice of software ? Best country to work? Well any tips that made your life easier as a 3D graphic designer are welcome.

Thank you for reading me."

1y5z2r,0,2014-02-17,"Got denied by a Chase credit card, is this common?",GreyMatter22,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1y5z2r/got_denied_by_a_chase_credit_card_is_this_common/,"I was in FutureShop all set to buy a MacBook Pro, went to issue my FutureShop's Card by Chase so that I could purchase the laptop in installments, but I got denied by Chase.

Called my bank to see what's up first, the person on the line looked at my credit history and assured that it is in good standing, however the representative on Chase told me that ''*my credit history isn't high enough*''.

I'll now head over to get my credit scores from the bureaus, however the folks at FutureShop and BestBuy told me that Chase denying people is actually very common, so I shouldn't be worried about, and is most probably to do with the fact that I am a student than anything else.

Is the notion true? Is it common that students and even others get denied by Chase, or is something with my history?

Also, is there any way I could get the laptop in installments?  As paying all of it upfront from student me isn't ideal.

Sorry if this question might not fit here.

EDIT: Just to be clear, I can buy the laptop, but installments would be easier to maintain my cash flow, and the fact that I can work an internship for the summers, so that would give me a financial boost and a smoother cash flow, that was my thinking. Yes, if I did not have the money, I would be relying on my current 6 year old $250 desktop, which is almost done, lol."
1y6srp,7,2014-02-17,There's a kid sleeping on my couch.,TheAngerOfPanger,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y6srp/theres_a_kid_sleeping_on_my_couch/,"Ok, listen to me for just a second. This has the potential to get long, so turn back now if you don't want to read it. I understand. 

K has been...an acquaintance. I hesitate to call him a friend or an enemy, because he is neither. I don't like him, I in fact quite dislike him, but he's not my enemy. We have a mutual friend, and met at a party my sophomore year of college. Before we met, our mutual friend, M, warned that he might try and hit on me. I'm certainly not used to being hit on by dudes, but I figured I could handle it well enough (I hadn't been hit on by many chicks either, but I had a little experience). Well, that happened pretty early in the night. I wasn't much of a drinker then (still not), so I really was just hanging in a corner with my solo cup filled with water. He came up to me, slightly drunk, and asked if I batted for both teams. It knocked me back for just a second, because there was no chatting, no foreplay if you will. Kid maybe knew my name, and maybe not even that. I kind of stuttered out a response in the negative, and that I was happily dating someone and had been for awhile. He immediately took offense and called me homophobic. I kind of laughed it off, and that seemed to be the end of that. We saw each other at a few other parties, but never really talked again. 

Because of our mutual friend, K frequently came to my apartment to meet M before they went anywhere. My girlfriend was also over frequently, because I have had several classes that she was currently taking (she's two years younger than me) and I was helping her study. K always seemed to make it a point to hit on me in front of her, making her incredibly uncomfortable. Every time, I told him I wasn't interested, you're making my GF uncomfortable, and I wanted him to stop. One time he did this, there were a bunch of people over at my place with M pregaming for some concert. He started again, and I repeated that I wasn't interested and to please stop making my GF uncomfortable. He then yelled, drawing the attention of the entire room, ""You're just a damn homophone and intolerant of my lifestyle."" Before I even had much time to think, I heard myself saying, ""I don't dislike gay people, I just hate assholes like you. And if you continue to annoy me and make my girlfriend uncomfortable, I'll slap you into the middle of next week."" He sort of laughed and the party left soon thereafter, because I had clearly made tensions too high to bear. Throughout the year, I continued to receive nasty glares from him, but he never made any more advances.  

Fast forward to just before the summer before my senior year. M has informed me that K has been cut off by his parents and has been struggling to find a place to live that's in his price range (literally broke, from my understanding at that point). M asked me if it was okay if he slept at our place that summer. I warily agreed, because I am not heartless. K assured us it would be a month or two max before he found his own place. He had a roommate lined up, they were just looking. In the mean time, he got a job and was working on the edge of town. Good for him, right? I had an internship in my hometown that summer, but would be back in town frequently to party and play some sports with friends. I made it known to K and M both that my bed was strictly off limits and my room was to be used sparingly, if at all. The summer kept marching on, and it appeared that K was no closer to getting out of our apartment. He had cleaned a bit, but most of the time that I saw him (probably about 15% of the summer) he was sitting on my couch, watching netflix on my xbox, using my gold account. So he essentially lived the entire summer rent free, while accumulating money from his job. He also had the funds to open a new line with a popular telecom, as well as a shiny new iphone and some fancy accessories. It wouldn't have been much of a problem to pay at least part of the rent that is stupid expensive in a college town. But no, nothing. K finally moved out on the day before the semester started. Literally the day before. Whatever, I was just glad he was gone. 

But my troubles hadn't ended yet. K was back at our place frequently, because of M. They drank at our place frequently, and K passed out on our couch. One time, my practice ran late and didn't get back until after midnight. I opened my door and threw my bag on my bed in my dark room and heard a grunt. I stopped and snapped on the overhead light. There K was, snuggled up in my bed. My fortress. My blankets, my pillows, my safe haven. Being...used. I flipped out, and started yelling obscenities like get the fuck out of my bed you lowlife piece of shit, how dare you, and all kinds of other shit (way out of character for me, I'm a pretty chill guy). He started yelling back, and I shoved him out of my room and shut and locked the door. I was so wired I couldn't sleep for hours. Thankfully, I never found him in my bed again. The rest of the semester passed pretty uneventfully, except for the orange juice incident. I buy good OJ whenever I go to the store, and my roommates never buy any, and they don't usually drink it. Whenever I go home, my mom buys me a shitton of it, like 5 gallons. I love OJ. I came back from my early class one day and saw him sitting on my couch, drinking a big glass of my OJ. I told him I'd appreciate it if he didn't drink any more of my juice, because it was expensive and I really liked it. He said I wouldn't notice a single glass gone (I had just gone home, had a fridge full of the stuff), and I replied that it didn't matter. I was gracious enough to let him sleep on my couch and eat my food, but the juice was off limits. He was pissed, but I didn't care. He told M what I said, and M basically said that he didn't drink the juice because he knew how much I liked it and knew how expensive it was. 

It didn't get any better this semester. K has since moved to a suburb outside of town, but comes back on Thursday and stays most of the week, because of M. I used to like hanging out with M, but I don't like that K is always there. He's supposed to leave on Sunday, but doesn't. He sleeps on my couch, uses my blankets and my pillows, and watches netflix on my xbox. Just sits. All day. And when he does leave and come back, he doesn't knock. Come on man, common courtesy! I know you think you live here, but you don't. I do, and you're ruining it.  

All of this would be so much better if he was gracious. Me and M don't exist to cater to him. My couch is not a rent free hotel. No thank yous or nothing. If I was in his situation, I would be doing whatever I could to help the people who provided me a couch. I would deep clean, offer homework help, cook, something, anything! Instead, if I come home and want to play some vidya, I can't because there's a kid on my couch that I can't say any of this to because of his relationship with M. Instead of relaxing on my couch watching House of Cards or studying late into the night, I am in my room, venting because there's no way I can remedy this situation without losing a friend. 

Also, M just told me to get my stuff out of the dryer, that someone is coming over to do laundry (included in our rent) without asking. I mean, could you at least ask if I was in the middle of laundry before whoring out the machines? Jesus, common courtesy would be such a welcome relief. 

Sorry for the wall o' text, and thanks for listening. "
1y6sw3,2,2014-02-17,"Long, but I'd appreciate the advice: how to offer support long distance",advicewouldbewelcome,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1y6sw3/long_but_id_appreciate_the_advice_how_to_offer/,"I'm looking for some advice on how to provide the right kind/amount of support for someone suffering from severe depression.

I guess a bit of background: known each other for about 2 years, dating for a year and a half. It is a serious relationship and it is understood that we are in this for the long haul. We are both very focused on our education and career, which relevant to the story and is part of the reason we get along so well. When I first met him, he was not depressed; he went away for three months for an internship, and when he came back, we started dating. This coincided with the start of a major depressive episode that has been going on ever since.

I knew he had suffered from it in the past but never really got a feel for the extent of it. Also, I had never really known him when he wasn't depressed. To me, this is just ""normal him,"" although he assures me that this is not normal for him. I don't really have anything to compare it to, although even his friends have mentioned to me that he hasn't always been like this.

In part because of these things, I'll admit at first that I wasn't as supportive as I could have been. He is not the best at communicating his feelings and I tend to be rather high strung, so I jumped to a lot of conclusions and took a lot of things personally. I thought I was the ""cause"" of it - I still have a hard time convincing I'm not, even though he repeatedly says I'm not (although I'm sure stressful relationship situations didn't help). I went away myself this past summer for three months and that's when his depression really hit hard. That, coupled with long distance, made for a really unfavorable situation for both of us. But, we made it through. When I came back we started communicating more openly. I myself have pretty severe anxiety and he was very understanding and encouraged me to try medication, which helped for awhile. I also adopted some better coping strategies (notably avoiding alcohol and trying not to take things so personally). I am doing much better now and no longer need the medication.

However, he seems to be doing worse. I have finished my graduate program and accepted a really great 6-month opportunity on the other side of the country. He encouraged me to take the opportunity because the timing would be right: it would give him a chance to focus on the rest of his school, and we would be done at about the same time. I was a bit worried about leaving him alone for so long, but I know he would have felt even worse if I had skipped out on the opportunity ""just for him,"" so I took it.

So far I've been gone for three weeks. At first it seemed OK, but the past few days I have been really worried. He is too down to talk on the phone, but he will text, and he tells me he keeps doing worse. I'm glad that he is at least communicating that to me, because before he wouldn't even do that, but I'm still worried - this is causing my anxiety to resurface, although in this case I think that's understandable. I tried giving him some advice that I thought was pretty sound (focusing on smaller, achievable goals rather than broad and hard to define ones). He has friends who care about him where he is but I know he isn't reaching out to them.

How can I be supportive from so far away? I don't want to be overbearing or put any pressure on him, so right now I am giving him space, but I'm really worried - not just about right now, but about how long this has lasted and what this means for his future. I honestly wouldn't care if he dropped out of his program for now to figure things out, and honestly, at this point he might just get kicked out anyway. I'm really worried about what will happen then. His mental health is most important to me, but I know for him a lot of his self-worth is vested in the completion of his degree. He just can't bring himself to do anything.

Any thoughts about what I can do to be supportive without overstepping my bounds? I know this can be a very delicate issue and I don't want to do the wrong thing. Right now I'm just sending him cheerful text messages and asking how he's doing, but beyond that, I'm not sure what to do.

I've been programming since I was 9.  I started with RGSS2 and blah blah blah and now have a lot of experience with VC++.  

My math teacher, fellow programmer, told me I should aim to get an internship this summer.  I don't even know where to start with this.  Before he told me this, I didn't even know it was possible to get this or what an internship really was.  I asked him what I would put on my resume and he told me there are certifications that I can pass that I can put on my resume to show them I'm fluent in these languages?

Can you guys help me out?  Do you know of this tests to get these certifications?  I'm not planning on going to college so I have to work hard in my summers and try to get internships."
1y6x4j,5,2014-02-17,"Been promised a job promotion since last summer, but still nothing?",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1y6x4j/been_promised_a_job_promotion_since_last_summer/,"I am interested in your thoughts, suggestions, and I'm very curious what *you* would do in the same situation.  If it matters, this is my first office job, I'm late 20s, and this is a career change for me (my college degree is a bit different, so I'm self taught in this).

I have been a ""Temporary Web Design Intern"" for 1 year 4 months (hourly, no benefits).  My boss has changed 3 times: first one got laid off, second one moved to different company, and my boss now (I'm part of a team of 4 people).  Right now, I have some very important responsibilities for an intern and I'm the only person who knows how to do certain tasks.

I have asked each of these bosses about changing me to full time status (which would mean more pay, with benefits and vacation).  They have all liked me and my work and were very open to that promotion.  By late last summer I've been told (by 2nd boss) that I am basically hired, but it'd just be a matter of paperwork and that the headcount wouldn't be approved until 4th quarter, in October. 

October comes and this boss leaves, but the higher up boss has said to me that they are hiring me to full time status.  I ask my 3rd boss about this and this boss has asked for my promotion to the higher up boss.  I don't hear anything, so I email the higher up boss and HR directly asking if I can do anything to help/accelerate the process. He just says he's still working on it.  At this point I learn there's a freeze on headcount until mid-January.  

Starting since about November, I have seen a few other people being hired on different teams.  A few temps, but also full timers.  My status has still not changed. 

**Questions:**

* Everyone praises my work in front of me and the higher up boss.  I am eager to learn and do my best to help my colleagues even when that means staying late.  But why hasn't my status changed?  (Is it possible that my work isn't as good as they say?)

* Am I suppose to bug the hire up boss and my boss more persistently (I ask about this every 2 weeks or so)?  I am a very agreeable, quiet, and hard working person, but perhaps this comes off as I'm willing to be tossed around and underpaid?  

* To be honest, I feel quite disrespected because I've been given empty promises since last summer.  My gut feeling is that this company doesn't deserve me.  Should I just quit and give my 2 weeks now?  Or should I wait until I get a new offer?  I have been applying elsewhere, but no new offers as of today.

**TL;DR**
I've been promised a promotion (from intern to full time) since last summer, but still nothing.  Do you have any thoughts/suggestions?  What would you do in this situation?"

When I returned back to school I did something different and approached a girl that I never before would have considered chasing. Even though we had encountered each other for almost two years I had never even noticed this girl because she was so incredibly shy. 

It was the best decision I've ever made. This kind, hardworking, intelligent, and in my opinion beautiful girl had managed to go through highschool and three years of college without being snagged by anyone. It took me over a month just to get her comfortable around me but once I did she became more confident, positive, and ambitious with everything. 

During this time we fell in love with one another and after less than six months it ended. It ended approximately one week after I accepted an incredible job offer from the company I interned with. She told me that we were in two different parts of our life and that she had realized she wasn't ready for commitment. Breaking up was incredibly hard for her, she cried extensively and at one point had a panic attack and couldn't speak a word.

I respected her decision, starting seeing new people, and think I have moved on. She is single, hasn't pursued any relationships, and simply appears to be focusing on her grades.

I almost never miss class, never failed a test in college, never made less than a B on a paper, and I work my ass off. I have not taken the GRE yet.

I literally either have an internship, work, or school every day of the week. 


No one in my family has gone past an undergrad, and very few have even gotten one.

It was easy to make a decision for my undergrad. Pick a school in state and close by.


But graduate. I don't even know where to begin.


I want to be a Primatologist. I want to get an anthropology degree.

One professor is telling me to get my masters, the other is saying straight to a PhD.

I have a list of schools that just merely have masters programs for ANTH.


There's so many.

I don't know what to look for, other than that they have Primatology stuff.

I don't know how to look for funding.

I don't know what I'm looking at.

I don't know exactly what I want to do. Not zoo stuff. Research stuff.



I feel so stressed and lost.

I start to make a list, but there's just so much information and I'm not sure what's important.


My professors can help me some, but they can't dedicate hours to me for one day to look at all the schools. I don't want my hand held anyway.

I just wish I had someone next to me, knowing what I'm looking at, and helping me understand it all. I don't want them to make any decisions for me. I just want some support that isn't ""you can do this!"" 

""You can do this"" is nice, but that's as far as they can really help me.


On top of that, I'm scared. 

This has been my dream and I've worked hard for it, but I don't think it's enough. 


My family, professors, and friends keep telling me not to worry. I'll get in.

But what if I don't?

I feel like I'm the only one being realistic. 

I can always reapply, but that would be another year for some programs. In a way I'm in a hurry. I want to start actually working in my field and not watching others do it from a few feet back. I might have to, and that's okay, but I'd rather get started.

Well, the climax has arrived.

At the time of my last post, only a few people knew.

On Friday, I cornered a bunch of people one by one and told them I was transitioning. The general reaction was that while they weren't *expecting* it, they weren't *surprised* either. Except for the co-founder and *de facto* COO, who told me that he'd already guessed and said ""if anyone gives you shit, let me know"".

I'd mentioned in a couple of places that I'd been looking for a new job. Yeah, job hunt is off. As much as I'd love a job with good pay and benefits, I like my co-workers enough that I want to stay. Never in a million years did I ever think I'd be staying at a job because of the people, but hey, we're one really awesome ragtag bunch of misfits...

This morning, I came out one-on-one to a couple of people I'd missed on Friday. One of them was an intern who just turned 18 last month. That was probably the most awkward. One, it didn't happen at the office: he has a second job at the coffee shop in our building, and I told him there (we was the only people in the store at the time, and he just told me he wasn't scheduled to come up to the office today). Second, he looks up to me like an older brother, and I just *know* that dynamic is going to change now. Third, his reaction was... unexpected. I expected him to make a really tasteless and hilariously offensive joke or something (oh, I can tell stories about him putting his foot in his mouth...). Instead, he just gave me this deer-in-the-headlights look and says ""okay"" after a very, very long pause.

This afternoon, I gave an announcement at the weekly team meeting. Everyone in the room knew, but that made it official. Also, for most of them, that was the first time I gave my name as ""Amy"" (most of the people who knew, I just told them I was transitioning). I also made a little joke about how the guy at my company with the same legal first name as me gets to have the name all to himself now (thank goodness people don't have to call us by our last names anymore). Since I'm the one who writes the meeting notes, I got to be the one to record my own coming out for posterity. I gave March 3 as the tentative date I'll go full-time. I hope I don't chicken out: I'm worried that I'll look like a fool because I haven't been on HRT long enough and because my voice sucks and because my body language sucks. We'll see, I guess...

Since not everyone was in that day, and we have a few remote people, after the meeting I wrote a mass email to send the entire company. Fortunately, I had support: one of our remote programmers is also a famous trans activist (I've mentioned this in my earlier string of posts, BTW), and I'd been talking to her on Skype as I wrote the email. She volunteered to field any questions people weren't comfortable asking me personally, which was really awesome of her.

I seriously can't believe I've come this far. Just a month ago, I was swearing up and down that I'd just medically transition and not socially transition. What changed? A few things. One, I've become much closer to my co-workers in recent weeks, and I've started hanging out with them more as much of the depression I suffered from before HRT is fading fast, and I really want to be myself around them now. Two, my mom's cat who I've known for literally more than half my life passed away about three weeks ago. He was 15 years old, I absolutely consider him family, and I love him more than anything else. More than anything else, I regret not visiting more. I could have seen him more often, but I didn't. I regret letting year after year pass by just sitting at home and doing nothing. It dawned on me that I'd wind up with the same regrets if I treated my transition that way. I realized that I need to start living life the way I've always wanted to. I guess that was his final gift to me. Dammit, I'm crying again... I miss him so much."
1y7v27,20,2014-02-18,How did you/do you know you're depressed?,[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1y7v27/how_did_youdo_you_know_youre_depressed/,"It's been a series of unfortunate events for me in life right now and I have been having some, well, bad thoughts. 

Normally, I'm a cheerful/happy/optimistic person, but for the past 5 months, after moving back home from an incredible internship, I have fallen deeper and deeper into hopelessness. 

I don't want to admit I'm depressed. I don't want to make a big deal out of my self-pity, but I thought it would go away by now. And now all the shit that has been happening to me, it's only getting worse.

Edit: Thank you all for you wonderful responses :) I appreciate you taking the time out to tell me about your story"
1y7y8a,3,2014-02-18,"I look like I have a great life, but its a very convincing cover for my consistent failure. I've recently started lying to people about my job.",TinyPaintedBiscuit,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y7y8a/i_look_like_i_have_a_great_life_but_its_a_very/,"I was supposed to graduate in May 2013 from college but crippling anxiety attacks and generally being a failure who deludes himself into thinking he's some tragic genius. My graduation was supposed to be a week before my wedding and I even put money down for a gown rental and invite stationary. My wife is an amazing over achiever who works out of state and I've been living with her ever since but haven't gotten a job. We live on a military base and I stick out like a sore thumb with long hair and a beard. I feel like everyone knows something is up, like I'm the failure trailing partner in my marriage. My wife's boss has started to catch on and gave my wife unsolicited advice about how she should crack the whip and that I can't act like a college student anymore. I tell myself I'm overqualified for regular work but really I just don't want to go back to shitty retail or food service jobs. If I wanted to I could actually make money in sales, I've gotten really good at faking it and switch into likeable and convincing guy mode. But I choose not to because I hate it, faking it and being convincing to others drains me emotionally and leaves me with nothing and makes anxiety worse. Every sales or fundraising job I've had I did really well for a while but then got worse and worse as I would get more discouraged and once had to be let go.
 
I hang out all day and am supposedly supposed to be working on finishing my degree remotely and working through therapy to fix all the stuff thats broken inside me. I applied to an internship as a contributor to an online periodical. I sent in a resume and a writing sample. They liked me and asked for more and then I never responded. I tell people I write now. My grandma things I write, my sister who is a Mormon missionary overseas thinks I'm a writer, (She's the most squeeky clean, smart, likeable, successful person ever. I'm a bad person for this but I'm really resentful of her but she's super nice to me) so does my landlady and several acquaintances. My Facebook profile lists and old job. But on my most productive days I get out the textbooks from my failed classes and read for a little while.
I started writing notes and started to get good ideas again, and after months of therapy and new drugs (I lied to him too, no fucking clue why) I managed to write an email to some professors who I had a decent relationship with and explained what happened and that I wanted to send them papers in a few months. A year ago writing that email would have taken weeks and would have caused me hours of anguish and a bruised head because I hit myself in the forehead over and over again like a psycho toddler.

Then a week later my apartment caught fire and I lost all my work. I lost my home and I lost nearly everything. I don't dare write those same professors now, almost a month later and give them yet another sob story explaining why I bailed. The fire wasn't my fault but no reasonable person could possibly believe me and these men I respect and want to think highly of me certainly will think I'm not just a disappointment but also a deluded liar. In a few months I could stop the lie but now my life is fucked up by my own failure, lost notes and books, and a whole new wave of anxiety and depression that makes me really doubt that my life is worth living. 

But that's really fucked up. I have it so good. My wife is unbelievably patient and understanding. She loves me way more than I do. I've ruined my life and all I have left is a comfy lifeboat that keeps me from completely losing it. I've failed out of school once before four years ago just as I was moving out of my parents house. I was a miserable mess, tried very hard to see the bright side but slowly started to feel like I wanted to snap. I really wanted to take a baseball bat an smash cars, not in anger but because it sounded fun. Like I would put some fun music on my iPod and dive around lean out the window and smash someone's mirror off. I got myself out of that situation and back into school but I went into the same cycle; short burst of success and optimism, then a downward slope into doubt, anxiety and general craziness. Less just before seeking any medical help I took out a hammer and came very close to smashing my left hand. Not sure why but I really wanted to punish myself for not having started a paper yet. 

Jesus I'm so fucked up and I'm so lucky I have a supportive spouse and family. So many people have it worse but I still keep fucking up. The weird thing is if I had it worse, something big and noticeable like severe agoraphobia I could justify my awful failures and even get some sympathy and understanding from the people around me. People with real problems at least have a socially acceptable out for not living up to their potential. That desire is fucking disgusting, its a slap in the face to anyone in a worse situation than me. I'm in an awful ""sweet spot"" of being just functioning enough to fool everyone but my spouse and parents, but messed up enough to still be an underachiever and have it be reflected as a failure of my character. 

When I seriously contemplate a life where I never graduate and have the career I want I seriously don't want to live it. I'd rather be dead, killed in a car accident or have died in a fire. Fuck my building was burning down and I missed my chance. I don't seem to have real suicidal thoughts, again comparing my wish to die rather than get the life I want is disrespectful to real suicidal people. I can't even be sick right. 

I'm so sorry this was long. I never read shit like this when its this long. Edited to add more depressing details.


EDIT again. Writing this doensn't make me feels better. My hands are shaking and I feel like throwing up. Now I'm having a god dam''n anxiety attack, fuck i can't confess right."
1y7zt9,1,2014-02-18,Don't succumb to superficiality and materialism,HappyJerk,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1y7zt9/dont_succumb_to_superficiality_and_materialism/,"Quick story about me: I always hated superficial and materialistic people.  I grew up really spiritual and religious, and my parents were awesome and loving. I also had some of the coolest, realest, un-materialistic, un-superficial friends ever.  So I considered myself a pretty down to earth and genuine person.  

During law school I got an internship in Los Angeles and the cheapest and closest apartment I could find to my work was in West Hollywood, right in the middle of douche central, the plastic-surgery, famewhore, celebrity gawking, shitty, superficial capital of America.  I literally lived in the thirty-mile zone,  the 30-mile radius centered at the intersection of West Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard, where all the movie studios and douche nightclubs are located, after which TMZ.com is named.  I lived literally across the street from Area, the hottest douche nightclub at that time, where all the celebrities and famesluts would congregate to do coke and be shitty human beings.  I thought I would hate it. 

The first day I was in LA, I went to the bank to open an account. My banker was a hot blonde that looked like a typical LA girl - huge fake tits, obvious plastic surgery on her face, and a hot outfit that had her tits hanging out in a way that was definitely inappropriate for a bank.  We started talking and I told her I just moved to LA and I hoped I would like it.  She said to me, ""LA is a great city, but the only problem is that it is full of superficial and materialistic people.""   I thought it was strange that she would say that, considering that she was the epitome of an LA superficial and materialistic person. 

In the first few weeks, I had the same conversation with 4 other people.  I would tell them I just moved to LA, and they would say ""it's a great city except for the superficial and materialistic people,"" and then those same people would do something extremely superficial and materialistic.  One time a guy was telling me how he hated materialistic people and as he was talking a Lamborghini drove by and he yelled ""oh my god that is such an awesome Lambo! I want that car!"" It then hit me like a ton of bricks - materialism and superficiality is a DISEASE! And the people who have that disease hate that they have it, but they just can't resist it.  I used to think that superficial and materialistic people were happy that way, but then I realized that no, those people are regular people too, they are just in the grip of this crazy illness they can't control. 

Why am I posting this in seddit? Well, I think a big problem a lot of guys have is that they buy into the superficiality and materialism of bars and clubs.  They think that the only way girls will like them is if they are tall, have big muscles, are rich, famous, etc...  The reality is that those things help, but what girls REALLY want is a genuine, loving, caring guy. All human beings have the same genes, and even the dumbest, craziest, sluttiest clubwhore deep down wants what all girls want: a man to love them, a man to hold them, a man to genuinely listen to them, and a guy to be there when she needs him.  All that other stuff is a symptom of a disease partly influenced by genetics and partly by our society. 

We live in the most superficial, materialistic society in the history of the world and its just getting worse.  People try to enjoy it, but they are really deeply unhappy. And the deeper people get into superficiality and materialism, the more they yearn for something real and deep.  You know that super hot girl in a slutty dress at the VIP table in the club surrounded by douches in Ed Hardy t-shirts and sunglasses at night? The way to her heart is not by having the fanciest watch or the biggest muscles but by having a genuine conversation with her about something deep.  In my short time in this game I have noticed that I have the deepest, most spiritual conversations with strippers and hookers, because those girls are the most spiritually starved.  One night I brought a hooker home (I didn't know she was a hooker) and we stayed up until 2 in the morning talking about the Bible. I later learned that pretty much all strippers and hookers are trying to figure themselves out spiritually.  

Before I sound too hippy dippy I realize that in reality the disease is very strong and oftentimes for these women to even look at you you have to look rich, confident, ""alpha,"" tall, etc...  The disease is hard to break, but once you get your foot in the door you can cut through all the bullshit and get to her heart by having a serious conversation about the meaning of life, etc... You can absolutely ""destroy"" with these girls by having a conversation about how much you hate ""fake"" people, about how much you love your parents, about how the most important thing is to be a ""good person.""  It seems totally counterintuitive when you see these whores at the club but it turns out that the appearance they give off is the exact opposite of what they really want.  

I go to clubs where a lot of professional athletes and celebrities hang out, and I see a similar pattern often: the young dumb whores try to talk to them and go home with them (cuz that's what you're supposed to do, right?), but the guys are just so douchey and superficial that the girls can't handle it, and come back to me (sometimes).  The other night I started talking to some really hot girl at the club, and I was trying to have a really intelligent, deep conversation with her, but she was just too stupid, so I left her after like 20 minutes.  Later in the night I saw her in the same club talking to the movie star Jason Statham.  I obviously thought my ship had sailed, but as I walked by her eyes locked with mine and she literally left Jason Statham mid-conversation and walked up to me.  I was fucking shocked.  I brought her home that banged her (I wasn't going to leave her again) and in the morning I asked her why she left Jason Statham for me and she said ""cuz he was a douche."" 

Now, one of the problems with seddit is that it teaches guys to be unemotional ""alpha"" dawgs and not ""nice guys.""  The reality is that girls want guys who are genuinely, unconditionally, selflessly nice.  The problem is that most ""nice"" guys are actually predatory - they are only ""nice"" because they want sex, attention, validation, etc...  They are an emotional drag on girls, needy, annoying, depressing, etc... Part of the reason girls are attracted to guys who don't give a fuck about them is that paradoxically ""alpha"" guys are nicer because they can be genuinely honest and friendly to the girl with no ulterior motive or neediness.  A ""nice"" guy is like a used car salesman blowing smoke up your ass so you will buy his car whereas an ""alpha"" is like a professor who is too busy to spend much time with you but goes out of his way whenever he can to help you.  You also have to remember that a lot of girls have been ""in love"" before and have been hurt, so when they get in relationships where guys start tossing a bunch of heavy emotions at them they freak out and don't want to get hurt again. 

Think about yourself - what do you really want in a relationship?  You want a loyal, loving, caring girl that you can deep conversations with and be vulnerable. That's nice and good - but you also want a hot bitch with huge fake tits, a round ass, tattoos, and will twerk like nobody's business.  You have evil desires as well as good ones, and it is hard to balance them.  That is why a lot of guys hate clubs - it's not because its too loud or the music is shitty or whatever - what they are really worried about is that they afraid of their own materialistic and superficial desires and they don't want to go to an environment where that part of them might come out.  It's a scary and ugly part of human nature. 

The TLDR?  Be genuine and be real.  Don't be afraid to go for the deep conversation at the club.  in fact, if you can pull it off without looking disingenuous or weird you have conquered a plateau 99% of the other guys aren't even trying to.  99% of the people in the club are in the grip of this disease, but if you can show them you are above that (without looking like you are just bitter cuz you're not rich/famous/etc...), you come off 100X better. I talk about shit in clubs that would crazy to you - world peace, the war in Syria, the Bible, etc... Why? Because 1) that is what I am interested in and 2) all human beings have an innate need to be intellectually stimulated and feel a deep connection with another person.  It doesn't matter how big your tits are or how expensive your dress is.

Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption”

Episode Synopsis: Beauty and The Beast Season 2 Episode 14 “Redemption” – When some of Gabe’s (Sendhil Ramamurthy) acquaintances go missing, Cat (Kristin Kreuk) and Vincent (Jay Ryan) must come together to save them. Vincent ends up returning to the hospital where he was an intern, allowing him to see what his life could have been.

Detective Catherine Chandler is a smart, no-nonsense homicide detective. Several years earlier, Catherine witnessed the murder of her mother at the hands of two gunmen. Catherine would have been killed too, but someone – or something – saved her. No one has ever believed her, but she knows it wasn’t an animal that attacked the assassins…it was human. Years have passed, and Catherine is a strong, confident, capable police officer, working alongside her equally talented partner, Tess. While investigating a murder, Catherine discovers a clue that leads her to a handsome doctor named Vincent Keller, who was reportedly killed by enemy fire while serving in Afghanistan in 2002.

Catherine learns that Vincent is actually still alive and that it was he who saved her many years before. For mysterious reasons that have forced him to live outside of traditional society, Vincent has been in hiding for the past 10 years to guard his secret – when he is enraged, he becomes a terrifying beast, unable to control his super-strength and heightened senses. Catherine agrees to protect his identity in return for any insight he may have into her mother’s murder. Thus begins a complex relationship between Catherine and Vincent, who are powerfully drawn to each other yet understand that their connection is extremely dangerous for both of them.

The series stars Kristin Kreuk (“Smallville,” “Chuck”) as Catherine, Jay Ryan (“Terra Nova”) as Vincent, Max Brown (“The Tudors,” “MI-5″) as Evan, Nina Lisandrello (“Nurse Jackie”) as Tess, Nicole Gale Anderson (“Make It or Break It”) as Heather, Austin Basis (“Life Unexpected”) as J.T., and Brian White (“The Shield,” “The Cabin in the Woods”) as Joe. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is from CBS Television Studios with executive producers Jennifer Levin (“Without A Trace,” “Felicity”), Sherri Cooper (“Brothers and Sisters”), Bill Haber (“Rizzoli &amp; Isles,” “Thurgood”), Paul J. Witt (“A Better Life”) &amp; Tony Thomas (“A Better Life”), Ron Koslow (“Moonlight”) and Gary Fleder (“Life Unexpected”).

1y83th,93,2014-02-18,Co-worker gets called out for taking advantage of an intern,applestoapple,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y83th/coworker_gets_called_out_for_taking_advantage_of/,"**BACKGROUND:** So, a couple years ago I was a marketing intern at this international company. Because I was a good enough worker, my boss put me on corporate marketing request duty. Basically what happens is that whenever some random person in the company needs something to be done on the website, they would submit a request to my co-worker and I. We fix whatever is wrong and eventually shove it onto the website. I got the more-or-less simple tasks that only required playing in HTML and occasionally CSS. People tended to like me since I took care of things in a pretty quick fashion. Overall, my team had about 10 people in total, which includes me, my boss, his boss, my mom, and a few other people who don't need mention.

**ACTUAL STORY:** Some time a couple months into that position, I got a request from the legal department that seemed pretty trivial. Just fix this one page, whatever. I fixed it, sent it to the woman sending the request (let's call her Hagar just for ease) for review, and everything was starting to look good. And then she got the bright idea to start doing the ""Oh, and while you're there, could you do this little thing for me?"" I let my boss know about this, he said I should just go along with it even though she's supposed to send each and every one of her additional requests through the corporate marketing server. An interesting thing to note here is that I always made sure to CC my boss in my replies. In Outlook Express, if you hit Reply All, the people who were CC'd are going to be included in your reply. And all of her responses don't have my boss included, and her more impatient emails had her boss included. So, it means she is intentionally trying to take my boss off the email list. This continues for another week and then I suddenly fell incredibly sick. As a result, I had to stay home for a few days and was not allowed to work (my mom, one of my coworkers, had none of it.)

I finally get back to the office after ~5 days, including the weekend, to find about 20 emails from Hagar demanding to know what is going on with her now-pretty-large request. At this point, she decided to include my boss's boss in the emails. Mind you, not my boss, but his boss. I promptly respond with, ""I was out sick the past few days,"" and that shut her up out of sheer embarrassment for a while. I took care of everything she requested, sent it back to her for review, and then went to focus on this problem that required about half of my team.

A couple weeks pass, and then I get this email from Hagar with her boss, my boss's boss (because clearly my boss is just too insignificant for this shit), and one of the people on the corporate managing team CC'd with this huge explanation for why she is so upset and how dare I not do anything she's asking when her problem is so important (the problem she was citing was reorganizing the overview page, which is as trivial as you can get) and it's been over a month (more like 3 weeks) and I'm just ignoring her and I'm just the worst person ever.

Finally, I give up and, after checking with my mom and boss to make sure it's okay, send a Reply-All email with,
""Hi, Hagar. I'm sorry I haven't been taking care of your request in the past week. I had to focus on building the new site (which we were also building at that time). I have your problem fixed, you can see it here. And while I still have you, could you please check to see if all of your other requests that I sent back to you weeks ago look okay? *includes links to all of the pages she wanted me to clean up* Thanks, applestoapple, Corporate Marketing Intern""

A couple hours later, I get a response from Hagar's boss (with Hagar and my boss CC'd) saying that all of the things I've taken care of look good and are ready to go live. I don't hear from Hagar for the rest of my internship. I've been taking contractor positions at the company since then, and it was only until a couple months ago that Hagar has been allowed to send corporate marketing requests again.

**TL;DR:** During my internship at some company, some person in a different team sends a request that rapidly snowballs into a nightmare, gets angry that I don't take care of things as quickly as she wanted, tries to include multiple higher-ups in the company, and I smack her down in front of all of them."
1y89nt,1,2014-02-18,Just Be Careful,[deleted],Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1y89nt/just_be_careful/,"I feel the need to share this, only because I believe what I believe, and I feel it's worth it to mention what's going on with me to a subreddit full of people interested in exploring otherworldly stuff.

I'll throw this out there to start with: I have clinical depression. So, me being bummed out is the norm. I don't take meds and I've never had therapy, because I've never felt that my state of mind was severe enough for professional treatment.

It's also important to mention that I am a Christian. No denomination, really, just your standard Protestant. 

Not sure where I'm going with this, really. I just... feel the need to warn people. See, this past summer, I began an art/research project focusing on The Revelation of St. John, the last book in The Bible. Call it an internship, if you will, because I was offered money and it was a subject I wanted to work with. So, I'm making these big drawings of Satan's fall from Heaven, Tribulation, angels, demons, all that fun, disastrous, cryptic stuff. 

Basically, ever since I started these drawings in the summer, I've been... a mess. My girlfriend split with me, which didn't help anything, but I was falling apart before then. I LOVE this work, I love the research, I love The Bible, I love to make art. The way I see it, I shouldn't feel the way I do. But I'll just say what I told my girlfriend before she dumped me: something very real, and very evil, does not want me making this work. 

My depression has peaked into fits of anger, I'm forgetting how to interact with people, I can't sleep and when I do, I have nightmares. I forget to eat, and can't hold down what I do eat. I've been sick to my stomach once or twice a week for the past half year. I'm compelled to finish my task, but there are constant distractions. I've tried desperately to keep up with my Bible devotions and prayer, but I'm often pulled even from that. This work is about the final battle, evil being destroyed for good, and God recreating the world and perfecting everything He made that fell to sin before. Something terrible, be it the devil or whatever form of evil you believe in, has been attacking me ever since I started these drawings. 

I'm reading posts on here about Ouija Boards and talking to spirits and all that, and it kills me that people are so passionate about contacting ""the other side."" Meanwhile, I'm sitting here trying to share my faith through artwork, and something from said other side has all but driven me mad. I guess my point in typing all this is, if you're going to provoke the supernatural, you'd better pray for some kind of insurance that doesn't want to eat your soul. Mine is my faith in Jesus, and even that is pretty rusty at this point. Even if you're just trying to contact a ghost, a lost human spirit floating around, you're opening doors that other things can and will pass through. The devil disguises himself as an angel of light; never forget that. 

Go ahead and tell me it's all in my head, that this will blow over once I finish the work and take some stupid pills. Believe what you will, I'm just telling you, be careful. "

My IT internship ends in June and I have to find a new job. I can just stay in Norway and get a new IT job or i can travel to Australia and get a job there. 
I like to travel and I've always wanted to go to Australia, the thing is that i don't know whether i should wait one more year or just go now when my internship ends."

And I just failed my semester. And I'm trying to fucking hard, and it's like I'm always gonna be a failure. I can't take this anymore. 
So I had an appointment for the 7th of March. Fine. Then they called me saying I had to be rescheduled for the 28th. Shit. I called the international department (I live abroad) and they were able to give me an appointment for today, and I cancelled the one I had for the 28th. I was fucking happy and relieved. This morning I get a call from them saying the psychiatrist is sick today, and they only have space in the beginning of April. Seriously, fuck them. Not to mention all the times they didn't call me when they had do, to the point I had to call them from my phone crying and feeling like a neglected piece of shit.
Just fuck everything. My semester will be close to ending in the beginning of April. I have to do my internship then and I'll probably do it in another country so it's not even worth it.
I just thought that this one time, things would work out. That I wouldn't fail again. 
Right now I just feel fucking depressed, I hope this sadness translates into anger soon because when they call me again to confirm my next appointment I just want to yell at them like they just killed my whole family.
Have a good day everybody."

Touches of humor are riddled throughout the film almost as if the director took notes from the master of humorous storytelling and director of The Avengers Joss Whedon.

All the main players are back from the first film, simply titled Thor. Directed this time by Alan Taylor who is best known for directing some of the most popular television series on the small screen. Taylor has recently been sharpening his director’s swords on the hugely popular HBO fantasy Game of Thrones. With this type of pedigree the chap who is better known for television projects must have been seen as being perfect for the second Thor feature.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Chris Hemsworth is back as the blonde-locked demigod who has a romantic interest in Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster. Considering that this is the 30 year-old actor’s third outing as the son of Odin and brother of Loki, it isn’t too surprising that the role fits Hemsworth like a well worn, but tight, glove. As equally at home in his role as Loki, the untrustworthy and grandiose trickster who longs for his own throne, is Tom Hiddleston. The 33 year-old actor is perhaps the most qualified actor to play opposite Hemsworth as the two close and quarreling siblings. Although, Loki is, as Thor points out in The Avengers, adopted.

Equally impressive is Stellan Skarsgård who reprises his role as Erik Selvig friend and mentor to Jane and unwilling host to Loki, in his head, throughout most of The Avengers. This brilliant actor is equally at home in his character’s skin, again, because he also has played Selvig three times now in three different films. In Thor, Skarsgård was protector of Jane and reluctant friend to the Hammer swinging Asgard. With the news that there will be, at least, one if not two more Thor films in the offing, no doubt Stellan will be back and continue to impress with his skills as an actor.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online In Thor: The Dark World, which is dark, but not too much so; after Odin recites the tale of the dark elves, the audience is brought to “present day” and Thor is sorting out the nine realms and Loki is cooling his villainous heels in Asgardian dungeons. Thor is missing his human love interest and decides to pay her a very overdue visit. Meanwhile, back at Earth, Foster is attempting to move on having pretty much given up on the Demigod ever returning. After being interrupted on a date by her intern Darcy Lewis, played with kooky capability by Kat Dennings who tells her that something odd is happening and that Jane really should check it out; things move to a deserted warehouse in London.

While discovering an anomaly inside the warehouse, Foster stumbles over an artifact thought hidden since the defeat of the Dark Elf Malekith and it invades her body. Thor then turns up and after a short, and amusing, reunion the artifact which is known as Aether has taken over Jane’s system and apart from making her dangerous to others, she herself is in danger. After British police try, somewhat ham-handedly, to arrest Jane for trespassing, Thor takes Foster to Asgard to have her cured if possible.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film does an adequate job of recreating the Asgardian verse and the only disappointing thing about the film is the loss of Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano who plays Hogun, one of Thor’s band of Asgard colleagues who join him anytime battle is due to commence. At the start of the film, when Thor is sorting out Vanaheim and after defeating the rebellious natives, Hogan is allowed to stay behind to help clean things up. This more than capable actor, who is best known for his role in the Takashi Miike cult classic Ichi the Killer, has not had too much to do in either Thor movie, but, it is hoped that this creative genius will eventually play a larger role in future films.

The obligatory Stan Lee cameo is present, as in all Marvel films, this time as an asylum inmate with Erik Selvig who is teaching the assorted “crazies” in a common room. After the lesson, Lee asks for his shoe back, which Erik is using as a teaching aid. The film does have many small touches of humor, some more slapstick in nature; as when Malekith and Thor hit the roof and side of a glass topped building but even this touch is deft and not done in a “Three Stooges” sort of way.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The graphics in the film amaze and do not lose a thing by being watched on a smaller screen. The FX are just as brilliant and the battles are impressive. The acting is without a doubt top notch. In a film where “smaller” roles are filled by acting royalty, i.e. Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo – who may not class as royalty exactly, but does have an impressive pedigree – as Frigga, there can be no question as to delivery. Christopher Eccleston as Malekith is evilly brilliant and the award winning Idris Elba as the Asgard Sentry Guardian Heimdall is just as impressive in the second outing in the world of Thor as the first.

It would take too long and be ultimately boring to mention all the cast who adroitly make their characters come to life. Suffice to say the script combined with skilfull helmsmanship from Taylor as well as actors who all bring something to the party, Thor: The Dark World is a brilliant sequel to the first Asgard tale of a Demigod who fell in love with an earth woman and stayed on to become the planet’s defender. In this second tale, the film may be dark, but, not too dark. If the other sequels can maintain this quality the continuing story of Thor and his fellow Asgardians will be a special treat each and every time they appear. Available for streaming now and for sale from February 25, this is a real 5 star out of 5 film that in collector’s speak, “is a keeper.” Don’t forget to keep an eye out for another cameo of a miliary sort.

**Edit**: LOLerblades. This post sure got more attention than I expected. Banana and I just wanted to thank everyone who commented. We learned a lot from the comments! Thank you!

****

This is a short but sweet story about Medihams. Medihams is the ex-girlfriend of my boyfriend's brother. I have been exposed to her fatlogic and fit-shaming for a very long time but I didn't try to post here because my SO's brother browses reddit from time to time. But now that they've broken up, it's free for all. 

Yes, I am aware me posting about it after their break-up is a douche move. However, I just want to get it off my chest as her fit-shaming rustles my jimmies to high heaven. 

Medihams, as you can guess by her name, is a med student. She is not a very good one. Her ex-boyfriend is one of the best in his class. She *pretends* that she's just as good and even told me at one time that it was *her* tutoring that got him his good grades (this is bullshit. He is already an intern (on his way to being resident) and she is still stuck with lectures because **she keeps failing fucking everything**). 

She often tries to be nice to me, but ends up being condescending. We don't get to talk often because I would rather swallow a fistful of nails than talk to her. Well, that and we don't really have anything in common. Every time I talk to her, it ends up about how she's a med student and I'm not (I'm an English teacher, folks. Never dreamt of becoming a doctor even when I was bullshitting all those ""what do you want to be when you grow up"" essays in elementary school). 

Anyway, I wasn't present when this story happened. It was my SO, who we'll call Banana (its what his second favorite fruit), who witnessed her fatlogic first-hand. It's a little long, but this will be a bit important later -- and it will also kind of explain why Banana and I are so pissed at her fatlogic. 

See, for a few months now, Banana and I have been trying to get some changes done. See, we *were* both overweight. Not hamstatus or mini-moon status, but mostly just a lot of fat in the wrong places. I have to give him credit, though. Banana was the one who really pushed himself first and then encouraged me after. I was one of them TiTp-er sympathizers. I don't mean I was a fat activist who fit-shamed and didn't think ""diets don't real"". I sympathized in a way that I really did believe that fat people were being oppressed and unfairly humiliated. I got a lot of flak from my mom (especially her) and the rest of my family about my weight a year ago. I weighed 94kgs (206lbs) and Banana weighed a little bit less than that (maybe around 180-185lbs?). 

It was a year of feeling like shit and moping around about how lucky thin/fit people were and how my life was so hard because I couldn't say no to a second helping of white rice every meal time. Banana, on the other hand, started taking up Tai Chi lessons a two years ago. He's now learning Bagua (?) and other offensive forms of Tai Chi. He also started watching what he ate. He dropped the ""soda everyday"" routine, stuck to green tea and water and of course, controlled his cravings. It worked. He looks great now. 

For a while, I was hesitant to do it because I was too busy feeling sorry for myself. You know, like most TiTpers. But then I decided to give it a shot this year. Since January, I've been on the Keto diet and I've been circuit training every night no matter how tired I am from work. I now weigh 89kgs and dropping! Banana and I kind of encourage each other and help each other with our diets. It's been going great. I'm happier, healthier -- and I need new clothes because everything is so loose on me now. Ha. 

**Enter Medihams**.

See, Medihams has the illusion that she, too, is healthy. Her parents got her a membership to an expensive gym near her campus. She is also trying on this new trend diet. When I heard that she was trying to lose weight, I felt happy for her. She was finally fighting back the fatlogic --

&gt;Everyday posts pictures of cakes and ricemeals on FB

&gt;Everyday goes to Starbucks to buy fraps

&gt;""After gym treat, tee hee!""

**See why I say illusion?**

She has other people calculate her calorie intake and cook her food. This isn't bad at all. Especially since med school pretty much **does** take over your life. I just wish she'd stop shitting all over this chance to change something by **fucking eating cake every single damned day**. 

Okay, I'm calm. 

Anyway, Medihams is also the daughter of Banana's boss. That's why sometimes, she's there at the office while Banana is working. One day, before going out to lunch, she walks to Banana's desk and starts a friendly conversation. It's just the usual. School, work, life-stuff. Until Banana makes the mistake of saying the following words:

&gt;Banana: Yeah, AH and I have been trying to lose weight. We're doing great so far. 

Medihams puts on that face that she gives you when she wants you to know she's concerned. It's a mix between smug and constipated. There is no meme for it. Sorry, FPS.

&gt;Medihams: Why are you doing that?

&gt;Banana: Oh, well. We're not getting any younger. We have to start looking out for ourselves. AH and I want to be healthier for when we get married and start a life together. 

Banana is 31. I am 27. He also makes the mistake of telling her that he is taking up Tai Chi and I have taken up circuit training. We are both on the keto diet. 

&gt;Medihams: Yeah, you did lose weight. I don't get it though. Everyone is so *obssessed* with losing weight! 

&gt;Banana: My goal this year is to lose more belly fat. I'm going to do more crunches and situps --

&gt;Medihams: It doesn't *WORK* that way!

Banana had to do a fucking double take because, shit. Did the *med student* just tell him that **exercise doesn't work**? Like, fucking really? That's like a computer engineer telling you he doesn't know how to use microsoft office. 

She continued to lecture him about how diets and exercise are only society's way of pressuring you to be something you're not. And that if he really loved me, he would stop trying to fat shame me and love me for who I am. Medihams constantly repeated that exercise won't make you thin. Nope. It won't even *help* you get thin. And if you stop yourself from eating whatever the fuck you want? Well, that's you starving yourself! You should be good to your body and **let it have the three tubs of ice cream it so desperately craves** (okay, she didn't say that last part. That was artistic license). 

Again, FPS. I remind you. This is from a med student.

Let that sink in. A *med student*.

Someone who is going to be a doctor.

Someone who is going to treat people. 

Who will specialize in treating *children*. 

She just told us that exercise and diets *don't* work. 

I'll let you have a shouting match with your jimmies for a while. I'll be right here.

...

...

...

Okay. You're back. 

Banana's jimmies were rustled, but since she is the daughter of the person who holds his paycheck. He didn't really start any shit. Instead, he just asked a question.

&gt;Banana: So, you're saying that -- no matter how much I exercise. I won't get thinner?

&gt;Medihams: That's right!

&gt;Banana: If I eat a lot of food, will I get fatter?

&gt;Medihams: Uhm... well, yes. But that just means that you were meant to weigh that much!

&gt;Banana: But I read about this woman who weighs 800 pounds. Is that still considered okay? That's morbidly obese, right?

&gt;Medihams: Well, that's not a bad thing. It just means it was genetic!

&gt;Banana: But these people eat junk. All the time. They can choose *not* to eat junk. Also, isn't heart problems and physical impairment due to weight pretty much a bad thing? 

&gt;Medihams: I'm not petite (she means not fat). I don't have any health problems. I'm absolutely fine. And I exercise!

&gt;Banana: But I thought you said exercise doesn't work? Why do you do it? 

&gt;Medihams: To be healthy, duh.

&gt;Banana: But -- I just told you that *we* were doing it to be healthy, too. Isn't that pretty much the same thing as you're doing? Why is it wrong when we do it? 

&gt;Medihams: Because you're doing it to lose weight! And that's not healthy! You shouldn't be obssessed with it! 

&gt;Banana: My blood pressure stopped peaking as often as it did when I lost weight. I think that's kind of healthy. And AH and I aren't obssessed about it. We just do it together to motivate each other. 

&gt;Medihams: Well... Chocolate (Banana's brother) and I do that, too! We play tennis together! And that's exercise. 

&gt;Banana: Oh. Well, that's great! How often do you two exercise together?

&gt;Medihams: We play tennis *once a month*. Tee hee! 

&gt;Banana: Oh. Well, I guess if that works for you. I guess that means you've lost weight, too.

&gt;Medihams: Uhm... it's a little hard (this means no, she didn't. She still pretty much looks the same). With exams and lectures and all. I gotta keep energized! In fact, I'm gonna get a snack now. I feel a little light headed. Wanna come with?

&gt;Banana: Where?

&gt;Medihams: There's a steak house near here, right? Their ribs are *excellent*

**It's 3pm in the afternoon. At most, it's fucking snack time.**

&gt;Banana: Uh... no thanks. I ate a pretty okay lunch and I've still got work to do. 

&gt;Medihams: What did you eat?

&gt;Banana: AH and I had Kani salad (basically a garden salad with 3-5 strips of crab) and some coffee. I'm good.

&gt;Medihams: *sigh* Starving yourselves. It's so sad. 

And so off went Medihams to hunt for ribs. Banana told me about it the evening after it happened. My jimmies were rustled to maximum 5000 and there was much sexy times to soothe the savage beast within me. 

*****

Recently, Medihams and Chocolate broke up. This happened because Chocolate was going through some kind of life choice crisis and Medihams could take no more. At that point, I sympathized with her. Chocolate was kind of giving her a hard time. In Choco's defense, however, when he saw that Medihams was unhappy, he let her go. Then, Banana hears from Mediham's brother, Carrotcakes. He had this to share:

&gt;Banana: Hey, sorry about my brother being a douchecanoe. Hope there aren't any hard feelings.

&gt;Carrotcakes: Nah. It's alright. We'll see what happens from here. Have you heard though? 

&gt;Banana: About?

&gt;Carrotcake: Medihams said she's going to lose weight and become sexy so that Chocolate will be sorry he ever let go of her. 

&gt;Banana: ....Uhhhh...

&gt;Carrotcake: *shrug* It's kind of like -- to get him back, I guess?

&gt;Banana: O..kay.

***

As of late, Medihams is on that swanky diet I told you about. Although, her profile page is filled with pictures of the stuff she eats everyday. Basically cake, ice cream and all that other kinds of junk people aren't supposed to eat every fucking day. She used to post whenever she was at the gym, but I don't see her posts at the gym anymore. 

This will probably be a series. "

Unfortunatly my application was not good enought. I then decide to share what I made with reddit instead of simply deleting it. I would like you ti give me some feedback on what I should improve. 
Keep in mind, I'm not a native english speaker nor an expert in making balanced champions. I apologize for my english and hope you will enjoy reading it.

Kurai, the cosmic herald

INTRODUCTION : 

I imagined this character 2 years ago. At the time, I was wondering why there was no abilities able to interact with other abilities. Two years later, yasuo comes out. I was really happy to see, that finally someone had the same idea. I really like this type of gameplay, and I really hope Riot Games will go further in this way. I find it really interesting, because it gives some champions really high skill cap. Pro players are becoming stronger everyday, if we dont want players to be limited by the skill cap of champions, skill caps have to follow the trend.

LORE :

Kurain is a yordle, that lived in a remote place, near Bandle City, with her family. She was the only child her parents had, and they died while she was still young. She lived as an orphan, thanks to the fields her parents built, she managed to grow up. Until one day, while she was going on a trip into the mountain, looking for some edelweiss, a black spot caught her attention. As she was walking towards it, she felt an attractive strength. The closer she was getting to the the black spot, the more intense the strength was. She slipped on the humid moss that covered the ground, and was sucked into the black hole. She was no more able to feel her own body, she was now out of the space-time continuum. She attended birth of universes she didnt even know, she saw them growing and dying. She saw the entire galaxy taking shape and disappearing into star dust. She was travelling through space and time, she had no more shape or age. She felt the presence of entities close to her, but she could not know which feeling gave her this sensation. A whisper broke the deadly silence, this voice came from nowhere and said :

APPEARANCE :

I've designed Kurai as a silhouette, which is filled with a view on the universe. That gives her a really unique appearance as her ""skin"" contrasts with the rest of the map. Please keep in mind this is not what the champions is supposed to be. My drawing skills are not good enought to draw her as I imagined her. This is the only way I found to try to have you understand what it could look like designed by someone relevant. 
Kurai, the cosmic herald

INTRODUCTION : 

I imagined this character 2 years ago. At the time, I was wondering why there was no abilities able to interact with other abilities. Two years later, yasuo comes out. I was really happy to see, that finally someone had the same idea. I really like this type of gameplay, and I really hope Riot Games will go further in this way. I find it really interesting, because it gives some champions really high skill cap. Pro players are becoming stronger everyday, if we dont want players to be limited by the skill cap of champions, skill caps have to follow the trend.

LORE :

Kurain is a yordle, that lived in a remote place, near Bandle City, with her family. She was the only child her parents had, and they died while she was still young. She lived as an orphan, thanks to the fields her parents built, she managed to grow up. Until one day, while she was going on a trip into the mountain, looking for some edelweiss, a black spot caught her attention. As she was walking towards it, she felt an attractive strength. The closer she was getting to the the black spot, the more intense the strength was. She slipped on the humid moss that covered the ground, and was sucked into the black hole. She was no more able to feel her own body, she was now out of the space-time continuum. She attended birth of universes she didnt even know, she saw them growing and dying. She saw the entire galaxy taking shape and disappearing into star dust. She was travelling through space and time, she had no more shape or age. She felt the presence of entities close to her, but she could not know which feeling gave her this sensation. A whisper broke the deadly silence, this voice came from nowhere and said : 
""You saw things that none of your kind were supposed to see. You touched things that none of your kind were supposed to touch. That is because It chose you. It opened your mind to new domains, you are now ready. Go back to your world, be Its herald, and serve It. This is not about good and evil, this is about a timeless clash between things and nothing.

""Shapes, colours and time are only ellipsis made by weak minds in order to grasp what they could from a reality they cannot conceive. - Kurai""

APPEARANCE :

I made a drawing of her, but I do not know how to include it in my post so I will just describe how she is. I've designed Kurai as a silhouette, which is filled with a view on the universe. That gives her a really unique appearance as her ""skin"" contrasts with the rest of the map. She wears a very large magician hat that is too big for her. She has two little wings made from cosmic materials she gathered thanks to her powers (it's mostly a tribute to Flandre from Touhou). She also hold a staff made of broken shard, with at the the top a galaxy as the head of the staff.

ABILITIES :

Starts with one rank in ultimate

	Passive : Restructuration : Kurai can stack up to 50% CDR.

	Q : Cosmic Ray
Kurai fires a little orb of dark matter that detonates, inflicting magic damage (70/110/150/190/230  +0,6*AP)  upon hitting an enemy or reaching the end of its path (radius of little blast : 90). If the cosmic ray hits a black hole (R), the black hole deals magic damage (100/160/220/280/340 +0,9*AP) in a radius of 150, and the cosmic ray is automatically absorbed if the black hole is able to do so, but a single cosmic ray can only be absorbed once.
Cost : 55 / 65 / 75 / 85 / 95
CD : 8 /7,5 / 7 / 6,5 / 6 
Range : 750

	W : Wormhole
Available only when two black holes are present.
Kurai swaps everything that are within 60 radius of the center of the black holes to the other one, in both ways (enemy heroes and minions, allied heroes and minions and spells absorbed ). The swap deals some magic damage ( 75 / 125 / 175 / 225 / 275 +0,5*AP) to enemies. Cosmic Rays absorbed into black holes, thrown from it, deal 30 % more damage.
Cost : 65 / 75 / 85 / 95 / 105
CD : 25 / 23 / 21 / 19 / 17

	E : Spell devourer / Nebulous aura
Available when at least one black hole is present. 
Kurai decides to briefly unleash the full power of her black holes, causing them to absorb one  enemy spell, that must be a projectile, within 80 radius from the center of the black hole. If a spell is absorbed, spell devourer becomes nebulous aura for the next 6 seconds. 
If a cosmic Ray hits a black hole, it is automatically absorbed and nebulous aura is available. The cooldown of spell devourer is halved.
Cost : 90
CD : 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12  (starts when spell devourer is used, does not wait for the use of nebulous aura)

Nebulous aura : Throw the spell absorbed, from the black hole that did so. With wormhole, Kurai can change the black hole from which she wants to throw the spell.

R 
	Active : Black hole
Only available when Kurai has a dark energy charge ready.
Kurai creates a distortion in the space-time continuum, building a black hole (radius = 70). When appearing the black hole deals magic damage ( 80 / 130 / 180 / 230  + 0,5*AP) to enemies within 100. The black hole is immediatly able to absorb a spell thanks to spell devourer, but it has a 0,3 sec delay before Kurai is able to use Wormhole. Black Hole disappear if kurai is more than 1300 away. Building a black hole at more than 1100 from another black hole will cancel the first one. Only two black holes can be present at the same time.
Cost : 60
CD : 1 sec 

	Passive  : Space-time distortion
Every (10 / 8,5 / 7 / 5,5)  Kurai generates a dark energy charge. She can stack up to 2 dark energy charge at the same time. CDR does influence the rate at which Kurai generates her dark energy charge.

GAMEPLAY :

Kurai is ranged, her basic attacks come from her staff, she throws little shiny stars.
Kurai has been designed as a midlaner, toplaner or support  : she has some crowd control and good harass with a decent mobility.
Laning phase : Kurai has to choose where does she place her black hole. If she chooses to farm, she will place them close to enemy's minions, so her cosmic rays would hits her black hole dealing bonus damage to minions. If she chooses to harass her opponent, she has to place her black holes in an offensive way, closer to her opponent. In teamfight, she can provide nice engages, and good crowd control.

MISCELLANOUS : 
Kurai's enemies would be character coming from the void, such as cho'gath, and especially Malzahar. On the contrary her friend would be Lulu, as lulu is very open minded and able to see things differently. 

Alternative skin for Kurai : Arcade Kurai
Her black hole would be mario green pipes, she would maybe wear a salopettes and throw fireball like mario does.

I usually have short flings with interns sometimes when I go to the college bars I meet women there. 

I have dated some of the women my own age but in all honesty not only do they look worse on average, but they don't have the fun and vibrance of a younger woman. Plus they view are a lot less interested in casual sex. 

I heard usually when guys get older their tastes change as well, but for me it hasn't.

What have your experiences been?"
1y9435,0,2014-02-18,"Me 28/f with my 25/m 3 month relationship, just a female friend or waiting in the wings situation. Also, opposite sex sleepovers! And a possible engagement. After 3 months. Yep.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1y9435/me_28f_with_my_25m_3_month_relationship_just_a/,"

Like the day of our second date before we were exclusive. I found out like two weeks ago. She told him, ""Yeah, you probably shouldn't mention this to her"". She supposedly stayed over because the roads were too bad for her to drive back to Virginia, and we live in PA and his house is about halfway to hers. She stayed in a separate room. So he was hanging out with her (alone), came to take me out to eat, then took me back to my dad's and went back and she was there waiting for him, and spent the night. 

Anyway I kind of just forgot about this, although it sort of bothered me a little, but because I don't want to be THAT GIRL and in general I don't really feel threatened a lot (not to be stuck up but I'm pretty attractive and funny, and can hold my own in situations like that.) So I decided to forget about it.

It only kind of turned into this big thing when we were hanging out the one night after I'd been staying at his place for going on 4 days,  and there's a call at about 7 pm looks at it and goes, ""Oh, I don't recognize that number..."" sort of weirdly, and doesn't answer. 

It was from her parents house in Virginia and he said he didn't know it was from her, but I still think he was lying. I thought it was someone I myself had called earlier in the day (a grad school in Virginia, actually) and when I called and it was HER we were both really confused and I just shoved the phone in his hands and was pretty embarrassed about it. I guess the fact I assumed he had known it was her all along and  he didn't want to talk to her in front of me was an indication he liked her. 

So he told me later he DIDN'T know it was her calling (his iPhone said the call was from Virginia, I mean c'mon?...) and that I am misconstruing the information. I admit this is possible.

He swears up and down he doesn't like this girl and is friends with her boyfriend, but I just have this weird feeling. They talk on the phone (she calls him maybe once or twice a week, and it seems like she talks to him, but her boyfriend doesn't seem to contact him much, if ever) and she visits him. 

When I asked why he is friends with her when he basically makes her sound like an idiot, he had some interesting answers.  Not one to suffer fools lightly (he is actually kind of an asshole about it), I addressed this and he said, ""Oh, she is a good person to be friends with. Her family has good political connections"". Supposedly her family helped decorate Biden's Christmas tree. So, like really connected. 

My boyfriend works in a field where this could be useful.  She is rich (and I am really really poor, and I'll admit this makes me insecure in a whole other way, but I realize she can't help being rich either) and he makes her sound like a little infantilized idiot, but part of me think he kind of gets off on that too, because he likes to take care of me (paying for everything, talking about how he'd be a good provider, offering to buy me a car, etc). Also, she is what he'd want for social climbing, and not me. 

On the other hand, he has left me his phone all day (my phone doesn't work where he lives and my grandma was sick and I wanted to keep in touch with my mom). I'll admit when I used his phone, that while I didn't go through it, I saw all the calls from Katie on his phone. Like, a lot. I've been in his house all day long without him here. He has nothing laying around to incriminate him, although I'll admit I didn't really dig. 

On the other hand, he says he sees ""nothing wrong"" with her staying the night, and I agree that I myself should have no problem being as were weren't exclusive then, but I think it's a little ridiculous to think that at this point it would be fine. He acts as if the same thing to happen tomorrow that it would objectively be totally cool, but he won't do it ""because I don't want him to"". Remember Katie herself mentioned he shouldn't mention it to me. Isn't that just kind of common decency/sense? I wouldn't stay over at a guy's house at this point in our relationship, and I wouldn't make a point to tell him it was a special concession just for him. I would do it because it's generally just not okay. 

Also, he has made a point to disparage her boyfriend Kaleb. He has said he's goofy looking, but ""girls seem into him"". When I asked if they were serious, he said, ""Oh, they've been together years. They're going to get married"". He sounded almost resigned when he said it. 

He also told me that Katie would look up to me, (which pissed me off because it made me sound matronly or something, despite the fact I'm only 3 years older) and that Katie wishes Kaleb were ""more like him"", and that he thinks Katie thinks he would be a ""good influence on Kaleb"". He talked about trying to get Kaleb a job where he worked eventually. 

She added me on Facebook and asked when we would hang out. She told me Mike talks about me all the time to her. There were lots of exclamation points involved. 

I'm supposed to leave to go do an internship abroad (like very far away) for 6 months and so he has accelerated the relationship- he has talked about wanting to get engaged, and how he wants to keep me here instead of going to do the internship by buying me a car and getting me a job where he works. We went to visit a local school because he wants to keep me around (he drove me there and took a day off work, and knew I couldn't help with gas or anything). 

So he is very serious but what is up with this situation? I mean the 3 month thing leading into marriage is weird already but what is up with this girl? I am not the jealous type but I seriously am stumped. Am I being irrational or is there something to that niggling voice in my mind that says he has feelings for her and won't even admit it to himself? Should I proceed with this or is this going to end badly for everyone?

1y9arn,6,2014-02-18,"Long story, short: Can't stand the new manager",manage_this,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1y9arn/long_story_short_cant_stand_the_new_manager/,"First, a little background for context...

I am a 26-year-old full-time student at a large university majoring a business field similar to MIS. I went to work for a few years and saved up some money after high school, which explains the age gap between me and the students who spend every night piss-drunk.

I also have a 20-hour/week internship as a Network Operator at a large local company. It's so easy and boring for me, but most of the full-time operators are the kind of people who aren't motivated or intelligent enough to move out into other positions. So, there's a lot of in-fighting and people bad-mouthing each other. The internship pays very well (over $20/hour), so people tell me I'm an idiot when I complain. The problem is that the work is so mind-numbingly boring that it quite literally makes me crazy some days. Plus, the three interns were hired to fill in the weekend so the full-time operators wouldn't have to do it anymore. I was the sharpest of the three interns hired, so I got stuck on the night shift where more discretion is expected. Then, I got stuck on the night shift for an entire year, meaning I have no life because I go to school during the week and work on the weekend. My manager was great, though, and I enjoyed working for him--he was an intelligent, funny guy who knew his job extremely well.

So suddenly, right before Christmas, they called together an emergency meeting to let us know that IT was being reorganized and he was being demoted (never found out exactly why).

Then, after a stressful fall semester where I barely pulled through with my 4.0 (overall 3.84 GPA), I went out of town for three weeks for Christmas to visit my girlfriend who lives 800 miles away (she moved away last spring after she graduated, and now I only see her about once every 2-3 months for a week or two). Right after I left, my &amp;%$#@ landlady/roommate/whatever told me that she thought I was abusing her animals and that I needed to get out by the end of the next rent period (mid-January). Of course, how would she know if I were abusing them anyway? She went out of town every weekend for 3-4 days starting the day I moved in, expecting me to take care of them. She has two giant dogs that live in a 6'x12' kitchen while she's at work for 12 hours/day or while she's gone. Whatever, hated living there anyway--I just did it because it was cheap.

I miraculously, with the help of my sister and friends, found a place to move while I was 800 miles from home. Then, right around Christmas, I got sick with a horrible cough/respiratory infection (which I still have, by the way). I drove home while coughing my lungs up three days early to start the moving process, and I moved by myself right after New Year's (while roommate was out of town, to avoid her and to finish before school started).

The current situation is that I've been to the doctor several times. First, the student health center at my school, then my own doctor when I finally got an appointment. The SHC was useless and the doctor refused to prescribe appropriate medicines because she said the research on the medicine indicated the exact opposite of what it actually said. She told me to wait it out. I finally went to my doctor, who treated me a little better, and eventually sent me to an ENT when the problem didn't go away. The ENT narrowed it down to mycoplasma pneumoniae and has begun treating me for that, and it seems to be helping so far, but I still feel miserable.

Meanwhile, I have approximately 0 free time and 0 time to rest because I'm participating in an intense program at school involving Internal Auditing that helps prepare you for the Certified Internal Auditor exam and offers lots of opportunities for internships and jobs. I'm on track to finish school in December (which is a semester early). I had lots of money saved, but when I didn't work for the first year and a half of school, I spent a significant chunk of it. I still have enough left to survive on savings for about 8 months at the current rate, but I'm anticipating some more previously unforseen costs in the summer.

I've had to take a lot of extra time off in the past month for the Internal Audit program, but I've always made every attempt to schedule and practically build my life around my current job/internship. The old manager was always extremely easy to deal with and very understanding, especially when I had school obligations.
The new manager is interested only in micromanaging and doesn't care about me. She expects me to find someone to fill my shift and acts like it's a huge inconvenience. The problem is that they took away our remote access to company email so I can't communicate with anyone except when I'm in on the weekend. She texts me all the time asking me to fill in and even texts me to complain about things I've done. I just got a 3% raise a couple weeks ago on my yearly evaluation and they rated me very highly, especially on attendance and performance.

At this point, I'm so tired, I've been sick for two months, I have money saved but not enough for the final year of school, and I have lots of opportunities. I want to tell the new manager that I'm tired of her s%$# and that she can find a new b%$#&amp; to fill in on the weekends and see how much fun that is. I get lots of financial aid but it may be cut because of the money from my job. The Internal Audit instructor has asked for a couple of students who really want to work hard all the time to come forward for some certification fast-track opportunities.
I'm seriously considering giving my manager the middle finger and taking up the professor on that opportunity, and just sucking it up and taking out a loan if my money doesn't quite make it to the end.

Sorry, I usually write better than this (I won best essay in an undergrad English class last year), but I just feel frantic, like I need to get it out.

Thanks guys."

* **[Click Here to Watch Full Movie Online HD](http://w.atch.me/FMD0q0)**


Franco Zeffirelli’s sappy 1981 teen romance about obsessive love across the class divide – which was based on Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel and starred a young Brooke Shields – gets a glossy remake with Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in the leads. He’s a brooding blue-collar guy from the wrong side of the tracks; she’s a sheltered rich girl who belongs with the country club set. And when they fall passionately in love, her overbearing dad (Bruce Greenwood), still mourning the death of her golden-boy elder brother from cancer, is equally passionate about putting a stop to the relationship. The ensuing love-conquers-all narrative bears as much resemblance to real life as The Lego Movie, but for all its blandness, Endless Love will be pure catnip for its target audience of teen girls.

Although Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) are members of the same Atlanta graduating class, it seems that she’s spent the past four years so buried in her studies that she never looked up and saw the handsomest hunk in her high school. But he’s had his eye on her – and when he’s parking cars at a posh country club, he finally attracts her attention. Under the watchful eye of her cardiologist father, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood), she’s headed for Brown University to study medicine and is scheduled to spend the summer working on an internship with a high-profile Georgia surgeon.  Although her mom, Anne (Joely Richardson), and brother, Keith (Rhys Wakefield), have gone through their mourning period, her dad is still grieving over his older son’s death from cancer – and he’s furious when lonely Jade ditches the internship and invites David to join them at the family’s magnificent lakeside summer home. The friction between the ardent working-class suitor and upper middle-class protective dad is palpable, presumably because David’s widower dad (Robert Patrick) is an auto mechanic and David has blemish in his rebellious past.

Scripted by Joshua Safran (TV’s “Gossip Girl”) and director Shana Feste (“The Greatest,” “Country Strong”), it’s shamelessly clichéd and lamely contrived, discarding the tragic, pivotal elements of pyromania, prison and political activism that were so prevalent in Scott Spenser’s 1979 best-selling novel.  As a result, Hugh’s hostility and subsequent character arc seem more memorable than the titular angst suffered by the infatuated adolescents. Or perhaps it’s because Bruce Greenwood is a more accomplished actor than either Alex Pettyfer (“Magic Mike”) or Gabriella Wilde (“The Three Musketeers”). Which leads one to wonder why Feste cast two, bland 24 year-old Brits as prototypical American teens.

On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Endless Love” is a tepid 3, a maudlin melodrama not worth revisiting. Nicholas Sparks didn’t write the screenplay for Endless Love. Assuming as much is an easy mistake, though. The bestselling author has cornered the market on likeminded, puppy-dog love letters scribbled on the pink pages of pre-teenage girls’ diaries, and those who devour Sparks’ digestible novels should find plenty to appreciate on screen here. 

The rest of us might feel a distinct sense of déjà vu, for assorted reasons. Some will recognize Endless Love from the 1981 version of the story, a steamy take starring Brooke Shields, Martin Hewitt and a young Tom Cruise and James Spader. Others might have read the source material, Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel that has sold more than 2 million copies since first being released. 

Then there’s the simple fact that Endless Love consistently treads down familiar paths that are explored daily by daytime soap operas on each major television network. You have seen this material done countless times before, just by different, equally pretty people. 

Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) has supermodel-worthy looks, comes from a wealthy family, but sacrificed her high school years to study, ensuring a fast-track to Brown where she’ll conquer the pre-med program. Because the cool girls in her class won’t talk to her at graduation, though, Jade feels sad, and wonders if she just wasted the best years of her life. 

Enter David (Alex Pettyfer), the ridiculously handsome “outcast” who must be a rebel because he works at his father’s garage, has a wisecracking African-American best friend (Dayo Okeniyi), and is hellbent on showing Jade the greatest summer of her life… before she has to shoulder the burden of reality and venture off to the Ivy League college of her choosing. 

Say Anything? More like, “We’ve said all of this, over and over again, in earlier films.” You can practically hear John Mahoney’s voice when Bruce Greenwood begins exerting his influence over the film as Jade’s disapproving father, Hugh Butterfield. “Leave her alone, David,” Hugh pleads. “She has a bright future. If you actually love her, you’ll let her go on to med school and live the life she deserves.” 

How do you think that scenario is going to play out between these lovers from opposite sides of the tracks? 

Endless Love isn’t painful. It’s actually sweet in spots. Writer-director Shana Feste bathes her protagonists in that soft, candlelit glow reserved for the covers of tawdry romance novels, and sets her action to a tender acoustic soundtrack that usually sets the mood at your neighborhood Starbucks. Love finds the right cast members for the stereotypical roles that have to be filled, and the performances are above average. Wilde makes Jade tentative, shy and gawky, in a way pretty girls rarely understand. Pettyfer is borderline charismatic, as if he’s slowly realizing how to be comfortable in front of the camera. And Greenwood gives a legitimately invested turn as the sinister, overprotective father trying to do what’s best for his daughter (even though a subplot about one of Mr. Butterfield’s devious secrets goes absolutely nowhere). 

Watching Endless Love, it became clear that every generation deserves its own Say Anything, it’s own Some Kind of Wonderful. These star-crossed-lovers stories have been around for an eternity, and they’ll continue to be told by warm-hearted filmmakers for decades to come. Every generation, however, isn’t lucky enough to have its own John Hughes, or its own Cameron Crowe, and Endless Love lacks the edge and humor that makes the finest of this genre stand apart from the pack. I’m not going to look down on you if you need to see Endless Love this weekend. Just make me a promise that when you come home from it, you’ll also seek out recent movies like The Spectacular Now or 500 Days (of Summer), because they tell the same sort of story, but better. "

I'm not knocking any of those people/situations, I just know when I was looking for jobs, I found all of those things to be very, very frustrating.

The tl;dr of the job is we're looking for a paid intern (college student, recent college graduate, self-taught PHP developer that dropped out of high school - school status doesn't really matter) with PHP development experience to work either part-time or full-time in our office in Richardson. 

I'm one of the founders of Creatuity. We're a small (~25 employees) eCommerce development agency here in Richardson. Normally our HR team handles posting jobs, however, this position will be someone that I delegate to and work with quite a bit myself on some of our more interesting internal projects, so I have been trying to help locate some good candidates.

We have a pretty cool office and we focus just as much on our company culture and fun as we do on our work. It's a great environment and opportunity for someone who has taught themselves PHP but hasn't worked in a PHP position before so they're having a hard time getting their foot in the door (I was in that exact situation myself, so I know how it goes). Successful interns are generally offered full-time, permanent positions if they prove to be a good fit for the job and our company culture. 

Our hiring process is a bit of a gauntlet (we ask a lot of questions) because we really do invest in the people we hire, so we're looking for someone that's passionate and whose passion shows through in the entire application process.

I'm not knocking any of those people/situations, I just know when I was looking for jobs, I found all of those things to be very, very frustrating. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on where to find PHP developers (especially self-taught PHP developers) in the area. I've tried going through the local universities, but they just aren't teaching PHP - they're still teaching so many of the older technologies that are falling out of use. 

The tl;dr of the job is we're looking for a paid intern (college student, recent college graduate, self-taught PHP developer that dropped out of high school - school status doesn't really matter) with PHP development experience to work either part-time or full-time in our office in Richardson.

I posted more details over on the DFWJobs subreddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/DFWJobs/comments/1y9g7r/hiring_php_ecommerce_development_paid_intern/), but I was hoping someone here might have some suggestions of people I could pass this along to in the Plano/Richardson area that are involved in PHP or development in general. 

Thanks!"
1y9nyc,1,2014-02-18,Texas to Washington on a 93 fzr,jgfghfgfhgfhgfhgghfh,motorcycles,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1y9nyc/texas_to_washington_on_a_93_fzr/," I have to transport myself from south Texas to Seattle. I have the option to fly or drive, but this seems like a great opportunity to take a ride. I have a limited amount of time to make this trip, as it is nested between school letting out and my internship starting. 
What are some tips for making this trip?

Pros:
I've been riding for a couple years now, and am intimate with my bike enough for basic repairs.
I have enough money saved for repairs, food, and housing.
I get paid for every mile. At 40 miles to a $3.50 gallon, it works out a couple thousand dollars.

Cons:
My bike is an old whore. It's had an illustrious 20 years spent satisfying three or four owners.
It's been dropped. The crankcase is mostly jb weld right now.
It has no fairings and a pretty aggressive riding triangle.
I cannot afford to break down in bumfuck Utah."

1yb8kr,4,2014-02-18,Graduating with BS in Statistics in May and would greatly appreciate some career advice,The_Tapatio_Man,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1yb8kr/graduating_with_bs_in_statistics_in_may_and_would/,"I am graduating from my University with a BS in Statistics this May, and I am just looking for some career advice from anyone willing to offer some insight. Any and all words of wisdom are greatly appreciated.

Here is my current situation. I am studying for exam 1/P to try and open up some doors down the actuarial pathway, but I know that I will have to take, and most importantly pass, about 3 exams before I will be able to get an entry level position. The studying for the Probability exam is going well, and I plan on passing the exam this March. However, I understand this process of breaking into the field may take a while since I don't have any internships or exams at the moment, I am unsure how this plan will play out.

So, given the amount of time it may take me to break into the EL actuarial field, which is fine, I was considering trying to get a job in industry, but I don't exactly know what the ""industry"" is. Are these just Analyst jobs for ""Company A"" or something along those lines? I have had to work between 25-40 hours a week my entire college career, so working an unpaid internship wasn't really an option for me, so I am lacking in that experience category. However, I have been a TA for upper division stats classes as well as Calc I and II, for the past 1.5 - 2 years, so that might benefit me a bit.

What I feel the job in ""industry"" might provide me is the insight to see whether or not I really want to go to grad school or not. I know that I genuinely enjoy my Statistics classes and programming. The math gets a little dry for me at times, but I am able to get it done and I get that sense of accomplishment after completing a proof. This is my last semester, and I am taking Real Analysis to boost my math credentials up for my grad school apps, since I saw a lot of them recommended having taken that. My overall GPA is 3.15, Major GPA is 3.35, and my GPA the last two years is 3.44. Thought I would throw that in there if it may help to show where I stand.

Basically, I am really willing to go into whatever direction hires me first. Grad school would be great, but I am unsure if I will be able to get into a good program. I really enjoy programming, I've completed Codecademy's Javascript and Python tracks, as well as taken classes which heavily utilize R and SAS. I plan on taking Courseras course on Machine Learning in March, cause to be honest it sounds fascinating. Also, besides R and SAS, would you recommend studying any particular language? I really enjoy Python personally, but recommendations are greatly appreciated. 

I live in the SF Bay Area, does anyone know of how job prospects out here are? I know they're supposed to be good with Silicon Valley south of me, but I 'm pretty certain you need at least a masters to work for companies like Google, and I don't know if I am ""Google Caliber"" if that makes sense.

Anyways, I would greatly appreciate all of your advice, feedback, and/or success stories. Thank you so much everyone!

1ybacf,321,2014-02-18,How I hired a graphic designer,gd2182014,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/1ybacf/how_i_hired_a_graphic_designer/,"So, I'm a long time lurker, and I thought it would be great to share some insight on how I hired a graphic designer. I work for a very small firm that was expanding and we decided to hire another designer. Here are some of my thoughts, which might help others land a job.

**THE RESUME**

* **Design the resume a little but not overboard**. When I mean ""a little,"" I mean it better be more impressive than a standard Microsoft Word document with Times New Roman/Calibri font. However, at the same, do not go overboard with so many infographics, large body of text that's slanted, or bubbles that makes it overly complicated to read and pinpoint.
* **Make the contact information (including the portfolio link) visible and easy to find**. I'm surprised I have to emphasize this, but it's true, I've seen a bunch of resumes where it was hard to find the portfolio link. (ex: hiding a portfolio link in a QR code is not the preferred way to go.)
* **Always include a portfolio link.** This is a follow up to the above bullet. This is mandatory in order to be considered. Or at the very least, somehow include a sample pdf with the resume. A portfolio link is the preferred choice though.
* **Proper grammar/spelling**. This is self explanatory and surprisingly necessary to say.
* **Work experience = BRAG HERE**. This should be the meat and potatoes of the resume. Do not skimp on this. Do not make it a one-liner. I'm very impressed with work experience, so please brag here a LOT.
* **Pay attention to details.** It's one thing to say ""I'm detailed oriented"" and another thing to prove it. What I mean by this is, I will notice things like misalignment, bad font combinations, bad color combinations, etc. This sends a bad first impression, so please pay attention to details!
* **Do not overly complicate your resume.** I've seen resumes with just too much going on to the point that the eye doesn't know which way to read or where to go. I recommend choosing a smart layout that clearly demonstrates all of the candidate's assets.
* **I get it, you know the Adobe Suite, but saying you know the Suite shouldn't take up majority of the resume.** Guess what? Basically everybody who applies for a graphic designer position knows the Adobe Suite. It won't make somebody stand out, so please don't make it the highlight of the resume. 
* **Add a little personality to your resume.** This part, I'm just speaking from a friend's personal experience. She wrote on her resume in the ""interest"" section that she loves going to TV show tapings. She has told me that every single interview she has ever been on, people like to ask her about it. Personally, from looking at so many resumes, a little bit of personality cannot hurt and it's fun to see some differences between resumes.
* **Obviously, include things like anything AIGA-related, awards, and your education.** Most people include this, so it's a pretty moot point.
* **Always include a cover letter, regardless if it's asked or not.** I personally feel a cover letter gives an additional insight on the person. It does not need to be long, but please include one. I personally prefer something that is more than 2 paragraphs but less than 1 page.

**THE PORTFOLIO** - Here are the questions I am asking myself while looking at a candidate's portfolio

* **Is there a variety of workload that shows he/she has mastered the necessary skills?** What I mean by this is, I look at the pieces and I scan to see if he/she has mastered the basic skills. How are he/she's typography skills? Does this person have any working experience in the required field (eg: web/print) and has he/she worked for any clients? Are there any red flags? How does this person use color to convey thought? How about alignments? Also, quality is always more important than quantity.

* **What was this person's thought process?** What parts did he/she do? I love reading blurbs instead of seeing a still image and I'm supposed to guess what that person did. I also love seeing concepts from inception to completion.

* **What was the most creative piece and why?** Obviously, this is very subjective, but it is me asking ""What stood out in this person's portfolio?"" It's usually this piece that I use as a reference when comparing to other portfolios. I am not only looking for someone who can demonstrate the required skills, but I am looking for someone who can demonstrate creativity.   

**THE INTERVIEW**- so, now what?

* **Dress to impress**- This may or may not mean come in a suit, it really depends on where you're interviewing. Regardless of the work environment, I strongly recommend to dress to impress (eg: don't come in jeans!) 
* **Have a strong handshake**- Have a good firm grip and make eye contact when you greet your interviewer. 
* **Talk with confidence**- I know it's a nervous process, but the more confident people definitely stand out in a good way.
* **Have a predetermined set of examples that you can draw on.**- This definitely helps when answering the questions. Common questions that interviewers like to ask are 

1. Talk about a time when you had to complete a project under a short deadline
1. Tell me about a time when you had little guidance and needed to complete a project
1. Tell me about your greatest strengths/weaknesses
1. Tell me about a time when you had to take a leadership position in order to accomplish a task
1. Tell me about at time when things didn't go as expected and how did you react
1. Walk me through your portfolio. Tell me about this project, what your specific role was on it, why you approached it this way, what was the outcome of it, what feedback did the client give, etc.
 
* **Show some enthusiasm and knowledge about the company**- It's extremely impressive if the candidate does his/her research. I'm fairly confident that's how I got hired before (I read online that XYZ company did a big yearly event for the community which coincided with my internship; my interviewer was very impressed I knew and asked questions about it.)
* **Always ask questions**- Everyone should always asks questions at the end of an interview, preferably ones that are company specific. Here are some generically good questions to ask: ""What do you like the least/most about working here?"" or ""How is the company culture like?"" or ""What would my day to day schedule be like?"" At the very least, I think the best question at the end to ask is ""Do you have a business card so I can contact you if I have more questions?"" Being able to reach the interviewer is VERY important so he/she can write the Thank You Letter.

**FOLLOW UP**

* **Always write a Thank You Letter within the same day of the interview**- It does not need to be super long, but it does need to be sent. Preferably by *e-mail* and within the same day of the interview. I emphasize e-mail because I've talked to a friend before who interviewed a candidate and my friend was very disappointed that he/she did not get a Thank You letter. My friend ended up getting the Thank You Letter via post mail many days later, and somewhat too late. 
* **If about a week has past by, do not be afraid to follow up.** Because it happens so rarely, it's impressive when people follow up. Do not be afraid to follow up. 

**OTHER**

* **The importance of networking**- People who are referred have a much higher probability of getting into the interview stage. Even if it's a friend who knows a friend, do NOT be afraid to ask. (After all, the worse that could happen is so-and-so says no)
* **The impressiveness of recommendations**- I actually had people come with recommendation letters. I enjoyed receiving these and considered it a great bonus.
* **Apply early**- For a small company, I got an overwhelming large supply of resumes. I don't think it's normal for every company to shift through every single resume so applying early is a very good bonus to get towards the top of the pile."
1ybokn,11,2014-02-19,Settle some fears for me please,StupidSexyFlanders14,bayarea,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1ybokn/settle_some_fears_for_me_please/,"Hi all. This is very similar to the recent 'ELI5' post concerning the bay area but I have a few more questions that didn't get answered. Some quick notes would be a lot of help, thanks in advance.

I am a graphic design student in the midwest who recently accepted an internship at a successful SF startup. I have family in San Mateo and Pacific Heights and I myself grew up in the Chicago area. Here are my fears for this coming summer and beyond:

The odd resentment of ""techies""- Quite a few posts on various subreddits imply that there is a general dislike of transplants in the silicon valley/startup business. That is exactly what I am. Where does this feeling come from? I understand the fear of gentrification of various historic neighborhoods, but is that mindset generally accepted by everyone or am I just seeing some more outspoken folks here on reddit?

Safe places to live- I am a pretty serious mountain biker and lived in British Columbia and Colorado for a couple summers to pursue that hobby. Obviously I want to live somewhere where I can drive out and be on a trail relatively quickly. On paper and after some preliminary research the East Bay and more specifically Oakland seems like it would be a great fit for me. However with the recent videos of sideshows and dangers I am a bit skeptical. I grew up in the Chicago area and while I won't pretend I ever experienced any of the south side gang violence, I am used to seeing multiple shootings on the news every morning and I know how to avoid bad neighborhoods. Are there enough safe neighborhoods in Oakland to make this work? I want to balance proximity to nature and the ability to have a car with city convenience to be able to meet up with friends and walk to some bars. Any other suggestions on a good place to live? My work will be in downtown SF.

Any help or opinions would be greatly appreciated!"

All the main players are back from the first film, simply titled Thor. Directed this time by Alan Taylor who is best known for directing some of the most popular television series on the small screen. Taylor has recently been sharpening his director’s swords on the hugely popular HBO fantasy Game of Thrones. With this type of pedigree the chap who is better known for television projects must have been seen as being perfect for the second Thor feature.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online Chris Hemsworth is back as the blonde-locked demigod who has a romantic interest in Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster. Considering that this is the 30 year-old actor’s third outing as the son of Odin and brother of Loki, it isn’t too surprising that the role fits Hemsworth like a well worn, but tight, glove. As equally at home in his role as Loki, the untrustworthy and grandiose trickster who longs for his own throne, is Tom Hiddleston. The 33 year-old actor is perhaps the most qualified actor to play opposite Hemsworth as the two close and quarreling siblings. Although, Loki is, as Thor points out in The Avengers, adopted.

Equally impressive is Stellan Skarsgård who reprises his role as Erik Selvig friend and mentor to Jane and unwilling host to Loki, in his head, throughout most of The Avengers. This brilliant actor is equally at home in his character’s skin, again, because he also has played Selvig three times now in three different films. In Thor, Skarsgård was protector of Jane and reluctant friend to the Hammer swinging Asgard. With the news that there will be, at least, one if not two more Thor films in the offing, no doubt Stellan will be back and continue to impress with his skills as an actor.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online In Thor: The Dark World, which is dark, but not too much so; after Odin recites the tale of the dark elves, the audience is brought to “present day” and Thor is sorting out the nine realms and Loki is cooling his villainous heels in Asgardian dungeons. Thor is missing his human love interest and decides to pay her a very overdue visit. Meanwhile, back at Earth, Foster is attempting to move on having pretty much given up on the Demigod ever returning. After being interrupted on a date by her intern Darcy Lewis, played with kooky capability by Kat Dennings who tells her that something odd is happening and that Jane really should check it out; things move to a deserted warehouse in London.

While discovering an anomaly inside the warehouse, Foster stumbles over an artifact thought hidden since the defeat of the Dark Elf Malekith and it invades her body. Thor then turns up and after a short, and amusing, reunion the artifact which is known as Aether has taken over Jane’s system and apart from making her dangerous to others, she herself is in danger. After British police try, somewhat ham-handedly, to arrest Jane for trespassing, Thor takes Foster to Asgard to have her cured if possible.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The film does an adequate job of recreating the Asgardian verse and the only disappointing thing about the film is the loss of Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano who plays Hogun, one of Thor’s band of Asgard colleagues who join him anytime battle is due to commence. At the start of the film, when Thor is sorting out Vanaheim and after defeating the rebellious natives, Hogan is allowed to stay behind to help clean things up. This more than capable actor, who is best known for his role in the Takashi Miike cult classic Ichi the Killer, has not had too much to do in either Thor movie, but, it is hoped that this creative genius will eventually play a larger role in future films.

The obligatory Stan Lee cameo is present, as in all Marvel films, this time as an asylum inmate with Erik Selvig who is teaching the assorted “crazies” in a common room. After the lesson, Lee asks for his shoe back, which Erik is using as a teaching aid. The film does have many small touches of humor, some more slapstick in nature; as when Malekith and Thor hit the roof and side of a glass topped building but even this touch is deft and not done in a “Three Stooges” sort of way.

Watch Thor The Dark World Online The graphics in the film amaze and do not lose a thing by being watched on a smaller screen. The FX are just as brilliant and the battles are impressive. The acting is without a doubt top notch. In a film where “smaller” roles are filled by acting royalty, i.e. Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Rene Russo – who may not class as royalty exactly, but does have an impressive pedigree – as Frigga, there can be no question as to delivery. Christopher Eccleston as Malekith is evilly brilliant and the award winning Idris Elba as the Asgard Sentry Guardian Heimdall is just as impressive in the second outing in the world of Thor as the first.

It would take too long and be ultimately boring to mention all the cast who adroitly make their characters come to life. Suffice to say the script combined with skilfull helmsmanship from Taylor as well as actors who all bring something to the party, Thor: The Dark World is a brilliant sequel to the first Asgard tale of a Demigod who fell in love with an earth woman and stayed on to become the planet’s defender. In this second tale, the film may be dark, but, not too dark. If the other sequels can maintain this quality the continuing story of Thor and his fellow Asgardians will be a special treat each and every time they appear. Available for streaming now and for sale from February 25, this is a real 5 star out of 5 film that in collector’s speak, “is a keeper.” Don’t forget to keep an eye out for another cameo of a miliary sort.

Available for streaming now and for sale from February 25, this is a real 5 star out of 5 film that in collector’s speak, “is a keeper.” Don’t forget to keep an eye out for another cameo of a miliary sort.

Franco Zeffirelli’s sappy 1981 teen romance about obsessive love across the class divide – which was based on Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel and starred a young Brooke Shields – gets a glossy remake with Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde in the leads. He’s a brooding blue-collar guy from the wrong side of the tracks; she’s a sheltered rich girl who belongs with the country club set. And when they fall passionately in love, her overbearing dad (Bruce Greenwood), still mourning the death of her golden-boy elder brother from cancer, is equally passionate about putting a stop to the relationship. The ensuing love-conquers-all narrative bears as much resemblance to real life as The Lego Movie, but for all its blandness, Endless Love will be pure catnip for its target audience of teen girls.

Although Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer) are members of the same Atlanta graduating class, it seems that she’s spent the past four years so buried in her studies that she never looked up and saw the handsomest hunk in her high school. But he’s had his eye on her – and when he’s parking cars at a posh country club, he finally attracts her attention. Under the watchful eye of her cardiologist father, Hugh (Bruce Greenwood), she’s headed for Brown University to study medicine and is scheduled to spend the summer working on an internship with a high-profile Georgia surgeon.  Although her mom, Anne (Joely Richardson), and brother, Keith (Rhys Wakefield), have gone through their mourning period, her dad is still grieving over his older son’s death from cancer – and he’s furious when lonely Jade ditches the internship and invites David to join them at the family’s magnificent lakeside summer home. The friction between the ardent working-class suitor and upper middle-class protective dad is palpable, presumably because David’s widower dad (Robert Patrick) is an auto mechanic and David has blemish in his rebellious past.

Scripted by Joshua Safran (TV’s “Gossip Girl”) and director Shana Feste (“The Greatest,” “Country Strong”), it’s shamelessly clichéd and lamely contrived, discarding the tragic, pivotal elements of pyromania, prison and political activism that were so prevalent in Scott Spenser’s 1979 best-selling novel.  As a result, Hugh’s hostility and subsequent character arc seem more memorable than the titular angst suffered by the infatuated adolescents. Or perhaps it’s because Bruce Greenwood is a more accomplished actor than either Alex Pettyfer (“Magic Mike”) or Gabriella Wilde (“The Three Musketeers”). Which leads one to wonder why Feste cast two, bland 24 year-old Brits as prototypical American teens.

On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Endless Love” is a tepid 3, a maudlin melodrama not worth revisiting. Nicholas Sparks didn’t write the screenplay for Endless Love. Assuming as much is an easy mistake, though. The bestselling author has cornered the market on likeminded, puppy-dog love letters scribbled on the pink pages of pre-teenage girls’ diaries, and those who devour Sparks’ digestible novels should find plenty to appreciate on screen here. 

The rest of us might feel a distinct sense of déjà vu, for assorted reasons. Some will recognize Endless Love from the 1981 version of the story, a steamy take starring Brooke Shields, Martin Hewitt and a young Tom Cruise and James Spader. Others might have read the source material, Scott Spencer’s 1979 novel that has sold more than 2 million copies since first being released. 

Then there’s the simple fact that Endless Love consistently treads down familiar paths that are explored daily by daytime soap operas on each major television network. You have seen this material done countless times before, just by different, equally pretty people. 

Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) has supermodel-worthy looks, comes from a wealthy family, but sacrificed her high school years to study, ensuring a fast-track to Brown where she’ll conquer the pre-med program. Because the cool girls in her class won’t talk to her at graduation, though, Jade feels sad, and wonders if she just wasted the best years of her life. 

Enter David (Alex Pettyfer), the ridiculously handsome “outcast” who must be a rebel because he works at his father’s garage, has a wisecracking African-American best friend (Dayo Okeniyi), and is hellbent on showing Jade the greatest summer of her life… before she has to shoulder the burden of reality and venture off to the Ivy League college of her choosing. 

Say Anything? More like, “We’ve said all of this, over and over again, in earlier films.” You can practically hear John Mahoney’s voice when Bruce Greenwood begins exerting his influence over the film as Jade’s disapproving father, Hugh Butterfield. “Leave her alone, David,” Hugh pleads. “She has a bright future. If you actually love her, you’ll let her go on to med school and live the life she deserves.” 

How do you think that scenario is going to play out between these lovers from opposite sides of the tracks? 

Endless Love isn’t painful. It’s actually sweet in spots. Writer-director Shana Feste bathes her protagonists in that soft, candlelit glow reserved for the covers of tawdry romance novels, and sets her action to a tender acoustic soundtrack that usually sets the mood at your neighborhood Starbucks. Love finds the right cast members for the stereotypical roles that have to be filled, and the performances are above average. Wilde makes Jade tentative, shy and gawky, in a way pretty girls rarely understand. Pettyfer is borderline charismatic, as if he’s slowly realizing how to be comfortable in front of the camera. And Greenwood gives a legitimately invested turn as the sinister, overprotective father trying to do what’s best for his daughter (even though a subplot about one of Mr. Butterfield’s devious secrets goes absolutely nowhere). 

Watching Endless Love, it became clear that every generation deserves its own Say Anything, it’s own Some Kind of Wonderful. These star-crossed-lovers stories have been around for an eternity, and they’ll continue to be told by warm-hearted filmmakers for decades to come. Every generation, however, isn’t lucky enough to have its own John Hughes, or its own Cameron Crowe, and Endless Love lacks the edge and humor that makes the finest of this genre stand apart from the pack. I’m not going to look down on you if you need to see Endless Love this weekend. Just make me a promise that when you come home from it, you’ll also seek out recent movies like The Spectacular Now or 500 Days (of Summer), because they tell the same sort of story, but better. "
1ycdo5,4,2014-02-19,ERP Internship: mapping out the administrive system and making sure the implementation goes well,sentinusdeus,ERP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ERP/comments/1ycdo5/erp_internship_mapping_out_the_administrive/,"Hi there Reddit!

I just started an internship in as small company which has started with the implementation of a new ERP system. They are now in the transition phase and are slowly implementing all the different tasks and software into this new ERP system. It's my task to entirely map out the company's administrative system and make sure the implementation will be successful.

My knowledge of ERP systems is quite small (had a course on SAP/ERP and Business Processes, but it's been 3 years ago). Where do I start? I've looked at a few books, this sub and of course wikipedia. Are there any books you can recommend or online courses I could follow?(preferably cheap/free) All the information and advice is welcome."
1ycflt,41,2014-02-19,"New career, already frustrated",mythrowaway_it,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1ycflt/new_career_already_frustrated/,"So, this is a throwaway account - uncouth I know.  But I am hoping this will garner some good advice from some seasoned IT pros.  I just started my career as a Network Administrator at a fairly large corporation.  However, it's been pretty..unprofessional thus far.  I was supposed to train on the helpdesk for a little while as to learn the systems we support, and then move to the actual networking department after 2 months.  Well, after a long delay, I finally moved, kind of.  I currently sit at a makeshift desk (read: an old return from a broken desk stuck in the corner, propped on someone else's desk), using another Admin's laptop.  My ""real desk"" is still in the helpdesk area, which is completely separated from the rest of the network engineers and admins.  Their excuse is that they ""are trying to figure out accommodations for everyone.""  I feel like that's not my problem and if they wanted to hire me so bad, they would have had it all planned out beforehand.  

It just seems like there's no real plans for everything, at a company that has a reputation for taking forever to accomplish anything.  I'm not going to be on a helpdesk answering tier 1 calls.  That's not what I applied for, that's not what I was hired for, and that's not what I want to do with my career.  I have already approached the boss and have been told something other than what I was hired for - namely, staying in the helpdesk area answering networking trouble calls.  

This is my first ""real"" IT job (barring internships and whatnot).  I'm starting in the industry later than most (mid 30s), so I've had my big boy pants on for quite a while in a different industry.  I hope this is all coherent to everyone and doesn't sound like a madman's manifesto - I just don't quite know how to approach this at the moment.



***EDIT:

I appreciate all the comments, whether supportive or otherwise.

I understand that I am not going to be messing with core routers and firewalls right away, or even a year from now.  However, should I be helping people reset their email passwords or restart their computer because they received a BSoD? No, I don't think I should be.  Answering a network outage call for a remote site?   That's the helpdesk work I am more than happy to do.  Do I expect a mahogany desk and leather high-back chair? No.  I don't think think an actual workspace located near the network team is too much to ask.

I have spent nearly two years answering desktop support and other tier-1 helpdesk calls, pulling wire, setting up APs, firewalls, and soforth, both as an intern and part-timer.  So I guess it being my first ""real"" IT job is a bit misleading.

But again, I appreciate all the feedback.

***EDIT 2

My boss and I actually spoke about this today.  His plan for my position (network admin) is to fill in on the helpdesk when absolutely needed while the empty slots are filled in the coming few weeks.  Intentions were that I would not be used as a stop-gap on a permanent basis.  Desks and whatnot are coming.  So we will see."
1ycmfm,13,2014-02-19,"Me [25 M] and my gf [22 F] of a year and half, financial problems on her side",baskerville654,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ycmfm/me_25_m_and_my_gf_22_f_of_a_year_and_half/,"So we've been in a relationship for nearly a year and half and we don't live together, although we live near each other. I've been working all this time and never had any financial problems, I was lucky that my parents paid for everything in my education, got me a car and helped me whenever I needed. My GF on the other hand, is finishing her degree, she has a moderate student loan that she will need to start paying in 2015, her parents (who live in another country) are near broke and can't help her with anything. She's taking her law degree, and for a good paying job and her dream job (as in lawyer) she would need to take a master's degree AND a non paid internship (it functions differently from the US afaik), and she just can't pay for it and she can't take another loan while she still has the previous one. I actually pay for most of our activities together, like movies, gas, half of dinners (the other half we split), I buy her lots of ""girly things"", etc.. She wouldn't die without me, but I know that I provide a lot of ""good"" things in her life, and I do it with love and pleasure from the bottom of my heart.

Now, I got this really well paying ""job"" in other city (I'm moving there in May), which is exactly where she wants to take her master's and wants to live with me (starting October). Now, three things that are major problems (for me):

- For this job I need to spend one year and half in training, where I only get paid the minimum wage (which is fairly low in my country, but my parents told me they would support me, again) + some expenses paid, before I start making some serious money (and no, it's not a scam, it's actually a government program). 

- Her master's is full-time with some ""after-school"" internships included. She **needs** to have some sort of sustain to pay her loan and pay house/bills. Or move with me and expect me to pay for most everything, and while I can depend on my parents, I want them to spend the minimum with me (if possible nothing at all, which is actually possible if I rent a small room instead of an apartment). Even if she does manage to fit a part-time in there, we would have 0 ""couple time"".

- I don't think I'm comfortable in moving together with her, currently we're going through a rough patch and I don't want to become like a friend of mine, who was living with his GF sharing a house, then they broke up and neither could move for almost a year. According to him, it was hell. Especially since if she decides to take her master's, she would have no other way of sustain and I wouldn't ever have the guts kick her out.

I love this girl, I care about her more than I care for some other immediate family, but I don't feel comfortable with her depending on me. I'm more rational in that department, the only way I would see of us moving together, was if she would have a full-time job and be able to move out (or keep the house) if things went south. But taking a full-time job would mean that she can't take her master's (and her dream). I don't want to break up with her, but with the current conditions, I don't see us living together and her depending on me. I've mentioned to her that it would be wiser to spend a year just working, but she says that she's afraid of never getting back to school and doing the master's, and that the master's would help her getting a much better paying job sooner.


  
**tl;dr**: My GF has a fair number of financial problems and kinda ""wants"" to depend on me. I'm not exactly financially stable right now (although I have no problems and my parents always supported me) and don't want her to depend on me. She would be able to follow her dreams if she would depend on me, I don't feel comfortable with the last part but I want the first to come true.

EDIT: we're not in the US, we're in Spain, so things like FAFSA don't really apply to us."
1yczee,12,2014-02-19,Jake and Amir: The TV Show- My dream cast/guest stars,Chill_OReilly,jakeandamir,https://www.reddit.com/r/jakeandamir/comments/1yczee/jake_and_amir_the_tv_show_my_dream_castguest_stars/,"Since the web-series is (presumably) over, I have begun to think about who else will be in the TV show. Obviously, most of these are unrealistic and are probably too expensive, but still, let me dream, you roach.

**New characters**

* Ed Helms- Todd Hutchinson 

Helms, executive producer of the show, seems almost guaranteed a spot in the show somewhere. Since they are in a new office, naturally they need a new boss. He tries to be a cool guy, but often loses his temper. Has his ""cousin (former NFL QB Chad Hutchinson)""'s jersey hanging in his office. Is not actually former NFL QB Chad Hutchinson's cousin.

* Paul Dano- Gaffney Jordan

Gaffney Jordan, a nerdy college graduate, works at the office as a programmer. He is often the butt of Amir's jokes and is defended by Jake, much like Pat Cassels. Also, like Pat Cassels, does not have a dad.

* Aaron Paul- Billy Braun

This is my own private Reddit post and I will not be harrassed...BITCH! Billy is an editor for the website and is Jake's adversary in the office, as he is intimidated by Billy's fashion sense and ability to get girls. Billy has seen every episode of Gossip Girl. Twice. 

* Cecily Strong- Candice Jemison

One of the actors and writers for the website, Candice is the love interest of both Billy and Jake. Jake is constantly writing sketches in which he ends up kissing her. While acting in one of his music videos, she became John Mayer's least famous sex partner.

* Michael B. Jordan- Lawrence Byrde

Jake's best friend in the office, Lawrence is a standup comedian and writer. Plays a foil to Jake's more eccentric side and is more level-headed than Jake when dealing with Amir's antics. Lawrence is a fan of underground hip-hop music and basketball, except for that blonde guy, #33 for the Celtics.


* H. Jon Benjamin- Royal Stubblefield 

The owner of StubCorp, the company that owns the website. A rich man with a Napoleon complex, Royal is extremely insecure and constantly needs to feel better than everyone. Coincidentally, he and Amir get along swimmingly.


**Characters from web-series (guest stars/cameos)**

* Charlie Day- LeRon

Charlie Day is good at playing crazy people. Whether it's Charlie Kelly, Dale Arbus, or Spaceman Benny, there's always some sort of insanity in his characters. LeRon is a rather crazy individual, and for a bonus point, Charlie and Amir sort of look alike.
*Possible scene: Amir leaves work to go play laser tag with LeRon and take the kids' juice*

* Don Cheadle- Amir's dad

It only seems natural, right? Was originally considering Idris Elba, but then realized that Amir's dad has to have skinny, spindly legs, which obviously suits Don Cheadle more. This cameo appearance would also possibly be doable, since Ben Schwartz stars alongside Cheadle in House of Lies.
*Possible episode: Amir's dad makes a surprise visit to the office*

* Julia Louis-Dreyfus- Amir's mom

This is a perfect fit. More than perfect, actually. Subpar.
*Possible episode: Amir's mom stays with Amir and visits the office and Amir embarrassed by her* 

* Louis C.K.- Jake's dad

Louie's reddish-brown hair matches Jake's and if you've ever seen Louie, which if you watch J&amp;A I assume you have, you know that he is quite capable of playing a fatherly character.
*Possible episode: We meet Jake's family at Christmas, where Amir somehow shows up at the Hurwitz' family party*

* Pete Holmes- All of Amir's oddly-named friends

Pete Holmes seems destined to be on the show as well, since he was a guest on the podcast and now also has his own show on TBS. A great way to utilize Pete's talents would be having him show up anytime Amir names one of his strange friends. 
*Possible scene: Bradlynn films Amir's audition tape for The Real Housewives of Atlanta*

* Ben Schwartz, Allison Williams, Thomas Middleditch, Rick Fox

It's not Jake and Amir without them.
 
* Shia LaBeouf- Mike Fink

Shia plays Mike, a lowly intern."
1yd1db,13,2014-02-19,[trigger warning] Found this subreddit recently and after reading it for awhile I think my parents may be narcissists.,Shadeslayers,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1yd1db/trigger_warning_found_this_subreddit_recently_and/,"Hi everyone,

This is difficult to type it all out, but I think it will be helpful to have feedback from such supportive people. I'm also not sure if my parents behavior can be explained by the fact that they're religious... or narcissists.... or a good amount of both.

I'm engaged to get married to a girl I've been with since high school, we've been togethor for 3 and a half years, I'm a junior in college and turned 20 a couple months ago.

For my 20th birthday, my parents sat me down (the night I got back from school) and told me that I need to marry my fiancee immediately or they will no longer support me. They tell me that in their religion it's not good for me to see her or be with her without us being married, and when I call them out on being hypocrites for treating their son poorly due to religion, they insist that they have to love their god, and love their prophet more than their children.  They are also VERY concerned with how god will judge them.. as opposed to my well-being.  My reaction to this was to not say much, and I just walked out. Immediate NC... I had had enough.  I couch surf for awhile, and then another family in the city hears what happened and intervenes and gives me a place to live until I can return to school. They probably saved my life... 

Anyway, my parents insist that I'm a liar and I was never honest with them.  Yea, I lie to them.  But it's unfair to say I was never honest with them. I always told them about my fiancee.  They were always against me being with her (As long as I lived in their house I wasn't allowed to see a girl!). When I first started liking her, I told my parents about her. I told them about all the things in my life, I wanted them to be able to support and help me with things.  But whenever I would open up to them, it would backfire with them threatening to kick me out, saying that they can't let me be with her because it makes them look bad (to their muslim community.... the nearest family of which lives about 50 miles away). Because of this, I eventually closed off. They make me have panic attacks, I have anxiety. The few times my fiancee would come over I wouldn't let her out of my sight because I CAN'T trust them! I'm paranoid about my privacy, because when I lived there I had none (go through my entire room, rifling through my desk drawers and stuff to find condoms to see if my fiancee and I were doing it or not, and then telling me that I should not have admitted to them that we had been! They went looking for that, and it's my fault they found an answer they didn't want to find. Oh, and at the same time I'm dishonest. Even though I was open about it when they finally asked me instead of going through my shit when I wasn't home).

My mother used to tell all of her kids (I have 3 younger siblings who are still stuck there) that nobody would ever love us like she and my dad do.  Now, that comes across to me as her being insecure, and trying to just have control over us. I have a wonderful fiancee and future in-law family who have all shown more love and acceptance towards me than my parents have.  I think she also said it just to guilt us whenever she wanted us to do something we didn't want to.

I've had LC since I moved out, beginning of December. I've gone back twice, once for my things and once to get mail that was sent there and my passport/soc card/w-2 etc.  Both times I've gone back end with them trying to guilt me, trying to explain to me how I'm wrong and they're right, which always makes me angry and ends with me yelling at them. I don't know how, but through everything I've managed to become very very assertive as an individual, and take no shit from nobody. I'm very sensitive to it now.  I also can't handle criticism well, I have panic attacks, and I can get angry very easily in reaction to witnissing somebody being treated poorly.  I also can't make friends, because I don't trust people. I'm always sure that a person will find a way to hurt you, one way or another. The only exception to the rule is my fiancee, for whatever reason I just think the world of her and she's perfect and all that nice stuff.
Anyway, the long term plan is for complete NC with my parents.  I've gone to the school psychological center and had a meeting with a nice lady, and she set me up for an intake appointment for next week.  I hope it helps.

Over the past 2 weeks I've been reading this subreddit, and it's helped me grow and be less angry already. Previously, I thought that having NC was the best way to hurt my parents and get revenge or whatever. Now I realize that NC is simply a healthy decision. They make me feel bad. So I will stay away from them. They are bullies, so I will just walk away.  They're angry? they're upset? Doesn't matter. I don't have to worry about it anymore. It's the best freaking feeling in the world man.  I COULD fight my parents, I'm good at arguing, I enjoy it even, and I'm sure that I would at least be able to break my mother down. But that doesn't accomplish anything good. I need to work on healing... and I am afraid that I show a lot of these tendencies as well so I want to better myself before the marriage and kids come long haha.

Doesn't the fact that I'm aware of my problems and want to fix them mean I'm not a narcissist?  
I know if I said to my parents they were narcissists their reaction would be to be outraged, hurt, oh how COULD I say something like that?!?!, etc..

In my head, even now, I think to myself ""Well maybe they're half-narcissists... surely they're not that bad. I'm just being dumb and acting up like they always said I do."". They always insisted I was overly emotional....... which is funny because if I'm overly emotional, then I don't know what my fiancee expects when she says I need to work on being more emotional ahahaha.  I keep thinking that my parents religion (Ahmadi Muslims, for the record) justifies their behaviour, that's what they've drilled into me for the past 20 years of my life.  It's really hard to think that they are like the people that I read about on this subreddit all the time..... but I have the same 'horror' stories, the insanity.. I just don't know.
I'm terrified of being told that I'm the one who is overly emotional, that I'm the one who is messed up and simply wants attention, and that my parents were right. And my parents were being good parents.  This summer will be my third summer working under a fortune 500 company (first summer I was in a contractor position, second and upcoming summer I will be in the internship program, rehired), they like having me there, I do good work there, I enjoy it. I do well in school, I'm on track for getting a computer science B.S.... I'm engaged to marry a wonderful beautiful kind woman.. what more could I do to make my life perfect? but to my parents i'm never doing enough.. idk.

I'm sorry I rambled.

**tl;dr - Not entirely sure if parents are narcissists. Have a few examples of stuff they've done as well as my experience of LC over past 3 months.  going to therapy now, to try to fix how I doubt myself and think that I am the one who is messed up. Are they narcissists? I don't know... I think so?**


Also, I have a full story typed out, but it's VERY long... so I will throwthe full story in the comments and apologize for the rambling nature of it. The full story is what I'm planning on showing to the psychology guy who I am seeing on monday."

1ydr2z,2,2014-02-19,Looking for a mentor or some advice,[deleted],Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1ydr2z/looking_for_a_mentor_or_some_advice/,"**The Short Story:** I'm a recent graduate who is having trouble seeing what I should do for my future career goals. 

**The Long Story:**  
So I'm a recent graduate from an undergrad program at a liberal arts university. I come from a family that's not very well off, so I chose my university based upon how much financial support they would give me, and upon their level of prestige. 

I'm trying to figure my post-grad life out right now and I'm hoping maybe someone who has been down this road might be able to give me some advice. 1) The film production side of my school's department was basically killed off after my sophomore year 2) as a result I decided to not be a film major and just focus on teaching myself and making work on my own. and 3) because of the attitudes fostered at my alma mater there are not very many alumni working in film, or who are accessible to me. 

I'm looking for advice because I feel a need to focus myself and put together a more concise, more actionable idea of what I should do with my career. 

Here is my current situation. I graduated last May. Before graduating, I started my own student production company, since production had been mostly halted directly through our school. I directed 2 music videos in the Fall, and a short film in the Spring of my senior year. Technically this was all done outside of any official school program. I finished post production for the short film in November. 

My school is in Boston. I decided to go back to my home state of Texas after graduating. I now live in Austin. I'm currently working as a salesman in an AV store, and working a paid internship as a graphic designer at a start-up accelerator. 

I've done a little freelance work but in general it's a little hard to get paid in this town. I don't have a local work history, and my school, while being a well-endowed private university, is virtually unknown outside of New England. 

Most importantly though I am not exactly sure what I actually want to do... So technically I didn't major in film. I was originally double majoring in creative writing, and fine art, with a minor in film. (double majoring was pretty common at my school). I dropped the minor and the writing major because I felt I had taken all the classes useful for actually making stuff (versus writing academic focused articles). I chose to focus on teaching myself what I needed to know, and to strike out on my own. 

But what to do about an actual career? That's a hard question because on one hand I have a very specific idea of what I want to do, and I also do not have a very concise or actionable way to achieve it. I'm the kid who knew what he wanted to be when he grew up since 2nd grade, and yet there's an important gap in my thinking missing. 

Bear with me, as I try to put this into words. What I want to do is be a storyteller, and honestly the exact medium doesn't matter too much to me. I'm interested in film, books, visual art, games, literature, comics, any way of telling a story really. This isn't just a general interests, flights of fancy either, as I've created sustained work in multiple mediums, and I'm very conscious of the pitfalls of becoming a ""Jack-of-All"" trades. 

My thought process was that I would use the limited resources I had to make the best work I could, and after graduation I would try and get any kind of job I could in the creative industry and see where that took me, If I ended up getting a job in film, then I'd focus on film, and leave the other stuff as personal projects, if I ended up with a job in something else, then I'd pursue that, and film would take more of a backseat. So far that hasn't happened. 

Other people who I look up to who I think reflect my own positions are guys like Wayne White (currently a fine art painter, who was an art director for Pee Wee's Playhouse and directed music videos and other weird projects in the 90s) and Rob Schrab (went to school for illustration, made a famous comic, won an Oscar for his script of Monster House, and he's done a bunch of directing/writing for a bunch of TV shows too). 

I see my skill toolset as being an asset, but I feel like I need to focus things in order to start gaining ground. Right now I feel stuck, and I don't know what to do, or if I'm just treading water. 

Currently there are only 2 things I see as possibly on the horizon. 

1) I've applied for a grant through my school to do a year long documentary project which fuses my art, film, and story telling interests together. It's an exclusive grant but highly competitive. I won't find out about that till May. 

2) Working with start up companies has put me in the mind set of maybe... starting my own company or something? The student production company I started was pretty limited but if I could get some investors I feel like I could perhaps start growing something worthwhile. That seems like a pretty wishful option though. 

I've also thought about grad school but pretty strongly though against it. While I do feel like I have so much more to learn, I don't think it's worth accruing the extra debt, and the academic posts which those degrees open up, are supposed to be shrinking in number every year. 

Does anybody have any advice or life experience they'd like to share?

Oh yeah and just so you can get an idea of my experience level:

Here's a trailer for the film I directed: https://vimeo.com/80128671

That was made for a tiny budget, with a skeleton crew, outside of and in addition to an Honor's thesis. It has it's flaws but I still think it's impressive considering the circumstances. 

And parts of my other work, fine art/illustration related, can be found at my blog (I have an actual portfolio website but it's not super up to date right now) 
http://jackalopeconspiracy.tumblr.com/

**Lastly:**  

I want to hear people's honest advice. If you have had to make hard choices about these sort of things, in your life, I'd like to hear more about it. "
1ye8hm,2,2014-02-19,Is it acceptable for me (20f) to email an ex-coworker (26f) for some help with getting a job at her work?,workrelationship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ye8hm/is_it_acceptable_for_me_20f_to_email_an/,"I just want to start by saying I'm not expecting her to be able to do anything, but wondered if it were even possible or acceptable to reach out to her in this manner. 

To summarize - I was an intern at her last place of business, and she left at the end of the summer (I started in late May). She was a huge part of the reason I even got hired to begin with, as I wasn't very experienced at the time, and she was amazing to me when I started working there. She helped me with so much and was always very kind - this meant a lot to a pretty shy girl. I gave her a card and some well-wishes when she left, and she told me to email her at any time if I ever needed anything.

Welp..

Now I'm looking for a job for the summer. I would love a paid internship, and my goal is to try and secure one. The only problem is, in my field of interest, there are very few businesses that pay their interns full time. Actually, there are pretty much two (in my city, which I have to stay in due to financial constraints). This ex coworker of mine works at one of them.

-----

I was wondering if it is appropriate for me to reach out to her about this. I don't want to come off as if I'm asking for her to ""put in a good word"" for me, even though I suppose that's sort of the case. I guess I just need help a) knowing if this is even okay and b) figuring out what to say to her in the email. I figure I'd start off asking her how she's doing and whatnot, and then ask her if she knows of any summer intern positions opening up in her department. 

Does this sound like an okay idea? Let me know what you think, or if you have any better suggestions. Thanks!

-----


TL;DR - Thinking of asking an ex-coworker about securing a position at her place of work... I'm applying in general already, but I'm wondering if reaching out to her could give me any further influence - and if this is even acceptable to do.

1yellw,2,2014-02-19,[20F] Trying to figure this out,hawkxs,questioning,https://www.reddit.com/r/questioning/comments/1yellw/20f_trying_to_figure_this_out/,"Also, this really is probably not my only issue (general depression/anxiety [on meds] has been getting more annoying lately, mostly due to type 1 diabetes/stress/life), but right now I feel like it's the biggest one, affecting my general quality of life and self-whateverness. And 'solving' this one I think will help with the rest.

I really like labels. Being able to say I fit in this box, this box, etc helps me know where I am in the world and what I need to do next. (I am an INTJ. If you know anything about us you will understand this whole post.) So my sexuality being more or less the only thing I can't put in a box right now is really bothering me. I just wish there was a definitive gay-straight-bi-pan-etc quiz or something. 

So I guess I'll start from the beginning. Was always a tomboy. Wore my hair short 1st-3rd grade, grew it out, and chopped it off again for 5th-7th grade. Want to chop it off again now, but professionalism and internships and all that crap (says my mom) so ought not to do that. I totally get it because last time I gave zero fucks about my hair. Still don't really, ponytail everyday, so understandable. (end random tangent #1)

Never had pink crap. Parents had no desire to give it to me, I had no desire to want it. Since the age of 5 I've probably worn a dress five times. Since I was old enough to pick my own clothes reasonably I've pretty much exclusively worn cargo pants and tshirts. (it gets worse?) Obviously these are guy's pants, and honestly the only women's clothing I own are a couple of dress shirts and pants. (end tangent #2)

I play ice hockey, have since 5th grade. Bari sax. Am going to school to be a biomedical engineer. Attending a traditionally male dominated school (ratio 3:1 right now guy:girl). Know of LGBTQ stuff on campus but don't really know who/what/when/where and don't really have the time for it right now. It's a smaller school, Midwest, but pretty progressive for our area I'd like to think. (end tangent #3)

So I always kind of thought I'd end up with one of my two best friends throughout elementary/high school. Both were guys and are super cool. High school came and as one does, I thought about a lot of things then. One of my good friends has a sister who is gay and had a hard time coming to terms with it due to her religion. So I kind of put my thoughts aside at that point because it didn't seem like the best thing to be talking about. The rest of my friends were/are atheist or agnostic so that whole thing didn't really matter to them (at the time I considered myself agnostic, now pretty sure in my atheist label). So I put that box aside and didn't really consider it again until now.

In high school I would go through my friends and random other people in my mind and do the whole 'would I go out with them?' thing. I had way more girls on my list than guys. My high school only had about 800 kids though. But I could only come up with 3-4 guys I would have gone out with and easily 10 or more girls. 

Add another thing to my pot - I've never actually been in a relationship with either gender, kissed anyone, etc. the whole shebang. So I have no idea really. But the idea of the male body is not as attractive as the female body to me. I will look through the assorted subreddits from time to time and definitely enjoy women, clothed or not, more than the guys (although I still appreciate a shirtless guy in good shape). Also /r/dykesgonemild...

In tune with the whole internet thing I've started watching a ton of YouTubers who are gay or otherwise not straight and find myself identifying and agreeing with a lot of the things they say. 

I guess I currently am pretty darn sure I'm not straight. I just don't know if I can really call myself gay. Self-labeling and all that, but I don't want to offend (?) anyone by trying to be something that they may not define me as. It would just be easier to not deal with this, but I think it's dragging me down a lot and I want to figure it out. 

I guess with some reassurance then we go to the whole coming out thing. This is part of it, I think. I think I know the truth and just want it out there, so I'm not using a throwaway; I want anyone who knows that hawkxs is this other person (a couple people irl have found me and honestly it's not too hard if you know me) to just know. I am not good at asking about or telling about touchy-feely stuff; it's why I'm going to be an engineer. I just want to box this and have it out there. 

Last tangent, I think. I have a number of family members who I really respect and love and do care about what they think of me. I am reasonably sure that some of them won't care at all, but I'm not as certain about others and would be really sad to lose them over this. They are somewhat serious Catholics, definitely politically conservative, but also not stupid.

I really want to talk to my mom about this. I've been stewing over this for the past few weeks if I'm honest, and just am not sure how she will take it. I think she'd be fine, but I don't know because obviously I've never told her anything like this before. She's from a conservative and intelligent background, and was raised Methodist but obviously never indoctrinated me in anything. I've heard my parents discuss a couple other gay people we know (we actually have neighbors, they're super nice), particularly during the whole Boy Scouts thing because there was a boy in the troop who while in the troop wasn't out for a number of reasons but came out shortly after he got his Eagle. Their opinions of him had nothing to do with that fact, and I think my dad said that if the board had said something about his being gay, my dad would have been obliged to say something - he's very much a separation of church and state kind of guy, and although the troop is chartered to a Methodist church, there's no reason to discriminate based on your own or the organization you represent's beliefs.

I told myself I'd write this post, and I have. Please help me figure this out, or otherwise how to become comfortable in society as whatever I am. Also, thanks for reading if you got this far."
1yez9n,113,2014-02-20,IamA former SpaceX engineer intern AMA!,enderfusion,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1yez9n/iama_former_spacex_engineer_intern_ama/,"Howdy, Reddit! My name is Andrew, and I'm a mechanical engineer from Texas A&amp;M. During the summer of '11, I had an awesome experience at SpaceX as an intern for the Structures department.  
My school was having an engineering career fair with about 250 companies attending. Most of the companies were your standard oil and gas types, and I’m not the climb-the-corporate-ladder-type. I walked up to the SpaceX booth, handed them my resume, and told them I had no interest in any other company except theirs. I explained to them how I was the most hands-on, critical problem-solving engineer they were going to find in the sea of khakis walking around. It didn’t hurt that I happened to have a video on my phone of some static firings of large scale rocket engines I had recently machined.

About a month later I was called from an L.A. phone number, and more information was collected. They requested that I write a two-page essay detailing why I was the right candidate for the internship. I sweated over that thing for like a week. In the end, I tried to cram as much passion into my explanation as possible. It makes me sad that I couldn’t be an engineer in the golden days of the 1960’s and the Apollo era, but this was the next best thing. A few weeks later, I did a few phone interviews with some senior structural engineers. Tip: Google your interviewers; knowing their grad papers on torsional chassis stiffness clenched it. After getting to L.A., I learned that they collected about 8,000 applications for the hundred or so positions. Apparently they appreciated my passion and enthusiasm. The single factor that probably helped me the most was being a part of the Formula SAE car team at school. Literally 50% of the interns and a lot of the employees had been through a similar program. I absolutely advocate doing the program if you’re still in school. It prepares you so well for facing real work deadlines, budgets, and working conditions. #becauseracecar

At the time, SpaceX only had about 1,300 employees. They hired 125 interns and crammed them into one apartment complex in Venice Beach about two blocks from the water. We carpooled every day because not many people had cars. That definitely led to some people getting stuck at work and spending the night there!

The culture at SpaceX, at least while I was there, was fantastic. The caliber of people in terms of technical excellence and talent was the most impressive I've ever seen.  Very rarely did I ever feel like I had a complete grasp on the problem I was tackling. It was a complete fire hose of real world engineering concepts no one outside of advanced aerospace would hear on a daily basis. I brought some structural theory books from school (Shigleys) and definitely used them. While cliché, the term I would use to best describe the engineers I worked with was passionate. They were there for the same reason we were there. WE WERE BUILDING FREAKING ROCKETS! I could never get over the fact that one could go downstairs and walk amidst Merlin engine bells and giant composite structures. Thai food, lots of coffee, and unlimited frozen yogurt is currently fueling the American private space race. 

My particular role in the Structures department had to do with the solar panel assembly and the electromechanical widgets. My mentor threw down the challenge within the first couple hours of starting there. I think we had my first print to the shop within the first week there. It was a crazy, insane rush of CAD, prints, FEA, and manufacturing. Shipments from McMaster arrived twice daily, and it was a slow day if nothing went to prototype. The challenge of it all was the most fun.  A lot of our parts are visible in this shot. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BgykXmJCcAAlONc.jpg
There were a few fun incidents. The first was a scheduling nightmare. Our team was holding up a test that apparently had a $50k / day penalty. We worked for something like 30 straight hours and through the night to finish assembling the solar array for its deployment test. In the middle of the night, we realized that we were one titanium fastener short, and the inventory room was closed for the night (it was 2 a.m. at the time). There was no way we could burn 5 hours of time waiting, so my mentor decided screw it, scaled the 15-foot chain link fence surrounding the storage room, let me in, and we got the part we needed. He said he’d rather explain to Elon why he broke a rule than a $50,000 delay. Security sent him some nice screenshots, and his boss didn’t say crap. 

Another fun time had to do with that same looming test. Back then the machine shop didn’t have any shifts running on Sunday. No matter who we pleaded with, we couldn’t get any approval to get someone to come in on Sunday to make some super-hot parts for us.  They were my design, and I felt responsible for getting them done and didn’t want to be the cause of the delays. I ended up convincing the manager of the auxiliary machine shop to give me key-card access to the machine shop after hours so I could come in to machine the parts on a Bridgeport mill after hours on Sunday. I probably broke about a million HR and union rules with that one. It was one lonely intern making chips in a 100,000 ft^2 shop, after having set off the building alarm badging in (security never checked it out).  Needless to say, I tried to finish quick. Six hours later, I threw the parts down on my mentor’s desk. Win. The unspoken expectation there was that you knew what the hell you were doing. This was an immense privilege that was not taken lightly. Most of the interns got to do things that full time aerospace engineers wouldn't get to achieve with 20 years. 

There was a lot of drinking, partying, and nerding out. In the end, I had 30 or so parts make it to A-rev and fly in space. It was an absolutely fantastic experience that I wouldn’t trade for the world. When I got the job offer, I had lunch with one of the VP’s and talked about it. He said I would be absolutely crazy for turning it down. In the end, I had to say no to the full-time offer. I chose instead to stay in Texas, get married, and work at a startup engineering firm.  Now I work with electron beam fusion and advanced additive manufacturing. Definitely a good decision, though I still miss the grandeur of it all.  Thank you Elon for the great experience!!! I’m happy to answer any questions.

1yfcoc,158,2014-02-20,The 12:30 AM phone call. An exercise in controlling contact.,BigAngryDinosaur,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1yfcoc/the_1230_am_phone_call_an_exercise_in_controlling/,"It's arguably one of the last tools in the toolbox. We all know how a phone call after a certain hour is highly troubling. When a family member calls you in the middle of the night, its more often than not bad news, and depending on your family's habits, it may be the signal of very bad news. 

So here I sit with my phone on my desk, showing one missed call. ""Parents. 12:29 AM""

I sat and watched it ring. I had no intention of answering this call. I already know that standard family conventions do not apply when that particular name appears. And even though I've been trained so well that such calls have been, with a 100% reliability factor, utter bullshit, I still could feel myself jump out of my skin. Every inner voice screaming: ""*What if this is the one time it really is important?*"" and putting all these visions in my head of every possible scenario, from a full-scale family disaster to my father sitting beside an empty bottle of brandy and a gun, reaching out to finally make amends for his behavior before doing something drastic. 

That inner child in me shrieks in panic. Ready to jump into action, to pick up and take care of whatever the problem is this time, and carry it until everything is better once more.

**That's what they want**. That's why treated you like you were so incapable for so very long. That's why they dressed you, why they picked out your hobbies and chose your friends and washed your hair for you in the bathtub even after puberty, even when you tried to cover yourself with a washcloth, hoping they would get the message that you were embarrassed.

And it was this knowledge of what they really want, hard-earned after decades of shame, guilt, insecurity, needless distress and emotional breakdowns, that told me not to answer that call.

*Shame on you*, my frontal lobes stepped in and said at the last second. Shame on you if you answer that call and spend the rest of the night staring into space and replaying the belligerent, inebriated, overly-emotional and dramatic conversation in your head. Over and over, wondering what you could have said different, imagining the things you should have said, the alternatives you could have tried this time. A new strategy in hopes of finally achieving some kind of connection, or at least getting through to them in some way the message that they are hurting you.

""*If you can just get them to realize that they're hurting you, they might change, just try to explain..*."" That tiny voice grasps at slippery straws, desperate in some deep, long unkempt corner of your psyche, desperate to have daddy and mommy happy, giving you love, reassuring you again. 

*jingle, jingle!* There it goes again. A second call. That means it must be important, right? No, no voicemail. It's bullshit. Like everything else you were ever led to believe. 

By answering that call you are allowing them into your room, to adjust your covers, to arrange your nightstand while you sleep, to control this quiet hour when you should be resting and at peace. 

Do not answer that knock. Do not forget what happens when you let them in on their own terms. They are like vampires. Do not feel guilt, because you did not do this. You did not create this long and incomprehensible story. You are not the one who has abused so many privileges for so very long.

Just for tonight, rest and be yourself. Do not be a product of them, do not be anyone's son or daughter. Right now you are just *you*, and you are not accountable for the problems of the poor, broken people who brought you into the world. You do not owe them anything, least of all your well-being.

*jingle, jingle!* ""1:00 AM. Missed Call: Parents. (3)""

You've responded like a good child over and over and over, and how did it make you feel each time? Was your reward worth it? Was it even about you at all, or are you just a part of the narrative being written in the mind of someone who doesn't even recognize the existence of other people?

It's time to stop feeling guilty. You are the star of your life, not an extra or an unpaid intern to your parents. You will not be punished for not wanting to be used. Get some rest and do something great for yourself tomorrow."

I'm back in school now and have to make a CV so that I can apply for an internship. However, my GPA is really bad and because I failed a really important course during my first year, I don't have the knowledge I am supposed to have for my career path so I don't see how I can get an internship or be of any use when I get there.

My parents like to remind me how much of a failure and disappointment I am. Unfortunately they only have one child and that child is a source of shame. I'm afraid for my future because I am a failure and I'm not sure if I will ever find employment if I do.

A little info:
I am a strong programmer.
I know the big languages (Java,C#, SQL,HTML ...etc)
I have had two internships worth of experience (8 months and 5 months )
I am looking at the CT, RI , lower MA area for work.

I have seen tools that say I should start from anywhere between 50k and 70k , but I feel that software developers who get paid 50k a year are under valuing themselves.

1yg6in,6,2014-02-20,Check my logic?,aceshighsays,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1yg6in/check_my_logic/,"I am having a hard time deciding on whether or not to renew my lease, and if I do renew it, if I should take a 1 year lease or 2 year lease. Can you please check my logic?

1. My current rent is 1300. One year renewal lease will be 1400, two year renewal lease is 1450.

2. Market: from craigslist and trulia, the cheapest apt I found in my area is 1200. The next cheapest is 1250. But there is one apt of each. 3 apts available for 1300. I didn't like any of these because they were either on the 1st floor, they were smaller than my current apt or no dogs. There were also 2 apt for 1350, 3 for 1400 and 5 for 1450.

3. I don't want to move to a different area because I will be further away from the city, won't have a grocery store/laundromat near by and I don't have a car/don't drive, I need to be very close to the train station. 

4. I figure with broker fee/realtor's fee (1200), credit check (150) and 1st months rent (1200), moving (600) it would only make sense to move to an apt that costs 1200 or less; and I stay in it for 2 years. Over a 2 year period that will save me ~1700.

5. I'm apprehensive about my decision because I was laid off late last year and I decided to go back to school this fall. I'm currently studying for the GMAT and will be applying shortly. If I get into the school then I will take 1 - 2 years off and live off my savings (which I can afford). I will also do internships during the summer. If I don't get into school I will get a job and nothing will change. 


From my observation:

It makes sense to stay in my current residence, since there is nothing available under 1200. I'm not 100% set on a 1 or 2 year lease, but they are both within the market value of apts renting in my area. I plan to stay in my current city for at least 5+ years. And I'm assuming the prices will continue to rise next year. I will pay an extra 1200 if I take the 2 year renewal lease. I think 2 years would make sense?

edited: added: moving costs, ""realtor's fee"", savings for 2 years if my apt costs 1200."

Both asked for business casual dress. Would this require a tie in your opinion? I was thinking to just go with a blue dress shirt and khaki dress pants. Thoughts on that? I did wear a suit for my initial interviews.

Also I know the office visits are more relaxed, but I'm pretty anxious. I'm expecting several informal interviews, but how can I nail them. In all honesty, I get nervous when trying to just be casual. It's something I need to work on, my conversational skills aren't quite where they need to be. I got through the on-campus interviews fairly well but was also a little scattered during thoem. Guess I did good enough to make it to second rounds though so that's a confidence booster. Any tips/advice?"

1yh3y6,15,2014-02-20,Perpetual anxiety,sool32,hownottogiveafuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/hownottogiveafuck/comments/1yh3y6/perpetual_anxiety/,Hey I'm doing my second internship and I'm such a nervous and anxious person. People on my first internship said the same thing and I had hoped I would have matured. But im still a nervous fuck. My energy levels skyrocket whenever a social interaction comes up and I can't think straight. It makes me do stupid things and seem really awkward and unsocial. I've tried saying to myself that it doesn't matter what other people think and that I should stay calm. But all that goes out the door when someone comes to talk to me. Do you guys have any tips or advice for someone like me. 
1yieep,23,2014-02-20,"Every time I talk to my mom, it destabilizes me emotionally.",[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1yieep/every_time_i_talk_to_my_mom_it_destabilizes_me/,"I'm not sure if what's wrong with my mum is narcisissm or just a need to have all of her immediate family at home and acting properly. My brother and I were homeschooled until high school, because my dad told my mother her spending habits (which are on par with his) were out of control and she needed to get a job again to support them, and therefore she couldn't continue homeschooling us. I lived in the (freshmen only except in special cases) dorms all through my undergraduate education except for my final year, because I had the choice of living there or at home (an hour and 45 minutes from where I went to college) and then moved back in for my final year. 

Things were semi-okay until I moved out after I graduated in order to do an internship in another state and attempt to be an adult. Since then, she enjoys calling me and berating me during her drive to and/or from work about never coming home (which has to be for the *entire* weekend Friday night to Monday morning even though I am not a minor and do not live there even part-time, can't be just for Saturday night dinner or something), how I must hate my 82-year-old grandmother, detailing everyone's physical ailments to me and how horrible that it is I'm not there to help them and be with them, telling me how miserable and unsuccessful I'll be if I don't listen to her and/or come home because she's ""seen it in other people"". I realize it's probably completely unfair to block out my dad, brother, and grandmother along with her, but she drives me crazy. Every time I talk to her I can't focus for several hours afterward, I feel like probably killing myself is the only way I could get away from her, and she dismisses anything I have to say against her and her behaviour because my family loves me, and if I loved them and was a good daughter I'd just come visit them for a weekend. Her favourite thing to say is either ""I didn't say that"" or ""you're being dramatic again."" My whole life she's told me I have a dramatic personality. Maybe I do. I'm not even sure anymore since she exaggerates everything else, and considering I'm incredibly introverted and generally try to avoid causing any trouble or having any attention on me negative or positive, I highly doubt that's the case.

She says they have a great time and always get along and stuff, but whenever I visit or am at their house for any period of time &gt; 2 hours, some drama always goes down, whether it's my brother tuning everyone out by playing video games and refusing to answer anyone who talks to him, my grandmother shutting herself in her room too much, my dad getting angry/paranoid for no reason and breaking shit or just being verbally destructive, or my mom just creating unneccessary noise and drama. I'm terrified I'm like her or that something's wrong with me in general because I'm pushing them away, but whenever I overcome my doubt and interact with her it just ends up fucking with my head again. If I answer the phone she verbally beats me up either over my shortcomings or things that have gone wrong during her day; if I come home she complains to me constantly and all kinds of drama that could be avoided happens. 

It makes me want to never speak to anyone again, especially people who profess love for me, and it's made having meaningful romantic relationships really, really hard. I started going to a therapist and that's helping some, but I don't know what to do. There's no way I can change her, and to avoid her is to avoid the rest of my family. The worst part is, the concerns she brings up are at least partially valid, though her reasoning is full of logical flaws and I generally don't have the 4 hours of travel time plus multiple hours of social ""oh you can't go to your room now, the TV show is getting good, sit here and watch it with us even though you don't watch TV, profess to hate it, and don't own a TV"" because I'm in graduate school and working at the same time, to be there as much as she'd like. 

My grandma is getting old, and I do need to call her more often. I'd like to hang out with my brother more but I don't generally know what to say. if I spend extended time with my mother, my father, or my grandmother they just talk at me to fill space even though I have absolutely nothing to contribute to the conversation other than ""yeah, uh huh, that sounds horrible, oh my goodness"" over and over and over. I've never told any of them shit and yet my mother tells me I never share anything *anymore* and I used to.

Am I a terrible person for wanting to stay away from her so much I start to lie and tell her how much homework I have even if I am done for the week, or if I have plans (even if then she makes me feel bad for having plans because I can't spare *one single weekend* to come home)? Is there something wrong with me that I want pretty much absolutely nothing to do with any of them, have nothing in common with any of them (they're fundamentalist, conservative, capitalistic, and demand everyone share their views) except my brother, and want them to leave me the fuck alone? I've even started researching personality disorders because I'm terrified *I* have one, because the way she/my dad/everyone tells it is everything is perfect all the time, except then I come home and everything's a shambles and people are yelling and drama everywhere and my brother shuts everything out and my grandmother hides in her room. I just want them to forget I exist. Is there any way to be in *good* contact with them, convince my mother I don't need to come home for an entire weekend, and interact with her/my dad/my grandmother without being overwhelmed by the amount of emotion I get barraged with any time I talk to any of them, especially my mom? How do I avoid emulating their behaviour? How do I have a better relationship with my brother without jeopardizing his relationship (or lack thereof) with the rest of my family? Is it bad that I just want them to leave me alone to the extent that I start to avoid all humanity in general when my mum's really gotten to me?

tl;dr entire family messed up, how can I deal with it without unravelling myself? I'm not entirely sure *I'm* not the crazy one and that they're all normal and people are just like this but I can't cope. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, and holy crap that was way longer than intended D: !!"
1yiqka,10,2014-02-21,"I am a 20 year old man, looking for advice in many personal/professional aspects of life, and for direction towards a self-disciplined path.",[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1yiqka/i_am_a_20_year_old_man_looking_for_advice_in_many/,"I am a 20 year old American male. Sophomore at University on full merit scholarship, studying Computer Science and Math. I am of slim physique, 135 lbs. and nearly 6 feet tall. I am of decent intelligence (3.6 GPA in Computer Science, generally excel at liberal arts studies, online IQ tests lead me to believe I am at around a 130 IQ). I am a musician: I play the saxophone and was brought up learning piano. I've always been a good student, a decent friend, and everyone has told me I am going to be great. Now that I have so much freedom with my time and habits, I want to really start becoming the man I want to be.

I am a decent student at a small liberal arts school, I think often, I write rarely. I would like to work in the computer science industry and I'm pretty sure I can be successful there. I already have a paid summer internship lined up and my resume, by the time I graduate, will be a tremendous asset for starting my career. My school is well-regarded for the liberal arts, and its CS/engineering department is growing but small. I am an only child, and close (but growing distant from the long distance) with my parents. Ultimately, I see myself doing something unique - starting my own business, working in animation or film, or teaching English - but before I get there, and before I get too rooted down in a career, I want to begin bettering myself, and broaden my experiences. I am just not sure where to start.

My goals are (in no particular order):

1.) Gain mass, and become as physically fit as possible. I enjoy swimming, I am okay at the gym, but I have no regiment or schedule, and my form on most weight-training exercises is not good. My posture is poor and my flexibility and mobility is below average. I am not sure where to start to fix all of this. Recommendations for particular fitness programs geared toward young slim men trying to gain mass and strength, for yoga programs for someone with absolutely no experience with yoga and poor flexibility/posture, for meditation, for diet, all of that, I would gladly accept. 

2.) Become a man. I am an only child, and have never really had to share or be overly concerned with the comforts of others. I want to change this, become more selfless, develop meaningful relationships, and become more confident in general with new people, friendships, and women. I have looked at The Red Pill and I don't know how much it resonates with me. I want to remain respectful of women, and learn from them, but I also want to be a man, and know what that means, too. I want to look like a manly man, act like a manly man, keep neat, respectful, informed, and confident like a man. Short of joining the armed forces, how can I start building these key habits? How can I become disciplined, confident, and manly?

3.) Become more disciplined with my time. My sleep schedule is generally unpredictable and shitty. I live in a Fraternity house so there are always many sources of distraction, but I want to become productive during the day, rise early, work in my free time, and relax in the evenings. On weekends, I want to still rise early, and be productive. I always think of myself as a successful adult, rising with the sunrise, going for a jog, eating a full breakfast and coffee, reading and writing, really taking advantage of that 5am-9am time before any of my classes start, to better myself and make good use of my early morning, rather than sleep it away.

4.) Become a better writer. I'm not bad (I receive good grades on essays in classes, I'm better than most, and I have a good voice), but there are areas that need improvement: my grammar needs to be strengthened, vocabulary enriched, and mindset broadened. Ultimately I would like to teach English, or write. Much will happen between now and then, but I want to know what to do. Should I read more classics? Write every day? Both? Something else?

5.) Gain an edge in the Computer Science industry. Right now I have only completed a few courses (have completed Fundamentals I and II, both in Python, with II teaching most data structures, also completed Calc I-III, currently in Computer Organization - a hardware class - and Interactive Computer Graphics - an OpenGL/C++ class - and Linear Algebra and College Physics II) but I'm starting to get well on my way to completing a B.S.; however, I want to self-study and I'm not sure where to start. What are the most important aspects of CS to dedicate my time to, if I truly want to be successful?

6.) Become better with money, budgeting, taxes, all of that - I will be making a decent salary this summer for three months at an internship, and this will be my first time having such an income. What should I know about budgeting, saving money, paying taxes, all of that.

7.) Cut the vices. Over my first two years away from home, I've smoked a decent amount of weed, a cig here and there, hookah with friends, a few drinks if there's a party, LSD once. I don't really regret going through any of that -- I never did any of that in high school, so I needed to experience it at the end of my teens -- but now that I am entering my 20s I feel like I need to cut out all that crap and be an old-fashioned good man who drinks a decent amount of coffee, alcohol socially, drugs rarely. I want to be able to live with myself, and take good care of my body. I also tentatively include pornography with these vices and I, like most young men, am an avid consumer, and I think it needs to stop.

8.) Take good care of my body. This sort of goes with (1). I want to learn how to cook good meals (I really have no idea how to cook most things) so I can stop going to restaurants so much when I'm not at school/home, I want to develop good eating habits (I am underweight, always have been, and fed up with being that way). I want to have good quality of sleep. I want to be flexible. I want to have a healthy heart, organs, brain, and skin (I've always had light acne and I want it to stop, advice for that would be great). I want to fix my posture. I want to think clearly. What vitamins, nootropics, lotions, face soaps, etc should I invest in? Good ways to start meditating? Recipes for those clueless about cooking?

That is about it. I'm open to anything. I'm a 20-year old male, with the world in front of him. I've had a sheltered life. I've travelled but always had a plan. I've gone far away for school but collected no debt. I'm only a few semesters into my major yet I have a full-time internship lined up. I weigh 135 on a good day and 130 on a bad one. I am just kinda floating along doing well enough, but I'm not truly happy. Things seem to fall into place pretty well for me, and I don't want to screw it up. I want to take advantage of this freedom and these good circumstances to become a man, confident and well-dressed, fit and flexible, disciplined and productive, neat and old-fashioned, rested and healthy, informed and well-read, prepared for a CS career and a better writer, and comfortable with money.

When my father was 20, he dropped out of college and worked shit jobs to stay afloat, and made himself a success. He gained discipline through rough times. Sometimes I think I need to experience such roughness to become a man. Because my circumstances don't force me to become more disciplined, but rather provide me freedom of time and money, I need to learn self-discipline. I know there is a wealth of information out there about the things I have asked for help with. But if any of you have gone through similar times, and found answers in a particular place, plan, idea, or subreddit, I would love your advice and direction. Thank you, and best of luck with your own endeavors. "

1yjiqc,1,2014-02-21,Facebook’s Company Pages Strategy and How-To,VonazonInc,socialmedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1yjiqc/facebooks_company_pages_strategy_and_howto/,"This article will guide you in how to set up a company Facebook page as well as strategies for how to manage it.

While Facebook may have lost a step with the cool kids it is still America’s go-to social network. If you don’t think your company or brand need to have a Facebook page(s) consider this: chances are your competitors already have them. This is a lost opportunity to increase brand awareness and drive revenue. If that’s not enough think about the multiple social outlets willing to give voice to your clients opinion about an experience with your organization. There is no need for you to be unaware of publicly posted complaints about your organization. Setting up a page is easy. While there are fifteen steps to setting up a Facebook page for your company (we know three more than an addiction recovery program) it shouldn’t involve tears.

Facebook Company Page Setup Instructions:

Go to Facebook.com and make sure you are logged into the account you want to manage this new page from- probably your personal account.
Click on the “Create Page” option
Choose what type of page you want to have. This will be generally either be “company” or “brand/product” depending on your needs.
Choose the category best describing your industry. Be careful, you cannot change your company category unless you delete the page once chosen.
Type in the name of your company; no capital letters in the middle of a word. For example, Facebook would have been acceptable but not FaceBook.
Check the “Agree to Terms” box (perhaps you should have a lawyer for this part)
Click “Get Started”
Add a description of your page. Keep it clear and brief.
Add websites your clients will be able to access from Facebook page.
Facebook wants to know if your organization is real, we’ll leave this one up to you.
If you answered “Yes” Facebook wants to know if it is your company. This is where you can add administration privileges so you can potentially prevent the intern from posting photos of what they looked like after happy hour.
Upload your company logo. Follow Facebook’s specifications.
Add the page to your favorites on your Facebook account and your web browser for easy access.
Ad posting. This will be the first of Facebook’s many attempts to separate your organization from some of its money. Skip this for now
Voila, you have a Facebook page.
 

Your Facebook Company Page Strategies

We do not recommend posting every minute to your account. Consider how often you want to be updated on social networks from your clients when deciding to post a message. Until your page has thirty “likes” and you have access to Facebook’s analytical tools (data about your customers browsing habits), block search engines from finding the page. Make it a perk for your biggest fans and favored clients to have the first look at your Facebook page and “like” your page and make suggestions to spruce it up. Once you are confident everything is in working order unblock search engines and let anyone “like” you on Facebook.

There is a variety of content that can be posted to Facebook. You can link to sections of your website, photos, videos, product information, blogs, customer testimonials and more. Most of your content should be about your company, but feel free to post client content, acceptable humor, unsung employee heroes and the occasional viral video.

Don’t forget to play good defense. Set up Facebook pages for names like “(Yourcompany)sucks” and use your imagination as to what anyone with an ax to grind can dream up to follow your company or product name. You may want to have a duplicate page for common misspellings of your page name as well. Follow these tips and with the new business your page brings in you may be able to afford a social media department!"

1ykka5,1,2014-02-21,"(EX) Girlfriend [20F] of 3 months broke up with me [20M], said she doesn’t feel like being in a relationship at the moment but still wants to be friends. I can’t move on, and desperately want her back. Need advice.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ykka5/ex_girlfriend_20f_of_3_months_broke_up_with_me/,"A bit of background information on our relationship. We met in college during the first week of classes and we quickly became friends. We could tell that we both liked each other, and after a month or so of getting to know each other and formalities we started dating. Everything was great. We spent almost every day together, practically lived under the same roof for the rest of the semester.  We clicked, fell hard and fast. After the semester ended, she landed herself an internship and moved back to her home city to work for the next semester, while I stayed in school. During this time, I live 1.5 hr drive away from her, and we would skype/call every day and I would go to visit her over the weekends. 

About a month earlier on a Tuesday night, my girlfriend and I got into an argument over something really small (I think it was about music preferences). She’s pretty sensitive, so similar situations had happened before where she’d get mad initially, but I would apologize and suck it up and the arguments would be over in an hr. However, this time I had brought up the issue that she’s always overreacting to small things, which made me feel like I’m always getting the shorter end of the stick. I had a feeling that eventually everything that’s stored inside will break because there’s only so much I can take, and I didn’t want anyone to get hurt in the future, so I wanted us to work together and fix this issue. But after a talk over skype she said she’s seeing more problems in our relationship, and that she can’t change or compromise. She asked for some time alone to think about stuff, to which I agreed.
 
Fast-forward to the weekend, I went over to see her. We had a talk and she said we shouldn’t see each other for a while. She said she doesn’t want to be in a relationship right now because she can’t compromise, she’s treating me less than what I deserve, doesn’t appreciate me as much as she should, and that I’ll be better off finding someone else that deserves me. She also says that she loves and cares for me and still wants to be friends, and that “if we’re meant to be, we’ll be together again”. As much as I tried going against it, she said she has made up her mind. I want to wait for her, so I asked if she still sees us back together in the future, she said yes, but she doesn’t want to make empty promises and give me false hope.

For the next couple of weeks, we still talk/text/skype every day, and although they were in a bit of a platonic manner, I can tell that we still have feelings for each other. Our texts would be the first things we see in the morning, and our voices would be the last thing we hear before we sleep. Following these signs, I thought this wasn’t gonna be as bad as I thought it’d be, and that I can wait for her and be back together again sometime in the future. But since last week, she has been talking less and less, and just seems very uninterested. I feel that she’s given up and moved on.

Needless to say, I was heartbroken since the breakup. Still am.  I know that 3 months is relatively short compared to most, but it doesn’t indicate how we felt about each other. Aside from the occasional bickerings, we were perfect for one another. We really wanted each other to be “the one”, as cliché as that sounds. We loved each other so much that our relationship suddenly falling apart seems so unreal, almost like a nightmare. If anything, the thought that “we had loved” is the only thing that eases me to sleep at night for the past few days.

And now the worst part is that not only has she moved on and I haven’t (don’t think I ever will, at least for a while), I don’t know if I can be friends with her, because I can’t bear the thought or sight of her dating anyone else, although she said she won’t. I also feel that the reasons she gave for the breakup, the good old “it’s not you it’s me” is not the main or only reason we broke up, and I want to know more about what she thinks, but I’m afraid that I’ll push her away even further if I press her for answers.

I feel lost and confused. I’m angry but I don’t know who or what I’m angry at. What do what do.

Thanks


---   
TL;DR

G/f of 3 months broke up saying she doesn’t want a relationship, still wants to be friends, but her recent actions lately says otherwise. She seems to have moved on pretty quick, I haven’t and I don’t think I can, and I want to wait for her, as foolish as that sounds. There are also many questions that I want to ask her, but don’t know how to bring it up given the situation that we’re in. I don’t know what to do. How do I move on so that we can at least still be friends?

1ylqxs,1,2014-02-22,I'm [23/m] not sure if I should even have the idea of rekindling my friendship with [23/f]. How can I get over her?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ylqxs/im_23m_not_sure_if_i_should_even_have_the_idea_of/,"I'll try to make it as non-cringy as possible but I feel that it is not possible and its super cheesy and overtly melodramatic.

So, I had a confidant and to me she was a really good buddy. She was in a relationship with a friend, so I never actually 'liked' her but I really enjoyed her company. Maybe because she was one of the very few girls we had in our program or because she was super nice. Anyways, I was a man-child and I had my tantrums, but generally it was against other people and I would then confide my issues in her. It was not a healthy relationship but overall I feel that she enjoyed the time with me and we had a good friendship.

Because of our program, we sort of worked in different companies for a year and she started having family issues. But me being a man-child and a massive idiot got really annoyed at her when she didn't reply to my texts or messages. (A year earlier it had been perfect where we would talk regularly and it was really fun). This went on for about 7-8 months where I would get angry at her every few weeks for not replying or other things. Frankly now that I think about it, I can't believe she even kept that going for 7-8 months. I was in a really bad depression in that time frame because the work was boring and it was a drag. Eventually, we had a huge fight where words were exchanged and then it was imminent that its not gonna last long. However, we tried being friends, being nice to each other. But eventually, in one of our group events it went really bad to the point where I pushed her really hard in anger and it blew up to a point where we just ended it.

However, once it ended, I began to really miss her, and in my desperate attempts, I tried to talk to her to bring things back to normal because it was effecting our friend circle as well but it turned uglier. Eventually our school started again and I generally ignored her for a bit but then I realized that she actually doesn't look at me altogether and as a reaction, I started staring at her trying to be her opposite. In the mean time, I had hit rock bottom and contemplated suicide multiple times. The reason it went so bad because everything went bad for me, my other friends laughed at me, having her around really made it much worse, my marks were bad, i had to rethink the area i was going to major in. At the end of the semester, I was finally invited to a friends gathering (first in 6 months) and she came there and did the same thing where she didn't acknowledge me at all. In my reaction (sheer stupidity) I intimidated her, trying to make the experience really bad, it may even be classified as harassment. Obviously, once it happened, and some more kicking and screaming, I avoided her again for four more months. At the end of my undergrad, I burst out at them once in a lab, but to her boyfriend and not her. After that, in my four months I finally had a break as she moved away to intern before she started her masters. I spent that time to look back at what happened and I realized what the fuck I had been doing. Out of that year and a half long ordeal, I felt that finally i was out of the depression. Things mended between my friends, and I finally felt ""grown up"" and in control. There was some anger towards her as I feel that she really provoked me certain times to prove a point to my friends how I am some sort of rapist.

Fast forward to now, we both are doing out masters. For the first semester, we had same classes but I managed to do my thing while she did hers, we avoided any sort of contact including eye contact. I still haven't spoken to her in real life. However, I am taking the same salsa classes as she is, so we end up dancing together and to me I don't really feel any emotions while dancing with her. The issue is, we talked (a couple of email exchanges) about insignificant things but I suddenly got the idea in my head that there maybe a chance to be friends again. So for a past couple of weeks, all these emotions are surging again, sometimes I am really angry, sometimes, I feel like really apologizing to her. The very fact that these emotions are coming up again has gotten me really scared. What do you guys suggest I do? I will see her around as we are in the same program for 6 more months. I think that there is a lot of bad blood between us and it is impossible to fix it. How can I get over her?

EDIT: The reason why I am so hung up over her was because she was the first person in my entire life to whom I actually opened up and she helped me a great deal."
1ylzzp,6,2014-02-22,Just got out of debt,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ylzzp/just_got_out_of_debt/,"Side question: What is a boglehead and how do i learn from them?

 I am 24 working since I was 16. My current and latest job has paid the most  netting about $25k for the past 3 years...only...I have no idea where that money has gone. All my years of work. Other than having a motorcycle, travelling Asia a bit twice, and raving for a couple years, I don't know what I did to use it all. Even doing all of that I should still have tons saved.

I have bills, but I still live at home and even w those bills, I should still have thousands saved. I have nothing. I recently (just last week) got out of debt. I didn't have much but it was just always a few hundred dollars in liability holding me back. It's amazing how just $500 in debt is so damaging. I can't imagine thousands. At least I was that sensible.

I basically feel so stupid when I talk to my friends who have all this money saved, or envious when they tell me their parents paid for their college. I have a $17k bill waiting when I graduate this May.  Luckily I have a job which makes $53k a year I landed that I'll be starting. 

A couple goals I have are getting braces ASAP as I would like to start that 2 years  wearing period elapsing as soon as possible. Total price is about $6200 (2k down payment with $268 pmts for 16 months, or 3k down with $187 pmts for 16 months. Both no interest)

I want to start an emergency fund as I have nothing. Ironically, I am interning at a financial services firm. I am learning TONS about retirement, investing (mutual funds, etc), and all the ways the advisors help clients meet their investment goals. I am also learning the true importance and seeing actual figures and the power of compound interest. I'm so lucky to have found a real internship, teaching me instead of having me fetch coffee. Right now I'm studying Kaplan's Series 6 with them.

I also want to pay off my loan obviously, and move out of my house later this year. I want a small place and I honestly don't care if it's a studio as long as it's pretty nice and the area is good (dependent on where I'm placed at the new job). 

I will edit and write more when I get home, I'm on my phone. 

I own YNAB. What do u guys think I should do? How should I start towards these goals?

**edit**: at home now, adding more info. So basically, to clarify, *which* goals should I start towards first? On the one hand, I want to start the braces so I can get them going. I want to get my teeth straightened as soon as possible because regardless of what anyone says, people judge during interviews, for jobs, etc. They aren't bad, but I just want them fixed. But then I also realize from reading this sub that emergency funds are incredibly important, so I want to work towards that as well. So, the consolidated list of my goals for the next 6 mo.-1 year are. Not sure which order they should be in:

1. Get braces, going to cost roughly $6200 (~278/mo. with 2k down for 16 mo. OR ~$180/mo. with 3k down for 16 mo. Ideally i'd like the lower dp, but with my other goals, and my start time desired might not work?)

2. Emergency fund. Right now I have literally $60. I want to start saving. I feel embarassed that people my age or younger have so much money saved. On top of their parents paying their tuition jealousy etc. I need to get these finances in order. (I also want to invest into mutual funds too, but I know this fund is more important now)

3. Move out my parents home. I'm 25 this year and I think it's time to go. Not to look too much in the past on my life and make excuses, but I really think leaving the house is necessary for a young man to find his way. I've spent my life since 16 working and going to school, while trying to maintain sanity with a social life on the side. I feel I need my own space to truly see what I want to do, map my path, and go after my goals. Currently, I don't know what the fuck I want to do tbh, since all i've been doing is striving to keep sane while doing what I do now.

4.Pay my college loan. I have about $17k in loans incl. interest. I went to community college and then a CSU school so thankfully it's not crushingly large debt. I do want to go for a Masters in the future. Perhaps in Finance or MBA. *This would be some years down the line though.* I'm not sure, but I'd like to go to a top school (for that chance, I need to start finding out what I want to do and work into an incredible career to outshine my 3.0 GPA) and also I need to get 760+ on GMAT. If i got into a top school, I'd take loans and quit a job. It'd be worth it to me, because I never got the true school experience of just studying. and also, if it was a top school, the chances of me getting a job would be a lot higher. I don't think i'd get a loan to attend a whatever MBA school.

1ym2kx,5,2014-02-22,My sister (26/F) thinks that I (24/F) am using her and am being unfair to her. My younger sister and mom are on her side.,throw_sisaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ym2kx/my_sister_26f_thinks_that_i_24f_am_using_her_and/,"First some background on my sister: My sister has always been unmotivated to work. Friends pushed her to go to college and so she got into Interior Design and got her degree. She tried working with a friend and that friend was an asshole because she used her and did not pay her for six months of work. She had also been in a long distance relationship for about seven years but his family did not agree to their marriage and they both decided on a mutual break-up. He's married now but they still talk. I think my sister needs to go no-contact on him but it's her life. After the six months of work she didn't do anything else. She gained back all the weight she lost and her skin developed acne. My mother doesn't help by criticising her all the time (although it's lessened now because I told mom a bit harshly to stop it). She sits around reading stories, fan-fictions and obsessing over one thing or another (the Olympics and now K-pop for example). In the beginning I resented her for not helping dad out by getting a job and working, but then she told me that she just didn't want to work. We pushed her to start her baking business but she only waits to miraculously get a job so she does it and even that's rare. Family and friends have tried talking to her, to explain that it's not good for her to do nothing but she gets defensive and continues doing nothing. She gets proposals for arranged marriages but they all reject her. I'm not a big fan of arranged marriage and think she can do better but that's her choice. Her day consists of her sitting by her laptop reading stories and driving one of us to any place we may want to go to (not a regular occurrence) and only recently, after an aunt suggested and I helped, that she decided to go volunteering. So she now volunteers once a week.


Background on me: I always wanted to be a graphic designer. After I finished school, I got a degree in Multimedia but the school sucked and I pretty much studied Comp Science. During college I discovered that I was a homosexual, something that is illegal where I live and a huge taboo. I came out to my sister who adjusted and I'm so grateful for that. I fell in love with my best friend who used my feelings to make herself feel less lonely. That lasted three years and things got bad enough that I developed bulimia and started cutting. I kicked the friend out of my life and kept looking for work while doing freelance jobs. I got back with my girlfriend and she and I both changed ourselves in positive ways, so we're much happier with each other (we're long distance). I got over Bulimia (almost completely recovered but not entirely) and cutting too. I almost relapsed just now but that's why I'm keeping myself distracted by writing this post. I recently landed a dream internship, and they could hire me if I worked hard enough. But the commute is hell... and so for what the problem is.


I don't have a driver's license yet. I procrastinated because I have a fear, especially where I live, where cars and people come in front out of nowhere but also because of money. My father is supporting my two sisters, me and our mom. Because of outside expenses, money's been a bit tight for a while. My family has followed the patriarchal system and so it was only after graduating college that I dipped my toes in professional work without my father feeling offended about it. I want to be independent and I want to help out my family with bills. I started freelancing in my field. In the past few months, my jobs have required to travel long distances to meet with clients. I asked my older sister to drive me around and since she was drove me around a couple of times, I told her that I would give her some percentage of the money I got, which I did. Besides that, some days where she would have to wait, I'd give her money to relax at a coffee shop or have lunch somewhere nice. Now with this job, it's two hours away and I have to take a bus -&gt; the metro -&gt; another bus, where going back: walk twenty minutes -&gt; metro -&gt; bus -&gt; cab, that after a 9 - 10 hour shift. It's my first week and it's been awful after freelancing for a year. I'm hoping that it gets easier. Till then I'll be using my pay to help dad pay for my driver's license (I'll have to take weekend classes though) Oh well, life's shitty. In the beginning, I made a proposal to my sister. I told her that if she would pick me up in the evening, I would once again give her some percentage and if she collects that, she will have enough to buy that machine she wants at the end of my internship. She told me that her life did not revolve around mine and since then has been cold with me.


I should explain the room situation, as well. My sister and I share a room, while my younger sister has one of her own. We shared fine in the beginning, but after I graduated and started freelancing, I would often spend nights working and I needed the lights on or needed to concentrate while I worked so I preferred working alone. She started sleeping and then spending all her time in the living room. I told her that she could use our room and sleep there but she told me she preferred the living room where she got her privacy as well. I do have some issues with control, as in sometimes I need things to be in a certain manner and they have to be that way, otherwise I get very anxious, so I can also understand why. I have mild OCD that my sister has been aware of since she's witnessed my ""rituals"" from a young age. I take care of our room, I clean it even on days when I've been working for hours and have no time. I even clean the mess she makes. My mother and a maid do all the house work. The only time my sister takes charge of the house is when my mother leaves for the home country.


The younger sister is 16, pampered and does nothing at all, in case you are all wondering.


So now the problem is, today it all came out. My sister has been talking to my mother and sister and now mom told me that my sister thinks I'm being a snob who thinks I can throw around money and use her. My younger sister thinks that I'm using my sister too and being really unfair by not letting her use her room. I have done no such thing. I have two days off and my sister volunteers on the first day of the weekend. I told my sister that I want her to get ready (to go out to her volunteering job) in another room because I am completely exhausted and I would like to sleep in. My younger sister is angry at the injustice of my older sister not having use of her room (she's so angry guys, she can't even muster up enough generosity to share her own room) and of me using her in general. The reason why I offer to pay my sister because I've needed her assistance desperately in the past and I've always had to beg and plead her for it, so now I offer money instead.


I'm trying to help myself now so I can help my family in the future. I don't have any money - I'm strapped for cash. My pay isn't much and I'm still looking for freelancing jobs. I'm trying to gather enough money so I can travel and visit my girlfriend but it's so difficult because I have to pay for my mother as well (she won't let me travel alone since it'll be my first time). For now, I try to take as many of my own personal expenses on my own as I can, and some of the house too. I am conscious of the electricity that is wasted by my sisters and always try to keep the bill low for dad. It's all I can do for now. 


Sometimes I feel sorry for my sister but then I see myself and just think that she's lazy. I don't know how to approach this at all. And why am I being blamed and accused like that? Like I'm this bad guy who thinks I can do anything I want and walk over anyone with all the money I have - I'm not like that. I've been thinking about giving my sisters an allowance so they don't ask dad. I wish so bad that my sister would help out so my parents could get a break, I'm trying really hard from my side and I feel hopeless and alone. They need savings desperately but this is an expensive place to live in. I know things are difficult but I am not a victim. And I am not what they think I am - but why do they think that and what can I do?

Over my summer internship, I grossed $10,500. From January 13- January 14, I received about $18,000 in scholarships/grants. I would say about $12,000 went to my tuition. This leaves about $6,000 in taxable income plus the $10,500 from summer. I already had my wages withheld from my summer internship.

My issue is that my dad is planning on claiming my tuition and scholarships on his tax returns and I am claiming my summer wages on my tax returns. Is this going to pose an issue?

Wouldn't the most correct way to do it is that I file all my tuition, scholarships, and wages on my own tax returns? What happens if he claims my partial income of scholarships on his and I file my taxes on my summer wages?

He is also claiming me as a dependent, when I am pretty sure he didn't provide 1/2 of my income of the past year, but I can't cause issues because he'll refuse to give me his tax returns for my college education.

The program has you specialize in either pure math, applied math, computational science, or statistics.

I'm trying to decide between pure math and computational science.

Pure math would obviously prepare me for a career in academia. But this is a little unappealing due to salary and having to teach pre-calculus to a bunch of freshman who don't want to be there. 

Computational science would prepare me for a career in the industry. But I still have no idea what computational scientists even do, despite googling and looking around.

I know what quants do, but outside of finance, what do computational scientists do?

And I'm not sure if I would even enjoy it. I have taken around 25 college math classes, but they were pretty much all pure math.

I guess I could try to find an internship this summer in computational science and then spend my first semester taking computational science classes and see if I enjoy it?"

1yo5ac,4,2014-02-22,How do you go about finding purpose in your lives?,dan_1993,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1yo5ac/how_do_you_go_about_finding_purpose_in_your_lives/,"I don't know if this post has any place on here, as I am neither suicicidal, nor diagnosed with depression. And frankly, as I know what other people have been through, I always feel like an entitled brat whenever I try to bring these things up. I'm trying now, so please don't judge.

I have so many reasons to be happy. I was brought up by loving parents. I'm a sophomore in a prestigious college, yet I can't remember the last time I was happy. I engage in student life as much as I possibly can, being chief editor of the student magazine and honor rep of the business society. 

Still, I simply cannot connect with anyone there and at their exclusive parties I feel excluded even though I was the one sending the invitiations. Whenever I tell my parents how lonely I feel they just tell me to get out even more, to engage even more. But I'm just so sick of fake smiles, spending time with people I don't like and who don't like me. I'm sick of the drinking, the constant nagging about internships or grades, sick of feeling like a loser for not appreciating those things. 

I've tried to escape into my academic work in economics but deep down I suspect that I'm not intelligent enough to produce anything of significance. My parents live far away and seem to be getting by just fine without me, I have no siblings, few friends and no SO to care for. Thus, I guess I've put all my expectations on myself. My only forms of self-validation are work and academics and if I can't even excel in those things, what good am I? I feel like shit. 

Seeing everyone's successful image in fb doesn't help, and while I have thought about deleting it, I can't force myself to cut my online friends off. These relationships are double-edged swords because while I can engage in rewarding, meaningful and fun conversations with these people, unlike my fellow students at college, they all live so far away that I can't go and see them.

While I haven't suffered much from depression before, I really feel like I'm losing ground and the uncertainty scares the shit out of me. Maybe there's something out there for me but I just can't see it. Friends on r/depressuin, how do you find purpose in your lives and what would you suggest I do?

And to those who suffer way more than I do, my heart goes out to you too. Hang in there!

Just for your information: I'm a 22 year old male, with little to no dating/relationship experience..

I've met this girl (21 years old) online, and we've been talking via facebook-text-whatsapp-snapchat-... for more than a month now.
Conversations have ranged from serious, to funny, to even flirting with eachother.

However.. Every time I try to ask her out, she's either always busy, or something comes up a couple of hours before the 'date'.
Because she has an internship that also sometimes requires her to show up during the weekends from 2-10pm, I realize that she wants to use some of her free time as 'me'-time just to relax. 

But a couple of days ago she also refused to go do something together because she had to start at 9am the next day, which is no problem for me of course. I went out with some friends and had a great evening, but for some reason, she and I kept talking via sms/snapchat/facebook/whatsapp/... where she told me she was bored and was going to watch a movie on her laptop. It's not that we were miles apart, because the pub we went to is in walking distance from her home..

I've asked her out a couple of times now, and I've even apologized for asking so many times, but she replied saying it was not a problem at all, and that we should hang out sometime.

I don't want to look obsessed or 'overly attached', but I also don't want to lose my chance to get to know this girl.

So I'm kind of clueless as of what I'm supposed to do now..

**TL;DR: Girl is avoiding to meet in real life, even though I've received more than enough pictures from her (snapchat/facebook).**"
1yo7qe,1,2014-02-22,Overachievement Anxiety,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1yo7qe/overachievement_anxiety/,"I am currently a 3L law student. In second year, I ranked 2nd out of 320 undergraduate law students. I have a social life (well somewhat), I love what I do and my standard of work is pretty high. I am the executive editor of my schools law review and I have a fair amount of internships under my belt.

The last few weeks have been unusually rough. Despite all these things above, the fact that I've been rejected from four particular co-curricular things in the last few months has me really demotivated and anxious. It's not enough for me to graduate with honors...I can't seem to move past not getting through with these other activities and it has me in a rut. 

I have not really talked about this to anyone...it would make my parents worry, some friends don't seem to understand the depth of the problem or what it is to me. I do talk to one friend whom I live with but i feel like I can't talk to them about this because one I don't want to be running to talk to people about my problems all the time like I can't keep it together and two he's smart but ranked lower so I don't want to trivialize what he's done.

It feels as though things like making law review and my grades aren't important because I haven't achieved what I set my sights on. Keep in mind that these are fairly ambitious, one is getting published in a practitioner law journal as an undergrad.

I'm glad there's reddit though, because for some reason I never feel like I'm bothering anyone, like I would to talk to friends in person...


This has probably made not one ounce of sense but it does help to have it written out and I'll clarify what I can.

I'm an undergrad currently studying Computer Science. I'm trying to get my foot in the door by finding an internship this summer that would be good for my level. I'm not seeking anything paid, since I won't meet most of their requirements for another year(I'm just now getting deep into OOP in Java, have completed some logic and theory classes, and now learning HTML,CSS, and JavaScript). I've worked on projects on my own(text-based quiz game, bank transaction simulator, phone book program, etc) but nothing too advanced. 



I'm wondering if any of you could give me advice the best approach with companies here since I'd be bringing more of a lot of enthusiasm and willingness to learn, rather than a deep understanding of things. 

So basically, where did you guys intern here and how did it work out for you? What do your companies usually look for in interns and what do the interns typically do at your company? Any additional info/advice would be greatly appreciated. "

1yol9r,2,2014-02-23,[25/m] seeking relationship advice on where i should go from here,notbeforelong,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1yol9r/25m_seeking_relationship_advice_on_where_i_should/,"I [25/m] have been with my girlfriend [23/f] for 2 and a half years. 

First off, I want to say that I do enjoy spending time with her and ditto for her. She is pretty, cute and smart. If given a chance I would gladly marry her. 

We are two very different people. I am a pretty laid back person who follows my passions. She's more of a practical person. I like sports, she doesn't like the sun. I like quiet places, she likes being in crowded areas. I like dogs, she likes cats.

Our first 'date' started off with her scolding me for not being contactable in the 20 minutes before that. It's mainly my fault for not planning my time properly. I bought a new phone on that day and had to get a micro SIM card. This was 20 minutes before the date. After changing the SIM card and setting up the phone, I realized she had been trying to contact me for the past 10 minutes. We were in the same building and I rushed up to meet her and she told me off pretty badly. I guess this set the tone for the rest of the relationship.

I am nowhere near a perfect person. Since the start of the relationship, she has been weeding out my problems and telling me about them. This has resulted in countless quarrels and telling offs centered around me. Having to wake up everyday, for the past two and a half years, to hear that I have this or that problem I have to change is pretty exhausting. Problems ranging from the way I cough to me not having the confidence to show that I'm in control of the relationship. I know that she is doing this for my own good because she cares about me and that it is for the better me. These quarrels and telling offs usually end with her calling me names like 'stupid' and 'dog', but happen less often nowadays. I am determined to improve myself no matter what it takes or how long it takes. She has actually hung onto me during this time, and is determined to help me improve as well. 

Unfortunately, all this has made me lose a significant chunk of my confidence. I no longer feel good about myself and have all the other issues related to low self-confidence. I do fake it but I know that I have confidence issues because of hearing that I have this many problems everyday. 

She just got a job after graduating from her Bachelor's program. I'll be graduating in August and she will have a couple of months head start. During this 6 or so months, she will definitely berate me about how she is getting a higher income than I am. When I graduate, there is a high possibility that I would have to go for an internship before being able to secure a job in the industry I have decided I want to be in. She also said that if her pay is higher than mine after a couple of years working in the industry I chose, I should get a job in a different industry.  Shes working as a business development executive in an international freight company and I am looking to work in public relations. I definitely do not want to have a lower salary than her but there is a chance that will happen. 

I love her and enjoy her presence. She has stuck with me through good and bad times. I feel that we're at a crossroads but I do not want to give up so easily. Does anyone have advice that I can use to make this relationship better?"

1yoxcb,45,2014-02-23,All men with game are just good salesmen,puaSenator,AlreadyRed,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlreadyRed/comments/1yoxcb/all_men_with_game_are_just_good_salesmen/,"A common objection to PUAs is how ""it's creepy"", or ""The whole idea of them having routines, and thinking through every situation, just seems so manipulative!"" And I'll admit, it is manipulative. But you'd have to be absolutely naive to think ""naturals"" aren't being manipulative. The only difference between a PUA and a natural is the PUA started with a script, just like an entry level sales intern. 

See, women often have this objection, because they don't have to actually game themselves. To them, when they find a guy to be with, they didn't get him because she was good at game. No, because a women's role isn't to sale a product, but to be a potential customer. To them, relationships and ONS develop from just ""going with the flow"" and seeing how she ""feels about it."" She's the customer, not trying to sell a damn thing. As the gatekeeper of sex, it's not her job to sell anything, instead, it's her job to (shit)test the salesmen to see if the product he's trying to sell is any good, or if he's just a scam. 

No great salesman is naturally a great salesman, he's just more experienced than the rest:  
Like EVERYTHING in life, to be good at something, it takes practice. A great salesman wasn't just born great at navigating society. Not a single one. Instead, the ""natural"" has just been selling for a really long time. 

Since they were kids they were selling their parents on buying them something, selling their friends on where to play, and even selling their teachers with their charm to turn the other cheek when they dick around in class. They know the tricks. They've practiced it all. They know what works, and what doesn't. Every great salesman has routines. Meanwhile, the other great salesman started out in a call center or a retail outlet. They were trained and given a script. They were told, just say this, and just do this -- to every customer that walks in. They tell him, ""You suck at sales, so for now, just stick to the script and never veer from it. Your odds of closing a deal will be much higher than if you tried your own shitty sales tactics."" Then eventually he'll have that script mastered. He'll learn exactly what works, and what doesn't. Then he'll start incorporating some of his own stuff into the script. Then eventually, he's done with the script entirely and has his own pitch that works best for him. With enough experience, just like the natural, he has a rebuttal and retort with anything you can possibly throw at him. He too is now a great salesperson.  

This is just like game. You'd have to be absolutely crazy to think that the ""natural"" player is any different than the player who started out with a script. When a natural is talking to a woman, he definitely knows what he's doing. He's heard every rejection in the book, so he's familiar with how to respond. His reactions are planned and intentional. When a natural wants to get a girl to bed, damn right he has a ""manipulative"" tactic he's going to use. He knows how to calm the potential customer down, how to deal with shit tests, and how to ease her into the idea of coming to his house.

When we give advice to someone on ""How do I deal with this shit-test?"" Yes the answer we may give is a routine, and it is manipulative -- just like the natural's. However, the answer a natural will give is also a routine, and intended to be manipulative. He's just a salesman trying to close the deal. However, the only difference, is the natural learned his through experience and by watching others, while we openly discuss what works and what doesn't. In fact, this is probably the most effective person there is, and women should be scared of this person. Because unlike the natural who will fail an go back home either thinking through how they failed to close the deal, or maybe talk to a buddy, a PUA will go back home and talk to hundreds of people ensuring that the solution they get is going to be far more effective than what just one guy could give.

Players on both sides are ALWAYS trying to close a woman. They are ALWAYS running routines. Because men are salesmen trying to make a buck/pussy. The difference is one salesguy just has one really good mentor to get advice from, while the other sits on a committee of salesmen always giving each other tips and advice. 

So if there are any women out there reading this that think these type of open forums of discussion are ""manipulative"" just remember, all guys are manipulative -- just some openly talk about it and others don't. And you should be afraid, really afraid. This shit is like ""Project Manhattan"" of getting laid. I'm far from the ""nerd"" type -- I'm a semi-natty using TRP/PUA like steroids--, but the truth is, a good portion of guys that start out on their journey here are or were pathetic nerds, and it gives me incredible joy to know that we are building an army of these assholes by giving them the secrets to nuclear power. It's like when the world ressented Germany for their role in the wars, but now they are an economic powerhouse, and they run the entire EU. I bet the German's fucking love it. I fucking love it. 

And remember, Always Be Closing.

EDIT: I never actually proof read the shit I post -- I didn't in college either. So typo's an clarity are subject to whatever. "

I also think NF gives exponential returns when paired with other productive habits (nutrition, exercise, meditation, cutting out bad habits). These seem to strengthen each other and the total effect is insane. I’ve been NF for almost a year, never made it to 2 months but routinely get to 3-4 weeks. Almost all hard mode. Only disadvantage is once I was with a girl I was really attracted to and I came way to fast. The two other times I just didn’t feel an emotional connection with the girls and it kind of made the sex weird which wouldn’t have bothered me before. I don’t know for me it improves my life, but not sex so I’m going to stick to hard mode until I finish school and get my goals in order (only 1 more year).  Here are the changes (remember NF acts like a battery fueling these changes, it’s not necessarily solely responsible) 

* Started waking up at 5am every morning- been months since Ive slept in past 5:30 

* Cold showers in the morning 

* Got offered a paid internship that was supposed to be unavailable but they wanted me on board so bad they squeezed me in. 

* Insane emotional control, have not gotten angry. This is very closely linked with meditation which I used to think was bullshit, but definitely is not. I also don’t get stressed or worried despite an insane class and work schedule. 

* Studying has become slightly easier 

* Have been able to save 2-3x more money per week because my impulse control has gotten better.

* Much more confidence. Deeper &amp; smoother voice. I can almost even sing now which before it was just a squeaky mess. 

* Much more energy. I feel it deep in my stomach like boiling water. Sometimes a girl smiles at me and warm blood just surges through my body. As soon as I wake up I’m like let’s do this. Sometimes I look at heavy objects and just feel like hurling them across the room. 

* No longer addicted to TV. House of Cards season 2 came out last week and I’ve only seen 5 episodes. Before I would have watched all 13 in a day and it would have left me feeling unproductive and tired. 

Good luck guys, I know everyone has different physiology, but I really think this works for most people-especially if you have a highly sexed nature, which I’m guessing most of us do. Good news, if you don’t let it control you, it is a blessing much more than a curse."

I'm Paul and I’m a French student who's looking for an international internship. I'm currently in a second year of Business School and I choose Strategic Marketing as my specialization. 
This internship must start in the middle of April and end early October. 

In regards to my legal eligibility to train with your organization, I would be participating in the J-1 Visa Internship USA program, sponsored by the Council on International Educational Exchange [CIEE].

-	Federal Unemployment Taxes (FUTA)

By participating in the J-1 Visa program, you will be contributing to the United States’ cultural exchange and public diplomacy policies and will benefit from the support of CIEE for the duration of the internship.   

I really want to do my internship in New-York City, I already went in this Big Apple and I loved my trip. But know I don’t want to go as a tripper but as a worker.  During this internship I want first to gain a lot of experience, as a French/European student I will bring my vision in order to help your company. I also desire to discover a new city and a new way of life. I can give you my sense of humour, my enjoyment of life, and my creative skills.
If you want my resume please ask me in private. 

Thanks you for taking time to read this and I wish you the best.

Found boyfriend's online dating profile, he denies it, I feel like I'm being gaslighted!",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ypa4q/help_me_found_boyfriends_online_dating_profile_he/,"Last night I went on to OKCupid because I've had my suspicions about my boyfriend. We've been together a year and already, the sex started to dry up. He claimed that he didn't want to have sex because he didn't feel attractive. I told him that I thought he just had low libido because of his health condition. He said no, he actually ""jerks off"" when I'm not home. 

Our relationship has been pretty rocky from the start. On our first date he admitted that he had low self esteem. Through our relationship he would ask me ""do you really love me?"" ""do I look ok?"" ""is my body ugly?"" ""you would rather be with someone else wouldn't you?"" Honestly, his lack of confidence in our relationship started throwing up red flags to me. My last boyfriend was so insecure with himself too and cheated on me with his ex.

So last night my eyes about bugged out when I saw my boyfriend's picture. It wasn't of his face though, it was of his chest but I can recognize that chest anywhere. I searched through my pictures and found a similar chest shot that he sent me when we were first dating. They are the same except the one on OKC is tilted and black and white.

So the picture had my head spinning. The creases in his body were the same and the nipple placements were the same. Even if there was doubt in my mind about the picture being his, I went on to read his stats.

Age: 43

Yup, he was 43.

City:  H........

Yup that's the city we live in

Height: 6'2""

That's his height

Occupation: Sales

Right on the money

No kids, has dogs:

Yes and Yes

The self-summary was rather strange. It had four paragraphs describing various sexual things he wants to do with women's breasts. I've never known him to have a breast fetish before. Every time I tried to get him to touch my boobs, he would giggle and pull away. Like he was embarrassed or something.

Now I know that these statistics can describe a lot of people but combined with the picture, the odds of that being not him is astronomical. If I would've been smart, I would've messaged him and set up a meeting. I was just so stunned and shaking that I immediately ran into the living room to confront him. He denied it up one side and down the other. He said we live in a big city (100K people) and anyone can have those stats. He also said ""I'm 6'1"" not 6'2""!

I asked him to come and look at the profile on my computer screen. He said the picture wasn't his and even if it was his, someone must have stole it. I start crying and screaming at the top of my lungs. How can he deny so much evidence I had right in front of me?

I then proceed to call my sister because at this point I'm going to lose it. I felt like I was going crazy because I knew what I was seeing but he swore he had no idea what it was. He even went so far to grab my mouse and close the tab.

Then, the final piece of evidence happened. As I was on the phone with my sister, I opened up the tab some 15 minutes later. Lo and fucking behold, the profile had somehow MAGICALLY VANISHED. I wrote down the username so I typed that in the search bar. It said ""this profile has been deleted"" or whatever language they use.

By this time I'm hysteric. Boyfriend comes into the room and I ask him about the profile disappearing. He is still denying he had anything to do with it but now he starts getting angry. I ask him to give me his phone. He says no and starts getting pissed and offended saying that I don't trust him. He then goes on to point out all the stuff he buys me and tells me about all the nice things he's done for me.

By this time, I'm feeling so gaslighted that I feel like I'm glowing. I knocked a stack of papers of my desk in a fit of rage. He countered by yelling and knocking over a small table. He then starts yelling at me to get out of his house tomorrow.

Here's where it gets sticky. I live in his house and I have no job. I have no job because I'm doing a full time internship for school that ends in two months. Anytime I've rented an apartment in the past, they asked for employment and to show pay stubs. I suppose I could tell them I'm a student but the financial aid I got went straight to tuition. I had none left over that I could claim as income. I have some money saved up so I'd be able to pay rent, but I'm not sure if they would even rent to me.

Here's where it gets stickier: we got a dog together and I want to take him with me. I could leave today and stay with my mom or sister but they won't let me bring the dog because they have cats.

Ok, so I'm kind of fucked and the huge man I live with is pissed at me. He has never done anything physical to me in the past but he does joke about doing violent stuff to me. One time he asked me ""what would you do if I just punched you in the face?"" Another time he was holding the sharp lid of a tin can and said that he should use it to slice my throat.

Now, I have no idea if his dark sense of humor would equal any of that really happening. But I have no idea, I'm grasping at straws here. 

He wants me out now but I can't find an apartment that will take me and my dog that fast. Also, it would be ideal to move spring break which is in a month so I can stay home with my dog for a week while he gets acclimated to the new place. He has bad separation anxiety issues and is used to living in a house with a yard with another dog (it's my boyfriend's dog that he had before we got together.)

Is this what people try to do to mentally manipulate you even though they've been caught red fucking handed??? He had me so convinced that it wasn't him that I started to question my mental state. He was pissed at me for the rest of the night for accusing him of cheating and not trusting him. He said since I don't trust him, that I should just move out. I asked him if I can stay a little while until I find another place. He said he's afraid he will feel too awkward.

TL;DR Found boyfriend's profile on OKCupid. No head shot, only body shot, stats match up, mysteriously gets deleted after I confront him. He denies it. Am I being gaslighted?


EDIT 1: So I'm still sitting here trying to figure out what the fuck to do. Everyone has been so thoughtful and caring. I don't feel like my immediate safety is danger but I'm going to do what I can to leave. He still denies that was his profile but whatever. He said I could stay as long as I needed to. He did admit that he pulled back emotionally from the relationship because he doesn't feel good enough for me and that he feels like he's holding me back. He has a disease that causes physical limitations but I never cared about that, I looked passed it and went hiking alone or with friends. He has had this condition for 12 years and he said it has eaten away at his self-esteem. Why would he even start dating in the first place? I'm on the search for a dog friendly apartment. 

EDIT 2: Today I went to his parents house and told them everything. They were pretty shocked and didn't know what to say. I asked them if he had ever been physically violent with a woman before and they no, not that they know of. They promised that they wouldn't mention our visit today with him. They said that he was always insecure, even as a kid. They also said that he's always has been pre-occupied with his looks and needed constant assurance. My (ex)boyfriend has been strangely pleasant since I found the profile two nights ago. He said I could stay as long as I don't date other guys and come home smelling like penis. Wtf, gross. Can't wait to move out."
1ypocw,0,2014-02-23,A simple change to make Soraka viable?,evilsider,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ypocw/a_simple_change_to_make_soraka_viable/,"Hi guys, I was wondering when my second most favorite support (Soraka) will become viable again. It's been some time now and even after her revamp she continued to be avoided by the majority of players. I see Riot are trying out making skills scale with AP, but I really believe that's a wrong approach (here I said it..sry Riot I still love you). The problem (imHo) is that the current meta requires engage/disengage abilities in 90% of the cases so that the given champion can be considered viable. If that's the case then why not just add a new mechanic into her E or her Q?

I have 3 ideas circling my mind:

1. Make her E function like LB's E (skillshot) but a little tweaked so she doesn't lose her charm there. It can be like ""If connect to enemy roots for X seconds after Y seconds"" or ""If connect to ally fills X amount of mana after Y seconds""

2. Make her E function like Karma's W. Basically the same as 1. but without the skillshot part.

3. Make her Q root for X amount of seconds after Y amounts of successful hits.

NOTE: In all honesty, I don't really care if my idea gets picked up or any other solution is found. But if a Rioter by any chance reads this, please be sure to raise Soraka for an intern discussion, she really needs some love after not being viable for 1 full season and counting...

**TL;DR Give Soraka some kind of root effect (it's the one and only thing she needs to become viable in the current meta).**"

1yq9ap,34,2014-02-23,"My girlfriend [23F] of 13 months hardly spends any time with me [23M] (also, other issues). I've been patient but it's getting difficult.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1yq9ap/my_girlfriend_23f_of_13_months_hardly_spends_any/,"As a bit of an update to my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1uvage/girlfriend_23f_of_one_year_is_experiencing_mental/), my girlfriend has since recovered from her state and is doing wonderfully. She is seeing a therapist and has been getting better ever since. I am now employed part-time, but unhappy with my job and still really discouraged that I can't find any work in the field I would actually like to pursue.

During the past few weeks, it feels to me that we've been growing more distant. She used to come by after her work in the evenings but now she spends the evening at her house (we both live with our parents), stating she needs to spend more time with her family. Granted, that's one of the things her therapist suggested she do, but now our time together is limited to about once a week, if that. When she has full days free, she shies away from hanging out with me, saying she would like a day to herself.

This sort of thing is the subject of most of our fights, and she tells me that she is busy with her job. My rebuttal to that is that when I was still at my university, I would wake up at 7:30, go to a job, an internship, and school full-time, get back to my place at 10:30 pm and begin doing homework, all the while still finding time to spend an hour or two with her over the phone. Right now she has a part-time job that requires her to put in some extra hours every so often, but she still can't seem to make time for us.

Whenever she has needed me, I supported her, dropping whatever responsibilities I was able to just to be there for her. I'm at probably the lowest point in my life right now and all I want to do is have dinner with her once or twice a week. Her response? ""We'll see.""

At her workplace, her co-worker, who is also her best friend and ex-boyfriend, has just gone through a bad breakup. According to her, he's incredibly sad and might be slipping into alcoholism. Whenever we're together, she talks about him and texts him often. I once asked her if she still had feelings for him, and she replied ""I don't know."" I understand he's going through a lot right now, but whenever the subject of him comes up I feel like such a consolation prize.

I have half a mind to break up with her, despite all the good times we've had. I've been okay with us not spending much time together for a bit, but her constant avoidance has been really getting to me. I have all of her stuff she brought to my house in a pile and am seriously considering driving to her place and breaking up with her right now.

Am I crazy for feeling this way? Do I just need to be more patient with her? What the hell am I supposed to do right now?
---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend says there's no time for me when I think she can clearly make it happen. Also, she is very concerned with (and spends a lot of time talking to and about) her co-worker/best friend/ex-boyfriend. What do I do?"
1yql4x,19,2014-02-23,24 yo looking to get some feedback on PF plan,throwawayPFhelpPls,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1yql4x/24_yo_looking_to_get_some_feedback_on_pf_plan/,"Hi all,

I have been pretty terrible in the past in terms of finances but have been really proactive in the last couple of months in trying to educate myself in all this (thanks to this subreddit! and other PF books!). I have come up with a plan for myself for the next few years and would like some feedback on it. I apologize for any grammar mistakes in advance as I am a 1st generation immigrant.

Goals: Pay off student loans and buy a house in my mid thirties (10 years from now, if plausible)

Situation:  
24 years old  
Income: Gross 70k/year (take home $3800/month)  

Student Loans: ~117k (5 years of undergrad)  
Break down:  
40k charged off  
Loan 1: 24,328 @ 10.13%  
Loan 2: 2,941 @ 7.63%  
Loan 3: 21,686 @ 6%  
Loan 4 (Consolidated Fed loans): 29,000 @ 5.88%  

roth-IRA: $1000  

Car: Own a 1996 Volvo that is about to die. Cant pass a smog test that it needs to pass for me to reregister for this year.  

Motorcycle: Made a stupid impulsive buy with some money I earned at an internship a few months ago. (Paid off)  

No emergency funds. Dumping excess money in bank account to loans.  

Spent the last couple of months paying off 3k of CC debt  

How this happened:   
My parents’ income were deemed pretty high when I was in highschool and so when I applied for financial aid for college I didnt get any. Even though my parents could have technically helped pay for my education, they couldnt because theyre pretty bad with their money as well (different story). My parents had me be responsible for signing up for my own private loans and really at the time, I had no idea what I was doing and so I just signed up with the first bank that was willing to give me money for school.

My parents filled for bankruptcy during my 3rd year and since they cosigned my loans, the loans automatically went into repayment. I had no job at the time and so I couldnt pay and had 2 of my loans at ~20k each go into “charged off” state. I asked an uncle of mine to cosign for me for my future loans so I could finish my degree.

Recently graduated this past June and had a 3 month internship. At the end of the internship, my company liked me and brought me in full time at 70k.


Plan:
Currently paying $1400 a month on student loans (more whenever theres any surplus in my bank account). Doing the minimum payments on all of the loans except for the big one at 10% which Im dumping as much as I can into.

Vehicle:
My car is probably going to cost me more to repair than it is worth so I am thinking of getting a (new to me) used car. I know that the general mentality that I found here is to buy a $5000 car but Im thinking that going with that route might result in the same thing that is happening now. Me having to pay for repairs in a couple of years. So Im thinking of getting a used car that is closer to $12k worth and use the hell out of that in the next 15 years. Can I get some feedback on this, please?

Posted my motorcycle on craigslist to sell and use that money either as down payment for a car or use to drop the principal on that 10% student loan.

Budget:
I have one (I use mint). I set my budget to $640 for groceries, restaurants, gas, fast food, and coffee. Ive been under that budget the last couple of months though so I think I can pull off a $500 budget per month.

Expected increase in rent in June. I am currently living with 4 other guys in a 2 bedroom 1 ba apartment. Been living like this for a year now to save cost in rent (~300/mo) at the moment. I know its really cheap but I can’t stand it anymore (theres barely any room to breathe, especially when they all bring their SO over, there’s like 8 people in one tiny apt). When our lease ends in June, I plan on moving out and getting my own room in a house thats renting out a room that will increase my rent to ~$700-750/month.

Investments:
I opened a roth-IRA account because the idea of investing for my retirement now, really appealed to me. But after I thought about it, maybe paying off my loans would be a higher priority before maxing out my roth.
Investing 3% of salary to 401k, my company does NOT match. Should I use this money into paying off my loans instead of shoving that 3% there?


I would really appreciate some advice on the my vehicle situation, investments vs loans, and lastly if anyone has any advice on that charged off loan. When I talked to the bank about it, they said that it is not accumulating any interest because of its status. When I heard this, I thought “Great! I can pay a little on that one and focus on the big 10% interest rate loan” but then I started really thinking and thought that its probably really bad for my credit that that is there, right? I really wish to purchase my own home in my mid thirties if possible and so I would want clean credit the next 10 years right?

Thank you for taking the time to read this!"
1yqmp8,6,2014-02-23,Previous employer mailed W-2 to my old address. Should I be worried about my personal info?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1yqmp8/previous_employer_mailed_w2_to_my_old_address/,"Last summer, I had an internship in another city. I recently found out they accidentally mailed my W-2 to the address I had when I lived there over the summer instead of my current address. Since it's an apartment building, I'm fairly certain somebody lives there now. Assuming somebody lives there now, they have access to my full name, DOB, SSN, etc.

If my W-2 fell into the wrong hands, how concerned should I be about my personal information? What steps should I take now? Am I at risk for identity theft?"

Edit:

I figured I'd keep the request more general so it would be beneficial to any other grad students looking for summer internships, but it has been suggested that I give some background information. 

I'm in a MSc in Cultural Sociology program with an emphasis on social justice. The short version.. I'm knowledgeable in SPSS, R, qualitative methods, non profits, grant writing and studies in inequality. I've also taken courses in (and have experience with) human resources and event management.

I'm looking for experience in any of the aforementioned subjects. Non Profit Management, Grant Writing, Data Analysis, Social Science Research, HR and Event Management all fit the bill. "

I'm in my final year of graduate school, working as student intern with the promise to become a full employee upon finishing my PhD (my tuition is paid by my employer).  Our combined income is $93,000.  When I graduate this fall it will become $110,000.

We live as cheaply as we can in the area, saving every penny for a 20% down payment on a house.  Seriously, we make breakfast, lunch and dinner at home every day (and even make our own baby food).  We eat out less than twice in a month.  Our total expenses every month are $4000 for rent, transportation, child care, utilities, groceries,  insurance, etc.  

The only debt we have is a combined ~$5000 in student loans that we are actively paying off.  We have and emergency fund ($15,000 in an online savings account), and $27,000 between two different credit union savings accounts.  We both have retirement plans through work, into which we are contributing the employer-matching amount (5%).

I have had issues with my credit reports in the past.  In 2009, I was once 60 days late on paying my student loan (it was a simple, stupid mistake of me forgetting to pay the bill).  Additionally within the past two months, I successfully disputed a tax lien that had been incorrectly reported to my credit history.  That issue was removed without incident from my reports.

We have no credit cards.  We did up until last November.  We had two Bank of America credit cards that never carried a balance and we hadn't used in over four years.  We got fed up with BOA for their shitty customer service, and the nickle-and-dime fees they kept charging over the years.  Our disgust came to a head last fall and we closed all deposit accounts and both cards.  In hindsight, it was a bad idea to close those cards since they were our oldest (~7 years), but at the time we didn't know that it could negatively affect our credit.
 
Questions:

1)  I tend to be old school and do everything with paper statements, and pay our bills with checks in the mail.  I know this is inefficient, and can be dangerous (like when I forgot to make my student loan payment once).  I'd like to set up automatic bill pay, but I'd also like to make the money go further.  Would it be beneficial to open a new credit card to pay bills with (preferably, one that has a good rewards program)?  We would pay it off every month.  My wife has never had any issues with credit, and her reports are all positive.

2) Would applying for said credit card now be a good thing for our credit rating and mortgage application if we want to buy a house in 9-12 months?

3) I don't know much about rewards programs, and ones we should consider to be ""good.""  For example, we spend a lot on gas/groceries, but we also like to travel once a year, so I don't know if a cash back card would be better than a travel rewards points card.  How do I decide which type of card would give me the most bang for the buck?

4) Should we maintain our current ethos of joint finances and get card(s) that we can both use?  Or would it be better for us to get individual ones?"

1yr56x,12,2014-02-23,The problem with a long hair fetish (x-post with sex),[deleted],BDSMcommunity,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/1yr56x/the_problem_with_a_long_hair_fetish_xpost_with_sex/,"Hello everyone,

I'm a girl with a fetish for cismen who have long hair (what I consider long is past the shoulders). I lucked out and got a boyfriend with hair down to his waist (he has many other fantastic qualities, but it is just particularly refreshing to indulge in my fetish and have him enjoy it too).

Of course, I am getting to the age where everyone is starting to cut their hair for work-related reasons. In particular, my boyfriend is looking at a summer internship that would require him to keep his hair collar-length, and no longer (that's what the interviewer told him). He says that if he is hired, he will grow it out again after the internship, and he will wear polos so the collar will be as low as possible.

I won't leave him over this. I joke that I am pretty shallow, but not that shallow. I just worry that I am going to find him less physically attractive if he does get this internship. Or that he will think having short hair is easier and not ever grow it out again. I also won't be able to do a lot of what I enjoy about hair. I get a thrill out of playing with it, brushing it, and feeling it on me, as well as using it as sort of a form of mental bondage (as an example, if he feels possessive, he drapes it over me).

I guess I am not sure what I am asking, since I know I will need to just suck it up and deal with it until he grows it back out. Maybe I just need to vent. But maybe other people can give me some advice on not having access to a fetish while in a relationship? Or talk about similar experiences? Polyamory is not an option, fyi. And long hair fetishists, if you are out there, how would you find a way to indulge with hair shorter than shoulder length?

Sorry for the length! This sub is fantastic with giving advice so I thought I would ask everyone here."

I have a 3-month summer internship coming up, where I'll have to move from PA to TX and back. I was wondering what the options were for bringing my gaming PC along. Keep in mind that I'll likely have more travel in my future, so I'd like to come up with a method that'll work several times.

Here is my current build:

    Full-size ATX Case: HAF 912

    CPU: Sandy Bridge i7 2600

    Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212+

    Mobo: ASUS P8P67 Rev C

    RAM: 4x2 GB Kingston HyperX DDR3

    GPU: XFX HD 6950 flashed to use extra cores

    Soundcard: ASUS Xonar D1

    PSU: Antec Neo Eco 520C

One option is to ship the computer over using a courier service and back, but I'm a bit hesitant, as I know packages get mistreated a lot in transit. Anyone have any recommended services/methods to use? What are the prices like?

Another option is to sell the entire build off and build a mini-ITX computer. What would my current build sell for; would it cover the price of a mid-range mini-ITX build? Would there be room to fit in a soundcard next to a GPU? Anything I can carry over from my existing build? I'm thinking of mini-ITX so that I can bring it in my carry-on in the plane.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

My future looks bleak and I am unsure of what to do. I wanted to go to law school, but my grades were not good enough (thanks to being depressed in high school and ggetting straight C's). I am at a college with a degree I don't care for, because I was expected to get a degree. I have lost a bunch of friends for stupid reasons and cut off the remaining ones - due to my sadness. I quit my job and rarely speak to anyone. I feel at ease or safe really - just sitting in my bed room doing school assignments and reading books. Home abuse, school bullying, and having cobbler's chest has made me the way I am. I have no self esteem and feel down all the time. For some reason, I feel compelled to get into politics, because I want to help people - but I can't even help myself. I tried to get an internship (I need to 2 internships to graduate), but felt to down to follow up with one I could have gotten. I felt okay, but then talked myself down - saying things like how I am not good enough to work for this person and others things of this sort. I have no money for professional help, nor can I get help from my parents. They are the only people I sort of talk to. I hate feeling the way I do. I feel like I have learned nothing, know nothing, and am not qualified for any job. Is it possible to cope with my depression or manage it better, so I down feel so gloomy? "
1yrjwb,5,2014-02-23,I am 18 and trying to get a good handle on my future so that I can have a good financial plan right from the start.,plzteachme,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1yrjwb/i_am_18_and_trying_to_get_a_good_handle_on_my/,"Hi, I'm 18 and I'm trying to figure out finances and the like so that I can live a reasonable lifestyle and hopefully accumulate a generous amount of wealth over my working career. I've been reading and posting in this sub for the past three months, but I'd like to ask a question about myself, something I've not done before.

I am about to enter college. Since I did well on the PSAT, I can get paid about $4k per year to go to the University of Kentucky. However, I could also potentially get in to some of the big name schools that people on this subreddit seem to view as exceptions when it comes to student loans: places like Harvard, Stanford, etc. My parents will pay most of the costs, but will probably leave me a deficit to make up that will be around the subsidized loan limit (afaik anyone can take these out and they have a current max of about $30k over four years). My prospective major is a mixture of Computer Science and Mathematics (with finance classes if I go to a big name target school for banking). I am interested in the software, consulting, actuarial, and banking sectors.

I am wondering if it is financially smart to take out the rather small loans (relative to my earning potential, that is. They could probably be paid off in a year) and get a degree that is probably ""worth"" more, has better recruiting potential, and will allow me to network with the social/financial/academic elite or to take the degree that will leave me with net worth coming out of undergrad. 

I can work during college, of course, but I'm not sure how well this will pay. I am thinking of doing standardized test tutoring throughout the year (because, hey, I'm good at it) and I know internships in the CS/banking area can be quite lucrative, but I don't want to count these chickens before they hatch. 


Now, what I'm really worrying about is what to do after college. As of right now I am planning on going into industry (perhaps to go back to get an MS or MBA if necessary to climb the corporate ladder), and my anticipated fields will probably have first year salaries in the $70k-$120k range, albeit in more expensive living areas like SF and NY. After socking away whatever is possible in a Roth IRA, provided that I am eligible, what investment vehicle would you recommend? I do not expect to have living expenses totalling more than $35k in today's dollars (unless I live in NYC), so even after taxes and loan repayment and an IRA (who knows if I will have a 401k) I will likely have some excess dough. Right now I am thinking of getting equity in a duplex and renting out the other half for money, the benefit of this being that I suspect that duplexes are a little more liquid (and definitely more renter friendly) than condoes and normal houses, which would be good if I had to relocate or if I wanted to upgrade. 

I appreciate any and all advice regarding my questions as well as any general tips when it comes to accumulating wealth during my 20's. I am aware that during my first year of living alone I will likely have some unanticipated expenses/first-timer expenses such as basic furniture, a mattress, perhaps a bike for a commute, etc. In fact, I expect that most excess income during my first year living alone will be spent on these things + building an emergency fund."
1yrqgi,10,2014-02-24,Software Jobs in Boulder,[deleted],boulder,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/1yrqgi/software_jobs_in_boulder/,"I'm a recent CS grad(graduated May 2013) and have been doing a lot of research and trying to figure out future plans and my fiancee and I have settled on Boulder sounding like an awesome place to move to. We're currently in Lexington KY and I've got intern experience + salaried experience at a large tech company where I was able to move up fairly quickly to a mid-to-senior tier C++/Java Dev role. With that in mind, I'm trying to figure out where might be the best places to apply to in boulder. Obviously Google is one, and I've applied for a few positions, but I don't currently know anyone devs in the area to get recommendations from. Companies that pay for new hires to move are definitely a plus, but finding the best job for the long term is better in my mind than short term things like that.

Also, if anyone has any pointers for moving this far that would be great. I would ideally be moving mid-May(after fiancee's graduation) and I've never moved anywhere near this far so I'm still not exactly sure what to expect as far as the move itself."

&gt; Hey interns, lets take a break, and head down for some after work McBeetus!

&gt; Don't judge me, I fucking love deep fried food

Maybe it's just my love of fast food (in moderation, unlike my cider) that causes me to be in the shouting field of these fat fucks, but after my major encounter with *her,* I've been seeing fatlogic alllllll around.

I understand having a core group of five characters can get kind of boring, and there isn't much to be done and new people can shake it up which makes Jeph's job easier, but...

Before it had a homely [""Friends""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends) feel to it, but now its more of a [""soap opera""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera) and I cant help but wonder if every new character needs to stick around.  

[Emily](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/emily.png) is comedic relief and adds nothing to the story besides being a secondary Pintsize.  I get that she is ditzy but that means she is only Raven 2.0.  Introduce her as an intern, and leave it at that.  

[Dale](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/dale.png) was a pizza guy but now he is on the fast track to full cast member when his role of wishy washy depressed guy was already being fulfilled by Marten.  So now all he does is Marten's job but that means we lose Marten time.  

[Amir](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/amir.png) is the bassist for Deathmole and isn't being shoehorned is as a love interest for the inner circle.  More side characters need to be like him.  Do your job then go away.

I could analyze every character but what I'm getting at is we were all drawn to Questionable Content because [these](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/marten.png) [five](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/pintsize.png) [characters](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/faye.png) [felt](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/dora.png) [like friends.](http://questionablecontent.net/cast/steve.png)

I didn't fall in love with 20 people, I loved reading the strip and keeping up with just a few of them and seeing them hang out.  it was a simple good time watching them drink and hang out.  Now with the Marten/Claire situation I feel like we're being set up for some huge trans-acceptance movement which puts QC more in the 'South Park' preachy mode and not in the 'Simpsons' family mode.  Regardless of [which side](http://imgur.com/gallery/NmKf7) [you're on](http://www2.palomar.edu/users/scrouthamel/ams105/images/hippies_2.jpg) when you bring politics and these debates into the picture it becomes slightly muddied.

I feel like i'm going to be bashed for ""defending trans phobia"" but that's not what I'm getting at.

The strip isn't what is used to be.  It used to be watching a few [friends](http://guestofaguest.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mc.jpg) hang out but now I have to keep track of [everyone](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Castpoto.jpg) and their [killer robot](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSy4aGwPYvkVp6Vf7V3Scki3MbXOZ8o0XFAPK62iiiYa0oD92WZ).  

It is just different.  I don't have an amazing closing speech or a main point of discussion.  I'm just sad that its gone.

""Yeah, over there."" She pointed at the skinny, quiet kid that always sat in the back of the class. Alone. Eyes the colour of hazelnuts, his hair greasy and awkwardly combed to the back of his head, as if he was constantly riding his bike into an oncoming storm. His bike, probably his most valued possession. It was only the shadow of the shiny blue brand new it used to be. But he loved it, as if it was his only friend.

One day, he came out of school and walked towards the bicycle parking station, unknowingly walking in on a scene he would not want to witness, let alone be the victim of. ""Shit guys, he's there!"", giggled a ginger haired girl he had never seen before, while she waved her hand in a gesture that said *let's run*. Only a glimpse of her is what he caught, a glimpse that was imprinted in his memory forever. He caressed the wreck of his bike as if it was a dying friend - which it probably was, to him. Then and there, he swore he would make it his life goal to blossom good and do away with evil.

Years had gone by, and God had just won the election. He had worked hard for it, too: he had graduated cum laude from high school, finished four years of university law studies and had spent the past seven years working as a campaign intern for various political parties, to gather experience, which he then used to start his own party. He campaigned and picketed,  and now he made it: he was president of the universe. Things were going to change, but in a very democratic and non-dictatorship way. He installed Heaven and he installed Hell. He encouraged good and punished evil. He was an all-seeing, all loving God, but what the public didn't know, was his history. The reason why. And more importantly, the secret grudge he held that dictated his life in more ways than he could imagine himself, at that point.

And then came I. I was born after he had been in presidency for a long time. He knew about every baby born in his universe, and he somewhat influenced the way their life would go, from womb to casket. When he saw me, he gasped. I was a small chubby baby with eyes as blue as the sky. My upper lip sat there awkwardly, as if it was too big for my face, and I looked like I just invented the duckface photo fad years before its time - but I smiled. I thought I was going to be happy, I honestly believed that. I had this small pluck of ginger hair on my head, fluffy enough for it to be petted by everyone I met. A small pluck, but big enough for him to notice. With the glimpse of my gingery, silky hair, the memory he had locked up years ago yet based his entire existence on broke out of the depths of his mind, and filled him with a rage he had never deemed possible. ""No!"" he thought, ""No, I can't allow her to live... but what kind of a God would I be, were I to kill her right here, right now?"" The sadistic undertone of his intelligent mind took over, and he swore then and there that I would pay for what I made him feel that moment. 

Within years, my allergies had already taken out most of my healthy days. My parents had divorced, I was moved from here to there and then back, never feeling the warmth of a place called Home. Growing up,  I was that weird kid God once was, sitting in the back of the class, alone, with a book and a bike, without any friends. I was an outcast, or at least I felt like one. Everyone I ever loved either died or abandoned me, everyone I ever trusted misused that trust to abuse and hurt me. He took it all out, on me, for my entire life.

Until one day, he ran into her. The girl that had bullied him, the girl that had deceived him and trashed his bike. She was dying, and only then, she turned to him. She prayed  and begged, apologised and flattered, wanting to stay alive. He realised he should forgive her, but he could not. ""You turn to me in a moment of death, after deceiving me for a lifetime?"" He left her to die, alone and painfully. It was in that moment he realised how he had it wrong. How he should not have punished me for something I had not done. He needed to make things right.

He reached into his Heaven, massively underpopulated, and found the kindest soul in there. ""It is time"", he whispered, ""I have the most important mission for you"". He took that kindest soul, wrapped him up in the most handsome human being he could possibly imagine, gave him a warm heart, a great sense of humour and most of all, a personality that was just the right amount of different yet the same to mine. He sent him down, smack in the middle of my shitty life. 

I smiled. Genuinely, for the first time in what seemed forever."

1yts3z,14,2014-02-24,"Results of my first bulk - 5 months clean, Diet &amp; Routine included",danny_b87,naturalbodybuilding,https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/1yts3z/results_of_my_first_bulk_5_months_clean_diet/,"tl;dr did clean bulk too clean, only gained 6 lb (3 lb LBM)  
  
I thought I would make an update post with the results of my 5 month clean bulk and the diet/workout I used since some people appreciate how anal I get about my nutrition. I am a 26 year old male, 6’1”, 190lb, ~10% body fat, almost 8 years lifting experience (not all of it serious)  
  
Here is my initial post last year: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/1h6el2/7_year_progress_60lbs_and_25_body_fat_xpost_from/  
  
Overall a little disappointed, this was my first bulk since losing 60 lbs and I found it really hard mentally to let myself gain weight, my goal was 10 lbs in ~5 months but I only gained 6 lb, 3 lb LBM and 3 lb fat (via Dexascan) up to ~190 lb with 10% body fat. The first few months I averaged 3200 calories and then I upped it to 3300 calories and then 3500 the last month. I don't have as many progress photos since it annoyed me getting softer but here are my measurement improvements: 
  
from 10/2013 to 2/2014, measurements were taking in the morning after a rest day for consistent comparison  
Left Arm: 14.75” -&gt; 15.25”  
Right Arm: 14.25” -&gt;15.25”  
Chest 41” -&gt; 43.5”  
Waist 31.5” -&gt; 31”  
Left Thigh 23” -&gt; 24.25”  
Right Thigh 23.5” -&gt; 24.25”  
Left Calf 14.75” -&gt; 15.5”  
Right Calf 14.5” -&gt; 15.5”  
  
The workout I was doing the last 3 months was P.H.A.T., I didn't feel like I get the most out of it due to some injuries. I strained my rotator cuff during the first month and my MCL felt tight a majority of the time which set me back a month or so.

Chest &amp; Arms Hypertrophy: http://imgur.com/lRAO6Vg 
  
My diet was pretty similar to my previous post as I like those foods and the macros were about right but I'll relist them here. Aim was ~50/25/25  
  
*High calorie breakfast:*
  
* Pancakes w/dark chocolate chips &amp; blueberries ~ 450 calories  
* 1 Tbsp Honey  
* 2 Egg omelet with 2% cheese  
* 2 Cup Skim Milk  
* Fish Oil Pills
  
*Low Calorie breakfast:* 
  
* Oats w/blueberries &amp; ground flaxseed
* 2 Egg omelet with 2% cheese 
* 2 Cup Skim Milk 
* Fish Oil Pills  
  
*Lunches:*  
  
* 93/7 Beef 1/4 lb - 1/2 lb or 93/7 ground turkey ~1/3 lb  
* Potato/Sweet Potato cubes baked in olive oil ~ calories  
* 1 Apple  
* 1 Cup V8 Low Sodium  
* Fish Oil Pills (depending on strength)  
  
*Snacks*  
  
* 1 Banana  
* Almonds  
* Greek Yogurt or Greek Yogurt/Oats mix  
* ½ PB&amp;J Sandwich (when needed extra calories)
* Post Workout Protein Powder 260 cal (20g pro, 40g carb)  
  
*Dinner 1*  
  
* 1/2 lb grilled chicken  
* Brown Rice cooked in olive oil  
* Green Peas  
  
*Dinner 2*  
  
* Whole Grain Spaghetti  
* Spaghetti Sauce 
* 1/4 lb 93/7 Beef  
* Corn  
 
*Dinner 3*  
  
* 1 Can tuna ~4 oz  
* Brown Rice cooked in olive oil 
* Green Peas 
  
Supplements: I prefer a whole foods approach so I don’t take many supplements, just the protein powder I mentioned (EAS's Recovery Protein which does have 1.5g HMB), creatine (ON's creatine monohydrate), fish oil, and recently started taking a glucosamine/chondroitin/MSM supp in the off chance it helps speed my joint/tendon injuries.  
Started my cut last week, aiming for 3000 calories since upping my cardio as well by biking to and from gym 3x/week, 2 warm up jogs/week, and one 30 min jog. Pretty much only change in diet is having the low calorie breakfast and just greek yogurt without oats as a snack. In a week or 2 will go down to ~2700.  
  
The new workout I designed is a 5 day split - Shoulders &amp; Abs, Legs, Chest &amp; Abs, Back, then Arms. Still tweeking since just did the first week but here is what I did: http://imgur.com/Jnf1nsp  
If anyone has any feedback on the workout definitely let me know, want to make sure it hits all the major muscles and shooting for ~45 min. Arms workout definitely needs help, barely felt worked out when done. Here is my fitocracy for anyone that wants to follow: http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/KingBeer/  
  
I don't know if I will be doing a June competition in Longview, TX or Austin, TX in July (will find out first week of April if I got into an internship) so will refine calorie goals then but goal is to be at 5% body fat by competition so ~1 lb/week. I'll keep you updated as competition gets closer! Thanks in advance for any feedback or advice.  
  
edit: pics from a year ago almost at the height of my last cut ~7% front: http://imgur.com/KAoQhEa &amp; back http://imgur.com/9puChUu  
will try to find some decent recent pics but the lighting at new gym sucks :-/ basically just softer

I won't be done till my mid 30's if I'm lucky. i don't even have an AA yet so there is so much to relearn that i feel it will take me to long and that i won't get jobs. my biggest fear with this is that younger kids will get the jobs first because really are you going to hired a young 24 year old fresh out with a masters or a 35 year old. I'm probably just listening to myself to much and allowing myself to be discouraged. but idk what to do. i already have a good job as a uber x driver. but if i go back to school i want to do something that will earn me more then what i make now and i feel learning computers can give me a job that pays even better. problem is doing it. i don't know if i can handle the work load. and trying to not worry about the younger kids who have been doing it longer then me. i guess I'm really hard on myself but i just can't help it. any advice or encouragement and even criticism is welcome. :D thanks "
1yueoe,2,2014-02-24,One piece of mail is about to ruin everything.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1yueoe/one_piece_of_mail_is_about_to_ruin_everything/,"April 8th, I have to be out by April 8th.

I walked in the door to my mother sitting in her chair with her face in her hands crying. She showed me the paper stating there was no longer anything we could do to save our house, it was an official document stating we had to get out. My mother had been battling with my recently divorced father about getting all the documents needed, but both my selfish father and the constantly losing things bank never quite had what they needed to help. So now, my poor mother and myself have to leave.

I was just car shopping as my car was taken out of commission, I was saving for something decent, something I could be proud of. I didn't know we were going to have to leave our house anytime soon, I had no idea the state of things. I was in the middle of their relationship, as the rock for 10 years, the intermediary, they never understood when I checked out, when I was done. 

Yesterday I was happy.

But now here I am absolutely destroyed. I need a new car, a new place to live, a place for my cats, I have $725/mo in student loans. I work 40 miles away, I make OK money, and I love my job, but it's in my contract that I can't work another job. I'm not due a raise for another 4 months. not to mention living in this part of the state is exceedingly expensive. I have no family who would take me in, my GF is leaving for an internship for several months on the other side of the state.

It took just one little piece of mail to really fuck my life up. "

Its not all that unstable as one would think. Its about as stable if not even more stable than Manjaro Linux. In the Debian world you also don't have to worry about a pesky AUR which may not have official support and you don't have to stray away from the repo's like in arch. It's better than Ubuntu because you always get the freshest without reinstall and Ubuntu intern releases are based on Sid, hey why not.

I'm 19, he's about to turn 27. We've been working together for the past two months in a shipyard where my typical apparel includes coveralls and dirt on my face. I started work there as an intern that was supposed to be temporary but I loved the work so much that I'm going to be making it a permanent position once I take a couple weeks off to make the permanent move.

The first day we worked together, there was instant chemistry, at least our personalities melded well together. For 8 hours, there was hardly a lull in communication. He knew my age from day 1. After several weeks of working together, it seemed that at the very least we had the potential to be really great friends.

The last week I worked as an intern in the shipyard he confessed that he didn't have many friends yet I was one of them. On my last day, he asked about my roommate search and suggested we try to find a place together. He also asked me to be his gym buddy and said we could be ""bros."" I hardly tried to keep it a secret at any point that I had a major crush on him. But, I'm not sure if the age difference means more to him than it does to me.

I love his person, that's what I've come to realize. The fact that we can talk for hours and spend half the day playing 20 questions while we work is amazing and I haven't gotten close to many people in the area. But, I'm not sure if I should make a move and risk making things awkward when I need a friend? It seems like he may be interested but hesitant to do anything about it because of the stigma attached.  Or I might just be friendzoned, which is entirely possible.
What should I do? His birthday is coming up and I could try and do something for him then.  Or do I just let it be and see if he makes a move first?    
   
TLDR; Should a 19 year old woman make a move on a 27 year old man or let it be and see where it leads?"

1yvdo6,4,2014-02-25,PC Application: 10 Months of Paperwork and Waiting,[deleted],peacecorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/1yvdo6/pc_application_10_months_of_paperwork_and_waiting/,"~A former college professor reached out to me to share my experiences applying to the Peace Corps to give one of his students some insight into the process. I'm not one to be concise, and before I knew it, the novella below is what I typed. I thought it might be insightful for some PC applicants, or at the very least a look at what the process felt like in 2009.
  
  
Hi [former professor] and [prospective PCV],
  
I served in the Peace Corps starting in 2009, and from what I hear, there have been some changes to the application process, mainly giving the volunteers more say in where they wish to serve. That being said, the fundamentals are still the same, so I'll try to lay out everything I can think of regarding the application process, and what the PC recruiters are looking for in potential volunteers.
  
First, the application process is lengthy; both to be thorough and to deter anyone who decided to join the Peace Corps on a whim. The process begins with an online application via www.peacecorps.gov. For reference, I began filling out my application in late September of my senior year of college, and submitted it a month later. This part is similar to many college applications - there are parts for your personal information, education, job history, as well as essays. All of the application is important, but I'd say 2 of the traits you want to highlight are your flexibility and your philanthropic nature. They want to know how well you can handle the unexpected (and believe me, you will experience the unexpected during 2 years in the Peace Corps) and they want to know that you have a history of volunteering. If you do not currently volunteer - go out tomorrow morning and find somewhere to start volunteering! This could be anything from tutoring kids after school, to building houses with Habitat for Humanity. Don't worry if your volunteer work isn't exactly what you want to do in the Peace Corps; what you do as a volunteer isn't as important as having a track record of giving back to others. After all, that's what the Peace Corps is all about. Along with these traits, they also like to see any type of inter-cultural experience. For me, I talked about working in a warehouse with people of many nationalities – so don’t think you need study abroad experience or missionary trips to qualify for this part. Take your time with the online application; this is an important part of your application process, as a good online application will set the foundation for the rest of the application process.  
  
I should mention here, that before I even began my application, I was in touch with a PC recruiter in [local university]. I would suggest you contact either that office, or the one in Boston to just chat with them about applying to the Peace Corps. They are all former PC volunteers, and their job is to give insight into the application process, what volunteering in the Peace Corps is really like, and to answer any other questions you have. This helped me immensely; as I had someone I knew who could give me direct answers regarding the nuances of the application process. Get to know your recruiter – they will be a valuable asset while you apply for the Peace Corps, and they can give you first-hand insight into why part of the process seems to be taking long, or let you know if you need to fill out an extra form here or there.  
  
But I digress – shortly after submitting my online application, my recruiter mailed me an information packet to complete and return. The information they ask for is pretty basic: official college transcripts, skill addenda, 3 references (if not already done through the online app.), background check form, fingerprint cards, health form, and student loan worksheet (if applicable). The recruiter will also set up an interview.
  
For me, the interview felt relaxed, but that had to do with how well I got to know my recruiter in the month or so leading up to the interview. It should still be approached with the same professionalism as any job or internship interview. Dress nice and act professionally. This interview is used for the recruiter to learn about you and your desire to be a Peace Corps volunteer as well as learn about your preferences regarding geographical location or program. While your preferences are taken into consideration, it is still up to the Peace Corps to place you where they see the best fit.
  
After the interview, you will eventually get a nomination. This will not give you a definite country or leave date, but rather a broad geographical location, a volunteer program/sector, and an estimated departure date. For me, I received my nomination in late December, about 3 weeks after my interview. I was nominated to teach math in a French speaking country in sub-Saharan Africa, and leaving in July 2009. That’s about as specific as it gets.
  
Between December and July, many things happened regarding my Peace Corps application, but honestly it was a LOT of waiting. There are medical forms you need to have filled out by physicians and dentists (reimbursed by the PC), and you need to wait and hear back about getting legally cleared by the PC background check. This is probably the most difficult part of the process as many prospective volunteers are anxious, but it’s good to keep in mind that once your recruiter knows something, they will tell you.
  
The final piece you await as a future Peace Corps volunteer is an official Invitation. This is a large white envelope that you get in the mail and has your country of service and your departure date on it. For me the timing couldn’t have been better. I had just finished my last day at my internship at the end of May and the next day I got my invitation in the mail. Don’t be surprised if your invitation isn’t exactly the same as your nomination. There are only finite positions, and infinite variables the recruiters deal with in placing volunteers. For the most part, my invitation was the same, except my volunteer description was no longer teaching math – I was going to Niger to be a community and youth educator. You will have to officially accept the offer (I believe you have 7 days), and then you will be given a flight to somewhere on the east coast to do orientation with the other volunteers going to your country. Then, before you can blink, you’re on a plane full of strangers going to a strange country to have the experience of a lifetime."

so I'll be moving to the US (DFW) for an internship and I'll need a car.
My supervisor is giving me the option to buy his 2007 Nissan Altima S for $9k but I am not sure if it's a nice deal, it's more than what I was willing to spend for a car but I also do not want to have issues with it since I am not a car person.

He says the car has around 120k miles.
I would have also to sell it after my internship, so I need to know if it would be easy or not.

so is that car a no brainer to get? or should I wait until I am in the states to get something cheaper; I was thinking $5k max : a reliable used car with a manual transmission (like a Civic or something)"

After seeing Wolf of Wall Street, specifically the scene when Jordan Belfort begins selling penny stocks, I've realised that I absolutely love watching fast, smooth and clever conversations in movies.

What I'm looking for is more movies or scenes of movies that have similar styles of speech to these, mainly for personal inspiration to better my own conversational skills. Any help is greatly appreciated!

I have been working for about 3 months @ 70k a year, have about 40k in my savings, 4k in my 401k. Most of my savings came from internships I've had during school. Every paycheck it put 20% into my 401k and have about 2800 in spendable income a month, of that I try to put about 2200 into my savings. I have no debt, no loans. At the moment I am living with my parents and I don't mind living here to cut down a lot of expenses. My SO its making 50k a year but most of it is going towards paying off her student loans.

This might be unrealistic but my goal is to buy one house in Mountain View, CA and live in it for the rest of my life. I would really want a family home 3-4br/3.5ba ish area. new homes in this area list for about .9 million - 1.2 million. 

My vision is that my and my SO will be able to put down a down payment on a house in ~5 years and a couple (2-3) of friends of mine want to move in and pay me rent for a few years while my income increases. Another option I thought of is my friend contributing for the down payment and paying their portion off to possible move in earlier than 5 years?

How realistic is my vision and what kind of advice can you give me to achieve my goal / get close to it?

I am currently working at a tech company in Silicon Valley, in a training program to become a SQL Server DBA. On top of the training I am receiving form my team, my manager suggested that I should look for certification related to SQL Server administration. 

I was looking up certifications on the Microsoft [website](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/sql-certification.aspx) and came across several certifications I could use. I saw the MCITP/MCSA certifications which seem DBA oriented, but I am unsure of which to go for. Also found the Exam 70-432, which seems very DBA centric as well.

Does anyone have any suggestions for certification that can help me build a better foundation in MSSQL DB administration? I already have basic knowledge of SQL and IT infrastructure from school and my last internship as a Jr. Sys admin."
1yy29k,1,2014-02-25,College [Rant] [Discussion],sagull,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1yy29k/college_rant_discussion/,"So I've only come to this realization very recently while I was playing around with a calculator, but I decided to try to find out how much college would cost me.

My dream job is to be a psychiatrist, but after finding out how much medical school costs, I think i'll just have to settle for being a clinical psychologist or something along those lines.

So per say I was to still try to become a psychiatrist, I would have to go through: 

- 4-6 Years of College to get my bachelors degree

- 4-6 Years of Medical School to get my PhD.

- 4-6 years of Residency (Basically an Internship).

- 1-2 years to get licensed.

Thats about 16 years of my life. So if it wasn't enough that all of my young life would be spent in school, lets talk about the costs.

Its about $50,000 a year for a good college/university.

So make that x4.

Boom. $200,000.

Then add on medical school, which is about $70,000 a year.

So make that x4

Boom. $280,000

Then Residency, which I'm not in school, I'm just an intern now. So maybe 10,000 a year for rent because I'm still a student/intern.

Make that x4

Boom. $40,000

The license is free, so at least I've got that going for me, which is nice. 

Lets add that all up now,

200,000 + 280,000 + 40,000 = 520,000

Thats over half a fucking million dollars guys. 

Like. Fuck. Fuck. *Fuck*

I assume most of you don't want to get PhD related careers, and that you plan to get just a bachelors, but keep in mind, thats still about $200,000. And if you want a masters, which most careers are starting to require, then thats an extra 4 years, so an extra $200,000. Thats $400,000.

Put that into perpective, thats the cost of a huge house, thats almost half a million dollars. Shit you can buy a ferrari with that money.

I'm just ranting at this point, but I hope you can see why I'm so buttsmacked. Fuck.

I have NO idea what is going on. I did 6 months of keto in 2013 and everything went smoothly. I have been back doing keto for 4 weeks and things are not going as well as before. I hit 196 and then fluctuate between 196 and 193 over and over, for 2 weeks now I have bounced between 196 and 193 (literally it seems every other day), I often find on sunday nights after a weekend of debauchery I am defintely near the 196, then I am battling back down by friday.

Week 1- Initial weight, 203 lb.
Week 2-196 
Week 3- 193
Week4-196 

Social History

* Diet- 
* AM: 0 carbs, occasional diet gingerale (cheese n bacon generally)
* Lunch: 5-7 carbs (cheese n bacon in a wrap + almonds generally)
* Dinner: 7-13 carbs (steak or chicken n veggies generally)
* Dessert: 3-8 carbs( Quest peanut cups 1-2 or Low carb tortilla w/ almond butter) 
* **(total carbs never exceed 40. usually well under 30 or even 20)**

* Caffeine: 1-3 cups coffee per day, 2 equals total per day
* Diet cola: 1 a week unless with booze
* EtoH: 1 1 oz whiskey diet gingerale every other day in the evening. 3-5 whiskey n diet on Fri and Sat
* H20- Looots
* Exercise: lifting 4-5 days a week

On the plus side, I am a pharmacy intern so I have access to health testing, After 4 week Keto my Cholesterol panel (1 hour after a bacon cheese tortilla factory taco) is:

* Total-198(at goal)
* LDL(115)- close to goal, may be inaccurate from food intake
* Triglyceride (138)- Below goal and falsely elevated from food intake
* HDL-55- WAY above goal, almost a negative risk factor for heart disease
* Blood sugar after eating- 85, normal goal after a meal is &lt;140, killed it.

BUT WHERE IS MY WEIGHT LOSSSSS WHY DO I KEEEP YOYOING. the only thing I can see is the booze affecting it, but I dont have that much, is it the soda from the booze, could the quest cups be affecting my losses?

1yy97w,0,2014-02-25,my honest fitness story (a lot of text inside),[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1yy97w/my_honest_fitness_story_a_lot_of_text_inside/,"Hello, 

Pictures: http://imgur.com/a/XmwPN

The following text is going to be a long one so I apologize to those who don’t want to take the time to help an honest fellow out. So please, read through this entirely and post with extreme seriousness because I truly need guidance. Alright, so I guess we’ll start.

I’m no one to be honest. I was that kid in high school who ate about half his weight everyday and miraculously maintained his bodyweight at 190-200lbs. As soon as I got my first job at 16 I ate all the popcorn, hotdogs, and drank soda like a motherfucker. I was then inspired later on in my nutrition class to change my lifestyle because my metabolic rate is eventually going to come to a screeching halt.

“What to do then?” So I hopped on the treadmill or hamster wheel as I felt that is what it was. I would run consistently for 20 minutes three times a day and saw absolutely no change. Each time I stepped on the scale I would cringe because weeks would go by and although the running was dreadful I forced myself to go through it. The weight never changed, I stayed at a whopping 195 lbs.

“Fine.” I started to go to my local rec center and played with all the machines, dumbbells, and avoided the barbell at all costs mainly because my mother told me weights were not good for my health. Of course, mom knows best right? Again, I go for a few months, stepped on the scale, and boom. I was then 197 lbs. I’m 18 years old at this point so I practically gave up, went to prom, graduated, went to community college, played Call of Duty religiously, and sucked at life. I was depressed, occasionally got a girlfriend or two thanks to my Latin charm (I’m a romantic, who knew?). I am a very social, likable, and easy going fellow. I never really claimed that I knew anything unless it was about pop culture or video games but when it came to the gym? Insert, lolwtfamidoing.jpg.

Anyway, one winter break my overweight buddy of mine --- Holy shit! Dude! You look fucking huge, not fat, and amazing! How did you do it?! “I picked up the barbell bro. You should try something called StrongLifts.” “Dafaq?” 

The next day we went to my rec center and I asked him if we were about to do like 10 exercises, “Nah bro. I’m teaching you 5 basic lifts today and you’ll be doing 3 lifts 3 days a week.” I was dumbfounded. How is it that you just do three lifts and get stronger? He made me read the report, I bought a copy of Starting Strength as well and I began doing my own personal research.

A year later, OMFG! I could barely squat 45 lbs but as of January 2014 my lifts were the following 1RM: 

Squat: 375 lbs
Bench Press: 225 lbs
Overhead Press: 175 lbs
Barbell Rows: 165 lbs
Deadlifts: 315 lbs

Please, for a moment, I would like to ask everyone here to stop there soft nose snorting. I get it, in the course of a year my numbers should be absolutely higher. But let’s face it, I also have a life outside of the gym. I have to go to classes, participate in an internship, maintain a healthy relationship with my girlfriend, and deal with the everyday stresses of being a Latin American 21 year old (I know, crazy isn’t it?). 

I should totally looked ripped now shouldn’t I? Well, I know one thing for sure is ripped… My jeans, my khakis, and some boxers I had to throw away. Worst part? I stepped on the scale for 2014… 200 lbs. Dude! How the fuck did I do one year of StrongLifts and still look the same! Mehdi! You lied to me! Fuck my life!

Then the doubts came in, “Maybe I should start running? Maybe I should stop eating McD’s? Maybe I’m fapping too much? Maybe I am not burning enough calories? My protein shakes are making me fat? Mom stop calling me fat! I’m not fat! I’m muscular!” I’ve just about had it.

&lt;insertnamehere&gt;
Age: 21
Height: 5 feet 10 inches
Sex: Male
Weight: 200 lbs

The pictures I’ve attached to this post are me. I’ve always felt uncomfortable sharing my body mainly because of the bad self image I have of myself but I felt the need to post the pictures mainly because I know I’m not doing so good. I did my research and I can only say I think I know what to do at this point.

THE SOLUTION: 

So, I get it. The more weight I push with barbell strength training the more stronger I become as long as I do low reps and bounce up the weight every time. Cool. Muscular hypertrophy? That’s just doing certain sets with lighter weight and increasing muscular growth. Cardio? Doing the same shit over and over again using aerobic &lt;insertthewordhere&gt;. I’m 200 lbs and I have no interest in increasing the size of my muscles through hypertrophy. My dream is to become a wonderful powerful powerlifter who can push heavy weights and perform the snatch/clean and jerk one day. 

Again, my GOAL is to be a POWERLIFTER/WEIGHTLIFTER. I just want to have that awesome body as a compliment due to the amount of weights I can push. I THINK I know the diet portion of this new potential routine is going to have to involve a higher protein intake, good fats, and less bad carbs (I love my oatmeal and brown rice please don’t take that away!).

In order to shred the fat off of my body I know that I don’t have to jog/run steadily mainly because I am not going for endurance, I’m going for QUICK use of my muscles which technically means anaerobic exercises right? I’m thinking of either going for sprints or doing compound barbell movements which forces my body to work twice as hard than just running on the hamster wheel (Check this vid out: http://youtu.be/TmEJGR1_sZc?t=11m34s).

AS OF RIGHT NOW: 

I stopped heavy lifting because I felt depressed on how my thick thighs looked in my jeans, I stopped because I was tired of hearing people calling me fat despite my goals, and I’m just overall confused on how to approach this fitness gig. It really sucks, I went towards a split and I feel miserable doing it because it’s not as fun as doing the barbell exercises.

So /r/fitness, judging by the pictures, my history, and clear goals. What are your thoughts on this?

Please be brutally honest as possible, I need the motivation. If Chris Pratt could do it, why can't I?

diarena

tl;dr - I felt the need to be honest.

1yybis,3,2014-02-25,Should I pay off my car with high-interest before upgrading?,LadyLabRat,askcarsales,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/1yybis/should_i_pay_off_my_car_with_highinterest_before/,"I would like to get a newer car. Mostly because my car payment is high and it would be nice to be paying that for something newer since our finances are improving.

A few things:

I am a 25 year old student graduating next month. I have been at my job for almost two years but only work 4 hours a week (it is basically an internship). They are in the process of trying to hire me full-time since I will be getting a degree and can move up now. It will be about 40,000 per year. My husband currently makes about 40,000 per year. He was furloughed January-June this year though, but has been back since then. Our credit isn't fantastic. The recent credit we have is all good. The bad credit is at least 3 years old and there are no balances. It was small stuff like a cell phone bill, but my husband was cosigned on a loan that was late a few times years ago, but it was paid off. Our scores are probably in the low 600s. We have my student loan debt around $20,000 that we will need to start making payments on soon, and we have been renting at the same place for almost 4 years

The car I have currently is a 2006 Kia sportage. It is worth about 5,000 maximum and I owe around 10,000. My payment is $320 per month. We financed this car out of desperation 2 years ago when I got offered a full-ride to finish school and I need a newer car to put miles on and that I have done! The interest rate is about 20% through capital one (the only place that would finance us). Back then we only had a couple small loans we had paid perfectly, but our negative credit was recent, we still had an outstanding balance on credit and my husband had not been at his job long and was not making as much money. We also added a warranty that we have never used.

We have made 2 years of car payments perfectly on time. No negative balances, and had a small loan or two that we have completely paid and was always on time. Our finances are much better.

I would like to get a new/slightly used crossover SUV (we have two kids), AWD around $25,000. I plan on keeping it for a good 10 years at least.

Should we pay off this car first before we get another?

Should we get another and roll over this debt because of interest?

Should I wait until I am working a few months and save up a large down payment?

Does the college graduate financing include our situation?

I am afraid I am being impatient. I have worked really hard in school and I have a tough 2 months ahead and would love to have a small bit of enjoyment. Graduation present?

Help!!!

I hate that I'm weighed down by my family responsibilities instead of being a productive college student.

I hate that these are supposed to be the best years of my life and I'm chained to my house and my family.

I hate that my parents made irresponsible choices. I hate that because of their choices we are poor. 

I hate that our income and expenses doesn't leave us any savings. I hate that I hate to give them my financial aid money because they can't pay the bills.

I hate that my money keeps being drained and that the people who have used it the most are my own parents. 

I hate that I have to play babysitter with my 8 month old brother because we can't afford a full time babysitter.

I hate that I can't sit and work because he cries when I set him down. 

I hate that I'm confined to the house for most of the day because my parents didn't wear a condom.

I hate that I feel like this.

I hate that I can't complain to my parents about what's happening because I don't trust them with my feelings and it'll only cause me trouble.

I hate that I can't be more involved in school and with internships because I hardly have transportation and even if I did, who would take care of the baby?

I hate that I'm only doing the bare minimum in school when I could be so much more productive.

I hate that I feel envy at the people who somehow manage to live either on or off campus. I hate that I hate them for being more fortunate than me in that respect. I hate as I see them walking past me on the way to class in pajamas or jogging suits because they have the time and opportunity to do so.

I hate that I have made no friends at my new college yet. 

I hate that I'm hardly on campus. 

I hate being alone. I hate being introverted. I hate not being able to connect to people. 

I hate that I have no control over how productive I could truly be.

I hate that I have potential and drive and competence but no outlet. I hate that this somehow will affect my future, my resume, my desirability as a graduate student and as job candidate. 

I hate that I don't have a car. 

I hate to feel this way because even now I realize that however I manage to do it, going to college is in itself a privilege.

I hate, and hate, and hate. 

I have all this anger and all this envy and all this scream inside and on the outside I hide it all with not one person I can talk to face to face to help me cope. 

There, it's out."

Basically we just want to be able to provide the best crossfit experience possible for the members.

SO, i thought to ask all of you the same question:
As a women doing Crossfit what do you want or need? what dont you like? what do you wish you had more of? - it can be ANYTHING.

Here is the story:

A little over two years ago I was completing my last semester of college doing an internship in Indonesia.  When I got there I moved into a tiny, one bedroom apartment complex near where I was doing the internship. It was a very lonely time there.  The people I worked with were nice and I got along with them well but they all lived in the suburbs and work was in the city.  There isn't much of a nightlife in the area I was in and the areas where expats hungout was on the other side of town from where I live; the traffic there was terrible so going across town was a big ordeal. 

Being as lonely as I was I was starting to get this craving for intimacy.  Just the feel of someones body next to yours and knowing that they want to be there too.  At that point, it had been over 2 years since I kissed a woman.  I am not a virgin but the last time I had sex was in high school  I've never been great with women but i dated a little in college and wasn't too worried about; I would eventually find someone.  The need for intimacy while I was in Indonesia got to the point I had to do something about or at least that what my effed up brain told me.  I knew there were brothels in town and I went to one.  I slept with one of the prostitutes.  I didn't really go for the sex, I really just wanted to lay with someone and hold them.  The touch aspect was what I was after and because I am so incompetent with women I felt I needed to pay for it.  I ended up visiting the brothel 6 times and sleeping with 5 different prostitutes.  I never imagined in a million lifetimes that I would ever do such a heinous act but I did.   
 
I some how have to figure out how to get over this.  My anxiety with women is at a all time low.  I am afraid to even think about getting into a relationship and I nearly have a anxiety attack if I start to feel interested in someone or they may possibly be interested in me.  I've always felt this but it is much stronger and debilitating than before.  I used protection at the brothels and have been tested but the fear that I could get someone sick freaks me out.  Also, thinking that I have the immoral event in my life that I will probably have to tell my significant other about.  I just can't move past it.  Its been a emotional brick-wall for me.

I am writing this more to get it off my chest.  I have told three of my closest friends about it and that is it.  I am not sure what I am trying to accomplish with this; hopefully something positive comes from it.  I live in the US, I am dirt poor and don't have health insurance are the main reasons I haven't seen professional help about it and some embarrassment about admitting it to someone in person.

TL;DR:  Slept with prostitutes while abroad; ashamed about it
Thanks for reading.

1yz9ys,15,2014-02-26,"You can keep your fancy job, I'll keep my principles and a few good memories.",calliope720,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1yz9ys/you_can_keep_your_fancy_job_ill_keep_my/,"To an old friend, who was like my brother -

We were friends since before our memories began. We grew up together in our stupid little hillbilly town, and took refuge in each other when everyone around us was ridiculous and cruel, and everything in our lives was hard. I was there for you when you came out of the closet, and I helped you learn to love the new self you were getting to know. You were there for me when I was almost kicked out. I helped pull you out of the bottom of a bottle. You helped me forget about a broken heart. We spent all our time together. People at school called us the twins, and I think I took it to heart a little more than you did. To me, you were my other half, the Will to my Grace, my best friend, and my brother. 

It was really hard on me when we started drifting apart in college, but you should know how insanely proud of you I was for all your accomplishments there. I wasn't jealous. I was doing well enough in my own field, but not nearly as impressive as you, and that was fine. I only ever wanted you to be happy, and I was elated that you finally were. Top of the class, shiny new internship, respectable job, double major, conference speaker, award-winning research - it was awesome. I always knew you had it in you. I was happy. 

But things took a really dark turn when you finally dropped me like a rock that summer that we graduated college. You gave me the slip on your birthday, taking all our friends out but lying to me in order to ditch me. I found you by accident. You took me out in the street and told me I was going nowhere with my life, that I wasted my time on ""worthless things and people"", that I was too old to be goofing off like I like to do, and that I ""held no value for you anymore"". I looked into the face of my brother, my twin, and never wanted to hit someone so badly in my life - to be dumped from that kind of friendship hurt worse than anything I ever experienced. It remains the second hardest thing I've ever gone through. You walked away and left me crying in the street holding 22 years of our history in a broken heart. 

I know why you did it. You had just been accepted to your big fancy grown-up job and full-ride graduate scholarship in another state. You hated that you came from such an embarrassing, poor, dirty, classless town like ours, you hated your family, you hated who you used to be when we were young, and there was no way I couldn't remind you of that. You had to cut me out to remake your identity. You couldn't look at me and know that I knew you better than anyone else and wouldn't let you lie to yourself. I would hold you to your past, hold you to who you are, and so you had to do it. You had to leave your baggage behind. You wanted more now - money, notoriety, professional esteem, feathers in your cap, expensive parties with people high up on the ladder eating shrimp and clapping each other heartily on the back and talking about elections and city ordinances and press releases and quarterly reports. There's no room for high school nostalgia in that world. I get that. So that, I could almost forgive. 

But when my dad died - when I spent a week in the hospital watching my father grow weaker and yellower and dryer and slip into a coma, and hear the tattered husk of his body gasp for breath for the last two days while I held his hand, hoping that just one more time I'd feel him squeeze back - when my dad died, you weren't there. You weren't there for the funeral. You weren't there after. You didn't say one word to me, or my brother, or my mother, who you'd known your whole life. 

For that, I can never forgive you. Because I believe that the true measure of a man is when he can put aside his selfish pursuits to show first and foremost his love and his kindness to others in need, especially friends, especially family. While I buried my father, you were having drinks with coworkers and adjusting your tie at some place I'll never afford, laughing and putting on airs, and not thinking about me at all. Your other half. The broken half. The half that needed you. 

I had to rebuild everything after that. I have lost so much. Not just my father, not just you. I've lost a lot in the last two years. Losing you was the second hardest. But I've done it. I built myself a real, whole, functioning human being, see? I haven't got it perfect yet, but dammit, she'll do just fine. I'll do just fine. I only need me now. I don't need you. And even when you came back last year and pretended to make amends only to disappear on me two weeks later and never talk to me again *again*, I was still ok. 

You were wrong about me. I never fully believed that until now. But I'm not worthless. I'm intelligent, I'm passionate, I'm a *good friend*, I was and am a good daughter and sister, I have dreams and goals, and I'm not afraid of anything anymore, so you know what? I *am* going somewhere with my life. And I like the looks of that place a lot better than where you went. 

I hope the plaques on your wall and your slacks and blazers keep your cold heart warm at night. 

I won't be there to pick you up when it's your turn for the fall. "

I was lucky enough to get an winter 2015 internship offer from one of the big 4.

However I am having doubts about whether it is the best route for Me to take. I am currently a sophomire on the 4 year plan for the CPA and will have the 150 hours by graduation. If I take the internship ill have to take a semester off and take classes over the summer term to graduate on time.

My question is: if I am fairly confident that during fall recruiting I can secure a summer internship should I decline this one? Is it even common for applicants to deny an internship opportunity? How does the firm view this?

Any advice would be appreciated!"

- Social problems all my life, never had friends, always bullied
- Years and years of therapy, focused on social interactions and cues
- Got a girl pregnant in my late teens.  Her parents adopted the kid and asked me not to be a part of the kids life.  I listened and its been 13 years.  Getting back involved doesn't seem fair to the kid.  I pay child support and have every week since birth.  I will be paying child support until the kid is 21 (New York law)
- Got married young to a girl because she would have me.  Got fat while married.  Wife left me.  I was devastated.  I had just begun my undergrad in a new state and I knew no one/had no support network there.  Her younger sister tried to console me.  Ended up kissing.  She initiated but that doesn't matter, legally or morally.  She was slightly under age, I was slightly over age.
- Went back to school for my undergrad in my late twenties.  Junior year, second semester, contacted by the police for the kiss.  Plead guilty to two misdemeanors.  Did two years probation, therapy, etc.  Luckily, I did not have to register as a sex offender.  The $5,000 spent on a lawyer was worth it in the end.
- Currently enrolled in a graduate program.  Was told funding was available for anyone who actively pursues it.  Applied to 62 and counting positions with 3 interviews.  Been told my resume and cover letter are great by various employment/help centers.  I can't continue to borrow money to go to school.
- Deathly afraid I can't get a job because of my record.  I have an internship now and they said I could have a job once it is done.  However, that position requires the background check I didn't have to do for the internship.  No job if I fail.
- Still no friends.  I relocated for graduate school and things are very different here.  I hate my life here.  I'm still very uncomfortable in social situations.  All of my therapy has made me able to read social cues that make it so obvious I'm unwanted.  I could give many different examples.
- Physically - I'm overweight(ish), I have bad hair that needs to be kept short, I have bad teeth (broken tooth needs a crown, not yellow/jagged), my glasses are very broken and slanted.  I'm very tall/broad so my clothes are poor fitting.  All of my shoes are broken/falling apart but I can't find shoes big enough for my feet (plus I can't afford them).
- Financially - I have no money.  I have no groceries.  I live off ramen.  I need to fix my car.  I need to put gas in my car to get to work (public transportation is about 1h40m each way, which means I couldn't get to school in time).  I need to replace my glasses, get a haircut.  I need to fix my tooth so I can eat with both sides of my mouth or drink cold drinks.  I have large school payments.  I'm behind on all of my bills.
- I have no time.  I have multiple jobs to try to stay on top of my bills.  I go to school full time.  I have a house to take care of (clean, dishes, pets, etc.).  I rarely have time to sleep more than 6hrs a night.
- Everyone lets me down.  I let everyone down.  It is a vicious cycle.
- I will not except financial help.  There is a lot of reasons for this but I feel strongly I cannot adequately repay the helper and I can't accept that.  I've created enough debts in my life.

I won't accept a life of living in an apartment, eating ramen, and hating every day.  I don't necessarily want to die but I don't see a purpose.  I feel like someone with a terminal illness and I'm just waiting to expire.  I don't drink or do drugs.  I just take up space.  Everything is a waiting game.  Wait for the work day to end so I can go to school.  Wait for class to end so I can do my work.  Wait to get paid so I can pay my bills.  Wait, wait, wait, wait...and end up in exactly the same place.

Help?  I'm losing my mind.  I see it everyday and I'm helpless to stop it.

1z0m5m,0,2014-02-26,My girlfriends work experience application to Riot's Dublin Offices.,[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1z0m5m/my_girlfriends_work_experience_application_to/,"**My girlfriend, and fellow summoner, is in her second to last year of high school. After being rejected once by Riot in her request to do work experience in their Dublin Offices, them saying that they didn't have the time for under-18 internships, here she tries again to persuade Riot to take her in. I felt like this might be a good post to put on Reddit, if any Rioters may see this, and give her some more information on the possibilities. That'd be amazing, sorry for the long read.**

**what do you think she could do to make a living from her future dream job, Reddit?**


The Mail:

I am very sorry to bother you again after having received your response already. Though after reading and re-reading your e-mail, I believe there might have been some slight misunderstandings. 

As I am under 18, of course I am not able to do full-time work or even most internships, which I understand. However I am I asking for neither. 

Work experience, to me is something on a completely different level. I have no intention on interfering with your work, or being taught how to do anything. You are not by any means supposed to be my baby-sitter or professor. I, on the other hand, am of absolute service to you and the other employees. 

I have excellent cooking skills, you can ask my friends if you wish for a recommendation. I make amazing brownies and cookies. I can learn how to make tea and coffee. I am available for small tasks such as cleaning windows, vacuuming etc... Basically anything that you might need, for free! And don't worry, it doesn't count as child labour, it's ""work experience"". 

All I ask in return is that you help me get an idea of what you do for Riot. The point of work experience is to narrow down what students think they want to do in the future. I am almost 100% sure that I'd love nothing more than to do software engineering, game development and/or cyber criminology. 
This would be such a great opportunity for me to so see further into the career choice I have in mind and make sure it's something I want to do, simply by observing (and giving you and the employees freshly-made and poison-free brownies). 

My school is also not involved in my decision making or anything to do with the -work experience- itself, and therefore this cannot be counted as a school program. My school is simply facilitating the ability for students in my year to help out in a local business that is linked with their interests by giving the students three days off school. They also give us guidelines on how to apply to businesses and how to create our CV's. 

Seeing as I am not a local here in this small town (I'm Australian), it's very difficult for me to find something here in Kerry due to the variety of relatives who offer their nieces, nephews, grandchildren and second cousins twice removed all the positions, I must look a little further all the way to Dublin, where I would've made my first choice with Riot anyway (I am planning on traveling all the way to Dublin from Kerry and staying overnight).

After all, it's only for three days and then I'll be out of your way. If three days is too much, this can be compromised to two days. Even one day! Or half a day! 

If there are any specifics that need to be considered, if you want me to sign a contract that promises I won't sue you if I get injured on your premises or if you want me to leave out walnuts from my brownies because one of the employees is allergic to nuts (or just doesn't like them), I will do so. 

Please understand how important this is for my future, and if you still refuse, I understand. However to ease the pain, perhaps a more detailed explanation as to why it isn't possible could be helpful. 

Yours sincerely and apologetically for pestering, 

Sceine (Real name left out)

P.S. My CV is attached in case you want to sneak a peak, even if you're not interested in my application, I think you'll find it an entertaining read. Goodbye fellow summoner!

P.P.S. Since my last e-mail I have now reached level 20 on LoL, another step closer to Challenger!

**EDIT: She left out a word in her email.**

1z106w,2,2014-02-26,Some worst case scenario shit happened,juliusakula,dogemining,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogemining/comments/1z106w/some_worst_case_scenario_shit_happened/,"So, i've had this 280x for a little bit now and its been running around 90C for about a month... until yesterday I turn on the computer and the 280x is no longer recognised, it only shows the 6870 in cgminer, guiminer, sapphire TRIXX, device manager.

I'm thinking, oh shit, my 280x is broken, it's a good thing I've had it less than a month. I go to my newegg account, and check when I ordered it. 1/24/2014. Yesterday was 2/25/2014. I can't return it because its been more that 30 days. It broke on the 31st day. Besides that, it never stayed above 600khash, so I definitly didn't break even on the $458 card.

So I've got a few questions - One, how can I validate for sure that it's broken? Two, what is neweggs parts warranty? It says it's still covered by that and I've never taken off the fan or heatsink or messed with the card... will they be able to tell I overclocked(only undervolted..) it?

Because the universe hadn't kicked me in the balls enough, today I found out from my boss I'm only supposed to be working 20 hour weeks at my work. I feel like an idiot because I just signed the lease and am moving into my first apartment on my own... I found this out about an hour and a half after I wrote my first months rent check and got the key to the place. How do I casually mention to my girlfriend that I'm looking for a job, while we are moving our stuff into the new apartment we JUST got?

Also, is it safe to order a 290x and put it in the slot the 280x that broke was in?\

Edit: A day later, all is well. I won't have to default on the apartment, because my dad will make up the difference. We work for the same corporate and I guess he feels bad that I got my hours cut at such a convienient time... Anyway, he's going to do everything he can to make the new apartment stick. It kindof sucks that the first place I'm moving into on my own, I have to have my parents help me pay for. I was looking forward to being completely independent -- but I'm sure that's not all it's cracked up to be. So I'm kindof, subsidized... I call this condition ""funderemployed"". I'm making the most of it. Today, Instead of the usual getting to work at 9, I slept in with my girlfriend, woke up at 10, took a shower and she cooked bacon and I drove her to school and I rolled up to work at like 11. Then I took an incredibly long lunch break and played a game of league of legends at a gaming cafe with my girlfriends friend that I finally got to meet. It's not going to be very hard to adjust to the new lifestyle of working 20 hours, I'll try to have a lot of fun.

On the 280x, I'm in the process of RMA'ing it, thank you everyone for telling me that the parts warranty should cover this. In the mean time, one of my co-workers gave me $600 to own a portion of my mining rig, and I ordered [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202080) today. That should pick up my hash speed until the 280x comes back. I made good use of my $800 credit limit, as I used that $600 to pay rent and then ordered the graphics card with my new credit card. That'll work out too, I can afford it I think. Anyway, with less hours I need to be mining as much as possible. Once the 290 and the 280x are both back, I'll be at a cool 2.3 Mhash. I also ordered 5 PCI risers, so that they don't get so hot and break. I actually ordered the risers this time, not just ""I'll get some risers eventually"".

Telling my girlfriend about my hours getting cut went okay, especially since I won't be bringing in less money with the help from my dad. I took everyone's advice to tell her ASAP, because it only would get harder. I didn't want to tell her before she went to work because as a server if she's in a good mood she'll get more tips, and I didn't want to make her sad anyway. So after work I told her and even waiting 6 hours to tell her I felt like I was just lying entirely too much, and I would be not myself until I told her. I'm glad I didn't wait longer than I did, because the question ""How long have you known?"" still came up, and I would've been in trouble if I had said ""a week"" or something, and yeah, don't hide things from your SO... I thought my life would be really shitty after yesterdays events but it all worked out. In fact, It's a step toward the future, especially for my career. My job right now is ""Intern"" and I've been working as a Jr. Software Dev here for almost 6 months -they hired me for a part time position. I worked too much and they ran out of money to give me- So really, they could've just fired me yesterday. My boss was kind enough to go out and ask for more money so I can continue to work until my contract is up on 4/15. So now, I'm really in the job market, and my next job will be my second job as a software developer! My second job as a software developer means that I'm **not entirely new** to programming and I can get paid more in my next job! In the past 6 months I've learned so much PHP and MYSQL, and with my cryptocurrency hobby, I'm actually kindof awesome and employable! I now get to look for a full-time, higher paying job, and that's the most exciting thing for any 18 year old. It's just scary to be looking for a job while also moving into a new place, and also getting a programming job at a company where my dad doesn't also work will be scary too, but hey, life is scary. Walk Hard!

And some best case scenario shit happened too! My girlfriend and I went to go get gas &amp; electric set up for the new apartment, and she left the lights on in the car! and the battery died! I turned my head 90 degrees, and we were parked literally in front of a Firestone car place. I walked, got a jump box and it took all of 120 seconds to get our car jumped! :)"
1z1b56,2,2014-02-26,Second Installment,[deleted],TheLiliad,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLiliad/comments/1z1b56/second_installment/,"And the official continuation for the 24-hour thread is here. Hi, I am original OP, and I approve this message.

Original thread is here: 510435461

Let's get to it.

Last time you saw me, I was 17 and had just attempted sex with a girl who was in love with me, and I her. While consummation did not fully occur the event itself definitely cemented my feelings for her.

And now...here we go. 

Note: All those guys asking someone to email them the story are hilarious, please whatever you do, do not email them. maybe add their Google+ profiles.

(and another side note, I laughed at every ""mfw"" reply in the other topic, so don't overdo it but realize I appreciate those)

Getting on the plane was so difficult. It felt like a nightmare when I landed back in the states, back to my family, back to my normal basement-filled existence with only my vidya games and my online friends for company. Talking with Lily was great and I did like it and looked forward to it - but the image of being on top of her, or of her lips on mine, made typing on a keyboard feel stupid.

My masturbatory fantasies were literally solely focused around that encounter in the park. Sometimes I changed it up by just jacking off to the thought of us kissing. Sometimes I dared to imagine the future. Basically, my penis ended up being sore for days by the time I was done with it.

I had a real girl and she lived across (down?) the globe. It wasn't fair - but it was also exciting. I loved the thought, and could feel myself going full pedo -- though I preferred to think of it as going ""full Lily"". 

I tried to not have all our conversations revolve around sex, but I did remind her over and over that I loved her and that I wanted to kiss her more. She said much the same, sometimes adding that she wondered what others would think if they knew she had a cute boyfriend who was in high school. I attempted not to freak out and tell her I'd die if she told anyone - but she did in fact use the word ""cute"" to describe me, after seeing my 'o' face. The only person to ever see it. It made me wonder if maybe I could actually be desirable or attractive. But fuck it, I was attractive to HER, and no one else mattered.

After several weeks I asked if she was okay with what we had done in the park. I said I was sorry if I had forced her - she just went with the same line, she was disappointed we didn't get to really 'do it'. It had been enough for me, as detailed before, but she had hoped to deliver more.

""I'm too small."" I remember her saying that, as it mirrored her statement about being too short to kiss. I assured her she wasn't, that I just didn't know what I was doing, and one day we could maybe try again. She said she hoped so. And that was enough to have me jacking off like a maniac yet again. 

She was turning 13 in a bit over a month. I was happy about this, as it was one year closer to being an acceptable age, even if it was still horribly young when I thought about it - thought about me, acne and braces, at 13. Yet one year closer was one year closer. A five year difference meant literally nothing by the time she was...18? 16? I tried to push the definition, wondering where the line would be.

Trying to shop for your girlfriend who exists in a culture you don't get in an age you don't entirely get is hard. I looked around for a while before settling on getting flowers delivered to her from an 'anonymous friend'. 

And oh boy did that go over well. I was afraid it was too mature or her parents would catch on, but that night she told me she was overjoyed and her parents assumed it was a boy from school with a crush. It was...perfect. And started a new tradition, that will be mentioned in the future.

We never talked about her body or mine, never got into having 'cyber'. That seemed sort of like perverting her, more than what I had already done. And plus who knew if she knew how to delete logs or hide her computer activities. Best to play it kind of, but not really, safe.

Her birthday was the precursor to Christmas, and I decided to not do anything big for that, just maybe a picture of me, or an emotional chat, or something. However she got to me first - ""guess what I asked for for Christmas""

I did not guess, as my first thought was a doll or an iPod. Of course when you come from decently wealthy stock, as her dad was, gifts tend to be a bit...big.

""i want to go back to america for a week.""

SPROING. My pants flew across the room from the power of my erection. I'd waited half a year, and figured I had another half left before I'd see her again. Suddenly there was potential for... soon! Really soon! She hadn't been back to America since they moved away and the request made sense. They used to live in our city (a big one, don't ask) 

and thus it made sense that they'd come back to the same city if they were going to see their old friends/places. I was overjoyed, especially when she said her dad had bought tickets for the first week of January. I started taking care of personal hygiene and stopped wearing sweatpants and began lifting like a champ (none of that really happened) to prepare for her arrival.

This was going to be it. I was going to open the year, before I turned 18, by losing my virginity. I was going to do it. I was. 

Power of positive thinking aside, I was just excited to have her back again. Really our emotional bond had hardly changed, we talked all the time, we were just missing everything physical - from holding hands to hugging to kissing to...the 'beyond'. Or maybe I was just missing it, who knows.

December crawled by. I finished my second to last semester of high school, got accepted to a decent college for business, basically made sure I did not bring shame to my family while I did everything to create a scenario in which my family would be more shamed than one would think possible (um I am not sure that sentence worked, you know what I mean). 

Christmas was coming, not that I cared. Each day was like an eternity, and I looked forward to logging onto the computer in the evening just to get in some talking before I went to sleep, praying the next day would come sooner.

Then one day she stopped signing on. A few days off here and there made sense, but in the middle of December she was just gone. Never online, not invisible or anything else. Just...gone. My heart sank when I saw that, immediately traveling down the worst possible solution, assuming she had found a new guy or had told on me or... That it was over. I couldn't handle it being over. We signed off our chats with ""i love you"" and/or ""i miss you"". How could it end so unceremoniously?

A week passed. No Lily. Christmas day was just me sitting under a massive tree with a huge pit of anxiety in my stomach. Two weeks had passed now - no Lily.

I had been living the dream and it was time to come back to earth. I...tried to find it in myself to accept that. 

We were supposed to meet up in my home city. We were supposed to, uh, take one more step in our relationship together. I was supposed to at least be able to kiss her one more time.

Masturbation came to a near-halt as each time I fantasized about that one early evening in the park, all I could see was her face, her smile, and then it vanishing. The way she had vanished, suddenly, leaving me alone.

The first week of January. It had now been three weeks since I'd spoken to her, the longest we'd gone in years.

I was devastated. Thinking about going to college, even thinking about going to classes in high school...it all felt so pointless. My parents noticed something wrong, and I admitted it had to do with a girl, they told me that young love was always like this, like it was the end of the world.

But this was MORE than that, it wasn't just an immature relationship. It was...she was...

She was my everything.

As I write this I can feel my chest tightening up. That was the furthest I've fallen, the darkest I've allowed my mind to go. Was it codependency or sick or something else? Maybe.

I NEEDED her.

Lily.

Lily.

Lily. 

I had thought about skimming over this part, fortunately I know you guys all know the pain of having something ripped away from you, whether or not you ever really 'had it' in the first place.

I knew she was supposedly in our city in early January, and as I woke up each morning I wondered where she was, who she was with, what she was doing. I wondered if she missed me.

It was stupid to wonder, stupid to consider that a lovely girl would-

I was in the midst of just such a downward, flagellating spiral when my mother told me that some Spanish person was on the phone for me.

I assumed immediately, trying to keep my heart from leaping (it did), trying to keep myself from sprinting to the phone (I did), trying to keep my voice from quavering as I said ""ola?"" (it quavered like WT Snacks when he sees cheese pizza).

""Ola. Puedos ir tu habitacion?""

(Yeah yeah don't make fun of me at least I tried)

I knew that voice.

I went to my room. 

In my room we switched to English, thank moot, as I had reached the limit of my ability the moment I said ""ola"". I guess a summer down there hadn't actually improved the espanol at all.

""It's me."" It was Lily. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't decide what to say before finally settling on ""where have you been?"" I knew girls don't like desperate guys and I tried to keep it together, but what the hell, what she'd done was bullshit. ""Our computer broke."" That made sense. Sort of. ""Why didn't you FIX it?"" ""My dad got me a new one for Christmas. But I don't know how to put AOL on it.""

To this day I blame Mac OS X and its coolness for almost ending my life. Parents, buy your young daughters Windows computers so their communication with their pervert boyfriends can continue. And that's the moral of the story.

""Are you here? In America?"" My voice sounded like I was on the verge of crying. I cleared my throat and tried to blink away the, uh, mist in my eyes. ""Yeah. We got here last night, we're staying at the [large hotel]."" A long pause. I had no idea what to say. My day had suddenly gone from the worst of my life to the best yet (or maybe second best) and I hardly knew what was next. ""I missed you so much, I love you, I-""

She interrupted me, which was probably a good thing before I went full-beta on her once again.

""When can I see you? 

My first response was I'd sprint to her hotel room in the next five minutes, but tried to play it slightly cooler. ""I'm sure our dads have a dinner or something, try and find out."" She hung up and was off. I clung to the phone for dear life, snarling and hissing at my mother when she tried to take it from me, eventually biting her hand off to show her who the alpha was.

It rang again, after ages and ages of waiting. ""They had one tomorrow night but I got him to change it to tonight.""

I laughed. Lily's ability to manipulate her father was always outstanding and it seemed like this was no different. ""I told him I'm meeting a friend tomorrow night, but I wanted to see you guys.""

Perfect. In several different ways - she was definitely not meeting a friend the next day. And I would be seeing her TONIGHT. Assuming my parents were fine with the switch, which they had to be due to them being window dressing for this story/my life. 

Dinner came. She was wearing a black dress with a wide neckline, one that showed off her collarbone and the upper part of her chest, no cleavage popping despite breasts clearing being shoved upwards by a bra that was clearly a feat of engineering. She was on slight heels, just an inch perhaps, and looked even better than the last time I saw her. Gorgeous, perfect, everything I wanted in one human form. Lily wore a white headband holding her black hair away from her face, a face that shone brightly as she turned and smiled at me.

""Hey.""

""Hey.""

We hugged awkwardly. My erection said hello within milliseconds, then we all sat down to a meal together.

I tried to talk and not stare at Lily. She looked so good, how could everyone not see it? My counterpart, a fellow senior in high school now, an expert bitch like most senior girls, ignored me.

I seriously considered going to the bathroom with her, or playing footsy under the table, or just running out the front door with her hand in mine until we found a place we could be alone.

Really though the bathroom plan was halfway real in my mind. Quick kisses in the hallway - simple enough, right? But how to get her to come with...hmm... These thoughts took up most of dinner, except when I chimed in to talk business with ""the guys"". Other than that I looked like my usual strange closed-off socially maladjusted self. 

The mystery of why any girl would like me is still not solved, by the way. Don't expect a how-to manual at the end of this, I am still as mystified as you are.

Dinner ended. More hugs. I really, really, really wanted to kiss Lily. Just for a moment, just to feel what it was like after half a year without it.

They got in a taxi and were gone. I floated back home and tried to remember how to breathe. 

Then the planning went into full effect. I was going to get alone time with Lily and I was going to get it soon. She had an excuse for the following night, and I was going to take advantage of it. We spoke on the phone again that evening -- going to my home was not possible, going to her hotel room wasn't either. Unlike parks in exotic foreign lands, we would definitely be caught by a group of /b/tards and raped to death if we attempted anything out in the open.

So it was time to bust out daddy's credit card. Or just a pile of cash. Or use the credit card to get a pile of cash.

School vacation was still on. Lily had plans from approximately nine am until seven pm when she was supposedly meeting up with her friends.

We planned it together, after I told her what I was thinking.

I paid for the hotel room -- a nice one, though not too nice. I sat back in my home while she did whatever she did with her family. I resisted the urge to masturbate. I wondered if this was going to happen or if a bear was just going to break down the door and eat me. I wondered for hours, tossing and turning, before she called me.

It was on.

I told her the location.

We both took taxis, with me arriving just slightly before her, trying to not look incredibly suspicious as I moseyed past the front desk looking incredibly suspicious. She probably did the same. I was sitting in the room, wearing 'nice clothes' - a polo shirt and jeans - when I heard a light knock.

I opened the door. She jumped into my arms. I staggered backwards and closed the door, locking it, wondering... No, no need to wonder. This was about to happen. 

Now despite all my research on sex (i.e. all the porn I watched) I was not feeling very confident in my ability to perform oral. This was, in all seriousness, the number one concern in my mind as we kissed one another, held one another, fell backwards onto the bed. I am not sure what she was wearing to be honest, that became a very small matter all things considered. Soon her top was off, revealing the juvenile bra beneath -- the first time I'd actually seen her like that. I kissed her firmly, pulling her on top of me, maneuvering her body over mine, marveling in her litheness, her beauty, her...everything.

We pulled away from one another with an almost audible pop, both of us gasping, faces wet and messy, eyes shining, her hair already a mess from me running my hands through it.

""I need to call my mom.""

This was almost as much as the period comment, causing me to throb in my pants as she moved to the bedstand, pulling a scrap of paper from her jeans and dialing, informing her mother she had arrived safely. She hung up and I pulled her back to me, onto my lap as I sat with my back up against the headboard, Lily facing me, almost like that first time we had kissed.

I could see her breasts pushing into the bra just inches away from me. I took a long look, not afraid to let her see me enjoy her body, before shifting my eyes back to her face and smiling.

""I love you. I missed you so much.""

She grinned. ""Do you want me to take it off?""

Honestly each thing she said made me want to blow a load in my pants. But instead I took a breath and nodded.

She seemed to take her goddamn sweet time with it, unsnapping, pulling it forward, letting the patches of fabric hang on her breasts for interminable seconds before letting it fall off.

My first in-person boobs. They did not disappoint at all. Small, just handfuls I would say, topped with soft pink nipples. My mouth was definitely dropped open as I looked and she watched me with obvious delight. 

""You're gorgeous."" I breathed it out without even thinking, voice full of lustful desire. My hand came up practically on its own, cupping underneath one youthful breasts, feeling its slight give, the taut warm flesh beneath my hand... Again, enough to make me cum a hundred times over. I leaned in and kissed her, one hand on her boob, the other behind her back, holding her close to me, our mouths opening, coming into one another, kissing like old pros now, like two people fully in love. Obviously at this point her age didn't matter, nothing mattered, all that mattered was her.

Her nipple didn't harden - I do remember that quite specifically. I wonder if I fucked up? No matter. It remained soft, pliable, and I rubbed my palm over it for a moment before Lily grimaced and shook her head. This was enough to make me move both hands to her back, smiling apologetically.

She backed off of me, pulling down her tight jeans with mild difficulty, revealing panties with some sort of silly pattern, before getting back onto the bed with me, where I had taken off my own shirt to reveal my oh-so-beautiful skinny torso. 

We kept kissing. I was trying desperately to take it slow. I knew where this was heading and wanted to do it right - and do it all the way. 

The kissing was, honestly, almost enough. If I forgot the sensation of my dick against her then I was able to imagine that I could be satisfied with just kissing.

Seriously, have I said enough about the kissing yet? Let me know.

We rolled over so I was atop her now, her hands lightly pushing against my chest as I bore down on her, mouth nuzzling, probing, tongue against her own. Finally I pulled back and away from her.

I had Lily here, in bed, in her underwear. Nothing to interrupt us. I sat back and took off my own pants, the massive tent of my erection (I'm like sixteen inches you guys) as obvious as anything. ""Ahe. I'm sort of..."" I had no idea how to explain this. Eh, she had to know what it meant. Or hopefully she did.

I moved between her legs, both of us with our underwear still on, and rocked against her, feeling my erection press into that soft flesh between her legs, her stomach shuddering as she took deep breaths, breasts expanding upwards slightly each time.

""Can we...""

I tried to ask for permission.

""Can we try?""

I am not sure if that is exactly what I said, it was something like that. Then it was her turn -- ""I love you, anon. I. Love. You.""

Seemed like permission.

I moved backwards and pulled my underwear off, now fully naked with a girl for the first time.

""It's too big."" She pulled her mouth to the side as she took her panties off, then laying back against the headboard, head propped up by pillows.

""We can go slow, it's okay, we don't have to-"" I started to back off mentally before trying. I wanted to have the right expectations. Maybe it wouldn't work, maybe she couldn't, maybe I was actually 'too big', though that seemed like such a porn thing to say. 

I moved up between her legs, dick bobbing between my own as I lay on top of her. First we kissed some more, feeling our naked bodies against one another for the first time. Her kisses were slightly more hesitant, kind of nervous, or perhaps I was just projecting my own insecurities onto her (almost definitely that). 

I could feel my penis, slightly wet already, resting on top of her folds. My shaft was lengthwise against her labia, just moving gently up and down, head hovering below her belly button. Finally I propped myself up onto one hand, raising my torso so we met at the hips only.

Pulling back I reached a hand down to try and reposition myself. This time around I noticed she had a tiny bit of fuzz on her pussy, just enough to make me feel slightly less pedo (but not much). Should I have worried about her period? Definitely yes. Did I? Nope.

Lily spread her legs side, those puffy, reddened parting slightly, and I pressed my cockhead against her, this time fully cognizant of what I was doing, seeing it all beneath me, pressing in oh-so-gently and yet firmly. Her folds pressed inwards, dragged in slightly by my penetrating erection, a strange look that made me worry I was hurting her.

I stopped. Looked up at her. ""Are you okay?"" Maybe it was beta to ask, but I had to. She nodded. ""It feels like stretching.""

Well...better than ripping and tearing pain. I withdrew, repositioned, pressed in again. The same thing happened, slight inward folding, about half my cockhead successfully making it 'in', but clearly some sort of tight ring preventing me from going further. 

I kept going like that. Pull out, press in, try and get a millimeter further each time. It was slow going and I was on the edge of cumming, and ruining the moment, from the instant I saw my penis press inside of her even slightly. Finally, finally, finally I pressed harder, my hands moving to her hips to hold her in place as I tried to get past that first little 'trial'. 

I felt a ring of what seemed like muscle pop down around my cockhead. Have you guys felt that? Oh my god. Oh. My. God.

Paused for a moment. Looked at Lily. Kissed her more, until she actually pushed me away with a soft hand on my chest. ""You don't have to stop.""

That took me aback for a moment.

""I want to kiss you. I don't just...""

I looked at her for a moment, dick buried a solid inch inside of her, trying to decide what my best move was.

""We love each other. This isn't...some stupid..."" I couldn't find the exact words to say. So I kissed her more.

She didn't speak up. I felt my dick beating inside of her, my heartbeat seeming to come from the very tip of my cock now. Finally: ""I love you too. I do. I want you to...""

It was her turn to trail off.

I was past talking, and looked downwards, humping my hips into her, trying to get any further, feeling like it was an impossible task, especially when I could see 5/6 of my penis outside of her.

With extreme delicacy, trying not to get too, uh, overwhelmed, I pulled myself out and pushed in again, to the same point, right where I felt her 'snap' around me. Then out, then in, just that one little bit of my length. 

Who knows how long that went on - it could have been an hour or thirty seconds. After a while I felt like I could go deeper, and on one thrust I tried, pushing in a little further, a little faster, a little harder.

FINALLY I felt myself really penetrate her, my dick now slightly further in, the hot grip encasing my head and the top of my shaft. There was a slight resistance inside her, despite it feeling like I could go further. Really hard to describe.

I think you know what I'm trying to describe - I am unsure how many of you have deflowered a thirteen year old, but I have, and I'm here to say it is really hard to put down in words. Won't stop me from trying though.

So I pushed. And pulled back, and pushed again. It took three attempts, the third more straining, pressing, feeling her clench up against me, her hands suddenly on my stomach as I closed my eyes and strained. Yeah - not quite as romantic as you might hope. And then the resistance was gone, my penis moving inside another inch, maybe less. On pulling back, I saw red fluid on myself, as if I needed confirmation of what had just happened. 

It dripped onto the bedspread (though I didn't see this, just discovered it later), those final remnants of Lily's girlhood.

She was obviously in pain, eyes clenched tight, mouth a thin line that she held closed as well. I said something trite and stupid like ""it's okay"", or even more likely I let out an animalistic gurgle.

But that sort of clenching, stressed-out, pained response had one negative impact on my perfect sexual form - and that was that she had clamped to the point that I couldn't move in and out of her any more.

Now I did clear my head, or try to, looking down at this beautiful girl, my everything, moving a hand from her hip to her face, stroking my thumb against her cheek.

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry - it's okay."" 

I did not magically become a porn star at any point, so things stayed pretty real, sorry if you are expecting a unicorn to pop out of her ass while I fuck her mouth. (I'm looking at you, furry guy)

But she did open her eyes finally, smiling for real now, shiny with slight tears. I didn't try and explain it to her, she wasn't a five-year-old, but instead just kissed her nose, running my hand up and down her side now, moving my kisses to her upper lip, then her full mouth. As I did this, I started to move my hips again, gently, feeling myself go in noticeably deeper. I was still 'bottoming out' before I got myself fully inside of her, but I figured that this was to be expected.

I was actually fucking her. I looked down at my penis shifting in and out, her labia dragged inward and outward with it, the blood still present, along with plenty of other liquids I wasn't about to try and identify.

A year previous I'd have been surprised had I died NOT a virgin, and now here I was, having sex in a hotel room. Having sex! Yes, these thoughts were actually in my head. It was exciting to finally be doing it, even if I was a little late (little did I know that 18 isn't really that late). And with someone I loved, and someone who loved me back, enough to do this with me...it was... 

I could have almost cried, were it not for the bolts of pleasure shooting through my body each time our hips came together, each time I thrust into Lily's body, each time I felt myself begin to slide out of her...it was indescribable. Better than kissing, better than masturbating, better even than dubs (no seriously).

The time it took you to read this is almost definitely longer than the amount of time I lasted, though in my memory we fucked like old lovers for a minimum of six hours. The idea of even bothering to pull out was silly - I had managed to get inside her, I was going to end there as well.

I could feel it building- 

My balls tightened as I picked up my pace, now thrusting in and out more frantically, with less timing and precision, mouth probably hanging open, first looking between us to see myself actually penetrating her, before deciding that wasn't what I wanted to cum while looking at -- I moved my eyes up her body, to Lily, my beloved, my everything. She was looking down as well, but then up at me as she felt my gaze shift.

I tried to say I love you, it came out more like grunts, and then-

I felt myself unload inside her, hot jets spurting inside her body, against her immature womb, the liquid building and making my cock slide easily as I continued to jab into her with each throb of pure pleasure. I saw white, fell downwards onto her as it began to subside, letting out moans as I slowly began to come down, the realization of what we'd just done...if anything turning me on again. No regret, no fear - only love and lust in perfect combination.

I'd just felt my first boob, lost my virginity, taken a girl's virginity, and cum inside her all in one fell swoop.

Jesus christ please excuse OP while he cums from remembering. 

I managed to get off of her before I smothered her to death. The aura of sex lay heavy in the air, and with regret I felt myself slip out of her - a place I never wanted to leave again. I don't like a mess, but the semen, blood, and lubricating, uh, stuff was basically everywhere and there was no cleaning it up. I checked the clock - she had to be back to hers within the next couple hours. Enough time to cuddle and talk, and maybe...But then again judging by how she was wincing as she sat up, Lily wasn't going to be up for round 2 in the near future.

""That was...amazing.""

The first thing I said was about as cliched as they come, and I was ashamed of myself but also knew there was no more honest way to express myself.

""I love you.""

She said it back this time - ""I love you too."" I leaned over to kiss her before standing, walking to the dresser and getting some kleenex to clean myself off a bit, OCD shining through.

I brought her back a handful - as I came towards her I did look lecherously between her legs, where her labia remained parted open slightly, sticky white globules oozing out of her at a slow crawl, an amount I don't think I've ever produced before, creeping down her ass and landing on the bed.

Lily took the tissues and pushed them between her legs. 

We kissed again, a quick peck on the lips, as she stood up slightly shakily. The amount of stains on the sheets was kind of gross, if not incredible, and she maneuvered to wipe away between her legs several more times, the amount of semen inside of her seeming to finally come to an end.

Whether or not cumming inside her was a bad idea didn't matter, I had done it and that was that. What did matter was hugging her again, which I did, kissing her forehead - the only place I could reach while I was standing - and telling her I loved her.

""I think I need a shower."" Lily said, with a little giggle, my first sign that I could relax and freak out just slightly less. We went into the bathroom together, stood underneath the spray, ran soap over one another.

Of course I was sporting another boner quickly, which made Lily laugh as she noticed it poking her in the belly. ""I don't think I can do that again right now."" She said, looking downwards, the angle just right for me to pick her up and impale her and have shower sex just the way -- I broke myself away from that train of thought and nodded. 

""I can't help it when I see you!"" It felt nice to...not be ashamed of my erections, or of any part of my body, to have someone loving and gorgeous appreciate very bit of me, when she could see literally every flaw. 

We got out of the shower and I made the bed again - she put her clothes back on, much to my disappointment, as now that I'd seen her naked it seemed a shame to ever cover it up. I dressed as well. With me sitting on the lovely hotel chair (joke, it was not lovely), Lily got onto my lap, resting her legs sideways over mind, nestling her head underneath my chin. I put my arms around her, pulling her tightly to me. She let out a happy sigh. I did as well. I drew in her scent, the soap of the shower mostly prevalent, perhaps I just imagined an odor of what we'd just done still present on her body.

We stayed like that. Maybe she slept, maybe I did. But the moment she had to leave came far too soon.

She walked out the door, leaving well before me to prevent things from looking odd. Or whatever reasoning my 007 mind had come up with.

My heart wanted to break again as she walked away. But the door closed, and she was gone. I wondered when the next time would be... I wondered if I'd made a huge fucking mistake.

Mostly I basked in the afterglow of what we'd just done.

Holy shit. It had really happened. 

We did not get private time again before she was back to her home. We saw each other a few more times, hugged, said our goodbyes on her last day. Again, I had a hard time looking her parents in the face knowing what I had done. I also researched as much as I could about whether or not there was a way to know if my kid was inside of her...as that was obviously not going to be okay. Sadly the internet did not have an easy solution for that one, so I knew I just had to wait it out.

Time passed.

We kept talking.

I brought up the sex every now and then, and she seemed mostly perturbed by how painful it had been, and that an orgasm had eluded her. She did not seem to be pregnant, though I did not push the issue of her period as that seemed weird.

But I did mention missing her body, her perfect breasts, the feeling of her arms around me or hands on my chest... Every now and then mentioning the hotel room, what we had done.

Phew.

It was hard, and by it I mean my penis every time we spoke. Cybering with her was not going to happen, but there was plenty of simultaneous chat/fap that she was unaware of. I think.

I had the chance to go back down there to do the same internship as the summer previous, and while it'd be notably shorter due to prepping for FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE, I obviously did everything to ensure it'd happen. 

(Okay guys. Where do we go now?)"
1z2k7r,3,2014-02-27,I think Canadian Medical Schools should have (more) affirmative action for Rural Origin students. CMV.,[deleted],changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1z2k7r/i_think_canadian_medical_schools_should_have_more/,"Finding doctors willing to practice medicine in rural Canada is hard. Straight up. The patient to doctor ratio is significantly higher in rural settings (1:1200 doctor/patient as opposed to 1:980 in urban Canada) and doctors in rural practices and hospitals feed overworked.

&gt; [Although 20% of Canadians live in rural communities, only 10% of the country’s family physicians practise in these areas. The shortage of physicians in many rural Canadian communities has been attributed to issues such as lack of access to teaching hospitals, less vacation time, demanding call schedules, and financial considerations. Medical students have cited difficulties finding employment for their partners, distance from family members, geographic isolation, and lack of professional support as disadvantages of rural practices.](http://www.cfp.ca/content/55/1/72.full)

It has also been indicated that students who grew up in rural situations are much more inclined to return to rural settings when they have graduated from medical school. They are more likely to favour family medicine. Therefore it is advantageous to have rural origin students in medical school as they are necessary for medical systems in rural areas. We need doctors who are willing and able to live in remote settings for the accessibility of all to our health care system.

Presently it seems rural students appear to be underrepresented in medical schools.

&gt; [National data on applicants including grade points averages and offers is not available, but Ontario data suggests that fewer rural students than their urban counterparts apply to medical school and even those who do apply, with similar grade point averages and MCAT scores to their urban counterparts, fewer rural students are accepted. (Hutten-Czapski in press)](http://www.cfpc.ca/uploadedFiles/Resources/Resource_Items/Health_Professionals/AdmissionRuralOrigin.pdf)

Students from rural backgrounds face several key problems in gaining admission to - and attending - medical school. Some of them are outlined in the report linked above but they include:

* Medical students have disproportionately highly educated parents who, more frequently than not, live in urban settings. Kids growing up in rural townships lack the exposure to highly educated role models that these children often do via relationships with their parents and their circle of typically similarly educated friends.
* Rural students are frequently economically disadvantaged. They were less likely to come from money (see also above: highly educated parents are more likely to have higher incomes than lesser educated parents of rural childrend). This provides dual problems: they often have to work to support themselves through university leaving less time for internships, volunteer work and other CV enriching opportunities and, furthermore, makes medical tuition particularly onerous. Also no medical schools are located in rural areas. Rural students face further economic hardship in that there is no ability to commute like their urban counterparts can. They also must pay for travel to and from their homes if they want to see their families.
* Rural students frequently have fewer academic and extra curricular opportunities in highschool which impacts their CVs. This impacts their ability to obtain competitive paid positions within the medical/science field prior to medical school that favourably add to one's medical school application.
* Admissions committees are largely comprised of people who are from and currently reside in urban locations. They don't necessarily see the demand or feel the acute need for rural doctors as they are somewhat divorced from that reality. (In the 2003 survey, of Canadian medical school admission associate deans, only 3 indicated they had a rural physician on their schools admission committee. It is difficult to develop policies that take the rural admission issues into account if there is not rural representation on the admission committee. Similarly, the heavy preponderance of urban interviewers at most medical schools may result in an unintentional urban selection bias as it may be that “medical school admission committee members tend to give high ratings to those students whose backgrounds, values and orientation are similar to their own”). Only the University of Manitoba has a policy to specifically help rural applicants and it only pertains to Manitobans.

I think we should both reserve spots in medical school for rural origin students and provide scholarships and bursaries to help provide incentive and offset expenses. Though this is unfair to urban origin students, it is necessary to help address the growing shortage of doctors willing to practice in remote locations and is the best recourse for growing rural practices and generating better equality in accessibility for healthcare among rural Canadians."

Is it possible to get a decent internship with my mediocre grades and this late into the process? If so, does anyone have an experience on where to start? I live in the NYC area if that helps.

Alex Pettyfer (Magic Mike) and Gabriella Wilde (The Three Musketeers) star in Universal Pictures' ENDLESS LOVE, the story of a privileged girl and a charismatic boy whose instant desire sparks a love affair made only more reckless by parents trying to keep them apart. Directed by Shana Feste (Country Strong), the romantic drama co-stars Robert Patrick, Bruce Greenwood, Rhys Wakefield, Dayo Okeniyi, Emma Rigby and Joely Richardson. Scott Stuber and Pamela Abdy (Identity Thief) of Bluegrass Films are joined by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (Gossip Girl) of Fake Empire to produce the film from writers Josh Safran (Gossip Girl), Feste and Schwartz. Inspired by the 1979 novel and 1981 film of the same name, ENDLESS LOVE will be released on Valentine's Day, 2014.

""Endless Love"" isn't so much a remake of the 1981 Franco Zeffirelli film as it is an extended ad for the idyllic Abercrombie &amp; Fitch lifestyle.

This is supposed to be a film about the throes of teenage first love—a love you would go to jail for, set a house on fire for, a love that requires a restraining order—but it's awfully tasteful and emotionally detached in its blissed-out depiction of beautiful young people cavorting in the sunlight.

Toned, tanned David and Jade (Alex Pettyfer and Gabriella Wilde, both former models) frolic in a meadow, leap off a dock in slow motion and splash in a lake, all to the blare of alt rock music to signal to us how we should react to these images. They make romantic love on the carpet by the fireplace light (but this time there's no creepy mom watching them from the shadows). Even their vaguely grungy moments—kissing in the back of a beat-up pickup truck or in the hot summer rain—feel impeccably art designed.

In short, director and co-writer Shana Feste has remade ""Endless Love"" but she's taken out all the crazy. Not that the original was all that great to begin with; a six-time Razzie Award nominee, it was screechy, melodramatic and over-acted, with an awkwardly flat lead performance from Brooke Shields. But at least it had passion. Pettyfer and Wilde look lovely together—although they're both in their mid-20s playing 17-year-olds, and it shows—and they do enjoy some real chemistry throughout their flirtatious, falling-in-love stage. But the sense that something vital is at stake is woefully lacking.

Some of the basic details and visual touchstones are in place, but Feste (""Country Strong"") and co-writer Joshua Safran have reconfigured this story entirely—and, notably, omitted the Oscar-nominated Lionel Richie-Diana Ross theme song which was such a ubiquitous hit on radios and prom dance floors alike. (Also missing this time around: the small role of the wild-eyed arsonist played by a young Tom Cruise in mercilessly short Daisy Dukes.)

Now, instead of an age difference, there's a class difference. David is a smart, decent, blue-collar guy who's happy to go into business with his father (Robert Patrick) as a mechanic rather than apply to college. Jade is a wealthy, sheltered and studious girl with plans to attend Brown University in the fall and become a cardiologist like her father (Bruce Greenwood).

The resemblance to the least-demanding sort of YA fiction, on the other hand, seems intentional. He is David (Alex Pettyfer), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. She is Jade (Gabriella Wilde), a smart, privileged girl who’s lived a sheltered life. They spent high school not talking to one another, but that hasn’t stopped David from seeing, as he explains in a gooey bit of opening voiceover, “the possibility of us.” After a cute escapade at a country club where David works as a valet, Jade sees the possibility, too. 

With little prompting, she’s on David like an electromagnet on a Buick, determined to make up for years of lost time during her last summer vacation before embarking on a demanding internship designed to feed into a medical career. He’s good for her, bringing a crowd to her party and a smile to her face, and she’s good for him, inspiring him to reconsider going to college. And everyone sees it, from Jade’s frustrated writer mom Anne (Joely Richardson) to her brother Keith (Rhys Wakefield) to David’s aw-shucks, salt-of-the-earth mechanic dad Harry (Robert Patrick, slowly morphing into Martin Sheen). 

The night of their high school graduation, David and Jade meet cute at the swanky restaurant where David works as a valet alongside his wisecracking best friend (a likable Dayo Okeniyi). Sparks fly instantly and the two become inseparable for the rest of the summer, to the vocal disapproval of Jade's snobbish dad. His overprotectiveness also stems from his continued grief over the loss of Jade's superstar older brother a few years back.

But the rest of the family welcomes David in; Jade's mother (Joely Richardson) and older brother (Rhys Wakefield) both experience much-needed emotional awakenings at the sight of Jade reveling in her first love. As David insinuates himself further with these folks—in a sweet and hunky way, rather than a dark and stalky way—something clearly has to give.

Director Shana Feste brought an occasionally entertaining fondness for melodramatic extremes to her 2010 film Country Strong, but here, she colors inside the lines. Working from a script co-written by Joshua Safran, a veteran of the TV shows Gossip Girl and Smash, Feste puts her photogenic cast through the expected paces in what ultimately becomes a conflict between a perfectly unobjectionable summer romance and a father unaware of the deleterious effects of the bug up his ass. Greenwood and a dewy-eyed Richardson overcompensate for younger leads not trying hard enough. Pettyfer and Wilde look the parts, but any scenes asking them to emote quickly turn disastrous. (A supporting cast of suspiciously mature-looking “teen” friends, one of them sporting a pair of distractingly inflated lips, doesn’t help.)

Just as the tension between father and suitor should be increasing, though, Feste goes through the motions en route to her happy ending. Strong, veteran character actors like Greenwood, Patrick and Richardson certainly elevate this predictable, lightweight material, but they can only do so much.

The film features many scenes with analogues to the novel, but they’ve been emptied out and drastically reworked, most notably a house fire that sets the novel into motion, but here shows up much later, and serves a considerably different purpose. That purpose, as with every element in the film, is to confirm the rightness of Jade and David’s passion for each other, any outside objections be damned. That’s far removed from the source, but more troublingly, presented in the least challenging way possible. Of course these kids belong together. They look great next to each other! End

Watching ""Endless Love,"" you long for it to be riskier, edgier, or at least more reflective of actual teenage experiences and emotions. Even the partying feels false, with freshly scrubbed kids talking about getting drunk and high without actually taking part in such activities or indicating their eventual effects. (Ostensibly, this creative decision was intended to secure a PG-13 rating.)"
1z2wtd,1,2014-02-27,Should I go to counselling or figure this out myself,throwawayelizabeth,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1z2wtd/should_i_go_to_counselling_or_figure_this_out/,"Hi, apologies if this is the wrong place! Throwaway as some people irl know my normal user name.

Basically - I don't know if I should go and receive counselling for an issue. My university has a free counselling service, but its quite busy so I don't want to take up a spot incase my issue is too trivial and someone else really needs one.

My issue is I've been offered a great summer internship in a city 4 hours away, meaning I'll need to move away from my flat. It will probably lead to employment when I graduate too.

The issue is 4 years ago I attempted to move far away from home and where I went to high school to attend university and became awfully homesick. I put on easily 80+ pounds in weight (that I am currently in the midst of losing thanks r/loseit!), I would lie in my dorm room and cry all the time, barely left my room or went to class, felt worthless, lost all my confidence drank pretty much everyday until I blacked out, self harmed and tried to kill myself at one point. I wound up transferring to a different University in a city I'd went to highschool in, where all my friends lived, where my boyfriend lived and only a 30 minute train ride to my parents. As soon as I moved back I stopped feeling so awful and I've slowly been building up my confidence again. No one really knows how badly I suffered from homesickness apart from my boyfriend who I now live with.

I've came on so much since then and I'm now a very self confident, with a wide circle of friends, doing really well in my academics and I'm president of a few different clubs/teams at university.

However I'm so scared that if I move away I'll get homesick like I was before (I'm almost in tears thinking about it as I type this) - I know that this feeling might be silly because I am a very different person now than what I was 4 years ago so. I'm not sure going to counselling would be able to help me in anyway, and I really don't know if I should bother the Uni's counselling team and potentially take up a slot in their very busy time table.

What do you all think I should do?"

I found out I was expecting during exams over the holidays and I am in the process of finishing off my 4th year History degree. My plan was to go to grad school in the fall to do my MLIS (Masters of Library Information Sciences), but I will be taking at least a year off to (hopefully) breastfeed and care for the little one.

I am currently 17 weeks pregnant, have gotten over the extreme fatigue I battled for a good portion of my first trimester, and am anxiously awaiting my completion of classes and internship with the Ontario Library Association at the beginning of April :)

It's hovering around -40 to -45 Celsius today and while I will not complain about the massive amounts of snow we have received and the bitter cold we are experiencing. I hope we are almost through the rough patch because I am not going to fit into my parka for much longer.

I was a size 8/10 before pregnancy and have already gained 15 pounds. I used to be an exercise fanatic, but with school, work and baby exhaustion I just can't find the time to get in more than one workout a week. Being on the petite side before pregnancy, this extra weight is really kicking my butt. Does anyone have any tips on how to relieve the constant breathlessness I am experiencing?

1z40c9,1,2014-02-27,"Frustration, Doubt, Guilt, Self-Loathing...my closest friends these days. [Venting]",[deleted],getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/1z40c9/frustration_doubt_guilt_selfloathingmy_closest/,"I need to conversate with somebody about this shit. Only issue is, I already know I can't trust most of my friends with these conversations. I can count the people that would keep my secrets on one hand, and all but one would be hurt and offended by what I have to confide.

Where do I even begin?

My father is dying. He has had Hep-C for many years, and has already been through treatment for it. He was diagnosed with liver cancer a few years ago, chemo'd it to death, and now it's back. He's on a transplant list, and he's in good health now, but it's going to be an interesting year. His mother, my grandma, who I had grown up with and loved dearly, passed away from leukemia on new year's eve. He is not coping well with it.

Next comes the selfish bits. As much as the above torments me to think about, for some reason it's the things in my own life that have nothing to do with mortality that tears me apart each day. I have a girlfriend. She's fantastic, really, very kind, beautiful, caring...except, every time I look at her I feel nothing but guilt. You see, until last August, I had been dating a girl for four years and change, and I loved her with everything I had and then some. She cheated on me in the worst way, with one of my best friends, probably for months until I caught them. The day after I caught them, I fled to my parents' house to hide from my pain, and that fucking asshole spent that night with her in **my** bed. They are still together today. I went through a **very** dark time in the month or so after that.

Anyway, fast forward. It's been five months or so since then. I've been dating this wonderful girl for almost three of them. She was the first to say those three fucking words...and what do you do? How could I possibly have NOT said them back? I did. I still do. But I don't mean it.

I have lucid dreams. Almost every night. Every night I don't go to bed ridiculously stoned, at least. They are *always* about her. Not her, not the one I'm sleeping next to, the one I lost. The one who betrayed me. Sometimes I dream she's mine. Sometimes I dream of watching her and her boyfriend from afar. Sometimes I dream I'm begging her to take me back. But she is always there. I can't stand it. I wake up from these dreams sweating, or crying out, and my girlfriend always asks what's wrong, to which I can only say 'nothing' and wave her off. How could I possibly explain this to her? She would never understand. She would hate me. This is not an assumption; I know her well enough to know she would never forgive these feelings.

One more point of selfishness. I'm in school to become an electrical engineer. Junior college, on dying dad's dollar. I haven't had a job in three years or so. Internships and volunteer work, but no paid positions. He pays for my rent, tuition, bills, and books out of a fund he started some 30-odd years ago to pay for me to get a U.C. education. He still bugs me about going to a 'real' university and getting a bachelor's, and I always refuse him. Part of it is idealism, I really don't want to participate in the higher education system while it's gouging people for lifelong debt or massive amounts of family money. The other part is fear. I am so afraid that I am going to amount to nothing. I am afraid that this impossible frustration that lives inside of me is going to keep me from success. I think it likely that if I went and sat on somebody's couch long enough and talked all this out, I'd be prescribed anti-anxiety medication. I have panic attacks, and also something very much like them, but very much different, that I've taken to calling 'angst attacks', with the same shortness of breath and swimming vision and pulsating headache, except instead of a desire to cry I have a desire to do harm. I just want to destroy everything around me sometimes when I get like this. 'Manic' is an appropriate adjective. These bouts are always followed by a deep depression that will last a few days. I think the worst part about this is I've gotten *used to it.* I don't even see it as a problem anymore, just another part of me that I need to live with and get past.

I don't even know why I'm typing this. I don't know exactly how I got to this subreddit. I just know I need some help, but I don't want a professional, and I don't want any drugs, and I've lost all the friends I could truly confide in. TBH, I don't even care if no one sees this or responds. I just needed to type it out. I wish it made me feel better."

I apologize for the Great Wall of Text below, but I wanted to include the context for everything instead of just putting it all in a list. I also apologize if it's somewhat incoherent, this is probably the fastest I've ever typed in my life, and I've never been good at writing.

I'm a 20 year old male, and I have two younger sisters (19 and 14).

2009

My sophomore year in HS. Things were good (or at least stable). My dad had a high paying job, and my mother was able to stay home. In late 2009, my dad quit his job because it was stressing him out too much and he had major disagreements with his business partner on how to run the business. My dad's family had a history of heart problems, so it was good for him to not be in a stressful environment anymore. I trusted that he had planned for this and knew what he was doing. I was so relieved to see him lighten up a bit and be able to spend more time with my sisters and I. Regardless of the financial difficulties that followed, I was so glad to have my dad be a big part of my life, whereas before he wasn't.

Him quitting his job is really what my mother points to as the cause of this family turmoil, but she's the only one spewing hate and acting crazy. I think my dad, my sisters and I have handled the situation pretty well.

2011

Financially, things started to get pretty tight. My mother began to leave the house late at night without telling anyone where she was going. That in itself may not seem wierd, but before the financial issues she never did this. If we asked, she usually gave us bullshit answers; ""I'm going to get coffee with a friend"". Really? At 11:30 at night? This continued for months. Around the same time she blocked my dad on Facebook and began to publicly post blatant lies about him, trying to make him look like a monster. She claimed he was an addict, a narcissist, that he was having an affair, that he was a closet homosexual. You name it, she posted it, for me and my sisters, and all our family friends to see. As you can imagine, this alienated and angered my sisters and I very much.

One night she left, and posted on Facebook that she was going to jump off a bridge, and that her children don't love her anymore. My sisters and I tried calling her countless times, no answer. My dad called the police and left the house to go look for her. She finally returned hours later with no explanation. We have a big fight, and at the end of the night nothing is resolved.

Not too long after that, she totaled her car in a head on collision driving back from drinking at a bar. The tests showed there was alcohol in her system, just below the legal limit, so she was free to go. She admitted she had a drinking problem and apologized for her behavior, but I knew nothing was going to change. She continued to drink and run off late at night.

At this point I'd had enough of being lied to, and I felt I had to act to protect my dad and my sisters. I installed a keylogger on her computer, not knowing what I was going to find. I struggled with the guilt of this decision afterwards, but in the moment it felt like the only thing I could do to fight back. To put it bluntly, I discovered she was having affairs with several men, who were giving her money and flying her across the country to meet (she told us she was visiting her cousin). It didn't come as too much of a surprise, at that point I knew my parents marriage was a sham. I sat on this information for a while, then decided I should let my dad know. He handled it well, and told me he had talked to his lawyer and had divorce papers prepared, which I was relieved to hear.

When my dad confronted her about this, she accepted no responsibility, claiming it was him that pushed her to do these things.

As always, she doesn't hold herself accountable for anything she's done, and she is always the victim.

2012

My dad starts working in a warehouse to make ends meet. I'm still living at home, now going to engineering school full time. A year after the day she totaled her car, she was arrested for DUI. My dad bailed her out, but her license is suspended. A short time after she got her license back my youngest sister told my dad she found empty wine coolers in her car when she picked her up from school. My dad got a court order filed removing her from the house, and she went to live with her friend. When she left, I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I no longer felt like a prisoner in my own house.

Mother gets a job as a physical therapist, the same job she had before she had kids.

In the fall I moved into an apartment near campus, and all the drama seems to die down.

2013

Dad landed a job with an investment firm, just like his old job, which meant a little more income, but he was behind on mortgage payments and bills for repairs on the house. Mother got fired from her job for showing up to work drunk. Coworker kicked her out. My dad allowed her to move back in under the condition that she find another job and helps with bills. She moved back in and found another PT job. The drinking continued, and over time she slowly stopped helping with the bills. My parents declare bankruptcy.

I moved back in at the beginning of the fall semester, and started helping my dad with my meager income from my internship. I avoided contact with my mother, which usually meant staying in my room all day.

2014

Last week was my dads birthday, and my grandmother sent him a birthday card with some cash in it (to help with our bills). It either got lost in the mail, or someone else took it, because it never arrived. I can't prove it but I'm certain it was mother. This monday, my sister caught mother going through my dads office, rifling through his personal things, looking for god knows what. Yesterday, my dad met with a member of his church, who showed him a prayer request they recieved sunday. The prayer request (which is supposed to be anonymous), stated my dads full name, was from my mother, and was asking for prayers to ""soften my husbands heart"" and ""help him forgive himself for having an affair with another church member"".  It was pretty obvious this was not a genuine request, but just another attempt to make my father look like a monster.

To top it all off, our house goes to auction in two weeks. I'm not too concerned with that to be honest, I'm more concerned about my sisters and how mother is affecting them.

I'm just so tired of her playing these games. She acts like she's the only one suffering as a result of the financial issues. She's constantly texting me passive aggressive things that she would never say to my face. I could probably fill a book with all the malicious things she says and does. I'm pretty sure she talks badly about my dad to every person she knows. Just today she was talking to someone about the house and started listing everything that needed to be repaired and blaming my dad for not getting it fixed. It's like she's trying to retroactively justify her actions by making my dad look like a terrible husband. I have no idea how many people now think badly of my dad because of her.

It has become damn near impossible for me to empathize with her, because I've seen how she tries to manipulate my dad, and I can't shake the feeling she's doing it to me too. I can't take anything she says seriously, because she never stops lying. She tells different lies to me and each of my sisters, and it's pretty obvious she is just playing games with us. I can't relax around her.

All of this has had a pretty negative impact on me. I'm pretty shy and introverted, but in the last year I've found myself preferring to be alone more and more. I'm still going to school, but when I go to class I try to avoid talking to my classmates. I just can't seem to talk properly around people. My words just come out in a big jumbled mess (probably like this post), and I end up sounding like a fool, so I tend to just isolate myself. I didn't have this problem before all this, and it's so frustrating because I just want to be normal and have a social life. I can't for sure say she's the one that has caused this change. I've been told I exhibit some symptoms of autism, so that may be the underlying cause. If that's the case I can see how this experience might have made it worse.

I can't help but feel like I'm overreacting, but I really do wish I never had to see her again.

Right now I'm just trying to figure out what to do. I don't want her in my life anymore, but I don't know how to go about achieving that. If I'm upfront with her I'm afraid she'll just play the victim and deny everything. I don't think I can just cut off communication either, because she will use the same tactics she uses against my dad, i.e. telling everyone she knows that I'm a terrible person.

Oh and I guess I should ask... Does this sound like narcissistic behavior? I stumbled upon this sub a while ago and can relate to a lot of the posts, but I'm not 100% sure if this is the right place to post this.

I already feel a lot better having written all this down."
1z5kcx,1,2014-02-27,The Journey Thus Far (Part 2),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1z5kcx/the_journey_thus_far_part_2/,"Alright, so if you were brave enough to wade through the entirety of [part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1z5exu/the_journey_thus_far_part_1/) of this post you know that my life is a bit crazy.  For part 2 I will carry on from where I left off.

Here we go. Remember we left of with Gary and I deciding to move back to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.

We lived at his parent’s house for a bit, and I was quite uncomfortable with that.  Gary and I were drinking a lot after the move.  We were out every night it seemed, and I was getting no where in a job search. The fighting that we were famous for just got worse and worse.  I was tired of being with him.  The relationship started to go south.  I had heard that an old friend was in town, and had recently bought another go-go club.  He was looking for a manager to manage the place.  I needed out of the house so I took the opportunity.  He kind of took me under his wing a bit.  This was the start of a crazy friendship.  We will call him Vinny, he was a big Italian guy who like to dabble in men. He was a crude but somehow charming guy, he was loud, did not mind cursing whenever where ever, and he loved to throw his money around like it was no one’s business.  I and he had actually met while I was working in the go-go club with Aaron Tyler years back.  He was kind of an asshole to me then, and I had got into a fight or two with him while I was dating Dale.  Actually he really came to respect me the night we both got very wasted in the VIP area and we got into an all-out fist fight.  I suppose i was one of the few people that actually stood up to him.  I held my ground and he seemed to respect that a lot.  I began to work for him managing the night club.  I was also starting to become kind of his personal assistant.  He would fly me back and forth from Lauderdale to Cincinnati to help him bid on construction jobs.  His main business which was pulling in a solid million or so a year was a demolition company that specialized in department stores.  Anyway, we became close.  I was also in charge of hiring workers for the go-go bar, houseboys to clean the homes we were staying in, and workers for the demolition company.  Oh, and just to add to the crazy of the situation Vinny owned a pet chimp named Chloe.  She hated me and would often rush me.  She was very protective of Vinny, and I supposed she saw how well I and he got along.  (I really hated that monkey (she hated me calling her a monkey...lol))

All of this goes without saying that I was drifting further and further from Gary.  Any spark that was ever there was completely gone.  I was traveling a lot and I had no time.  One day I decided that enough was enough. I was going to break it off.  I called Gary from Cinci to talk.  He did not take it well, and I had to go get my stuff.  By this point I was a bit upset, break ups are never easy.  I hoped a plane to Lauderdale to pack up my things and call it done.  On the flight I thought long and hard about my life. What was I doing with myself? Why did I keep getting myself into crazy situations? At that moment I decided it was all enough.  That flight was the day that the poles reversed, everything was about to change. 

After the flight back to finalize the break up I flew back up to Cinci.  I was a bit emotional; I could feel the switch in my mind.  I was ready to go back, and say fuck it all.  That is exactly what I did I rented a car and drove back to Vinny’s house in Cinci.  I walked into his house and packed up my things.  I told him sorry, but it was my time to go.  So I left, kind of concluding that chapter in my life.

I moved back home with no real plan. This was about the end of 2010 by the way.  Almost four years since I had first left school and moved all around the east coast. I stayed at my mother’s house for a few weeks, went on a few real dates.  A few months pass and I met someone.  I met the person who I am still with today.  I’ll just call him Trevor.  We took things slow in the beginning, but eventually started back at my old university.  I was going to finish this time, but I was still dealing with that issue that stretched back through my time at college, what the hell was I doing there?  I was still registered as an Interior Design Major, and I now had no interest.  I tried to stick with the program for another year and a half.  In this time I had added an International Business Minor.  I was finally finding what I love, and that was business.  Over the next year or so I tacked on a Marketing Major, and eventually dropped the Interior Design program all together.  I had met someone who I now consider my closest friend. He helped me to further find my place in the business school, and was able to help me leave the Interior Design program in the past.  By this time I really loved business, I loved thinking about it, studying it, and applying it through a number of internships.  I eventually found a way to dual major in Marketing and Management with a concentration in Entrepreneurship.  

I will finally be graduating this coming summer.  I feel comfortable where I am today, but I am still very terrified about what comes next.  I have considered doing an MBA program for a few years, or going straight to work.  I suppose it is a big choice and it freaks me out.  Sometimes I feel like I still have trust issues from all of those guys in my past, and it’s hard for me to really know what the correct path that I should peruse is.  I have made a ton of mistakes, but looking back those mistakes gave me some of the most exciting experiences of my life...  

I so guess that is it and maybe one day there will be something exciting for part 3...

1z5p3d,1,2014-02-28,My Struggle. Need Help,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1z5p3d/my_struggle_need_help/,"This is the 2nd time trying to type this. I just feel the need to vent and I figured this is a good place to do so.

I am feeling so f-ing depressed right now, probably the worst I have ever felt. I am a 21 y/o university student and I was doing ok academically up until this semester. Now the depression is really bad and I am really struggling academically. I am either unmotivated to do classwork or when I do classwork I somehow mistakenly f--- up. It doesn't help either that I am anxious about my immediate and long-term future.

In terms of my immediate future I have been trying to find something to do in the summer. I have lined up a handful of things. The one interview I have gotten so far I placed out b/c I looked like a fool b/c of stammering speech impediment. I really don't think I'll hear back from the other places and I have been looking for alternatives but so far absolutely nothing I found appeals to me. Meanwhile, I watch as everyone else I know gets awesome paid internships as I am still stuck with my crappy minimum wage part time school job.

My longterm future I feel like I want to be a minister or theologian but I am so messed up IDK if I'll be good for it and my family would react badly if I told them. Also, what if that ideas falls through? I have no other ideas or career goals.

I honestly have almost no self-esteem or confidence b/c I watch everyone else around me excel while my whole life I have struggled to mediocrity. I have had to watch everyone be better at me at almost everything while I sit here, lonely, single, and unmotivated.

It probably also doesn't help that I will never get to be with the woman from my home state I am infatuated with as she got engaged and is getting married soon. I know she will never feel the same way about me.

Moreover my mom seem's to not understand how I feel and my best-friend seems to presume I will just get over it (and I get the impression he is annoyed by my constant sadness).

I think that is everything. Basically I feel like a lonely, incompetent fuck up."

I am feeling so f-ing depressed right now, probably the worst I have ever felt. I am a 21 y/o university student and I was doing ok academically up until this semester. Now the depression is really bad and I am really struggling academically. I am either unmotivated to do classwork or when I do classwork I somehow mistakenly f--- up. It doesn't help either that I am anxious about my immediate and long-term future.

In terms of my immediate future I have been trying to find something to do in the summer. I have lined up a handful of things. The one interview I have gotten so far I placed out b/c I looked like a fool b/c of stammering speech impediment. I really don't think I'll hear back from the other places and I have been looking for alternatives but so far absolutely nothing I found appeals to me.

1z60rw,6,2014-02-28,Struggling math major computer science minor,blackmanwalkin,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1z60rw/struggling_math_major_computer_science_minor/,"Hey everyone, long time reddit fan, first time poster. I really need some advice right now, I have been struggling with various things for a while but I would like some advice on how I should continue school.

Right now im in a third year math major while minoring who chose to minor in computer science, and I can't seem to get great grades. My average is roughly in the c area, and I'm scared that my grades will hold me back in obtaining internships . 

I discovered that I really like computer science, and am fascinated with the idea that I can create something of my own, and share it with the rest of the world. However, I feel so behind compared with many students doing just computer science. It takes me a while to understand code, and I usually have to write it down on paper for it to make sense. I especially feel intimidated when in group projects, mainly because everyone is more knowledgable than me. This kills my confidence and makes me contribute less to my group because I don't want to say stupid things and be percieved as the one bringing the group down.

As for my math classes, I could be doing much better if I studied harder, but I feel less motivated to do well in those courses because I want to go into a software career.

So, if anyone has advice on how I can become a better computer scientist, and bring up my grades I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!

TLDR: suck at programming/ don't know enough. Confidence and grades hitting a new low."

I want to know how experienced programmers think I did, and I'm looking for guidance on how to improve!",chrisvanr,learnjavascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/1z6hi3/beginner_here_finished_my_first_project_i_want_to/,"Hi /r/learnjavascript! 

I started out an intern at a small design shop and over the last few years, the scope of my activities crept towards web development. I never had any real formal training in this but still I found myself making and adjusting themes for Wordpress, Magento and another custom-made CMS for clients as a full-time job. 

I picked up HTML/CSS as I went along quickly enough, but I never had the time or opportunity to properly learn a programming language as JS or PHP. Deadlines were always an issue and I heavily relied on Google, StackOverflow, and tons of scripts and plugins and retrofitting other people's code without knowing how it worked.

I had a big gap in my knowledge for the field I'm in and that had to change! So I decided to start with Javascript. I started out with codecademy, and worked through all the assignments. 

Then I decided it was time to build a little project for myself. I tried studying some JS books after finishing codecademy and there is a ton of material online, but I never felt like it 'clicked' and stuck in my head. I wanted to get my hands dirty and build something. 

It's a card game that is played in my family for as long as I can remember. Nobody on the internet seems to agree on the rules so here's our version of it. It started out as a few little prototypes, little ideas that sprung from codecademy lessons like, how would I build a card deck in JS, and how would I display the cards, and how would I shuffle the deck, etc. I used a little jQuery on the side as I had a little experience with that. 

[So here it is: Farmer's Bridge v0.1!](http://codepen.io/chrisvanr/pen/yKuHr)

So yeah its not an actual game as you're currently pretending to be all 4 players, but I that is the next step! I want to build this into a multiplayer game, and perhaps add the ability to add an AI player? Those would be formidable goals to work towards. 

I feel like I learned a great deal. It feels really good that I was able to set myself a goal, and complete it. I wondered if I could simulate the rules of this game in javascript, and I feel like I did an ok job! 

However, as I did this on my own I'm certain that there's a lot of beginner mistakes that you can catch! The downside of learning alone is there is no teacher that can point these out for me. So I hope that you guys can point me in the right direction. What can I improve? What best-practices should I adhere to more? What things did I make that I could've gone about in a better way? 

The next step for me is to completely refactor this code, and make more use of Objects and methods, and learn more Object Oriented Programming. I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around this, however. Codecademy introduces a few concepts, and before I started building this I decided I wanted to start this out as an OOP project but it didn't quite click for me yet, so I built it in a more straightforward way. Sometimes I get tired of reading and studying and I really wanted to build and finish something. So how do I start with OOP? How do I transform my imperative code into Object based code?

Meanwhile, I've made a github account and have decided to learn git alongside this. 

Eventually, I intend to use node.js &amp; sockets.io and transform this game into an actual multiplayer game! 
I've looked at nodeschool and learnyounode, however that made me feel kind of stupid. I had an extremely hard time figuring out the assignments and understanding what it even was that they wanted me to do! What do I need to learn first to be able to do node? "
1z6l9w,1,2014-02-28,is coming out to your company just for revenge of poor treatment valid?,apprehensive_fairy,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1z6l9w/is_coming_out_to_your_company_just_for_revenge_of/,"I have the unfortunate circumstance of working in Florida. I live in MA. The company I worked at in MA was purchased by this company in Florida and they hired me (seeing as I was one of the only two employees left). This company seems to think I am valuable enough to fly me back and forth. I have been doing this for 7 months now. It appears that the senior management appreciate me presences but my direct colleagues feel otherwise. I cannot pinpoint why my colleagues remain distant from me but it is enraging. I feel as if I have no hope of changing the situation.

I feel disrespected, ostracized, undervalued, and alone. I was hired on at the lowest possible title without my knowledge and they practically treat me like a fresh out of college half intern. (I have 10 years experience in my field and have taken senior roles before). Had I known these people cared so directly about titles I would not have allowed this, but let me tell you, every problem I am having is related to culture differences. Are all Floridians this self centered, belligerent, disrespectful, and most importantly close minded? I have felt more rage in the last 6 months that I have in the last 6 years. I often day dream about flipping tables and calling out to these shitholes just how bad they are at cleaning themselves. 

And the kicker is, I haven't come out to them yet (and still waiting on hormones :\). I keep trying to find where my breaking point is to say ""enough is enough"" and just leave. So far, I am so invested in the idea of ""succeeding"" before I leave that I can't do that yet. However I need to do something to get back at these people. I've tried many a thing to show them that I have all this experience, and skills, and valid opinions, but they refuse. So here is my idea:

I am going to come out, and just all of a sudden start presenting as poorly as I can. Just to fuck with them. To come in with half male half female clothing with a stuffed bra and use my poorest high pitched voice to make it as uncomfortable for them as possible. I don't care if that makes it worse for me, at least I am doing something to make them feel bad. If they do real shit to me, I might be able to get back at them legally. The important thing to recognize here is that I don't need this job, I could leave and find something else back in MA and be so much happier.

What do you think?

1z6li4,137,2014-02-28,[B/S] Sex in Europe,[deleted],incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/1z6li4/bs_sex_in_europe/,"I’ve been reading this sub a bit (throwaway account obviously) and decided to share an encounter between me and my sister, let’s call her Alex. I wanted to provide you guys with details, so sorry if it seems like I’m rambling at times.

Okay well, where to begin...

My sister Alex is about 2 years older than me. I recall when we were younger, my friends always wanted to come over and play video games when she was around. They would also joke about how hot she was, and ask me if they could come with me to watch her field hockey games (like really guys?). I took the hint. I always tried to act like I was pissed off at their comments and remain ignorant to the fact, but deep down inside it got the best of me. I saw my sister as attractive and when I became older I would occasionally masturbate to mental images of her, secretly hoping she would come in by accident and help me finish up (that obviously never happened).

Fast forward a couple of years, I graduated from college and wanted to take a year or two off to travel the world before heading back to school. At the time I was 21 and my sister was in France with an internship experience. I hadn’t see her for a few months so I decided it would be a good idea to pay visit her across the channel (I was in London at the time).

So we skyped and picked a date when she was free and agreed to meet up in Strasbourg. When I arrived to the city she met me at this restaurant with a couple of friends she knew and gave me a big hug. We chatted and I got to eat this regional dish called “baeckoff”.... I digress. 

My sister wasn’t actually residing in that city so we needed a place to crash for the night. Being two cash strapped young adults, I booked a bed for us at hostel because they’re very affordable.

The receptionist asked us if we wanted to reserve another bed, and she seemed concerned that my sister wasn’t going to sleep on the girl’s floor (they separated guests by gender). Unfortunately we didn’t have enough money to get a 2nd bed and buy train tickets back. I convinced her that one bed was fine. Up a flight of stairs we arrived to our room. When we got there 2 dudes were already making themselves at home. One was from Canada and told us he loved to travel, the other guy was from Germany and I could tell he was eying my sister down the whole time so I didn’t care for him as much. 

Nightfall came and we started bar hopping with the same friends as earlier. The first place had some quality beer (mainly from Germany). At the 2nd bar, I could tell my sister was visibly tipsy and trying to hit on her French friend. Yet, I wasn’t really helping her by joking that she was a lightweight (the sibling competition coaxed her to prove me wrong by ordering another pint). As the night dragged on her friends ditched us to go smoking, so the two of us went to another bar without them. The place was a small English-themed club in what appeared to be a cave. Despite being hammered I remembered a shot of whatever was 7 euros to which I protested (yet still purchased). The atmosphere was great, the music loud and almost everyone was on their feet dancing.

After a few more drinks, Alex and I began flirting with each other, we danced close and rubbed our bodies together. Overall, I was getting kind of horny being around her and all these foreign women. Despite all the alcohol, I noticed this one dude would keep going towards Alex and she would kind of scurry away from him and come back to me. He was persistent; clearly she wasn’t interested in dancing with him. She looked at me with that sad puppy dog face I would receive when she wanted me to do something. So I did something.

“Hey man, back off my sister,"" I said.

He ignored me (or probably didn’t speak English), so I said it in French.

“Nique ta mère,” he responded. (fuck your mom).

I exchanged some words with him and an argument ensued to the point where some employees had to kick us all out. I didn’t give a fuck; we left.

Yet, I remember in the wake of being extremely pissed off, Alex managed to cool me down. 

“Thanks for standing up for me,” she said. 

Alex sure knew how to make a shitty situation feel better. I put my arm around her and she let out a slight giggle which made me smile. At this time we were both pretty smashed so it was a unanimous decision to just head back to the hostel and call it a night rather than find her friends again.

Eventually we made it back to our room after stumbling through some long streets. Our Canadian roommate was still missing, but the German one was fast asleep.

Without disturbing him, we got ready for bed. I used the bathroom and started brushing my teeth, but Alex urgently knocked on the door and said she wanted to change so I hurried out. Probably because of extreme drunkenness, Alex didn’t completely close the bathroom door. From the bed, I got a glimpse of her boobs as she took off her bra and put on a tee shirt. It was the first time I could remember seeing her naked (I never accidentally walked in on her or anything).

She came out of bathroom only in her panties and a tee shirt. Her excuse was that she didn’t pack any pajamas. I didn’t mind.

“Oh I forgot to tell you, I sleep in the buff,” I joked.

“Ew! I hope you’re kidding.”

“Get in bed, you’ll find out,”

She laughed, turned out the remaining lights and slid under the covers after a bit of hesitation from my joke. As she got into the bed, I turned myself towards the wall and placed my back towards her. Seeing my sister in her underwear was getting me hard, but I didn’t want my cock to rub up against her and freak her out.

She started talking about how fun our night was and shit like that, and started playing with my hair. I turned away from the wall and faced her because isn’t that how people talk... face to face? She thanked me again for protecting her from that drunk dude.

“He really wanted your ass,” I said and I would never forget what she said next:

“Yeah, but guess who I’m in bed with at the end of the night.”

She then leaned forward to give me a hug however stopped dead in her tracks as her leg grazed my hard dick.

That following split second was a crescendo of “what the fuck just happened”, anxiety, and utter confusion. She pulled away from me.

“What was that?”

My mind raced to find an excuse.

“Sorry, my knee got in the way.”

1z76q4,7,2014-02-28,I [24 M] need a little advice on how to invite a crush to a coffee date. My social skills suck.,throwawaythegarbagem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1z76q4/i_24_m_need_a_little_advice_on_how_to_invite_a/,"TL;DR: Want to invite crush to coffee date, but I don't know how to go about doing it

Let me begin by saying that in most social groups, with my friends/co-workers, what have you, I'm actually pretty lively and talkative.

The moment I lay eyes on someone that I am potentially attracted to, I instantly transport myself all the way back to Junior High School where I had no social skills whatsoever.

My problem is, I went in to get Lasik done yesterday and I met a young intern there, who we'll call ""S"". She was there to observe the procedure and look at my eyes and whatnot. I couldn't help but want to get to know her better.
Problem is, I don't know how to do that. I was too shy to ask her in front of everyone else in the room to have some coffee/tea with me, and I don't know how else I should go about asking.

I've considered calling up the office asking one of the receptionist to ask her for me(since I don't have any more appointments there), but that just seems...desperate. 
The other part of my brain says just drop it, but I really want to see if there would be something there.

What do you think? Should I pursue asking her out on a coffee date? And if so, how?"
1z80v7,5,2014-02-28,Help me figure out what I'm worth,letsjumpoff,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1z80v7/help_me_figure_out_what_im_worth/,"Hey guys,

Okay, I'm getting interviewed for an entry level SEO Specialist position in E-commerce. Keep in mind while reading this that I actually don't have much E-commerce seo experience. I had a variety of different types of fields I have done SEO for, but never e-commmerce. 

I have a ton of internship experience in the marketing field. The last two internships I had was predominantly SEO. I would say my knowledge of SEO is pretty high. I'm confident I can do a full site SEO audit, keyword research, some advanced seo strategies, competitive research and I know most of the best practices of onsite and off site SEO. ETC
- I probably have built thousands of backlinks from a variety of different websites. 
- Created changes to tons of content to make it SEO friendly. 
- Keyword optimized tons of meta descriptions, h1 tags, page titles, etc...
- Ranking reports, Analytic reports, on site reports, etc..

Some SEO tools that I am familiar with:

- Google Analytics
- Google Webmasters Tool
- SEO Powersuite
- Buzzfeed
- gshifts 
- PR Status bar
- Mozbar for DA/PA and links
- SEO quake for SERPS
- Open Site Explorer/ Ahrefs
- SEM Rush
- Scrapebox
- Screaming Frog
- GT Metrix
- Some blackhat tools I won't mention
- And probably some other tools I forgot about

I should probably also mention that I have other marketing skills such as :

- Social Media Marketing
- Lead Generation
- Some E-mail Marketing
- Some Adwords
- Some digital advertising
- Content Marketing
- Some other stuff

I also should mention that I'm able to create a brand new wordpress website with a theme, and fix and edit minor HTML/CSS issues. With the knowledge of knowing what plugins to also implement. 

Also, for the purposes of judging how much I'm worth please assume I don't have much experience in other marketing fields. Assume lower than what you perceive in the things I have experience with in the SEO field. 

Also, you can ask me any question you need if you can't give me a fair assessment. 

Thank you if you took the time to read all that, I would appreciate some feedback!
