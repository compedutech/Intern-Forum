8u1vm,4,2009-06-19,About to start a long-distance relationship -- any tips from people with experience or just advice in general?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8u1vm/about_to_start_a_longdistance_relationship_any/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about six months now -- we just graduated from college and I'm heading up to Boston to start a PhD at MIT while she's staying in town to start law school next year. Anyway, things with her have been going really well so far, so we decided together that we want to try the long distance thing out next year. The ""plan"" right now is that we'll try and see each other once a month or so, however our schedules dictate, and we'll get to see each other more during Thanksgiving, winter break, etc etc. After that, well, we haven't spoken much about it, but I would like her to come take an internship in Boston (there are a lot of firms in the Boston/Cambridge area that are right up her alley), so we'll at least have the summers to spend. 

Beyond that, well, it's up the air. Honestly, part of me sees a lot of potential with her. We are young, yes, but I look at her sometimes and get the feeling that she is someone I want to get old with, if that makes sense. I'm not ready yet to get married, but I think I'm ready to have a pretty serious relationship that could lead to that in a few years, once we are graduated and more settled. The way I see our relationship is that it will be tough (in ways I'm sure I can't imagine yet), but I'm just really looking forward to the future with her. If shit happens, then so be it, but I want to at least give it my all so I can take some sense of satisfaction that I gave it my best. 

So, my question to you all is if any of you have any experience in the matter, and if you have any tips for a relatively young couple about this sort of thing. We're young, so I'm sure we don't know exactly what we're getting ourselves into quite yet, but maybe someone here can give a better idea of what it could be like. Anyway, if anyone has any comments to help a young guy that's in love, that would be great.
