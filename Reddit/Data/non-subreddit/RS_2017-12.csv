7gr23o,4,2017-11-30,"Stuck in a transition job, never went anywhere with my degree, too much debt",throwawayjobguy01,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7gr23o/stuck_in_a_transition_job_never_went_anywhere/,"I'm a long time lurker here and have learned some stuff along the way but never figured my self out in the process. I had (and sometimes still have) poor impulse habits that I've started to get under control since diagnosed with adult ADD (I am 26).


I went to a tech school in Wisconsin and got an AAS in Computer Engineering Technology which is a fancy way of saying we learned very minimal programming and the basic principals of electricity and circuit design, I graduated around 4 years ago. My work history is complete garbage, I've never held a job besides for my current one for more than 1.5 years. My resume screams unreliable.


I went to school (gather about $12,600 along the way) to attempt my BS in Comp. Sci., I hated it completely and left my internship and wanted nothing more to do with school (and still don't).


Where am I now? I've worked at Jimmy John's as a delivery driver off and on since 2012 and am there again for about a year now. I have a 2015 Civic ($17,000) and two credit cards that I have started to get serious about paying off ($4k @ 15% and $2k @ 23%). I work as much as my boss will allow so that basically my hourly wage alone pays for the bill and my tip money goes towards gas, car repair fund, and extras. I receive government assistance in the form of health care and SNAP. Here's what my typical month looks like...

* Paychecks: ~$800

* Tips: ~$866

* Bills: ~$850 (varies with Heat, this includes min. payments for cards and everything)


I typically try to pay $100/mo extra towards the card carrying the highest interest rate, more when I can.


The truth is I HATE working with customers and everyday is semi painful to get through work. I don't really like what I do but the reality is I need a job that pays $14+/hr but with my lack of good reliable work history and my degree I did nothing with, I don't know what to do. I'm 26 but I have never been more lost in my life. I also cannot move from my small Wisconsin city (50K+ pop.) and can't really deviate much outside of 9 - 5. So where does this leave me?


I am not looking for the ""magic answer"" because I know there isn't one, but I do know there are wonderful people on here with far more life experience than my self. I'm hoping you can all give a 26 year old in too much debt with no interest in school or retail some ideas of where to go."

7gr70w,2,2017-11-30,"I (21M) met a foreign girl (19F) who changed my life, but I can’t tell if I’m going crazy or not",unsurethrowaway1926,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gr70w/i_21m_met_a_foreign_girl_19f_who_changed_my_life/,"About a month ago I matched with a Japanese girl on Tinder.  I’m learning Japanese myself, and she’s an exchange student here learning English.  We hit it off on tinder pretty well with a mix of English and Japanese, and agreed to meet up some time.

Couldn’t really get a day planned to meet, until a few days later where she out of the blue asked if I could get lunch with her and her friends.  I obliged and it was a ton of fun, after I dropped them off she and I talked about next time and sent all kinds of smiles and winks over text.  Next time ends up being a week later and we go to the mall together and just do some shopping and eating at the food court.  It was ridiculously fun, I loved and enjoyed every second of it.  We get back to her place and talk in the car for a while and she tells me before she leaves that next time we should go back to the place we went for lunch, it was really good.  We text again after all flirtatiously and she says she’s looking forward to next time and so am I and so forth, super cute stuff.

This was two weeks ago.

We were trying to get something going before thanksgiving as I was going away for a week, but it didn’t pan out last minute.  We texted off and on about random stuff while I was away, and on my last day, I shot her a text saying when I get back, we should do something, what day works for you? No response, so the following day at the airport for hours bored out of my mind I sent her a snapchat message asking if she got that text.

“Yup”

Won’t lie it stung, but I said:

“Okay, let me know if you’re still interested then...”

“Interested in what?”

“Going to (restaurant) or pizza or whatever we decided last time lol”

“Can you take me to (restaurant)?”

“Absolutely, when?”

“I’m not sure...
Depends on hw”

“Okay that’s fine, just let me know whenever you can
I’d love to go again with you some time :) it was really fun”

“Oh really? I’m glad :)
I’d love to go again too !”

And that’s where we’re at folks.  I’m feeling really conflicted on the issue and the signals she’s sending me.  Even though it was only two “dates”, I could really tell how much I enjoyed them more than anything else I’ve done in the past year.  I’m just having a really hard time between wondering where she stands and reconciling that between a language barrier (if there is one, but the above texts are all English) or if she’s just really hard to text.  In person we’re talkative and chatty and really happy, and when we don’t text about planning something we’re also as happy and flirtatious.  She’s a college student and of course has a lot of homework, as am  I (though an intern this semester, so homework doesn’t exist), so I completely understand prioritizing that. Am I just being crazy and overreacting? I really don’t want to let her go, I don’t know where this will go, but I don’t want it to end here.  After meeting her I managed to end an extremely long MMO addiction because I really truly felt that this was better worth my time, but now that I have so much free time I think my sanity is fading.  All my good friends are from high school and not anywhere nearby (though we still group chat almost daily), and my coworkers are 40+ older guys who aren’t quite the “hang out” type.  Looking back I now see how much that game was my life; I think I’m better off for having left it, but I also really don’t know where to go from here.  

**TL;DR** I met an amazing girl on tinder but I can’t tell if she’s actually interested in me or not.  Meeting her made me change my life up, but now I have so much free time it’s spent ruminating on whether or not she likes me."
7grdd8,7,2017-11-30,The living proof,Roydhante,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7grdd8/the_living_proof/,"So.. here goes my journey:

I cannot even remember what time it was and how old I was at that day. All I know was that I was too young since there wasn't even any semen coming out since it happend. I was far too young and was so obsessed by videoclips that I randomly start humping the couch I was laying on and suddenly felt the orgasm. This was my first sexual encounter.

After that, you guessed it I was pretty addicted. I used to fap around 6 times a day. Years and years went by. I am gonna be 100% open about this and going to tell all the disgusting stuff I have done. Here goes.. Whenever I was at a familiy visit I used to sneak upstairs to the bedroom, took a bra from the drawer and fapped on the bathroom with it. I even took my neighbours bra from the balcony where it layed after being washed, fapped with it and put it back. I even had sexual thoughts considering family member such as my mom. I know I am a sick fck even when im writing this. My biggest shame is that I layed with my grandma and felt her breasts while fapping in my pants. I also usually would go out in the hope I would find people kissing and I would fap and come in my pants. I also even fapped keeping my head tot he door of my brothers room who was having sexual intercourse with his gf. After all these horrible actions committed I knew that there was something wrong with me. So I finally blamed and tried to stop fapping. At first it took me forever to quit 1 let alone 2 days. But after I did quit I felt something strange happen for the following days. I could feel more in a way of sense and the days after that it felt miraculously. It felt as if luck and the universe were by my side and everything would fall into its place. I assure you that I am the living (disgusting) proof that every superpower discussed on this page is true in some sort of way. 

Years later I told a friend of mine this and he would ofcourse not believe me. I then convinced him to give it a try, so he did. He researched about this topic and stumbled upon nofap. He then showed me this page and I was mesmerized. I was not the only one apparently.. Literally everything I felt was confirmed by other people, especially about the superpowers.

Fapping has destroyed so much for me. My pride, my dignity and the most valuable time. Think of it this way, why would mainstream media stimulate nudity in commercials, movies and videoclips. It is all because they trigger you to fap and withhold you to achieve great heights and unbelievable succes.
 I have now completed the 90 day challenge. All I can say is that do not look at the 90 days as if you are ready or completely done with your goal. I have felt much better in some of those 1 -2 week clean streaks than this 90 days. I personally feel that the whole rehabilitation process is in the whole journey and could happen to u in like the first month that u become clean. It was a long journey with too much ups and downs. While in this period I have searched for so many motivation/help/inspiration posts everywhere to maintain my motivation to continue nofap. I can advice to do this only if really necessary. Because eye openers won't help if it already opened your eyes. So take advantage of that moment at that time. What I also recommend is meditating, this is the true form to transmute ur sexual energy. Also do activities that are close to how I would like to call it elemental things. Things that are possible and naturally meant for humans, such as obtaining knowledge through reading, training ur physique, be in nature. 
At last what I would like to say is to take NofFap seriously but do not forget to live on the side. So let ur life and no fap rise gradually.

So as I am writing this at 21 years old on my 90+ streak and coming just from my examweek from school where I have passed literally every exam (haven't done this before, ever) and will be leaving my country for an internship for 10 months abroad. I can truly say I love all of you for making a change for the better, for you, for all nofap users and for all humanity.

Stay strong , live, love and be grateful.

7grh9o,65,2017-11-30,Here's the transcript of the Discord AMA with ELEAGUE's Electric Leo!,ContextualRL,RocketLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/7grh9o/heres_the_transcript_of_the_discord_ama_with/,"Earlier today, /u/electricleo did an AMA on the [Subreddit Discord](https://discord.gg/rocketleague). During this AMA, he answered multiple questions about the upcoming ELEAGUE, along with some personal questions. Below, you can see his answers.

&amp;nbsp;

###About ELEAGUE

The ELEAGUE Cup begins tomorrow, December 1st - their first Rocket League match will start at 2PM ET / 11AM PT / 20:00 CET. The tournament will be broadcast on TBS and Twitch (with [rewards on Twitch](https://twitter.com/RocketLeague/status/935622341802967040)). 

The eight teams participating are the same as the top eight of last month's RLCS.

More info about ELEAGUE (and the tournament) can be found here: http://www.eleague.com/rocketleague

&amp;nbsp;

###Transcript

*Note: Questions and answers were copied directly from the AMA, so you may see typos and emojis that turned into text artifacts.*

&amp;nbsp;

***Do you have a schedule for the upcoming matches so we can update it on Liquipedia?***

We have a running order, and start time for the first match, but I am not confident enough that we will stick to it until the production meeting is complete, which is at noon tomorrow. But the graphic we put on Twitter has day 1 running order as we currently plan to. I will follow up later with specifics at your own peril. DM me!

&amp;nbsp;

***Why did u decide to get into rocket league and organize this tourney?***

This is not easily answered with one specific reason, and the decision isn't by one person, but usually the main factors are how watchable the game is (eg how would we do DOTA and make it palatable on TBS), how robust the scene is, what is going on in that game's scene in the time frame we have available, and what do we want to do based on our hearts' true desire. Rocket League has been floating around since the very beginning as a true heart's desire.

&amp;nbsp;

***Did you take community advice on the format for the LAN or was it a format you guys wanted to go with yourselves?***

Some combination of discussion with Psyonix, what we believe the community wants, what captures what we want to do, and what works within the timeframe we have available. Hopefully we got this one right, but we do look at each tournament with fresh eyes from the beginning. It's definitely an art more than a science.

&amp;nbsp;

***Do you play rocket league, and if so what is your rank?***

Probably best to get this one out of the way and be honest. For this audience, I would say no. To my wife, I would say yes. Definitely not competitively, but fortunately definitely not necessary. Whenever we take on any new game, we always make sure we have some people on the team that play seriously, and for the social coverage, we try to bring in someone from the scene who can help make sure we are doing things right. For Rocket League, I am not the inside guy. Bizarrely, the data team at Turner (who is not dedicated to ELEAGUE) is SUPER HOT for Rocket League. I didn't even know they played games. They came to visit when they heard we were doing it, demanded to play us, and so we will play them in the next week or two.

&amp;nbsp;

***What is it like being a senior marketing manager in esports and what kind of career path would someone take starting in college?***

Definitely a question I am asked on a regular basis, and definitely not something I have been able to answer well. I've been on panels and to panels about this, and I would collate all responses to a few simple rules: Be very lucky, be nice to people, work very hard, meet great people through work experience and internships so you can prove your worth, work on the art of marketing in other fields to git guid while you wait for your opportunity, be lucky and BE NICE TO PEOPLE.

&amp;nbsp;

***Do you like pineapple on pizza?***

Of course, if it's done well. It can be done badly, ofc. Any ingredient can be great in any dish (more or less) if executed well. Anyone coming to Atlanta that loves pizza should go to Antico! The best pizza I have ever had. They do not have pineapple on any pizzas, but that is, I am sure, a coincidence.

&amp;nbsp;

***Given a best case scenario based on future decisions from Psyonix, how long do you think Rocket League will be a viable esport, in years?***

Forever. Why does any scene have to die if the community keeps playing and wants to watch? Street Fighter is still going. That's over two decades.

&amp;nbsp;

***Do you think ELEAGUE's use of the group stage will have an influence on future Rocket League events and encourage a group stage ---&gt; knockout format to be more common?***

There are an awful lot of Rocket League events, and each event has its own needs to succeed. So maybe? Quite often people will want a tournament to be set up to be as precise a way of knowing who is the best as possible. The best way to know who is the best is to track performance over a set amount of time and many matches. And the more matches and data you have, the more possible it is to make a claim of who is the best. But really, do you want to watch a tournament that lasts for 17 years? And is it really important that there is a best team, and that team always wins? These are questions I think about a lot (or some less dramatic variant thereof). Also worth noting I have nothing to do with tournament formats, and zero influence over them. But still! 
This has been a non-answer, sorry.

&amp;nbsp;

***You chose to bring Chiefs from OCE rather than involving a fan favourite, NRG, how difficult a decision was this? Did you consider just resorting to an NA vs EU standoff?***

I wasn't in this decision process, but my understanding is we decided how we were going to invite teams before the RLCS. Having an NA vs EU standoff is always great for any esport, but it seldom works out that way. We are always hoping for it on the marketing team, because it is such an easy message to convey. Especially for the TV audience, and for our general mission of trying to increase awareness outside of a specific game's scene. One of the big challenges for esports is creating narratives around teams in order to help viewers, especially new viewers, form a bond with a team or player. It is very hard to establish a sport without that bond. The Olympics does the best job at this, and I'm sure that is in no small part of the geographical tribalism around it.

&amp;nbsp;

***What led ELEAGUE to create an episodic documentary about Rocket League instead of ""only"" showing the live gameplay for TV?***

I have misled you here! Let me quickly correct myself. The TBS content will certainly have more narrative and player/team features than the live digital broadcast, but will not actually be a docu-series similar to our Dota programming. That was my mistake in the initial communication, so apologies there. Rocket League, unlike Dota, is fairly easy to follow for someone not aquainted with the game. So we can show more gameplay and hopefully get more people into the actual esport. So expect gameplay on TBS, but packaged in more of an NFL Rewind style, and more player features. Like a docu-series sport hybrid. It'll be something new for us. Let us know what you think if you have access to TBS!

&amp;nbsp;

***What's your favorite prime number?***

One, obvs.

&amp;nbsp;

***Who do you think will win the ELEAGUE tournament?***

The viewers, because WE GOT REWARDS!

&amp;nbsp;

***When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?***

Bruce Lee. I would have been happy even to be a Z-list low-budget martial arts movie ""star"". Turns out, nobody's shooting martials arts movies in Scotland. BUT THEY SHOULD.

&amp;nbsp;

***What's been the hardest part of organizing a Rocket League event, compared to other esports?***

This has actually been fairly tough on my side, but in no part to any fault of Rocket League's developer or community. We just had so little time to prep, and it ran into the ELEAGUE Major: Boston announcement and early stage. Too much going on. I feel like we didn't prep for the social content as much as we normally would have, and I hope we do the scene justice tomorrow. Crunched timelines aside, every interaction I've had with the community and Psyonix has been excellent. I think they get that we want to elevate any esport we are involved with, and that we have your best interests at heart, and that has made working together great. I am not sure we could have pulled this off in this time frame with another developer. AND they had to make the Switch version. A really talented and professional team, and a great community. Also, while I'm in this groove, AMAZING SUB REDDIT. Like, the best designed sub I've seen. It looks slick and organised, and every other subreddit should steal your design ideas.

&amp;nbsp;

***What does ELEAGUE bring to the table that other productions doesn't?***

Years of world-class production capability and exceptionally dumb photoshop jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

***What is your take on the EA / Loot Crate debacle the gaming world is currently experiencing and do you think it will affect Rocket League?***

I think that this is a great conversation we are having, and that increased awareness of these kinds of techniques are important for us to have. And not just in gaming. But they are prevalant in gaming, and sometimes it's good to analyse for yourself if you are spending time in a game for the rewards over the experience. You have to answer that for yourself, and I think some people are not really aware of it. I work in a different building from the Adult Swim Games team, but I go see them regularly, and they are one of the most ethical teams I have known, and that makes me very happy inside, to know that such a team can exist and make money in today's climate.

&amp;nbsp;

***Do you like noodles?***

My wife's cook book comes out soon and has noodle recipes so yes! I wish it was out already so I could post an amazon link to it here, have everyone buy it and then retire and just play games all day.
But real talk, I think we all know rice is the one true food god.

&amp;nbsp;

***(scheist) I'm observing this tournament and we haven't met yet. Who allowed such blasphemy?***

Josh mentioned you earlier as someone I need to talk to before we go live tomorrow, so I can get the inside skinny! Come to the big glass table back stage tomorrow and say hi 😃

&amp;nbsp;

***Will you be releasing all of the game replays files for the event? (on rocketleaguereplays.com for example)***

I have heard some talk about replays, but don't know for sure. I'll find out.

&amp;nbsp;

***What's your favorite beer?***

Manhattans, a good red wine, cider, beer. In that order. And then maybe Blind Pirate. But probably not.

&amp;nbsp;

***Do you think Rocket League will be able to attract the more casual fanbases of esports (or even TV) moreso than your previous ELEAGUE games? (eg. CSGO, SFV, and OW)***

I think Street Fighter is hard to beat, as long as you have the classic characters. Even my dad knows what Ryu does, and not to jump on Guile (well, maybe that is not true anymore). But definitely CS:GO and OW for a casual audience. Overwatch was really very hard to follow for a while. They are getting better, and they just hired MA BOY Jason Baker to work on that, and I am excited for where they will go, but right now Rocket League is one of the best esports for a casual audience. Possibly the best. But I am SUPER VERY MEGA biased for everything Street Fighter.

&amp;nbsp;

***Any plans with ELEAGUE to keep expanding to others games, like CoD or others?***

We are always looking at all games. Hopefully we will do a better job of announcing our schedule in advance in 2018 and you'll know what we are covering more than a month in advance.

&amp;nbsp;

***Whats your favorite video game?***

I am 41 years old and have played games since they existed. I could maybe give you a top 100 and not be happy about it. Notables that spring to mind immediately - Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution, Street Fighter IV, Puzzle and Dragons (1350 consecutive days played), Super Monkey Ball, Gradius V, Minecraft. PGR 2. I am playing a lot of Party Golf right now. WHAT a game that is.

&amp;nbsp;

***if you plan to do more tourneys in rocket league will u have the same concept like 8 invited teams or switch it up like 75% invited teams and 25% from qualifiers or all qualifiers etc etc?***

honestly dunno.

&amp;nbsp;

***What games do you play besides Rocket League?***

Right now, a lot of Party Golf, because I don't mind my 2-year-old daughter seeing it on TV. I am biding my time until Monster Hunter World comes out OMG I DIDN'T LIST MON HUN ABOVE!!! Monster Hunter is my most played game. I used to work at Capcom and have a very strong emotional connection with that series. I have put easily thousands of hours into Monster Hunter. It's the best game.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm currently a junior in high school. I've got quite a few APs under my belt, and my class rank is pretty good (90th percentile). I also have lots of extracurriculars related to computer science.


Anywas, I wanted to ask if any of you managed to snag an internship in high school? If not, what about college students?


I've tried to find other high schoolers that are looking to/have gotten internships but only managed to find one Reddit thread. 



I'm very passionate in my pursuit of learning computer science and have been doing it for about 3 years on my own now. I've been looking for a structured internship for a while now so I'd be able to learn from industry professionals that can help me improve my engineering skills as a whole. I've essentially just self-taught myself programming in various libraries and languages without any real learning structure, which is why I want to polish up my skills.



Anyone have any insight on this?"

    |               \---validation


I've laid the basis of this project through a Spring course. I already expanded on a lot of things but I'd like to add a new functionality, but I'm not 100% sure what the right place is for a class commited to financial calculations. I want to try landing an internship next summer so I'm trying to focus on best practices and clean code.

I currently have InventoryItem objects that contain one of (currently) 10 Supplier objects. For financial analysis I need a new class that handles calculations, with the first one being an iteration over all InventoryItems that adds up the monetary worth per supplier (I.e. we currently have $1000 in items from the Supplier Bosch).

The class isn't a config, constant, filter, validation, mail or controller for sure. It isn't really a Dao class since it'll obtain it's information through the InventoyService and SupplierService that communicate with their respective Dao's, so I feel like it needs a new package. I'm not sure what conventions dictate that package should be named,or if i'm wrong and it should be with the Dao's anyway.  

So that ends question one. My smaller secondary question is:

In the controllers I return a String that corresponds with the actual name of a Jsp page to display. Since some url-mappings return the same *.jsp name with different logic attached to it, I decided to make a package called Constants where I declare the page names, like this:

    public final class JspPage {
    
    	public static final String INVENTORY_OVERVIEW = ""inventoryitems"";
    	public static final String NEW_ITEM_FORM = ""createinventoryitem"";
    	public static final String NEW_ITEM_SUCCES = ""itemcreated"";
    	public static final String EDIT_ITEM_FORM = ""itemedit"";
    	public static final String REFRESH_INFO_SIDEBAR = ""refreshinfo"";
    
    }

and use them like this:
    
    @RequestMapping(value = ""/docreate"", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    	public String createNewInventoryItemPOST(Model model, @Valid InventoryItem inventoryItem, BindingResult result) {
    
    		if (result.hasErrors()) {
    			return JspPage.NEW_ITEM_FORM;
    		}
    
    		inventoryService.create(inventoryItem);
    
    		return JspPage.NEW_ITEM_SUCCES;
    	}

I figured this would be easier maintainable and easier to read, but on the other hand I create extra imports. Is this best practice?

Thanks for your time!

Raise your hand if you had the Eagles starting the season 10-1? If you're raising your hand right now, you're a liar. I am sure many of us thought the Eagles would make a jump this year and get to the playoffs and possibly win the division, but I don’t think anyone saw this coming. Doug Pederson’s Eagles have the best record in the NFL and are riding a 9 game winning streak into their toughest test of the season as they travel to Seattle to take on Russell Wilson and the 12th man of the Seahawks. The Seahawks are the most complete team the Eagles have faced so far this season ranking in the top 10 on both offense and defense. The Seahawks defense has suffered some recent injuries losing both Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor with season ending injuries, but they still have a very good defense filled with playmakers at every level. The Eagles match up much better with them this year than they did a year ago, but will need to play more efficiently this week and not make the turnovers this week as they did last week against the Bears. The Seahawks lost their last two home games and would miss the playoffs if the season ended today. Their backs are against the wall right now, so the Eagles better expect them to come out giving everything they have in prime-time on Sunday Night Football. The Eagles need to start fast to try to take the crowd out of the game. This game should be a slugfest between two defensively stout teams and should make for some great football Sunday night.|

Recap from Last Week’s Games.|
:-
**Eagles** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000883275/Bears-vs-Eagles-highlights-Week-12) – The game many expected could be a trap for the Eagles turned into a rout of the Bears 31-3. The Eagles controlled both sides of the line of scrimmage and dominated the Bears running backs sending them the wrong direction as they ended the day with -6 yards rushing. The Eagles secondary also picked off Mitch Trubisky twice on the day. On offense, the Eagles running game was on point as they ran for 176 and Carson Wentz threw for 3 TDs and 227 yards before an early exit in the 4th quarter to prevent injury and give Nick Foles some playing time. The Eagles had their first 100 yard receiver this season as Zach Ertz crossed the century mark. The game wasn’t perfect though both Blount and Ajayi fumbled the football running and Malcom Jenkins fumbled after making a nice interception.|
**Seahawks** - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qMK00l5WIc) – The Seahawks overcame a sloppy start Sunday to win 24-13 against rival 49ers. Russell Wilson threw an interception on the first play from scrimmage, but recovered and threw for two touchdowns to give him 150 career TDs passing and also ran for a short score. Blair Walsh continued to struggle as he missed two FGs to open the game before connecting on a 34 FG late. The Seahawks defense stout and able to keep the team in the game until the other two phases of the game got on track. They held Carlos Hyde to 9 yards on 8 carries in the first half and 47 yards overall, while the forced an INT from CJ Beathard and sacked him three times in the Victory.|

**Stats to Know** |
:---|
**The Seattle Front 7 Run Defense**|
Seattle's been known for great run defense for several years now. This year is no different, as they feature three Defensive Linemen in the top 10 for EDs and DIs in Run Stop % (Bennett, Reed, and Richardson). As a side note, the Eagles feature the top two EDs in Run Stop % (Graham/Curry). The Seahawks god of a Middle Linebacker is also third in Run Stop % for LBs and is making a strong case for DPOY. Before they got hurt, CB Richard Sherman was 4th in Run Stop % for CBs and S Kam Chancellor was first for Safeties. As a team, they still allow eigth-best Yards Per Carry and ninth-best Rushing Yards Per Game. Missing Sherman and Chancellor hurts Seattle in many ways, including Run Defense.--Courtesy of [PFF Elite](https://www.profootballfocus.com/products/elite)|
 
 
**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Eagles Passing Defense vs. Seahawks Passing Offense**|
This key matchup will be the key matchup for the Eagles in this game. The Eagles haven’t faced a good QB in several weeks. That doesn’t take away from the impressive performances from the defense this season but Russell Wilson is an outstanding QB. Wilson is having a MVP season dragging the Seattle offense kicking and screaming this season. Since their last Super Bowl appearance, Wilson has been the focus of the offense, rightfully so, but also out of necessity. Presently, the Seahawks have 4 receivers with at least 400 receiving yards on the season. Jimmy Graham has been a red zone monster accounting for 8 TDs on the season and has had at least one in the last few games. The Seahawks enter the game with the 13th ranked passing offense by DVOA. Enter the red hot Eagles defense. Earlier in the season, this matchup would have scared all Eagles fans. But the secondary has played pretty well and should play well this week even if it is their first real test in some time. The Eagles defense comes into the game with the 4th ranked passing defense per DVOA and the 3rd ranked defense per DVOA overall. Baldwin is presently the 7th ranked receiver per PFF and is their best all-around receiver. Paul Richardson and Tyler Lockett are also excellent threats outside for Seattle. The Eagles feature one of the top CBs per PFF in Patrick Robinson, who has made a living in the slot this season. They will Ronald Darby and the improved Jalen Mills outside. The Eagles also have 3 good safeties who have done a great job shutting down opposing TEs on the season. This matchup will go a long way to determining the winner as Russell Wilson is an elite passer. Shutting down their passing attack would stall this offense mightily considering they have the worst rushing attack in football.|
**Eagles Defensive Front vs. Russell Wilson**|
I’m making the extremely obvious choice in singling out Russell Wilson here since the Seattle rushing attack is a joke. Rookie Chris Carson, who is out for the season, still leads all Seattle running backs in rushing. Overall, Russell Wilson is the best rushing option the Seahawks have. He can kill you through the air and on the ground. The Eagles have done a good job of limiting QBs running ability on the season outside of one long Cam Newton run, but Wilson is a whole new challenge. He’s basically Carson Wentz in the pocket. Last year, the Eagles defense allowed the Seahawks offense to average 5.1 YPC on the ground in their loss. I wouldn't expect the Seahawks to be remotely effective running the ball, but that doesn’t mean anyone should sleep on Wilson. The Seahawks have a putrid offensive line and they will be facing the best defensive line in football. Penetration shouldn’t be an issue for the Eagles on Sunday night – discipline will be the focus. The defensive front will have to play smart football all game to contain Wilson. One slip up can result in a huge play for the Seahawks. This is a matchup the Eagles can win but saying that doesn’t make it any easier.|
**Eagles Passing Attack vs Seahawks Passing Defense**|
The Legion of Boom is another year older and the wear and tear of football is starting to catch up to them. Two of their best players in the secondary, Dick Sherm and Kam Chancellor, are out for the season. While there is an opportunity for the Eagles offense to capitalize on the mediocre play of Jeremy Lane and Byron Maxwell, the Seahawks still have Earl Thomas – who will play in this game. Carson Wentz will have to play smart football considering Thomas’s ability to take away so much of what offense want to do through the air. The Eagles enter the game with the 5th ranked passing offense per DVOA while the Seahawks enter the game with the 9th ranked passing defense per DVOA. Zach Ertz has been a monster for the Eagles this season and Alshon Jeffrey has picked up his play of late. Nelson Agholor has been a valuable contributor to the offense and will be looking to redeem himself in Seattle after completely hitting rock bottom in last year’s game. While the Seahawks are pretty banged up on the back end, they do feature rookie Shaquill Griffin, who is the founding member of the Legion of Baby Boomers. Griffin is a fantastic athlete outside and has been a valuable starter on the season. He has been banged up with some injuries but will be playing. He shouldn’t be overlooked. He’s looking like he can develop into a good starter very soon. The Eagles have an opportunity to really stick it to the Seahawks through the air but they need to play smart as the Seahawks still have plenty of talent and great coaching on defense to make you pay for any mistakes.|
**Eagles Offensive Line vs Seahawks Defensive Front**|
This matchup is probably the most intriguing of the night considering each unit is a strength of their respective teams. The Eagles are entering the game with a great offensive line that hasn’t missed a beat after Jason Peters went on IR earlier in the season. Lane Johnson and Brandon Brooks have been playing at All Pro levels this season. Jason Kelce is having a career year at Center for the Eagles and Wisniewski has been a revelation at Left Guard. While there is a lot of faith in the Eagles offensive line, the Seahawks have a lot of talent on their defensive line. Michael Bennett is an excellent EDGE rusher. The Seahawks also have Sheldon Richardson and Frank Clark along the line. Big V will be tested in this game after a rocky performance against the Bears. Overall, the Eagles offensive line should hold up decently against the Seahawks but Seattle will make plays along the line. They also feature DPOY candidate Bobby Wagner, who is amazing. KJ Wright is another excellent LB for the Seahawks. For the Eagles to have success, they’ll need to keep Wentz clean and help open up lanes in the run game.

7gvbsf,0,2017-12-01,Does a colourful character push you away?,kw2002,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7gvbsf/does_a_colourful_character_push_you_away/,"I was born lucky in many ways.  I come from a supportive and open minded family, am considered very attractive, am bright, and land good internships that pay very well for someone of any age.  I feel like these things I just lucked out on, and they make many things in life just easier.

Add in that I'm extroverted, a hedonist, and a risk taker.  I actively seek out and experiment with new and unusual experiences and have the resources to make those things happen.

Together, it means I have an unusual background full of experiences that often times seem incredulous to the mostly polite people I associate with on a day-to-day basis.  People like classmates or coworkers seem shocked if some of my experiences leak out in conversation, or if they somehow discover it online.  Finding out that I'm gay is literally just the beginning.

Experiences like diversity and number of sexual partners, drug use, part time ""jobs"", expat living, just bizarre encounters, unusual parties, prostitution, manipulation, undeserved successes, serendipitous hookups, breaking of social conventions, etc. etc. all come out piece by piece eventually IRL with people I hang around. 

And while everyone knows some aspects of me that they consider unusual, I don't think anyone knows the ""whole story"".  Maybe one or two very close friends.

On reddit though, I go to great pains to remain more or less unidentifiable.  Given that anonymity, I've posted all kinds of shit that I've done.  There are few people IRL I'd admit everything to, for lots of practical reasons.

Some redditors have told me I'm a horrible person, and yet, I consider myself to be quite agreeable IRL.  IRL I have had people I'm getting close to back off because, as they they put it, I just seem a little too eccentric for them.  They make this judgement based on the stories they hear about me, and conclude I can't be a nice, normal guy.

I'm worried that a colourful history is going to push away any guy I'd like to commit to.  I'd like a quiet, unspectacular guy.

Have you ever met a seemingly great guy just to later find he's too ""wild"" to be considered for anything close to a normal BF?"
7gvzt5,41,2017-12-01,[Progress] [Advice] dependency override and freedom!,Lulamay16,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7gvzt5/progress_advice_dependency_override_and_freedom/,"Hi everyone! I'm 19 now and I've been hanging out on this subreddit since I was 14 on various accounts for privacy reasons. My parents horrifically abused me for years, and this subreddit was always a source of comfort because it showed me that I wasn't insane or bad for my feelings about how they treated me. This community taught me all the adulting skills I could ever need, it taught me to cope with their bullshit and practice mental health self care when I couldn't get therapy due to my mom's meddling, and reading you guys' stories reassured me and made me feel better in ways that probably saved me from ever hurting myself or one of my parents in my frustration and anger about 19 years of abuse.

I posted on here about a dependency override after getting kicked out back in September and generally asking for advice- like how to get a phone, how to get back to college, how to get insurance and pay tuition... when I made that post, I was in my classmate's parents' apartment at 3 am surrounded by the entire contents of my room in suitcases after getting screamed out of the house by my drunk dad and taking a taxi to the first place I found that would let me stay the night. I was homeless for a while, couch surfing and sleeping on mattresses on the floors of people's living rooms. I put all my stuff in a rental car and drove 13 straight hours from home to college on my own (I'm a very new driver and this was my second time on the interstate).
To stay in college, I needed tuition. Without contacting my parents to get their tax returns for financial aid, i would be responsible for the $70k sticker price here, so I needed to get a dependency override. I spent 2 months gathering evidence that my parents had abused me. This was terrible, it involved such bad memories, and I was suffering so much, but it was so worth it. The dependency override was approved. I cried tears of joy in the financial aid director's office when I found out.

Now I'm finally on my feet again. I got a phone and all the other necessities for adulting, the dependency override was approved, and I'm attending a top-3 university for $5k a year including tuition/books/insurance/housing/food/therapy/gym membership. Although my parents are harassing me a lot with gifts and emails and letters, I can just ignore these, and all I need is to sign a piece of paper to get them banned from campus if that becomes a concern. My life is on track, I've gone from a constantly suicidal and self-hating kid to an independent adult who is paying for their own college. I'm transgender and I'm finally getting to start transitioning now that I'm away from their abuse. I'm finally getting to heal, my (incredibly supportive) partner constantly reminds me that they were actually abusive, that it wasn't my fault, and I shouldn't feel guilt for going NC. My friends here at college are so supportive and I love them so much- we all cooked Thanksgiving together at college and it was the wholesome NParent-free family holiday I had always seen in the movies. I'm spending Christmas with three of them, others sat with me and we drank wine and listened to music while I was digging through traumatic evidence, and everyone celebrated with me when I finally got the dependency override. I am working on getting myself a fantastic internship this summer in the field I love (getting flown out to SF in a week to interview for a development position at Dropbox!). I might even have time to quit a job and start therapy soon. 

It has been so much work to claw myself up to this level of mental health and independence, and I feel so empowered now that I've done it. I definitely have some terrible nights where I half believe I made up all their abuse, contrary to a literal stack of evidence that I submitted tor the dependency override, and sometimes I believe I'm terrible and a bad person for going NC. But the vast majority of the time my life is what I cried about dreaming of as a suffering teenager. I'm so goddamn happy. I just wanted to thank all y'all internet strangers for supporting me through so much, and I want miserable high school kids to read this and know that their life has the potential to get so so so much better. I remember being a sophomore in high school and feeling like shit, then looking at all the ACONs with NC in their flairs and thinking about ""The Ugly Duckling""- right now everything is shit, but in the future I'll be like them, independent and well-adjusted and happy and giving sage advice to kids still stuck in abusive homes. It gets better, y'all, and I'm finally able to verify that myself :).

Also, if anyone college- or high-school age has any questions about the ~fantastic~ process of dependency overrides, I'm happy to answer them in PM or in the comments. It can be confusing, but it's the best way to get yourself educated and become independent from NParents in one fell swoop.

&lt;3 &lt;3 thank y'all again for EVERYTHING."

7gwp9y,55,2017-12-01,Bilanz 2017 - wie wird 2018?,FeBaTheorista,rocketbeans,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketbeans/comments/7gwp9y/bilanz_2017_wie_wird_2018/,"Ein Versuch, Kritik aus dem Jahr zusammenzufassen und eine hoffentlich sachliche Diskussion zu führen. 

Es gab auf Reddit, im Forum und im Social Media eine Menge Feedback für RBTV... eine Menge. Mittlerweile sind ca. 90 MA beim Sender mit unterschiedlichen Verträgen und Aufgaben betraut worden, man konnte Sponsoren gewinnen und die BENS ein bisschen austauschen. Gleichzeitig wurde am Inhalt und Konzept gebastelt, was bei den Zuschauern unterschiedlich ankam. Genauso wie gewisse Moderatoren. 
Am 15.01.2018 feiert der Sender den 3. Geburtstag. 

Ein Rückblick: 

* Twitch ist wieder da, waiput.tv macht mit
* es gab den Deutschen Fernsehpreis und eine Nominierung beim Jugendwort des Jahres
* ""Game Two"" wurde auf FUNK verlängert, Trant kam zurück
* die Blog-Kategorie ""Per Anhalter durchs Bohnenuniversum"" wurde im Winter eingestellt, März war der behindthebeans-Monat, relativ regelmäßig kam wieder ""Spotlight on"" über die Mitarbeiter, seit kurzem läuft donnerstags ""Behind the Beans"" als ""Q&amp;A""-Ersatz
* BENS wurden teilweise durch neue Moderatoren in ""#MoinMoin"", Abendformaten, ""Beef"" und ""Pen &amp; Paper"" ersetzt/ ergänzt/ entlastet
* es gibt so eine Art Animations- und Kurzfilmexperiment: ""RBTV Stories"", ""PUBG Stories"", ""Stichhaltig"" in letzter Zeit
* es gibt einen Pressebereich auf der Website, der neu-alte Sendeplan funktioniert mittlerweile, es gibt einen ""Superchat""
* die Flairs für MA wurden teilweise im Reddit wieder eingeführt
* Events dieses Jahr waren u.a. ein Pokerturnier, Koops mit Pietsmiet und Kliemannsland, Gamescom, E3; intern: 5 Pen &amp; Papers?, Werwolf, 2 Beefs
* eventuell spontanste Sachen waren 'Budi zockt Knie' oder 'Flo liest Heine', 'Dissfest: Lars vs. Aurel', Reaktion zu ""Star Wars - The last Jedi"" und 'Let's sleep'
* es gibt wieder mehr ""Highlights"" und Werbebanner im laufenden Programm?
* im Shop diverse neue Produkte, darunter Halloween- und Weihnachtsspecials, ~~man distanziert sich allmählich von getshirts~~
* diverse Formate fortgesetzt (z.B. ""1 on 1""), eingestellt (z.B. ""Nerds an Herds"", ""mobile+""), umbenannt oder neu dazu genommen (z.B. ""Final Table""), Trennung von Hauptkanal und Let's-Play-Kanal in Non-Gaming und Gaming, Fremdcontent blieb übersichtlich?
* es wurde mit Clickbait experimentiert/ gespielt und ein neuer Abo-Button eingeführt

 .

*Der Claim lautet noch immer: ""Alles muss. Nix kann."". Was schaut ihr euch am liebsten an? Was glaubt ihr, wie geht es 2018 weiter und was hofft ihr bzw. nehmt ihr euch als Zuschauer vor?*

Persönliches Fazit: 
 
Die Professionalisierung schreitet voran. Das ist, was wir uns gewünscht hatten. Ich kann die Kritik teilweise nicht nachvollziehen, die manche damit haben. Natürlich kann man seine Persönlichkeit verlieren, aber als Internetsender lebt es sich nicht so leicht, möchte ich meinen. Da überlegt man sich mehrmals, wie man Geld holt. Noch immer würde ich selbst nicht spenden, da mir trotzdem noch ein umfassender Plan fehlt, wie RBTV plant und haushaltet. Dafür gibt es jetzt aber eben die Sponsoren und die scheinen Vertrauen zu haben (immerhin fast 100 Folgen mit Jägermeister). Ich würde es natürlich begrüßen, wenn die Sponsoren nicht so random werden. Tschibo als Sponsor passt irgendwie nicht. 

Die Kommunikation ist tatsächlich immer noch eine Sache für sich. Ich bin jetzt mehr auf Facebook und muss sagen, dass ich gefühlt dort mehr mitkriege als bei twitter, redit oder dem Kanal. Manche Aktionen laufen scheinbar exklusiv dort, z.B. dieser Gender Swap-Wettbewerb, was ich etwas schade finde. Ich finde es nach wie vor auch schade, dass Reddit in der Schwebe steht. Noch schader, dass Timo und die anderen vor kurzem nur durch einen Kritikthread hergekommen sind. In meinen Augen ein falscher Ansatz. Als Firma mit so viel Feedbackkanälen wäre es wirklich sinnvoll, bei wenigen Kanälen zu bleiben. Leider ist mir das Forum selbst zu unsicher, weswegen ich bei Reddit bleibe. Die Atmosphäre hier ist aber auch nicht das wahre.

Ich habe zwei Leute für den Kanal gewinnen können. Über das Nerdquiz und die Sendung von c't. Sie sagten, der Sender sei ""zu professionell"" für sie. Einmal gab es wieder einen Technikfehler, worüber sie sich amüsiert haben (Chat-Kommentare). Beide passen gut in die Zielgruppe. Das gebe ich so weiter. Macht damit, was ihr wollt.

Ansonsten wäre es nicht schlecht, wenn es zwar bunt zugeht, aber die Formate regelmäßiger kommen. Entgegen der oft gewünschten Spontaneität habe ich nichts gegen z.B. 1x M Buchclub, 1xM Almost Plaily, 1xW diesdas... ihr versteht schon. Dafür reicht ein geringer redaktioneller Aufwand aus und die Formate müssen nicht komplett eingestampft werden. Die Sponsorfrage macht Sinn, wenn die MA Honorare kriegen und zu wenig Geld da ist. Ist das denn so?

Gerne nehme ich wieder an einer Umfrage teil. Diese muss aber wirklich vorher geprobt werden. Die letzten hatten Fehler, die die Ergebnisse verfälschen. Es macht statistisch übrigens nicht so viel aus, wenn riesige Massen teilnehmen, da sich nach einer Weile alles einer Normalkurve angleicht. Fokusgruppen wären aus meiner Sicht eine Überlegung wert. Na? Na? 

2016 war manchmal interessanter. So wenig haben sie aber dieses Jahr doch gar nicht geschafft! Ich finde Mut gut. Ich vertraue ihnen und bin mir sicher, dass sie sich immer mehr einpendeln. Gerne wüsste ich, wie es finanziell um den Sender steht, denn das erklärt vielleicht einiges. An sich kommt aber nur Bewegung, wenn sie eben neue Dinge probieren, egal wie unpopulär es erstmal klingt.

7gwslk,4,2017-12-01,Co-intern got the job over me. Now I'm the last one who hasn't landed a full time position. I feel like garbage.,Odiil,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7gwslk/cointern_got_the_job_over_me_now_im_the_last_one/,"Like me, most of my fellow interns have recently graduated from university this year. That also means we're all on the hunt for full time positions. Some early on landed jobs, and gradually over time many more did too. Besides the interns who are still in school and the couple decided to remain interns into the next year, I'm the only left with no insight on what I'm going to do.

Now don't get me wrong. All of my fellow interns are beyond deserving of the positions they landed. I'm truly happy for them.

Thing is, though, I'm even amazed I landed this internship in the first place. I already suffer from major depression, and have had (and still do) little to no confidence in myself and abilities. I have no motivations, little energy to do anything, and have little redeeming qualities.

All of that is amplified when you see your co-interns leave for full time positions. I feel like shit because my life and anything about me is garbage. No one seems to think I'm worthy of hiring and I've sensed for a long time that my current bosses even wonder why they selected me for this internship.

I just don't know anymore. I give up. I give up on everything. "

_____________________

Reimes had warned her how time begins to run through your fingers. Back when a Cruiser had whipped low over the rickety St. Louis outskirts the Resistance called home.

The sleek hovercraft stuck out like a sore thumb among the meandering low-class yawls and sputtering haul-ships lugging rusted scrap metal and copper wiring. The Cruiser swept low, as graceful as a hawk, casting plumes of dust off rooftops, no doubt scanning the derelict red bricks for Resistance infrastructure. Kare belly-flopped into alleyway grime. She initialized DNA scrambling with only seconds to spare. An odd prickling sensation overcame her as the torrent of air from the Cruiser’s wake stood her hair on end like a fingernail down the spine.

Later that night, the crew sat stone-faced over tepid cups of chicken soup. Prig frowned at the distant skyline blinking in city smog, while Travish plucked away in the firelight, implementing updates to Gracie’s code. Reimes sat chewing over contingency plans. He was rubbing absentmindedly at the scar on his temple, the fire flickering something foreign behind his eyes. 
Could it have been fear?  Kare had assumed he’d scrubbed that emotion from his constitution. 

Yet, there it was. 

It was Prig who’d first broken the silence.

“The sooner we yank the rug out beneath ‘em, the better.” He stood, a massive shadow across the flames, and ambled over to Travish’s chair. “Every second you slog through your numbers, another batch of ‘*deplorables*’ are pacified,” he grumbled, reaching for Travish’s half-empty cup of soup.

Travish placed a hand over the lip of the cup, eyes never wavering from the code on his screen.

“And every second you distract me astronomically increases the probability of a hiccup in Gracie’s programming,” he’d said. 

Prig frowned, obstinate as always. He lumbered over to the tent flap and yanked it open. The landscape painted a grim picture. The heart of the city shone bright, sure--a yellow, gleaming metropolis, with the Gateway Arch shrouded in Osiris gold--but the landscape surrounding was crumbling. Darkness encroached on scattered trash bin campfires. A civilian populace collectively struggled amidst reality. 

“There’s a bloody *war* going on out there, and nobody even realizes it!” Prig said. “They’re lulling entire demographics, entire *fucking* families, into comas.” 

“That’s why we’re fighting, Prig,” Travish said, closing his eyes with a sigh. “That’s why I need to get this right.”

“The longer we wait, the less bodies there *are* to fight.”

As the two argued, Kare seized the opportunity to fish through Reimes’s mind. Something was off with him, but she couldn’t quite pinpoint it. Kare lifted her stump and plopped it into the dirt right next to him. He’d hardly seemed to notice. Just kept squinting into the smoke.

 “They’ll detect the DNA anomalies soon,” she prodded.

Their pensive leader nodded, distracted. “We’ll move tomorrow,” he’d said. “Further into the outskirts. We can’t risk the mission until we’re completely prepared.”

Then, after a moment, he’d said:

“You ready to play your part?”

Kare had leapt at the chance to impress. 

“Of course. Get in with Gracie, *commission* ourselves a Cruiser using Prig’s very select skillset, then skim the souls I uplinked back in the day. A happy little rescue. If we’re lucky, one will prove useful.”

Reimes simply grunted, returning his gaze to the popping of the campfire. Kare placed her hand on his shoulder. The scar on Reimes’s scalp had shone like a pale hieroglyphic. Something deep and mysterious to be decoded. “You scared?” Kare asked before she could help herself. 

She felt Reimes’s muscles tense beneath her palm. He looked at her in a way he’d never done before. “I’m not sure I can even explain,” he said. “They...I...I wasn’t *human* anymore.” 

She nodded, trying to understand. Reimes was the only human alive who’d escaped from the subfloors of the Osiris complex. Without his knowledge of the floor plan, the Resistance was dead in the water. 

Reimes had grabbed her then, looking her dead in the eye. 

What he said next took her by surprise: “If they catch you, Kare, it would be better to end it.”

Now, his voice played over and over in her head as she was bound up in a chair in a white-tile room under a flickering fluorescent. The glare off the tiles was so bright that Kare’s face shrunk into a perpetual squint.

The Project’s first step in unlocking the puzzle of her mind was to deny her basic humanity. Eliminate the threads by which she clung to the world.

 First and foremost, they stomped on her knuckles and unmoored her from the fabric of time. There was nothing by which to gauge the passing of the days. How many flickers of the fluorescents equaled one hour? Or fitful bouts of sleep? How many times had they jarred her awake with an arbitrary flick of the lightswitch?Meals came completely at random. A tray would slide unceremoniously to her feet, drugged food hardly enough to fill a saucer. Once, she’d hardly finished some soggy breakfast eggs when another tray slid to her feet. She squinted at the thing, confused. 

*Dinner rolls*, she realized. *Moldy ones at that*. 

Then the lights flicked off.

Kare became familiar, too, with silence. Bubbling underneath its surface was a slow rising dread. She’d taken for granted the familiar vibrato of a passing yawl, or the gentle flapping of their tent in a breeze. Sound’s absence was permeating. It soaked through her like a wet blanket and left her shivering in her chair. Kare wanted more than anything to scream out, feel the scratch of her voice, but if she were to so much as hum to clear the headache, an unseen eye would shock her, a painful jolt riveting through her steel chair. 

Humans are nothing more than a collection of senses, it turns out.

 One by one, the Project exploited them, turned Kare’s reliance upon them against her. 

*Stay rational*, she thought. *Keep your wits about you.They just want you to erode.*

Here, too, the Osiris Project assaulted her. Microchips the size of fleas buzzed behind her ears. They turned her own consciousness into a pointed spear. Every so often, her own internal voice would chirp:

*Give in. Let them kill you.*

There was no escape from the voice. It followed her into her dreams. Poking and prodding her with her most disturbing unrealized truths:

*Perhaps they’ve killed you already.* 

It could have been weeks, it could have been months, but at long last, Kare squinted and found the door wide open.

 “How are you faring?” came a feminine voice. Then, the sound of heels taking ponderous, calculated steps. A beautiful break in the monotony. 

*Click. Clack. Click. Clack. Click.* 

Kare nearly cried at the sound. She blinked several times, unsure if the woman was some sort of mirage. Another level of their mind game. The woman carried a slender figure, dressed in a black lab coat that fluttered past her knees like a sort of dress. “Oh, it’s okay. You can talk now,” the woman said. “Don’t worry, little mouse.”

The woman leaned in close enough to smell. The scent of lavender so stark against the blankness. Kare realized it was the first smell she’d processed in some time. 

Kare’s voice faltered at first. It felt strange. Words teetered out of her mouth as if on stilts.

“Your accommodations could use some work,” Kare said after some effort. 

The woman flashed a toothy grin. “Still you, I see. That’s good.” She nodded. “Very good.”
The woman stood up and began to circle her. The clicking of her heels suddenly took on a very ominous feel. “Such a fine line, I’m afraid. Sometimes we lose people. Folks who had a tenuous grasp to begin with most likely. But in the end, we get what we want.”

Kare coughed. Her tongue felt dry and raspy in her mouth. “And what is that?” 

The woman stopped in front of her, crossing her arms. Her black lab coat was emblazoned with golden letters that spelled: *Carissa*.

“Oh, I’m sure you can guess,” she said. 

“Info on the Resistance.”

Carissa laughed. A short, sharp laugh like the cracking of a whip. She leaned in close once more, eyes wide and dancing. “There’s no such thing as resistance,” she whispered. “Just fantasy.” 

Kare met her gaze head on. 

“I find that an incredibly ironic statement.”

Carissa snorted. She walked around and around Kare’s metal chair, taking her time, as if studying an ancient artifact in a dusty museum. 

“As ironic as a disgraced former employee come back to give lectures on morality?” Carissa said. “Your file is so very interesting.”

Kare prepared her retort, but Carissa appeared in front of her and put a finger to her lips. 

“Shhhh, now, little mouse. No use getting into all that. I simply want to know how to stop our rodent problem.” She traced the outline of Kare’s lips, smiling to herself, before straightening. “We set all sorts of traps, you see? Sometimes we even catch you by your tail.”

She motioned at the door. 

A box was brought in. Carissa made a show of fishing around inside, keeping her eyes locked on Kare’s all the while. 

*I will kill this woman,* Kare thought. *So help me God.*

“No matter what we do. You pests keep...” 

 Kare gasped as Carissa withdrew her hands, holding Prig’s severed head by his dreadlocks. She twirled his face in the air so he was facing hers.  

“Popping...”. She winked at Kare, then she leaned forward and kissed him. Deep. Hard. She withdrew with a satisfied *smack*

 “Up.”  Blood trickled from the corner of her lips. She wiped it away with the tip of her fingers. Then smeared it across her lips like lipstick. 

Prig’s head dangled. His mouth stood agape--eyes lifeless and empty. 

“That memory of yours was nice. Reimes. Hoi boy what a man. I almost wish he’d been the one to tag along,” Carissa giggled, then abruptly frowned. “Where did he move camp?”

 It was all Kare could do to keep her lips from trembling.

 “Burn in hell,” she croaked. 

Carissa clucked. 

“A pity. Truly.” She plopped Prig’s lifeless head in Kare’s lap. Kare recoiled and nearly toppled her chair. Blood soaked through her jeans. Hot. Sticky. It pooled in her lap, running down her hips in molasses-like rivulets.

 Carissa clapped her hands. “But on the other hand that means we’re in for some fun!” She spread her arms out wide, twirling. Her black lab coat swirled in the air.

 Kare wrenched her eyes closed, unable to watch. Unable to meet Prig’s blank eyes. 

“You said our accommodations were lacking. Personally, I’ve found our new room to be quite marvelous. The company’s been dabbling in side projects, you see? The military is *very* interested in the interrogation techniques our rooms have to offer. All it takes is a single passphrase, and you’re at the mercy of my imagination.”

Suddenly, Kare felt the moisture of Carissa’s breath on her earlobe. Her excited breaths came hot and heavy, sending goosebumps down her arms.

“Harbinger,” Carissa whispered. 

Carissa had scarcely spoken the word when the white tiles pulsed. Kare’s chair lurched and she opened her eyes to see the tiles shifting, rearranging. An electric pulse shimmied through the air.

Kare’s chair lifted from the ground. 

Carissa cackled and whirled in the air. The room was full of static electricity. It stood Carissa’s hair on end like a deranged scarecrow. The wicked witch of the west. 

She cricked her head, and Kare’s chair flipped upside down. Kare let out a shout as she dangled, bindings digging deep into her wrists. She wiggled her hands, working furiously to slip through. 

Then the bindings hissed. 

Fangs dug into the meaty part of her palm. Kare screamed and fell, crumpling to a heap on the floor. Two snakes fell beside her. They reared up, baring their fangs once more, but Kare kicked them away before they struck. 

Carissa floated around, orchestrating the room like a maestro. The tiles around Kare fell away. Down, down, down, they went, dissolving into nothing. Until she stood on a single tile, staring down into the pit of a mass grave. Bodies lay everywhere, squirming, moaning. 

Thunder rumbled overhead. The ceiling tiles folded in on themselves. Suddenly, they weren’t tiles but clouds, unleashing a hot, sticky rain. A torrential downpour of blood. Kare blinked it from her eyes, tasted thick iron in her mouth. 

Prig’s head was now floating, suspended, dreadlocks matted down in all that crimson. 

“Think, Kare-bear,” he said. His eyes wheeled loose in their sockets. “Tell them and you’ll be uplinked.” He began to orbit her like some demonic moon, smiling all the while. His voice grew demonic with every lap:

“You’ll see your sister again.”

“You’ll see your sister again.”

“You’ll see your sister again.”

Carissa’s hands were suddenly rubbing Kare’s shoulders. She pinched her cheek as she whispered in Kare’s ear. “He has a point, you know, perhaps you should listen.”

She bit Kare’s neck, ever-so-softly, giggling to herself.

“Where did Reimes move camp?”

Kare wrenched her eyes closed, shaking her head. Blood spattered everywhere, seeping through every pore. She cried out, but another booming clap of thunder drowned her out. 

Her mind was running. The little fleas behind her ears buzzed names they knew would stab hardest. 

*Reimes*, they said.

*Prig.*

*Your sister, Reianne*

Then something clicked. 

“This isn’t real,” Kare said aloud. Her eyes widened. “None of this is real.”

Carissa’s hands abruptly stopped. 

Kare stood firm, and shouted: “I’m in a drip.”

It was like a leak had suddenly sprung. All the electricity let out of the air. The room, the tiles, everything, snapped back to form. Carissa rubbed the back of her neck and sighed. “Very astute. Once again, I’m impressed.”

She drifted down to the re-forming floor like an acrobat being lowered by circus wire. “Suspend the drip.”

Colors blended and swirled. Kare’s reality flickered, and the familiar drain commenced, her heart settling itself back into a steady rhythm.

Kare blinked. She was in a stasis pod. Through the orange plexiglass lay an observation lab. The sort of rooms they’d used to first develop the drips. Monitors blipped on lab counters, IV bags stacked on bedside tables. 

 “You’re proving very troublesome, you know,” Carissa’s voice said. The pod beside Kare hissed open. Only Carissa was completely different. A redheaded teenager, pale and doughy, hair tied in a frizzy bun. She slid out of her stasis pod with a clumsy jump, shaking her head clear.

The girl smiled through the plexiglass.   

 “Do you like my the changes I made?” she asked. Then she slapped her forehead. “Of course, you wouldn’t remember.”

Kare frowned. Synesthesia attacked her senses. The oxygen pumped through her mask nearly made her puke. As if reading her mind, Carissa fed Kare’s pod a pill. “Here, for the synesthesia.”

It dangled in front of Kare. Carissa smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling. She nodded. “Take it. If I don’t, my dizziness smells like cat pee.”

Kare took it gingerly, fixing her with a wary gaze. 

“You need some water?” Carissa asked. 

Before Kare could answer, she danced off to the sink. 

“This is one hell of a good cop-bad cop routine.”

Carissa laughed. “So you like her? I stayed up all night developing character. She’s such a sleeze! It’s funny, at a certain point she began to feel *real*, you know? Like, I dunno, a part of me? She nearly worked, too. That was the longest I kept you under.”

“What are you talking about? H-how long was I under?” 

“Ten minutes,” Carissa beamed. There was something strange about her. Something familiar. She almost reminded Kare of herself, back when the Project was simply a promising upstart. The way she carried herself with such naive confidence. Like the world was splayed out before her. 

“You’re a fucking intern.”

“*Not* if I get you to crack,” she winked. “The engineers really tucked the prize deep in there, huh?”

Kare’s mind was racing.“This isn’t some trial,” she said. “Carissa, this is real. P-please you have to help me.”

Carissa rolled her eyes. “Save it. Who do you think I am? Kristoff? The stupid bloke who stuck his head so far up his bum in *that* conspiracy theory they scrubbed him clean? No. *I* pay attention during job shadow, you hear?” She turned to a camera in the corner, raising her fist. “You hear?!”

“Carissa, please,” Kare whispered. She tried to convey her seriousness through her eyes. Carissa held up her hand, visibly annoyed.

“This is the third time you’ve done this, damnit. So now I turn off your speakers.”

“Carissa, wait!” Kare yelled, but her cries were muffled behind the glass.

 She struggled against the locks of her stasis pod as Carissa cleaned up. The girl hummed as she did so, skipping across the room, shutting down observation monitors and decommissioning her uploaded reality parameters. Then, almost absentmindedly, she said: “I put anesthetic in your IV, so you’ll be asleep soon. Lord knows you’ll need the rest. Tomorrow, we implant deeper in your cortex.”

With that she skipped across the hall. 

Before she left, though, she paused in the doorway. 

“I’m curious. How did you know this time?” 

She waited a beat. Then cackled out a laugh. “Here, let me turn your speakers on.”

Kare’s mind raced, searching for any advantage. This girl was a lost cause. So she was down to any crack in her pod’s plexiglass she could exploit. 

“Nobody knows about my sister,” Kare said, distracted. “Aside from those who’ve read my file.”

Carissa nodded. “ You won’t remember this--they wipe you in your sleep--but I like you. When I’m full-time I hope we can be friends.” 

She waited for a moment, but Kare only shot her a frown. Carissa sighed before gently closing the door. The heavy scrape of a deadbolt sounded soon after. 

The anesthetic flowing through Kare’s veins made her fingers clumsy. She felt the smooth surface of the glass, searching for some sort of catch, some purchase with which she might be able to carve escape. 

There was nothing.

Kare’s eyes drooped. A flush of dizziness overcame her. Tears began to well under her eyes. They tickled her cheeks as they flowed down. Kare’s coordination was thrown so off balance, instead of wiping them away, her hands grazed along the EMP earring Travish so painstakingly fashioned prior to the mission. 

The intern must have missed it during her safety sweep.

A sudden jolt of energy. One last gasp.

*’Vish you brilliant bastard,* she thought. Even the words in her mind sounded sleepy.  She had to act fast. 

If she detonated the charge now, the pod would surely open. But there’d be no preventing sleep. 

How, then, to remember? The girl said herself, they wiped Kare’s memory every night. She would wake in a fresh nightmare with no recollection of her salvation.

An idea struck her. 

Kare leaned forward and breathed on the plexiglass. Condensation bloomed. With great effort, she lifted her groggy fingers. In the resulting fog of her breath, she wrote:

*EMP. L lobe.*

 Before fading into darkness.

Apologies for the delay! Got caught up in building a bit of a backlog and outlining the next several parts. 

**I will be making this a scheduled release, every Friday afternoon**. I like the idea of making this story a serial of sorts. Plus it gives me added time to flesh sections out, as well as work on other prompts. Depending on holidays, a scattered few parts will be released over weekends this well (P5 should be sometime Sunday ;) )

I hope you are enjoying!

7gxwgp,31,2017-12-01,425 micrograms of LSD + 50mg 4-aco-met,PsilocinPsychosis,researchchemicals,https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/7gxwgp/425_micrograms_of_lsd_50mg_4acomet/,"This is going to be an interesting night. I'll write up a report when I can properly articulate what I experienced. The come up is hitting pretty fast and hard already. 

Oh boy, here we go again 🙃


Dosage: 425 micrograms of LSD in liquid form, ~50 mg of 4-Aco-met prior to dropping
Route: Sublingually, orally
Duration: 14 hours
Test Subject: 160lbs, male, 25 years of age

I would like to start off by saying what I chose to do yesterday was borderline reckless. It isn't smart to mix substances to this extent if you've never done it before. It's always smarter to take a little amount of each and see how you react, everyone's body chemistry is different. That being said, it was one of my favorite psychedelic experiences and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Let's get into this. 

T: 0:30 - 
Coming up fast and hard now. It's like an incredible body load that has me cold but warm at the same time. I'm laying in bed covered in blankets trying to adjust. But it's hard. And getting harder and harder as time goes by. The come up on Metacetin always feels so god damn nerve wracking until you hit the peak. Then it's smooth sailing. Blah. 

T: 1:00 -
It's been about an hour since injection of both substances. I decide to play some music, and take a dab. The dab as per always kicks the trip into hyper drive, sending me down a tunnel of geometric patterns and tribal writing. Everything at this point is OEV, tho the CEV are starting to form as well. 

T: 1:30 -
I'm utterly fucked up. I'm forgetting every few minutes where I am, who I am, what I am doing and how the hell I could've thought taking psychedelics would be ""fun"". It's getting all to be too much. I wish there was a switch to turn all the noise down just a couple tabs. I'm starting to feel anxiety, tho more then likely was caused by the dab. The visuals at this point are incredibly vivid. I can almost remember exactly what was happening. I was here, in reality briefly, then it felt as if the metacetin was sending me to this alien place. The rooms of my house weren't my house anymore, but rooms inside my subconscious. I was bouncing from room to room experiencing a different emotion with each new room I would enter. I remember my bathroom turning me into a 12 year old mentally and physically, but not me as a kid, something else completely. 

T: 2:00 -
I'm here, but I'm not. I'm alive, but not entirely. My ego is partially still intact, but it's being ripped to shreds as the trip goes on, and I'm fighting it, I want to remember exactly what is going on to be able to record it. Seems a little far fetched at this point. 

T: 3:00 - 
I feel fucking fantastic. I'm realizing things about myself that I didn't know were affecting me. I have a package stuck at customs that creeps its way into my mind. I push it away, and try going outside for a bit. This is where everything takes a turn. 

T: 3:30 -
The trees are breathing with me, I hear their every thought, I'm listening to them telepathically. They're telling me I should stop littering. I should appreciate the earth more. This makes me want to take a hike at a nearby steep hill. I'm outta my mind at this point, not making rational decisions at all, and I head out. I'm watching the trees swing back and forth, and the grass go from purple to green to orange. The sky is dark, but the clouds are so bright. They're creating faces of family members that passed away. I'm scared but comforted as if they're looking over me 

T: 4:30 -
I make it to the top of the steep hill overlooking the town I look in. Everything is silent. Not a peep from anything or anyone. I'm watching as I envision myself living inside one of the houses, going on my day to day life but in someone else's shoes. I go through these almost DMT like breakthrough experiences but I'm fully conscious. I'm not blacking out at all, I know what is happening. 

T: 5:30 -
I'm home now. Making it to the top of the hill felt like one my greatest accomplishments. I faced my fear of heights under the influence and somehow it made me feel better when it was over then I ever had before. I suffer with depression, pretty deeply. Have my whole life. I find ways to manage, and self medicate. But this whole experience was just exactly what I needed. The visuals in my bedroom are very tribal at this point, lots of warping, breathing, and things like still pictures are turning into major motion picture productions. 

T: 6:30 -
I try playing Player Unknown's Battlegrounds. I fail miserably, giggle, turn my PC off and start watching planet earth on Netflix. 

T: 8:00? - 
I lost track of some time. I remember thinking herds of Buffalo looked like synchronized swimmers and lions scared the shit out of me. The visuals are still strong, but it's mostly introspection at this point. I feel guilty for taking too much of both substances and frequently go through a worrisome loop of thought pattern. 

T: 10:00 -
I take a couple more dabs. I'm trying to sleep now. It's late, I'm tired and anything longer then 9 hours is just too much for me now a days. Mentally it's exhausting. God how I commend you people who take LSD. It's my favorite substance, but it's so mentally taxing. I didn't look at my phone once throughout my trip and that was a wonderful feeling to be so detached from everything. 

I came down about 4 hours after that completely back to baseline; and ended up falling asleep nearly 15 hours after ingestion. I realized thing about my life that I don't like. I hate working as a manager and having to delegate. My job has turned me into something I never wanted to be, and all for chumps change. I have a degree in Addiction Psychology, but have sat on it like a fool. I'm looking at a psychiatric hospital nearby for a possible job or an internship. I need a change, I keep telling myself that but it's time to get off my lazy ass and do something about it. I could bitch till my face goes red, or I could just do it (insert Shia LaBeouf meme). 

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I think this will be one of my last trips I will experience for a while. For some reason I don't even want to smoke weed today. I don't want to smoke cigarettes. I just feel over all substances. I want to get my shit together. Baby steps. 

Peace and love everyone"
7gy065,143,2017-12-01,The frozen account with a balance of $0,Deprox,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/7gy065/the_frozen_account_with_a_balance_of_0/,"A little bit of background: I'm a clerk in a civil court in Brazil. My job includes dealing with lawyers and parties who walk up to our counter, as well as dealing with all the stages of a lawsuit, such as summons, writs, requests and writing routine decisions and orders so my judge and/or supervisor reads and digitally signs them. Lawsuits here are mostly digital, and organized by file numbers, something like XXXXXXX-XX.YEAR.COURT NUMBER.

My court is located in the same building as a few other civil courts and the family courts, and the building next door houses a bank and the criminal courts. Sometimes we get a few stray people who were supposed to go to the family court, but got thwarted by the building's odd layout.

The parties in the story are as follows:

**Me**: A smiling, charming, upright and zealous clerk

**Inner me**: A very angry man who takes shit from no one

**Intern**: A smart 17 year old girl

**Shady Citizen**: A shady looking individual, with an angry demeanor and a faint smell of liquor

Today, as per usual, I was reading a petition and completely minding my business, when Intern comes to me with some *very* nasty looking pieces of folded paper and what seemed to be a bank statement.

**Intern**: That man says we frozen values on his bank account and he wants us to release it *now*.

**Me**: Excuse me?

**Intern**: He said the bank person told him we would release if he gave us these documents.

Now, that makes absolutely no sense. Everyone at the bank *knows* they need a written request directly from the judge to release a frozen account, and that clerks have no way of producing it. Also... Those were copies from *criminal* summons dated over 3 years ago.

**Inner me**: Here comes a good one.

**Me**: Did he give you his lawsuit number?

**Intern**: No, do you want me to go get it?

**Me**: Please do it.

Intern goes to the man and asks him the lawsuit number. He looks at me.

**Shady Citizen, in a very demanding tone**: So, did you release my account yet?

**Inner me**: I'm going to release my hand right into your face.

**Me**: No, because I don't have a lawsuit number. Without a lawsuit number, I'm going to need your SSN.

**Shady Citizen**: Who doesn't carry their SSN? I have it right here, take it to him!

Shady Citizen hands Intern another nasty looking pieces of paper, all of them completely unrelated, some worn down documents filled with holes and, finally his very worn down SSN. I type his SSN in our system's search engine and I find no civil suits. Instead, I find 10 criminal suits and 6 family suits against him. Most of them were finished, though, only one family suit (alimony) was still active at the Second Family Court, so I thought this *could* be the court which issued the freezing order...

Except that when I look at the bank statement, it reads as follows:

&gt;Savings: 0,00

&gt;Blocked value: 0,00

Now, having an account on that bank, I know exactly what that means. ""Blocked value"" means a payment was made and that value would be blocked for a few days before leaving your account. For example, if my statement showed ""Savings: 1000,00; blocked value: 600,00"", it would mean I can only use $400, because I paid $600 in something. It doesn't mean *at all* that a freezing is in place, and besides, he has nothing on his account. Were it frozen, the statement would show ""Frozen value: XX"". Both Intern and me realize it at the same time.

**Intern and Me**: His account isn't frozen at all!

She happily goes tell him that and I get back to reading that petition... Until I hear the man screaming.

**Shady Citizen**: IT IS FROZEN! CAN'T YOU SEE IT READS RIGHT HERE ""BLOCKED VALUE""? THEY ALREADY TOOK MY MONEY AND I! WANT! IT! BACK!

**Inner me**: Good GOD, can't you shut up for a second?

**Me, walking to the counter**: Sir, that's OK. There is no money in your acc--

**Shady Citizen**: THERE IS NO MONEY BECAUSE YOU TOOK IT FROM ME!

**Me**: No, sir, there is no money because your balance is zero. Did the bank tell you to come here?

**Shady Citizen, banging some pieces of paper at the counter**: THEY DID! DO YOU SEE THOSE PAPERS? IT SAYS IN THEM I HAD MORE THAN $50.000 *YESTERDAY* AND NOW I HAVE NOTHING!

Thinking no one at the bank would *ever* tell someone to come here for this, I look at the nasty looking pieces of paper the intern left at the counter before returning to her own work... And I see some handwritten numbers that add up to more than 50.000 and some company names who supposedly paid him that.

**Me**: Sir, if you're *sure* you had these values up to yesterday, your lawsuit is on the fami--

**Shady Citizen, pointing a company name at the piece of paper**: I WORKED FOR THE COMPANY THAT INSTALLED THE CAMERAS IN YOUR COURT AND YOU'RE BEING FILMED NOT BEING HELPFUL!!!!

There are no cameras in the place I work, only at the hearing room. At this point in time, I can only think of calling one of my supervisors, so look back and see my supervisor is not in the room (he was with the judge in her room), my second supervisor is also gone and my third supervisor is laughing her ass off in the archive. Some of the other clerks are looking at me and they're only missing the popcorn to look [like this](https://media.giphy.com/media/pUeXcg80cO8I8/giphy.gif).

**Me**: SIR! I'm trying to tell you that your lawsuit is on the family court, but you're not let--

**Shady Citizen**: I ALSO WORKED FOR A HELICOPTER COMPANY AND THEY'RE WATCHING YOU TOO!!!

**Inner me**: I'm fucking done here.

**Me, exhaling and speaking fast before he interrupts again**: Sir, this is the First Civil Court and you're looking for the Second Family Court on the ground floor. 

**Shady Citizen, looking at the sign that says ""First Civil Court""**: NO, I'M LOOKING FOR... Here. This... This court. I CAME HERE BEFORE.

**Me**: This time you want the Second Family Court, though.

**Shady Citizen, in a very condescending tone**: If you're not going to help me, why did you come talk to me at all?

**Me, shrugging**: Right you are, sir. Have a good afternoon.

I leave him muttering at the counter things like ""you don't know who you're talking to"" and ""I pay my taxes and that's how I'm treated"" for five minutes, up to the point when he folds his papers and documents and goes away, stomping and banging at the walls.

I looked at some of his criminal suits. Half of them were for tax evasion."

I wrote my House Rep and got this form letter as a response a few days later, but at least it's a positive. I'll be watching his vote closely whenever it comes. I'll probably call and write his office again once (if) the bill gets an actual voting date.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Dear TripleChubz:
 
&gt; Thank you for taking the time to share with me your strong support for our Second Amendment right to lawful gun ownership. Understanding your view on this important issue helps me better represent you and our fellow Mainers in the U.S. House of Representatives.
 
&gt; Having defeated a tyrannical government, our founding fathers understood firsthand that the well-being of a free society hinges upon the right to self-defense. Like you, I believe that it's critical to protect our heritage, freedom, and rights given to each American by the Constitution. When I was sworn in as a Member of Congress, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and I do not take that oath lightly.
 
&gt; As you may know, I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2015. This bill allows Mainers who have a valid concealed carry permit to cross state borders and have their permit be valid as long as that state allows concealed carry permits/licenses. Our law-abiding taxpayers should be able to defend themselves and their property as they travel the country.
 
&gt; As a member of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus, I will always fight to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States and will make sure our hard-working and law-abiding Mainers are able to exercise their Second Amendment rights.
 
&gt; If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Congressional Offices in Bangor, Lewiston, Presque Isle and Washington, D.C. I'm honored to represent you in Congress.
 
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; Bruce Poliquin

# Find Your Representatives

[You can find your representatives here.](https://whoismyrepresentative.com/) Call or email them and let them know you want to see H.R.38 passed. See my quick guide below if you're nervous or unsure about how to handle your communication.

&amp;nbsp;

# Brief Guide on Writing/Calling Representatives
When writing/calling your representative's office, you don't have to be super detailed. Keep in mind that most communications go through their intern staff. Don't be angry and threatening, just polite and matter-of-fact. They'll treat you with respect.

Example:

&gt; ""Hi there! I'm a voter in [such n' such district] and wanted to reach out and let Representative [name] know that I strongly H.R.38, the *Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017*. I am/am-not a concealed license holder and I think all Americans should enjoy the right to carry a firearm for self defense in any state.

&gt; Please also let Representative [name] know that I voted for/against them in the last election, and my support for them in the next election is contingent upon their support for pro-2nd Amendment bills, such as H.R.38.""

If you call, they'll thank you and wish you a good day. If you email, you'll likely get a form-letter back in a few weeks stating the representative's intentions/opinion and thanking you for writing to them. 

The representatives don't read all of these messages themselves. They get hundreds a day from various people wanting different things. Interns are the ones who go through them and mark them down in broad categories like ""[your name] supports H.R.38, is voter"" and they move on. They analyze the data coming in to give them a bead on their voter's wants/needs/opinions. 

In the end, they'll vote how they want based on information they have that we likely don't. No one in Washington is determining their votes purely off their constituent's opinions. Making your voice heard can sway them, though, so it's valuable to take the five minutes to make your opinion heard, even if your senator is completely on the other side of the aisle/issue.

What should I be expecting for an interview for this type of position? I have a bit of an IT background from my degree (CIS) + from my previous internship.

7gz0b3,5,2017-12-01,[US NY Area] Accepted an offer from Big 4 but received a counteroffer from my employer today. I need your advise!,lkh9596,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7gz0b3/us_ny_area_accepted_an_offer_from_big_4_but/,"Hello everyone,

I am currently a tax senior working in real estate industry at mid size firm for 3 years. But I got an offer from Big4 (NY office) and signed it today. And the reason why I am leaving my current firm is that my team is literally the worst performing team (and we have very small yet demanding clients) in this office and there is no career advancement. 
I did maintain good relationships with other people in the office and they tried to help me switch to their teams but it did not work out well. So I felt hopeless and demoralized recently and decided to jump ship. 

After I told my senior director and manager that I am leaving, they did not make the counteroffer and wished me good luck. And I had absolutely no regret that I was leaving. 
But few hours later, a senior managing director (equivalent to  partner at Big4) from the best performing team approached me and made a counteroffer. He will put me on his team and I will take on more responsibility as a experienced senior. He will also match my salary. 

And another thing is that this Big4 real estate tax group is infamous for brutal, long hours and insane workload. Everyone (interns, associates and seniors) I know who used to work there left within a year or two and hated working there. 

Should I accept this counteroffer or just move on like nothing happened?

7gz3c0,2,2017-12-01,I [25F] gave my sister [19F] advice for dealing with her depression and social isolation and now she's projecting her frustration onto me and acting out.,etherisedpatient,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gz3c0/i_25f_gave_my_sister_19f_advice_for_dealing_with/,"This story isn't one of my shining moments, but here goes. 

My sister (let's call her A) moved away to university last fall and had a really rough time in her first year. She was never very strong academically, and really struggled with her classes, and she was also living alone and off campus, so felt socially isolated. I went to university in the same city (an hour from home), and my other sister (let's call her B) is also a student there, so my family bought a house and she moved in there. Unfortunately, B was at home with my family when A went off to school for an internship, so when A moved away she was living alone for the first time, but also having to adjust to a new school, new social circle, and living *alone* in a strange new city. So I understood that she was having a hard time, and she was genuinely depressed while she was away. For context, she's a lovely, vivacious girl, and was popular in high school, and it's very out of character to be socially isolated. She planned to transfer to a school closer to home and sent in applications, but it would take time to hear back and because of her low grades it wasn't a guarantee, so she went back this fall. 

This time around, she's living with B who's back at school with her, which we thought would be a big help, but it seems she's still struggling socially and academically, and is very unhappy. However, I noticed that she hasn't taken any steps to try and improve her situation -- she comes home every weekend to see her friends back home, hasn't put herself out there socially at school by joining groups or teams, and still largely keeps to herself. 

The last time she was home, the issue came up again, and she went to see a doctor about getting a note to excuse her for a test. He asked about her academic anxiety and her social situation, and asked her if she was sad and if she had any friends. She replied no, and burst into tears. 

I approached her later and suggested that she find a part-time job near her school, which I thought from personal experience would be a big help. When I was at university I was in a similar situation, having been socially isolated myself, in addition to going through a really nasty breakup and dealing with academic pressure applying to graduate programs. Having a job was great for me because it gave me a sense of purpose, was a productive use of time, and put me out there socially, and I made a lot of new friends in the area. 

She refused, saying she had no desire to stay 'in that hell hole' over the Christmas holidays. I asked her why she thought the city was a hell hole, saying that we know she hates it but that she's never told us what about it makes her so unhappy. She immediately lashed out me and accused me of being insensitive and said that she didn't need to explain herself to me. She threw a big temper tantrum, and stormed out, leaving for school. Over the past few days she's been ignoring my messages and sending me passive aggressive memes, until I noticed that she unfollowed me from Instagram. This is her usual MO when she's mad at someone, and I only happened to notice by chance, so I confronted her about it and she ignored me *again*. 

In the interest of full disclosure, I lost my temper and snapped and unfollowed her back and unfriended her from Facebook for good measure. Admittedly, not a mature thing to do, but given that I've dealt with this numerous times before, I really didn't have the patience for it anymore. I was fed up having her blame me for being insensitive, which I don't think I was -- I was only trying to help with my suggestion, and I asked what I asked because I wanted to understand. I have a history of being direct and insensitive, so I'm resentful that she's throwing that in my face and putting the blame on my shoulders. So I did what I did because I wanted to give her a taste of her own medicine, knowing that she did what she did to passive aggressively get my attention. 

I know that she's in a tough place and I don't want to see her miserable, but I also have a very low tolerance for childish behaviour and I don't appreciate being treated badly. I'm torn between letting her stew because she behaved badly, steamrolling over her shitty behaviour and coming in and coddling her, and confronting her and giving her the tough love that she (imo) needs. My family also isn't of much help, since she's living with B and B is self-involved and hasn't been helpful thus far; my dad doesn't take mental health seriously; and my mother just coddles her and isn't really doing anything about this. 

I don't think she should be coddled because she needs to learn how to deal with her own problems instead of being babied, but she's used to being babied and won't respond well to tough love, especially given how long this has been going on and her continued reluctance to deal with it. Letting her stew isn't exactly productive either. So what do I do?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My sister has been depressed and socially isolated at university and when I gave her a suggestion that might help her situation she lashed out at me and has been passive aggressive towards me ever since. How do I handle this?"
7gzgtd,6,2017-12-01,Did I throw away an amazing opportunity by going to the University of Arizona?,AZWA_Throwaway,UofArizona,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofArizona/comments/7gzgtd/did_i_throw_away_an_amazing_opportunity_by_going/,"Some Background:
From the 2nd-10th grade I lived in Arizona. As such, I grew up wanting to go to the University of Arizona (UA). After 10th grade,  I moved to Washington (for parental employment reasons), and for the first time I was forced to consider other institutions. Very quickly it became obvious that the UW was the best choice, academically. Come senior year, I ended up applying to and getting accepted into both.

I really want to work in a field related to space, mainly Aerospace Engineering or Astronomy/Astrophysics, so I ended up going to UA (CS Major) because it's the official partner of NASA and because majority of my friends were there, but due to an unfortunate series of events, I was ostracized by all but 1. 

Now it feels like I was always just lying to myself about the potential benefits of attending for NASA reasons and it was always just because I wanted to be with my ""friends"". I'm realizing that besides the partnership with NASA, UA is academically a weaker school, and UW may have been a better option for CS if I can't get a programming job related to space, in terms of education and potential internships.- I mean, it's in Seattle.

To boil it down to a question: Did I throw away the opportunity to go to one of the most prestigious Universities in the world by choosing friends over academics? 

I know that UA is still a great institution, but even my professor who used to teach at and attended UW thinks that it's a better school."

I graduated with a pretty good GPA, then got a job at a telecommunications company where I only made about 28k per year as a bottom of the barrel, entry level project manager.

I spent eight months there until I was offered a job doing legal research for a real estate law firm where I was making nearly 40k per year...it only lasted for 4 months until I got fired for a number of reasons. My anxiety, poor communication at work, and the fact that people weren't buying houses in my area led to me losing my job.

It's been three months. I temped at a warehouse for two months, but I'm finally back on my feet working for the state at my DHHR as a youth service worker. Once I finish training, I'll be making around 29k per year, only slightly more than I made at the telecom place...

I'm happy that I'm on track now, but upset about the path I've taken in life. I always wanted to help people for a living and I've finally gotten the chance to do so. But the path I took to get here, and the things that I could have done better are haunting me. That, and all of the people my age and older who are saying that my degree is worthless, and that I should have gone to trade school...hey, my parents strongly encouraged me to go to college..I was on track to enlist in the military until my parents threw a fit :\

Things aren't all bad. I'm medicated now. I manage my issues much better. I live on my own. But, I'm worried about the future. It'll take over a year until I get a chance at a raise. It'll take four years until I can become a licensed social worker, and two years until I'm offered any tuition reimbursement. I plan on going back to school. But man...right now, I still feel like I'm in the pits. I'm okay, I'm taking it day by day, but this is the worst depressive episode I've had since I lost my job in September. I could really use whatever words you guys have right now."
7gzvem,1,2017-12-01,Don't know where I am going in life. Need advice.,Umwhatsthatoverthere,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7gzvem/dont_know_where_i_am_going_in_life_need_advice/,"The title says most of it. I honestly don't know or have much motivation for anything anymore and it's terrifying.

I am 22 years old, I graduated college last year with a psych degree and I currently do not have a job. I didn't get any internships or network during college. I do not have a job because i am too afraid to even look for one in the first place.

I did work during college at a retail job for 4 months during my sophomore year. However, due to my grades dropping, family issues, and losing my scholarship because of my gpa, i decided to quit my job and went back to focusing on my school work and grades for the possibility of going to grad school. 

I never tried to get another job during college, because i was afraid the same thing was going to happen again.

Grad school didn't happen because i burned myself out with school work my last year of college and not only that i scared myself out from even trying to apply to one simply because i felt I wasn't good enough for it.

During college, i started to develop really bad anxiety out of nowhere and it just got worse and worse as time went by. I cut myself off from a lot of my friends due to me being embarrassed about my situation and now i only have about 3 people that i still talk to.

My life is run by fear and anxiety. I don't know what to do about it. Things that used to interest me like art or other creative things, I don't even practice it anymore and that makes me even more depressed. 

I am not too sure about what is going on with me but i feel like such a failure and at the same time i lost the will to do a lot of things.

Most of what is going on and the currently situation that i am in right now is due to my own doing. That is something that i do not deny at all. I don't blame anyone else for my position except for my own self.

I really have no idea how to deal with my own self. I have place myself in this circle of misery that i am having a very hard time trying to get out. :("
7h06ns,6,2017-12-01,"Me [20 F] with my boyfriend [20 M] of five years, he's feeling career-related pressure from me",Swarelle,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7h06ns/me_20_f_with_my_boyfriend_20_m_of_five_years_hes/,"My boyfriend and I are both in our junior year of college right now and studying Computer Science (CS). We started going out in high school and have been in a long distance relationship since college began. Yesterday was actually our fifth year anniversary!

While we both started on CS in college, I took my first CS course in my freshman year and him in his sophomore year. We both started applying for internships for summer 2018 since the beginning of this semester and are trying to find internships in the same city (since we are in a long distance relationship, we'd like to be together during summer break).

Since then, I've gotten many interviewing opportunities and several good offers, but he hasn't received any good news. He's feeling very pressured by this state of things because he wishes to do well -- as well as me and even better, in terms of the internship company's reputations, impact, and offer terms -- but the stream of rejections has gotten him very disheartened and insecure, and he tells me he feels useless.

We've experienced something similar in high school. We went to a high school that puts a strong emphasis on GPA and ranking, where I was consistently ranked first in the grade while he hovered around top 15. At the time, he was also hurt and insecure whenever he got a lower grade or ranking than me, though I never gloated or indicated that it mattered to me whose grades are better. We were even younger then and didn't know how to have a good relationship, so there would be times when he would only give me one-word responses and shut me out when I tried to get him to tell me about why he's so upset -- he denied that it was the grades/ranking at the moment, but later in college told me that that was entirely it.

Back to the current situation in college -- we've made a plan for him together, where we found more opportunities for him to apply for and set up times to practice technical interviews together since I have more interviewing experience than he does. Those plans take time, though, and the problem is that every day he feels that he gets trampled on by the people all around him (including me and other CS majors at his school) who are ""succeeding"" when he has only gotten rejections from everything he's applied to. Sometimes it gets really bad and he would break down into tears and it just hurts to hear him so brokenhearted when I can't even hug him since we're so far apart.

I've asked him to talk to his school's counseling and psychological services, to talk his feelings out to someone less involved and more professional. He's agreed and set up a meeting for mid-December (the earliest availability they have), but the issue right now is that these lows happen every day, e.g. when he sees some underclassman demonstrating an amazing technical project or hears me mention an exciting aspect I found out about the company that extended an offer to me.

I asked him if I should just stop talking to him about internship-related things, but he says it would hurt him to know that I'm keeping things from him and that we can't speak openly with each other.

How can I best support him in this kind of situation? I full-heartedly believe in him and think that he will have an amazing opportunity, it's just that he needs to be patient and stay strong since nothing can change overnight. I don't want to seem condescending to him because I already have offers that I'm really happy about, but I also wish there was some way I can support him more than just telling him again and again that I believe in him and that everything will be okay. 

Have you been in a situation like this, when someone you love is in an emotional/vocational ""low"" and you're doing better than they are? What did you do to encourage and help them? 
 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend (long distance relationship) feels pressured and insecure because he hasn't received any good news for internships and he's struggling with school work, while I have several internship offers - how can I best support him beyond just listening to him and telling him I believe in him?"
7h0dp8,1,2017-12-01,How to followup after Amazon online assessment,alwaysgreenface,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/7h0dp8/how_to_followup_after_amazon_online_assessment/,"I've finished the online assessment with Amazon for their SDE intern position. The next step is a final phone interview. There were two coding questions. I missed 1 test case for one of the coding questions (out of 24) but other passed all the test cases for the other coding question, which made me feel that I did well. How long should I expect to hear back? I'm only asking because it's been 6 days since I've taken the assessment and I have another offer pending.

Also, it seems that I don't have a recruiter to contact to expedite things. The only contact that I've gotten is the sde-intern-assessment [at] amazon.com email contact? Can I try to use that?"

7h1i4j,0,2017-12-02,"My girlfriend (22) of 2 years and I (23) are going on a break, because we rushed living together.. can we make it?",patrick20cool,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7h1i4j/my_girlfriend_22_of_2_years_and_i_23_are_going_on/,"My girlfriend and I meet each other at a summer camp in America. It was a love story you just can’t make up. We just connected straight away and we were like peas in a pod ever since. 

She lived in England and I lived in Ireland, so we gave the long distance a shot. We made monthly visits, using our student loans to have this ability to go back and forth. It had been pretty equal and fair. I was in my final year of uni and she was doing a fast track where she does placement and first year in one year. So she chose to move to Dublin thinking it would kill the distance, but I was still 5 hours away making it that much tougher. 

She lasted 3/6 months on placement. The hotel she worked at were horrible to the staff, so she made a stand walking out and she ended up doing placement at home. So I graduated that July and I left my job to spend that August with her. I was with her for a month and again we were inseparable. Whenever the month was over I was back 2 weeks later for her cousins wedding and we had a good catch up weekend. Because I had no other commitments back home, she wondered why I kept leaving?

That’s when a problem for us began.

We talked about me moving to be with her for her final year, and that would be great. But I wanted to get my drivers license first, so all my money was put into driving. She argued why not learn here in England? It would be the same, but I wanted to have it before so it wouldn’t be an issue for me there. This had gone on for months. 

Conveniently I had been doing really well in my driving in November time and passed my theory part, my girlfriend agreed to come to Ireland for NYE for me especially if I was moving to England in the next year. Her sister had broken up with her fiancée that month, meaning she’d be alone with her parents for NYE, my GF then told me that she couldn’t go to NYE with me because of that. I was annoyed and upset because I was really excited about this idea. I told her Mum the news and her Mum told her to go off an enjoy herself. So back to plans! 

Before Christmas last year, she had been to Italy with her friend, then Christmas was busy and I think it was Boxing Day and I hadn’t really heard much from her since before her trip. So I was annoyed because we’d usually have Skype dates and text throughout the day but she just hadn’t checked in with me. When I got her she said she would tell me everything when she got to me when she got there, and I just wanted to get a conversation from her. 

She then told me that she didn’t want to come, and that she felt forced. And she didn’t have a good vibe about going. This broke me because my girlfriend didn’t want to be there. We argued and fought when she was there, but it was because I was selfish and wanted to stick to a plan rather than let her spend time with her sister. But had I not seen her then, I dunno when I would have. And I had her being unenthusiastic while she was there, but she come around and enjoyed herself and she apologized for acting selfish.

We celebrated an amazing valentines weekend together, basically making up and fixing the heartache we caused last time. After I left same issue, why can’t I just stay? Again a driving lesson. But she gave it to me straight, that she wouldn’t be able to see me until my birthday in May, because I didn’t have a job after getting let go from one after Christmas and she was renting a stupid expensive place for Uni. And pushed for me to make the move, but I was genuinely scared. Because it meant giving up my life, friends, family and my comforts for her.

At the end of the month I said fuck it, and took a leap of faith and moved in with her and ended the distance! We were so happy and it was a big chance for both of us. The agreement was, I move in with her, rent free (I did offer). Get a job, get on my feet, get my own place and then we do the normal couple thing where we see each other several times a week. So that’s what we did, I got on my feet, saved up the money to move out. But as it was April/May, she needed to find a new place too. So I pushed for us to continue living together because we had been loving it so far and why should it end, it would be cheaper too if we shared a room. 

We started renting a place together with 2 of her uni friends and it was a really proud moment for me. Move to a new country, get a job, paying bills on time, seeing my girlfriend everyday, it was amazing! 

So the flatmates didn’t move in until September time, so that kind of changed our dynamic. But we still tried to make time for us. 

I was working in a bar 30-40 hours a week, I got myself an internship 2 days a week and that was pretty much my week, my days off were usually playing video games, spending time with the GF or practicing my craft. She has a tendency to take on way too much. She has Uni 3 days a week, retail work 20-30 hours a week, French 1 day, Jujitsu 2 nights a week, an environment scheme and she co-lead a society too. While balancing spending time with me and our flat mates.

It started to bug me whenever I got in or seen her she always had goofy and more fun with the flat mates but whenever we went to bed she’d came down and just want to go to sleep. Which I mean I didn’t mind. But we were still making an effort. 

So two weeks ago, I had a really bad weekend at work, anxiety and people screwing me over and I just needed support and sympathy from my GF especially since I hadn’t seen her all weekend with our schedules. 

Again, once I get in from my internship, she was goofing with the flat mates and was distant and didn’t jump to ask me what was up. She eventually came in and asked, I told her everything but instead of making an effort to make me feel better she said shes got to go to Jujitsu. But goofed off again with the flat mates. This bothered me so instead of sulking I tried joining, but she wasn’t giving me hugs or anything and said she’d see me later. So I let it slide for the time being. But when she got in she made more effort with their pet hamster (another story) than me and I got ticked off.

I told her, I felt under appreciated about this because I hadn’t seen her and I’m not getting my fair share of her attention. I know she has a lot going on, but a little effort to check on me is all I ask. She said I was needy and that I’m not nearly as busy as she is. She said she’s exhausted all the time and just needs space from me sometimes. To which I said we hardly see each other how doesn’t she get space. So instead of resolving it before bed, she went to sleep on it. I vent/ranted to our flat mate. She said tell her everything.

Next day, did just that. We had a back and forth, I said she prioritizes everything above me, and hasn’t made the effort as much. She got defensive about how busy she is again compared to me, she feels responsible for me here, that if anything happened to me it’s on her. She feels as if I don’t do much with myself besides work-intern-play games-watch YouTube. Like I’m not at uni, i haven’t joined a club because with bar work, you can’t really plan your week, so it’s harder for me to meet people. The only friends I have are work friends who I see all week anyways. I just like to dedicate some free time for me, doing what I like and seeing her when I can. She said the qualities she used to find endearing, they bother her now, and that we rushed into moving in too fast. She feels like all of these doubts are making her afraid of the future, I said why don’t you talk to me? She said because of how sensitive and sulky I get if she tells me off. She also said I don’t challenge her to do more or become better, although I encourage her and ask about everything, she wants to be inspired by what I do and things that I accomplish. As a practicing Graphic designer, my feats are small almost not noticeable.

So we didn’t solve the situation, we just laid our cards on the table. So then she said I need to study my French and I’m like seriously? Isn’t this more important? She said she had an exam. So I left her to go study, because where would fighting more get me? 

I usually tend to avoid arguments because of these situations. I don’t do confrontation well, my mind goes blank. Our flat mate asked how it went and I said not well and told her what happened, she told me to go back in and tell her off for doing what I complained about. Again, knowing well that it would only get me in more shit, I told her off, she got annoyed at me and continued studying. So I went out for a walk because I couldn’t do anything more.

When I got back she told me things are getting difficult and we needed space. Meaning she was going to sleep in with a flat mate and I was in bed alone. And she was going home for her birthday weekend and I wasn’t coming despite booking it off work for her. People told me not to sulk and go somewhere too, so I visited my cousin in Wales. I talked it through with him and basically thought maybe taking a step backwards and moving out would help. 

So when I seen her this Monday, she was upset and distant. She told me that we’re not the same anymore and we’re just out of sync. We rushed in too quick and as a result she doesn’t want to resent me. I offered to move out after Christmas. We talked some more and she said she is having a difficult time and doesn’t know where her heads at. We need time apart to figure out how to step forward. As much as we didn’t want it to come to this, and to help save our relationship, I said I’m moving back home so she can have all the space she needs. It sounds very rash but at the time we were both in tears and I didn’t want to even suggest it. The space is time for me to work on myself and her to work on herself.

I want to try and get that spark back, and if the distance gets that back then that’s what we gotta do. I requested for the last few days that we talk about the better times and memories and remember what we’re trying to save, and we can stay in the same bed again. She agreed and we cried, laughed, remembered, talked and through it all we still believe that this break that we’re taking is not the end of us. I also said when she wants things to start again, she has to come to Ireland to get me.

She’s blaming herself for everything, she’s worried that she ruined us, but I’m trying to convince her that it was a mutual decision and it will save us. Time will fix us. We know that this isn’t the end!

So now I’m about to board my flight home. Details might have got lost, it’s the full story. I hope I didn’t paint a bad picture of her, she really is a lot more special and generous than what I’ve said. So basically I’m asking if this space will work? It’s very tough love and my hearts broken, but I want to assured that my heart is in the right place! 

And please be gentle! Sorry for the long post!! "
7h29hx,7,2017-12-02,I've got so many skeletons in my closet I don't know what to do with myself.,128919820,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7h29hx/ive_got_so_many_skeletons_in_my_closet_i_dont/,"This will be fairly long, and I haven't told anyone about this so bear with me.

There have been things I've done in the past which I've regretted, and I feel like this will overshadow my entire life.

I'm studying engineering at a good university, but I've taken nearly 8 years to finish a course which should have only taken 5.
The reasons are as follows:

I had a psychotic episode when I was 20 years old. This was brought about by mostly smoking pot, which I started when I was 17. There were a bunch of other reasons which were just bubbling along which I will go into now:

When I was 18 I went to a friend's 21st and then when the night ended, for no real reason behind it, I went to a see prostitute. We didn't have intercourse.

When I was 19 I started seeing a woman that was more than twice as old as me, as kind of a friends with benefits thing. It just kind of fizzled out.

At the beginning of last year, I came home after a bit of a night out and my parents were angry at me for staying out longer than usual. For some dumb reason, I cut my arms up pretty bad. I have scars all up and down my arms which I feel self conscious about.
-When I was 22, I had a manic episode - which I feel was brought about by me getting into spirituality. This was followed by a brief depressive period, but I'm feeling better now.

-I don't have a job (like a proper job). I've had several part-time jobs but I haven't gotten an internship at an engineering firm like I'm supposed to have gotten as a part of the requirement for my degree. This may be because of my below average marks, and the marks are low because I don't really apply myself. It has improved somewhat however, I'm doing honors next year, and this year I got pretty good grades.

The relationship with my parents and family has completely changed as a result of my fuck-ups. When I got unwell (psychosis) I told my parents everything. They don't really trust me and are much more controlling. They always tell me to pray and to believe in God, but I just don't and I can't see myself ever being a believer.

I don't have many good friends. It feels like I'm just going through the motions right now.

I've never had a girlfriend. My parents after my psychosis completely cut all my friends out of my life and then a year after my episode sent me overseas for a year to work.

I see a clinical psychologist weekly to help me. She is the only other person aside from my parents and grandparents that knows.
What I'm trying to get at is that ... I've done all these things. It's constantly in the back of my mind. And my parents (they're good people...) keep bringing this up.

My parents say that when I get married or begin a relationship that I will have to tell the person all these things I've done.
Despite all this I continue to get up in the morning and feel thankful for all I have in my life and the people I have that support me and love me.

I've had discussions with my parents where they've said they've forgiven me for my transgressions but they do say what I've done is sinful and an affront to God. I think this is also because at one point in time I was a bit 'experimental' with my sexuality and did things with guys. My parents know about this too.

I still feel positive about the future. I'm somewhat happy. But my parents are still kind of 'living in the past'. My dad thinks I have a bad character. My mother tells me he sometimes cries over the fact that he used to beat me as a kid (sometimes) and feels partly responsible for the state I'm in. I don't blame him at all.

I guess I'm bringing all this up now because I was having a chat with my mother and she said ... 'you'll have to tell (the girl I'm seeing) eventually'.

To add to this my dad hasn't had the easiest time either. He has been on/off employed for the past 5 years. He lost his job recently due to redundancy and my mum especially has the view that 'children should be support for their parents'. As in once a child has grown up he/she should be a 'good' member of society and should be earning and capable of supporting a family and helping others in need.

My mother keeps saying I can't tell 'right from wrong'. I always compare myself to the people around me, and realize I've gone off the 'right track'. I keep thinking, 'when will things get better?'. No one calls me, no one texts me, no one asks me how I'm doing or how my day has been (aside from this girl I've gotten to know over the past year, and my psychologist).

Again to reiterate, I'm not looking for sympathy because this is all my doing. I'm not 'unhappy' but I'm not 'happy' either. I realize that life is what you make it but the date with this girl has me anxious and scared.

What will people think if they know the truth about me? I feel like I'm a liar and a thief, and to a degree I am. I feel like I can never get close to anyone because they will judge me.

TL;DR - I've done things in my past that have taken a toll on me. How do I move forward and stay positive. How do I make life better? How/when do I tell people about my fuckups. Do I need to tell them at all?

Thanks for reading."

7h39oe,1,2017-12-02,Supervisor Feedback,emmsgirl23,internship,https://www.reddit.com/r/internship/comments/7h39oe/supervisor_feedback/,Ok so I am a master's student and I am coming to a close of being in my first semester of my internship. I have a strong desire to be Academic Advising in a community college which is exactly what my internship is for me. So here is what happened. I was accidentally late a couple of times which I know is obviously not a good thing to do as it will make me look unreliable. One time it happened I was 3 minutes late and I was supposed to have a meeting with a student which I obviously felt terrible about. But now I have made a new goal for myself moving forward where I am showing up every time 5 minutes early which has been feeling good that I'm making this change and it gives myself time to not feel rushed I just got in the bad habit and my boss talked to me about it. I just still feel terrible about it. My supervisor gave me feedback and she's all about comfort level and she says she thinks I'm not ready to take my own appointments with students also because she saw some of my sessions where I accidentally told the student the wrong answer for different classes that they should take. I know that I am not necessarily ready for myself either. But this feedback has been racking my brain ever since and I have been feeling bad about myself lately. How do I start feeling better again I know being late was a simple bad mistake and I am changing that ASAP. It will never happen again. I understand if she feels that I am not quite ready she wants me to do more shadowing and I will be working on special projects instead that she said will both be really good for me. Now that I am making changes that will be better I know that I probably have a bad reflection of myself to her but how do I stop thinking about it and making myself feel bad for my mistakes? I feel grateful for the opportunity she is still giving me and she told me she thinks I'm a really good person but I just feel so bad to myself and I want to start feeling better. How do I do this when will it happen and am I being too hard on myself? How do I regain her trust in me I obviously want to be the best and have a great experience and I want her to think highly of me. I feel ashamed though and I can't get over it. But I know that I am in the right place otherwise she wouldn't still give me second chance. 
7h3hk3,29,2017-12-02,How NC Saved My Life [TW: thoughts of suicide],spellbound_sphinx,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7h3hk3/how_nc_saved_my_life_tw_thoughts_of_suicide/,"The realization that I was raised in a narc nest came at the urgency to save my own life. A timing that I am sure many acon can relate to.





I have been suicidal three times in my life. I have had depression most of my life, with anxiety and disordered eating almost the entire time, but the full on planning-my-exit-from-earth no-will-to-live suicidal times are unforgettable. My therapist of three years diagnosed me something along the lines of major depression minor, which I understood to mean that symptoms of depression spike and become dangerous in relation to my environment/relationships. In other words, I can live a happy existence, as long as I ensure to surround myself with a positive, respectful, and supportive home and work life/relationships. However, to be in an environment or situation which is toxic, can actually trigger extreme depression to the point of being suicidal. (I am sure you all see where I am going with this…)





**First suicidal time in my life, or How I found support in community:**
I lived at college during my undergraduate career, less than an hour from where family of origin lives. Over the summer my friends and roommates would all go home, and I would be stuck in a boring deserted college town. So instead I decided to work for my aunt, who also lived in my hometown, to make money and keep busy. I would live at the narc nest on those summer days which includes Nmom Nsis Nbro and GC, and Edad. I had no knowledge of narcissists, and no awareness about depression. I thought my family loved me, a love I had subconsciously built on the fact that I was a people pleaser. So when I realized that I was not heterosexual, and not even close, I was shook. It was classic closeted internalized homophobia and shame. Shame that spewed from my brain to my heart to my stomach until I was so wrought with guilt I would literally throw up. But this is a story about narcissism, and not about the struggles of the queer community to find acceptance in themselves and in the world. So here I am, young and poor, working for my extended family while living in narc nest of bio family. I have depression, which I am unaware of at the time. I have built my self worth on the idea that my family accepts me, because I am the heterosexual, smart, overachieving, kind, athletic, people pleaser person that I am. I have no gay friends. Realizing I am gay and fearing that my family will never accept me, I am ashamed of myself, and at the end of 2 months summer vacation have began making plans to kill myself.





In hindsight I know now that all of the shame, depression, and suicidal thoughts I experienced upon coming out, although typical, were not necessarily the norm for lgbt people. After the summer and back at college, I dove into the queer community. My suicidal thoughts, and eventually depression, subsided. I made queer friends, I read the material, I went to the clubs and events and centers, I got the social media apps, I watched the L word weekly. I met my first partner, and fell in real love for the first time in my life. I learned that being queer and coming out could be the most magical, beautiful, wonderful experience. I learned that the community there would accept me, understand me, support me, and come to love me more than my own family ever could. And that’s the kicker. Why was my coming out so terrifying, so alienating and disorienting just a few month before? Why was I considering killing myself when met with the realization that I was queer, and why did it take me so fucking long to come out in the first place? Can you guess, friends? Can you guess?





I have nothing specific to say about the narc family at this time in my life. The homophobia I experienced while coming out and living at home was pervasive, insidious, and covert. It went on to wear away at my sense of self until I considered ending my life, thinking that nfamily could never accept me. I had wrongfully assumed at the time that my struggles were typical, and purely and only related to my coming out. I did not know that the natural timing of leaving that bio family to return to college after the summer saved me. That the queer community, by purely accepting me like nfamily wouldn’t, saved me. Queer people who hate themselves don't do it for no reason. We are taught to. Often, by the very people who are supposed to love us unconditionally.





**Suicidal time in my life number two, or How I got my ass to a therapist:**
In college my first ever partner-of-the-same-sex cheated on me after a year and a half of being together. And in the most horrible movie cliche way - I walked in on them sleeping with our roommate. Oh, they were also not sorry. Somehow it was my fault. You’d think that would do it, right? Be enough to make a person with depression want to die? But no, you know this is a story about narcissists, and you know that this tragic beginning is only a setup to a story that gets much worse. Please remember my family’s lack of acceptance regarding my sexuality as an underlying ongoing sentiment throughout the following recollection.





I moved home, not knowing I would have probably been better off staying with the cheater and sleazy roommate. I graduated a few weeks after, and spent the summer completely heartbroken, jobless, classless and listless. Eating disorder and depression picked up, and pretty soon I was staying in bed and not eating for days at a time. This is while living in the nfamily nest with 4 other humans. I just want to reiterate that. That while I was unable to leave my bed, or my bedroom, and unable to eat for days on end, that both of my parents and both of my siblings watched and let this continue. For months. Without intervention or concern. In fact, they continued to treat me as if everything was completely normal, and would do typical narc things like complain to me about their lives or make selfish requests of me that I was unable to do. Oh, and blame, guilt, and shame. More than that, I started dating an old friend who at the time was the only one who would bring me food, could sometimes get me to eat, or shower, and go outside in the yard. Well, Nfamily banned them from coming over. To this day I was never given a reason as to why, but while I was slowly dying the only person trying to keep me alive was told by nfamily to never come back. After they did that, I tried to kill myself three times. Actually it might have been more I can’t remember. I survived by realizing I needed help, asking them for a therapist (had no money and never been to one before), and when they ignored me (shocker), I had my parnter at the time find me one. I want to emphasize the REALIZE I needed help part, as my nfamily had entirely normalized and simultaneously denied the depression and eating disorder I was experiencing. I started going to therapy for the first time in my life despite them and had my therapist charge my parents. During this time, I discovered Nmom and Nsis had been reading my diary, and had been using it to manipulate me (yet were still somehow unconcerned about my mental state?). Enraged (thanks depression for this symptom that made me move my ass finally!) I put my shit in a duffle bag and moved into my partner’s bedroom in their mom’s house for six weeks while I secured a job and saved up enough to get my own studio. Then I applied to grad school and moved out of my hometown to get certificated for my career. With therapy I began to manage depression, and after moving out of narc nest my mood stabilized. 





**Suicidal time in my life number three, or How I decide to go NC:**
    I was finishing up working full time on intern wages at a place that was an hour commute from my home, while I was simultaneously going to graduate school full time on financial aid. It was definitely the hardest I had worked in my entire life, in every sense of the word. And I went to private school for 12 years and graduated from a UC in 4, and had started working at 13; I was no stranger to hard work. I attempted expressing this to family of origin constantly. I was met with...I want to say zero sympathy, but I think the term could better be described as negative sympathy. Not only did no one care to acknowledge/ listen to my struggles or wish me encouragement, if I attempted to express any difficulty I was having the conversation was immediately switched. And I mean whiplash immediately switched. Compounded on the struggle of you know, grad school, and you know, being poor not having living wages, working extreme hours in impoverished area an hour commute from my house - I also spent the past two years getting released from that work contract due to harassment from Nboss, while also simultaneously getting a restraining order from Nex (who tried to run me over with their car, several times, while I was on foot and in vehicle). Did I mention this ex worked and went to school where I did, and that they were friends with the Nboss? 





To say I had nothing left is an understatement. I was demolished. And yet here I was, coming up on meeting all of my graduation requirements, in the midst of getting released from work to find a better job, and almost free from my abusive ex. Vacillating between feeling run-down and worthless and finding the strength to go on, I thought maybe nfamily celebrating my accomplishments would help me keep going. It was getting really close to graduation time, and not hearing anything from parents about the subject, I asked them if we would be doing anything for the event. Short answer: no. Actually, a short answer is all I pretty much got. I asked in a few different ways, even mentioned I did not want anything big at all, just to get together for graduation. More silence, more short succinct no, more lack of explanation. Ok...I thought this is really weird. My family never was supportive, but apparently I never noticed. Or maybe now that I am older they just care less about hiding it or I am smarter at seeing it. 





Graduation time approaches, and my mom contacts me to come over, and to bring my new (amazing) partner. I naively think that the whole lack of excitement about finishing grad school was a ploy for some sort of low key surprise graduation party. Haha. We arrive, and I am waiting. Waiting for nothing. I see some presents on the kitchen table. They are for my partner, who had a birthday a few weeks earlier. I sit and watch my partner open presents from Nfamily, while my partner nervously and awkwardly shoots me looks in between feigning thankfulness, fully aware of how bizarre this situation is. I choke on my astonishment and say nothing. Next, nparents inform me they are selling their house to move to, you guessed it, the city where I live. A city which they have had zero interest in previously, let alone cared to move or sell their house for. I express discontent immediately. I straight up tell them - then I am moving somewhere else, and how I do not want to live in the same city as them. They used the age old tactic of my family when I express a boundary or concern: IGNORE IT. Nfamily had piled a bunch of useless junk from around the house, and wanted me to take it off their hands since they are now cleaning out the house for selling. Oh, and they wanted to know if I would be coming to their house for my cousin’s graduation party they were throwing her, because she was finishing high school. I declined the invitation and the useless junk, and left. 





I was devastated in a way that only my family knew how to make me feel. I cried the kind of cries that physically hurt you, the deep, gutted sobs and twisted intestine cries, the cries of a child realizing their family does not love them. More than does not love: does not care. I think you can have ambivalent love towards family, and still care about their well being, still want them to be okay. In the peak of my accomplishments through the depths of my deepest struggles: my family did not care. They did not care if I became president. They did not care if I jumped off a cliff. No matter the success, no matter the hardship, my family would give absolutely zero shits. 





This hit me hard, and I struggled with staying alive. My thoughts were looping: what kind of worthless person did I have to be for my own mother, my own parents, my own family to not care about me? I had thought finishing grad school would earn me their acceptance, since in my mind I lost it when I came out. I was placing so much of my value and worth on their external validation, and not receiving ANY of it, I was finding it hard to go on. I got the message from them that I was completely disposable and worthless, and I became suicidal. Despite being suicidal, however, this time something was different. I was living on my own, just started my dream career, had an amazing partner who was incredibly respectful and supportive, a house which I loved, and four rescue animals we were raising. I didn’t actually want to die. 

By my therapist, partner, one best friend, and the grace of god, I survived. I realized in the subsequent months that nfamily's behavior to me was not only hurtful, it was disordered, even toxic and abusive. I started reading, researching, digging furiously for material. The moment I finally realized that I was raised in nest of narcissists was the moment my life actually began. I started to validate and love myself, more than they NEVER would have. And that fierce self love which came out of me molded my entire life into a loving and fulfilling place. I went grey rock to low contact then no contact (never once attacking or blaming my nfamily directly, publicly, or privately), and have honestly never been happier and healthier in my life. Since they ignored me most of my life anyways, this was fairly painless process, especially when compared to the hell I lived through trying to do the opposite and maintain a relationship with them.





Through realizing what I survived, I was able to see that the other two times I was most struggling with suicide - the times my life was only spared by a miraculous coincidence or brush of fate - were times Nfamily had most influence/control over my life. Only through 2 years of No Contact and 5 years of therapy have I been able to look back on the lowest moments of my life, and point to how nfamily pushed me there. 





You want to hear the most ironic part? The part that actually makes me laugh, and reminds me that this is not all some sick twisted dream? Since going No Contact, depression, anxiety, eating disorders have steadily waned. I have become increasingly more happy, calm, confident, fulfilled, just overall healthy. I finally feel like I have my life! I am no longer waiting to die, I am living my life and loving it. In the midst of this,  Nsis made a public post about me - not a direct address or letter or call to me. In between saying how horribly No Contact has affected her (she started smoking cigarettes, then quickly quit? idek), she feigned concern for my well being. Get this. She claimed I have a serious chemical imbalance that I am refusing to treat; that I am seeing a therapist who is basically brainwashing me to blame that imbalance on bio family; that I should be taking serious medication so I can at least be /and I quote/ ‘somewhat happy’; (this one is the best) and that SHE IS CONCERNED THAT I WILL END UP DEAD. Haha, oh lord that still puts a smile on my face. That’s the one thing that grounds me back into reality when I experience waves of NC guilt. That the happiest and healthiest I have ever been in my entire life (lightyears beyond ‘somewhat happy’), nsis is choosing that time to express concern about me being suicidal. That the times in my life where I was actively trying to kill myself where I was LIVING WITH and was in regular contact with nfamily and nsis on a daily basis, she found completely acceptable. That only now, now that I have distanced myself from the pain and the abuse, now that she no longer has narc supply, has no more punching bag, has no more scapegoat, has no more people pleaser, only then does she choose to feign concern for my well being. It is painfully clear through the timing of her comments and the public format through which she choose to express them that her intention was to slander, shame, and guilt me into communicating with the narc nest again. 





And that is why I laugh. Nsis doesn’t realize her last ditch effort to get me to relapse back to the narcs is the one thing I hold onto to stay away, the one thing that ties all three of these stories together: that nfamily triggers my suicidal behavior &amp; they see it as normal; and conversely, distance from nfamily keeps me healthy &amp; they see it as dangerous. Having a relationship with nfamily can literally kill me. And going No Contact has saved my life. HAHAHA BUH-BYE.



**tldr: nsis' feigned concerned for my mental health highlights how nfamily's narcissism is so pervasive it is actually a threat to my life**"

7h4su7,104,2017-12-02,"So you want to be on Survivor, here's how to apply!",ShadyBeachMelons,survivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/7h4su7/so_you_want_to_be_on_survivor_heres_how_to_apply/,"So you're thinking of applying to Survivor but you got a burning question that you *need* answered. Here's the answers to those questions that you keep posting over and over and over again! 

* Q: **Dude, how can I apply to Survivor?** 
* A: You can apply [online via the CBS website] (http://www.cbs.com/casting/) OR [apply at an Open Call](http://www.cbssurvivorcasting.com/Survivor-Open-Casting-Calls) that's held in cities around the United States. Both options are completely **FREE**. Please do not pay anyone to apply to the show. 
* Q: **Like is there a difference between applying at an Open Call or Online? Which one is like better or whatever?**
* A: There is no difference between applying at an Open Call or applying Online. The ""better"" one is the one that suits your personality. If you don't know how to shoot and edit an audition video OR you're able to think on your feet  and show your personality on the fly, then an Open Call would fit you. You'll only have a minute or so to do this and may be asked a random question. If you can shoot and edit an audition video OR need the flexibility of applying 24/7 OR want to carefully craft an audition tape to showcase your personality, then applying online would fit you better. You can also apply using both methods. 
* Q: **Will someone from Survivor Casting be at the Open Call?**
* A: More than likely, no one from Survivor Casting will be at the Open Call. An intern or a tired cameraman will ask you a random question or give you a minute or more of free time to give your pitch on why you should be on Survivor. Open Calls are used as promotional events by the local CBS affiliates and will occur in multiple cities around the country throughout the year. Tapes from Open Calls will be mailed to Survivor Casting and will be watched when the casting season is active. 
* Q: **Do you guys like watch Open Call tapes and do people like get cast from Open Calls?**
* A: Tapes from Open Calls will be mailed to Survivor Casting and will be watched when the casting season is active. Many contestants have been called from Open Calls, many of them have made it to Casting Finals, and some of them have made it on the cast. So yes, you can apply via an Open Call and get cast. 
* A: **I'm 17. Can I still like apply?**
* Q: I think this is the most asked question ever. Yes, you can still apply to Survivor when you're 17. However, you must be 18 **before** filming takes place. In your application video or in your bio, just mention your age and how you'll be 18 before the filming takes place. It should be noted that there are a few states where the age requirement is higher so review your state's age requirement. **#YesYouCanApplyAt17**
* Q: **When is the Casting Season?**
* A: Survivor casts from Fall, Winter, and into Spring for the next seasons. There will be multiple Casting Finals that will take place in Fall, Winter, &amp; Spring. This is not a fast process and it takes time to go through all the applications and Open Calls. You can apply any time during this time period and still be considered for the next seasons. Applications and Open Calls will continue to be reviewed during this casting period until both casts leave for location. All applications submitted after this point will be for the next following seasons and won't be reviewed until the next Casting Season.
* Q: **When is the best time to apply?**
* A: Personally, I think the best time to apply would be in the Fall. Casting starts up in the Fall and at that point, all spots are open and available for both seasons. As mentioned above, you can apply any time during the Fall, Winter, and early Spring to be considered for the next upcoming season. However, the longer you wait to apply, the less spots on the cast will be available.  
* Q: **So I submitted an application, how long will it take before someone calls me?** 
* A: You'll hate this answer. You can be called minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and even years after you've applied. We've called people who forgot they even applied. It just depends on what casting is currently looking for and if they're looking for a specific spot to fill. Stop waiting at the phone. Just apply, forget about it, and move on with your life. 
* Q: **I've applied previously and it says my application is still on file. Can I apply again?**
* A: Feel free to reapply every casting season. If your application is still on file, you can reapply with a different email address. Please be respectful and don't spam your application. When reapplying, please use a new audition video. No one wants to watch the same video again.
* Q: **I just missed a phone call! Did you call!?! OMG! DID YOU CALL?!?**
* A: If someone from Casting calls you and you don't answer, they will leave a voicemail or try to contact you by another method. So no, we probably didn't call you and hang up. You should, however, make sure your voicemail box is not completely full so someone can leave you a voicemail. 
* Q: **My audition video is too large to upload to the casting website! How can I make it smaller?**
* A: Videos are compressed to a frame size of 480X320 when you upload it to the Casting Website. Reduce the frame size of your video while maintaining video quality. That should help you get under the size requirement. Always remember to keep a high quality version of your audition tape. 
* Q: **So like can you watch my audition video?**
* A: A lot of people have asked me to watch their audition video. Unfortunately, I just can't since I don't have the time in my busy schedule to help everyone out. I'm really sorry about this but I wish everyone good luck. 
* Q: **What are your thoughts on the Amanda Kimmel of Survivor: China, Survivor: Micronesia - Fans vs. Favorites, and Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains fame?**
* A: Well, I like Amanda Kimmel of Survivor: China, Survivor: Micronesia - Fans vs. Favorites, and Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains fame. But most of us who know her refer to her as AKOSCSMFVFASHVVF.  
* Q: **But... but... but... I have more questions!**
* A: Your questions were probably already asked and answered in this [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/4362v7/lloyd_quinto_casting_editor_ama/). 

Good luck everyone! ([And don't shoot vertical video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA))"

I currently have four apps on the App Store, each one more complex than the last. I have won two awards for my last app and had articles written about it too.

I am a senior in college (will graduate December 2018) with an information systems and operations management degree in progress, with ~half of a CS degree worth of experience from a prior university that I transferred from. I have a lot of programming experience and am best in Swift, but I also know C++ and Java.

I am about to start applying to iOS Dev specific internships, specifically in NYC, Seattle, and DC. Does anyone have any tips on the best application practices? Since iOS is such a specialized field, I assume that they do not want a ""general"" resume like many jobs in the business field. What is the best way to showcase what I have done?

7h5bbf,10,2017-12-02,Metacetin and 425 micrograms,PsilocinPsychosis,researchchemicals,https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/7h5bbf/metacetin_and_425_micrograms/,"Dosage: 425 micrograms of LSD in liquid form, ~50 mg of 4-Aco-met prior to dropping
Route: Sublingually, orally
Duration: 14 hours
Test Subject: 160lbs, male, 25 years of age

I would like to start off by saying what I chose to do yesterday was borderline reckless. It isn't smart to mix substances to this extent if you've never done it before. It's always smarter to take a little amount of each and see how you react, everyone's body chemistry is different. That being said, it was one of my favorite psychedelic experiences and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Let's get into this. 

T: 0:30 - 
Coming up fast and hard now. It's like an incredible body load that has me cold but warm at the same time. I'm laying in bed covered in blankets trying to adjust. But it's hard. And getting harder and harder as time goes by. The come up on Metacetin always feels so god damn nerve wracking until you hit the peak. Then it's smooth sailing. Blah. 

T: 1:00 -
It's been about an hour since ingestion of both substances. I decide to play some music, and take a dab. The dab as per always kicks the trip into hyper drive, sending me down a tunnel of geometric patterns and tribal writing. Everything at this point is OEV, tho the CEV are starting to form as well. 

T: 1:30 -
I'm utterly fucked up. I'm forgetting every few minutes where I am, who I am, what I am doing and how the hell I could've thought taking psychedelics would be ""fun"". It's getting all to be too much. I wish there was a switch to turn all the noise down just a couple tabs. I'm starting to feel anxiety, tho more then likely was caused by the dab. The visuals at this point are incredibly vivid. I can almost remember exactly what was happening. I was here, in reality briefly, then it felt as if the metacetin was sending me to this alien place. The rooms of my house weren't my house anymore, but rooms inside my subconscious. I was bouncing from room to room experiencing a different emotion with each new room I would enter. I remember my bathroom turning me into a 12 year old mentally and physically, but not me as a kid, something else completely. 

T: 2:00 -
I'm here, but I'm not. I'm alive, but not entirely. My ego is partially still intact, but it's being ripped to shreds as the trip goes on, and I'm fighting it, I want to remember exactly what is going on to be able to record it. Seems a little far fetched at this point. 

T: 3:00 - 
I feel fucking fantastic. I'm realizing things about myself that I didn't know were affecting me. I have a package stuck at customs that creeps its way into my mind. I push it away, and try going outside for a bit. This is where everything takes a turn. 

T: 3:30 -
The trees are breathing with me, I hear their every thought, I'm listening to them telepathically. They're telling me I should stop littering. I should appreciate the earth more. This makes me want to take a hike at a nearby steep hill. I'm outta my mind at this point, not making rational decisions at all, and I head out. I'm watching the trees swing back and forth, and the grass go from purple to green to orange. The sky is dark, but the clouds are so bright. They're creating faces of family members that passed away. I'm scared but comforted as if they're looking over me 

T: 4:30 -
I make it to the top of the steep hill overlooking the town I look in. Everything is silent. Not a peep from anything or anyone. I'm watching as I envision myself living inside one of the houses, going on my day to day life but in someone else's shoes. I go through these almost DMT like breakthrough experiences but I'm fully conscious. I'm not blacking out at all, I know what is happening. 

T: 5:30 -
I'm home now. Making it to the top of the hill felt like one my greatest accomplishments. I faced my fear of heights under the influence and somehow it made me feel better when it was over then I ever had before. I suffer with depression, pretty deeply. Have my whole life. I find ways to manage, and self medicate. But this whole experience was just exactly what I needed. The visuals in my bedroom are very tribal at this point, lots of warping, breathing, and things like still pictures are turning into major motion picture productions. 

T: 6:30 -
I try playing Player Unknown's Battlegrounds. I fail miserably, giggle, turn my PC off and start watching planet earth on Netflix. 

T: 8:00? - 
I lost track of some time. I remember thinking herds of Buffalo looked like synchronized swimmers and lions scared the shit out of me. The visuals are still strong, but it's mostly introspection at this point. I feel guilty for taking too much of both substances and frequently go through a worrisome loop of thought pattern. 

T: 10:00 -
I take a couple more dabs. I'm trying to sleep now. It's late, I'm tired and anything longer then 9 hours is just too much for me now a days. Mentally it's exhausting. God how I commend you people who take LSD. It's my favorite substance, but it's so mentally taxing. I didn't look at my phone once throughout my trip and that was a wonderful feeling to be so detached from everything. 

I came down about 4 hours after that completely back to baseline; and ended up falling asleep nearly 15 hours after ingestion. I realized thing about my life that I don't like. I hate working as a manager and having to delegate. My job has turned me into something I never wanted to be, and all for chumps change. I have a degree in Addiction Psychology, but have sat on it like a fool. I'm looking at a psychiatric hospital nearby for a possible job or an internship. I need a change, I keep telling myself that but it's time to get off my lazy ass and do something about it. I could bitch till my face goes red, or I could just do it (insert Shia LaBeouf meme). 

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. I think this will be one of my last trips I will experience for a while. For some reason I don't even want to smoke weed today. I don't want to smoke cigarettes. I just feel over all substances. I want to get my shit together. Baby steps. 

Peace and love everyone"
7h5ldd,2,2017-12-02,CPO vs Brand new,jfungy,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/7h5ldd/cpo_vs_brand_new/,"Edit: 
After putting some thought into this I'd like to rephrase my question and provide more information!

I am a university student that is 21 years old and I live at home with my parents. My expenses are all paid for and I have a job at a non profit that pays more than a typical fast food chain worker. I have had paid internships, which has allowed me to save some money up.

Before I was comparing CPO to new, I was looking at a low mileage 2008 G35X (60k miles/97k kilometres) but my parents thought that a 10 year old car for $10k was not worth it.

So I listen to them and started looking at CPO'd Infiniti Q50, because they look pretty nice and it's a Japanese brand (Nissan) so it should be reliable enough for a university student to handle the ownership costs.

My parents pitched in that I should buy a new car instead, because even if the car is CPO and low mileage I will never know the life of the car before I owned it. They also want to steer me clear of any powerful cars (Eg. Q50, WRX, etc), fearing that I might be cocky or reckless. 

To provide some context with pricing, the Q50 awd with 40k kilometres (26k miles) is $28k, but I believe there is room to haggle. Including the CPO warranty it should end around 2020 

The only awd economy car I was looking at is the Subaru Crosstrek and that is around $28k Canadian as well, but there is very little room to negotiate from what I heard as my area's Subaru Tax is quite harsh. I learned that Subaru's warranty is only 3 years, so it ends around 2021

I have looked up the depreciation of these vehicles, but I will pretty much be keeping these vehicles for a long time. Subaru pretty much keeps its value VERY well, whereas the Infiniti slowly drops down over the years. 

My parents will be paying for the insurance as they understand that paying for the car is already a burden for me.

Fuel economy will not be a large issue as I do not primarily drive to school or work, but rather going to and from gym/sport, weekends, errands, late to work/school. Very few miles will be racked up, leading to very little gas consumption overall

Are there any other factors that I should take into account?"
7h5m96,6,2017-12-02,I'm a college student and I should finally be able to escape next fall but I need advice with steps to take and how to make this happen,CaptainQuint77,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7h5m96/im_a_college_student_and_i_should_finally_be_able/,"Hello, 
I'm a 23 year old male living with my Ndad and Nstepmom. I was in a long honeymoon stage which just recently ended with me losing my access to the basement (where I had a workspace for my internship and classwork) and them obsessing about where I am all of the time. I got in trouble for coming home just after 11PM. They decided they want the space for a ""recreation space"" so now it's just an empty basement that no one but my brother uses and I have to do everything in my bedroom. I then bought a shelving unit and my stepmom doesn't like that either. 



This probably doesn't sound like real issues but they come on top of other issues that I've been dealing with for years like managing my mental health issues all on my own even when I told my dad I was suicidal. Having him being mad at me for taking depression meds. Driving a dangerous car (bad brakes) even though he said he would take care of it while I was in college which led to me having to purchase my own car. Him ignoring and not talking to me for months when I dropped a college class when I was suicidal. Threatening and then denying me medical coverage under his plan because he says he isn't allowed to because I'm not a full time student (I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter what your doing as long as you are under 27 years old). Completely stopping talking to me in mid conversation if I say anything negative about my life (like if I say I had a tough day or am just okay). 



Numerous times barging into my room while I'm sleeping and yelling at me even when I'm crying which has made it difficult for me to sleep or feel safe in my room. Making me fix the family cars even when I have finals coming up and never paying me or appreciating my work. Never being there emotionally for me, making fun of my speaking patterns and telling me I'm too sensitive. Everything is reemerging in memories and flashbacks and I'm falling apart right now. I'm working with my therapist and psychiatrist on this and we had to reduce my work hours to try to compensate and allow me focus my energy on my internship and class. 




My therapist has described me as a mismatch for my family and has told me that the environment I live in is toxic for me. She thinks I'm a mismatch because I'm a sensitive introvert interested in things like art but am in a family of anti emotion extroverted people interested in sports. She also thinks I won't be able to handle getting my first post college job and moving out at the same time without breaking down so doing it while I'm still in college will allow me to do this in steps. 

I talked to financial aid at my college and found out that next fall for financial aid my parents will no longer be considered for my financial aid and instead it will only be based on my income. This is because I finally aged out because I will be 24 next fall. 




As a result of this I will be eligible for more grants, aid and loans. I turned in my FAFSA but won't have concrete numbers for a while. A rough estimate from the counselor is that I will be able to take out enough to have $5000 per semester back to spend on whatever I want. I think what I want is to use this money to move out next fall and not return to live at home again after this. My college is a commuter college and doesn't have dorms. I also pay for my college expenses on my own. My dad and stepmom refuse to pay for tuition or other expenses. 




My problem is that I don't know what I'm doing or how to do any of this. Talking to financial aid was my first step. It was both good and terrifying to find out that I could potentially move out next fall.  It feels like I have an enormous amount of work to do now to make it happen and it's really overwhelming me on top of my work, internship and class. 




I already own my own car (in my name) and have bank accounts that they aren't attached to or have access to. I'm also learning how to budget and be more careful with my money. I don't know what to do next to make this happen. My therapist thinks that I should get an apartment with a roommate because she is worried about me being alone and isolated and thinks it would help to keep costs down. I'm terrified of getting a roommate that is abusive or not a good fit because I don't want to get into an even worse situation or an equivalent one. This is really stressing me out and taking up a lot of my energy and I was hoping you could help me in some way.

For me this is super important since I have to pass by February 15th or I lose the new grad internship I got into.

We hung out for a couple of weeks before deciding that we will officially date and then break up when he goes back his home country. When he went back, we had minimal contact until one day, he told me that he was seeing someone else. I then told him that I can't keep in contact with him anymore because it isn't healthy. He immediately broke contact with the other person and started to text me everyday. After more than a month, he admitted that what we have is more than just good friends and that we should take some time to decide if we want to be in an LDR. It will be about 1-2 years before we meet again because the flight ticket is so expensive. After one week from that confession, we decided to call. Within that one week, so much happened. I got into a minor car accident and everything that could go wrong with my assignments did go wrong. His mom got into the hospital, his house mates gave him a last minute's notice about moving out, he still hasn't got a place for internship, which is supposed to start next month and he has his finals coming up soon. So when he said he really likes me but that now is not the time for an LDR, I don't know if I should move on or wait.

# **1. Should I Pursue Filmmaking / Should I Go To Film School?**


This is a very complex topic, so it will rely heavily on *you* as a person. Find below a guide to help you identify what you need to think about and consider when making this decision.

##Do you want to do it?

Alright, real talk. If you want to make movies, you'll at least have a few ideas kicking around in your head. Successful creatives like writers and directors have an internal compunction to create something. They get ideas that stick in the head and compel them to translate them into the real world. Do you want to make films, or do you want to *be seen as* a filmmaker? Those are two extremely different things, and you need to be honest with yourself about which category you fall into. If you like the idea of being called a filmmaker, but you don't actually have any interest in making films, then now is the time to jump ship. I have many friends from film school who were just into it because they didn't want ""real jobs"", and they liked the idea of working on flashy movies. They made some cool projects, but they didn't have that internal drive to create. They saw filmmaking as a task, not an opportunity. None of them have achieved anything of note and most of them are out of the industry now with college debt but no relevant degree. If, when you walk onto a set you are overwhelmed with excitement and anxiety, then you'll be fine. If you walk onto a set and feel foreboding and anxiety, it's probably not right for you. Filmmaking should be fun. If it isn't, you'll never make it.

##School

Are you planning on a film production program, or a film studies program? A studies program isn't meant to give you the tools or experience necessary to actually make films from a craft-standpoint. It is meant to give you the analytical and critical skills necessary to dissect films and understand what works and what doesn't. A would-be director or DP will benefit from a program that mixes these two, with an emphasis on production.

Does your prospective school have a film club? The school I went to had a filmmakers' club where we would all go out and make movies every semester. If your school has a similar club then I highly recommend jumping into it. I made 4 films for my classes, and shot 8 films. In the filmmaker club at my school I was able to shoot 20 films. It vastly increased my experience and I was able to get a lot of the growing pains of learning a craft out of the way while still in school.

How are your classes? Are they challenging and insightful? Are you memorizing dates, names, and ideas, or are you talking about philosophies, formative experiences, cultural influences, and milestone achievements? You're paying a huge sum of money, more than you'll make for a decade or so after graduation, so you better be getting something out of it.

**Film school is always a risky prospect. You have three decisive advantages from attending school:**

1. Foundation of theory (why we do what we do, how the masters did it, and how to do it ourselves)
2. Building your first network
3. Making mistakes in a sandbox

Those three items are the *only* advantages of film school. It doesn't matter if you get to use fancy cameras in class or anything like that, because I guarantee you that for the price of your tuition you could've rented that gear and made your own stuff. The downsides, as you may have guessed, are:

1. Cost
- Risk of no value
- Cost again

Seriously. Film school is insanely expensive, especially for an industry where you really don't make any exceptional money until you get established (and that can take a decade or more). 

So there's a few things you need to sort out:

- How much debt will you incur if you pursue a film degree?
- How much value will you get from the degree? (any notable alumni? Do they succeed or fail?)
- Can you enhance your value with extracurricular activity?

##Career Prospects

Don't worry about lacking experience or a degree. It is easy to break into the industry if you have two qualities: 

 - The ability to listen and learn quickly
 - A great attitude

In LA we often bring unpaid interns onto set to get them experience and possibly hire them in the future. Those two categories are what they are judged on. If they have to be told twice how to do something, that's a bad sign. If they approach the work with disdain, that's also a bad sign. I can name a few people who walked in out of the blue, asked for a job, and became professional filmmakers within a year. One kid was 18 years old and had just driven to LA from his home to learn filmmaking because he couldn't afford college. Last I saw he has a successful YouTube channel with nature documentaries on it and knows his way around most camera and grip equipment. He succeeded because he smiled and joked with everyone he met, and because once you taught him something he was good to go. Those are the qualities that will take you far in life (and I'm not just talking about film).

So how do you break in?

- *Cold Calling*
  - Find the production listings for your area (not sure about NY but in LA we use the BTL Listings) and go down the line of upcoming productions and call/email every single one asking for an intern or PA position. Include some humor and friendly jokes to humanize yourself and you'll be good. I did this when I first moved to LA and ended up camera interning for an ASC DP on movie within a couple months. It works!
- *Rental House*
  - Working at a rental house gives you free access to gear and a revolving door of clients who work in the industry for you to meet.
- *Filmmaking Groups*
  - Find some filmmaking groups in your area and meet up with them. If you can't find groups, don't sweat it! You have more options.
- *Film Festivals*
  - Go to film festivals, meet filmmakers there, and befriend them. Show them that you're eager to learn how they do what they do, and you'd be happy to help them on set however you can. Eventually you'll form a fledgling network that you can work to expand using the other avenues above.

##What you should do right now

Alright, enough talking! You need to decide now if you're still going to be a filmmaker or if you're going to instead major in something safer (like business). It's a tough decision, we get it, but you're an adult now and this is what that means. You're in command of your destiny, and you can't trust anyone but yourself to make that decision for you.

Once you decide, own it. If you choose film, then take everything I said above into consideration. There's one essential thing you need to do though: create. Go outside right fucking now and make a movie. Use your phone. That iphone or galaxy s7 or whatever has better video quality than the crap I used in film school. Don't sweat the gear or the mistakes. Don't compare yourself to others. Just make something, and watch it. See what you like and what you don't like, and adjust on your next project! Now is the time for you to do this, to learn what it feels like to make a movie.

#**2. What Camera Should I Buy?**

The answer depends mostly on your budget and your intended use. You'll also want to become familiar with some basic camera terms because it will allow you to efficiently evaluate the merits of one option vs another. Find below a basic list of terms you should become familiar with when making your first (or second, or third!) camera purchase:

1. **Resolution** - This is how many pixels your recorded image will have. If you're into filmmaking, you probably already know this. An HD camera will have a resolution of 1920x1080. A 4K camera will be either 4096x2160 or 3840x2160. The functional difference is that the former is a theatrical aspect ratio while the latter is a standard HDTV aspect ratio (1.89:1 vs 1.78:1 respectively).
2. **Framerates** - The standard and popular framerate for filmmaking is called 24p, but most digital cameras will actually be shooting at 23.976 fps. The difference is negligible and should have no bearing on your purchasing choice. The technical reasons behind this are interesting but ultimately irrelevant. Something to look for is the camera's ability to shoot in **high framerate**, meaning anything above the 24p standard. This is useful because you can play back high framerate footage *at* 24p in your editor, and it will render the recorded motion in **slow motion**. This is obviously useful!
3. **Data Rate** - This tells you how much data is being recorded on a per second basis. Generally speaking, the higher the data rate, the better your image quality. Make sure to pay attention to resolution as well! A 1080p camera with a 100 MB/s data rate is going to be recording higher quality imagery than a 4k camera at a 200 MB/s data rate because the 4k camera has 4x as many pixels to record but only double the data bandwidth with which to do it. Things like compression come into play here, but keep this in mind as a rule of thumb.
4. **Compression** - Compression is important, because very few cameras will shoot without some form of compression. This is basically an algorithm that allows you to record high quality images without making large file sizes. This is intimately linked with your data rate. Popular cinema compressions for cameras include ProRes, REDCODE, XAVC, AVCHD. Compression schemes that you want to avoid include h.264, h.265, MPEG-4, and Generic 'MOV'. This is not an exhaustive list of compression types, but a decent starter guide.
5. **ISO** - This is your camera sensor's sensitivity to light. The higher the ISO number, the more sensitive to light the camera will be. Higher ISOs tend to give noisier images though, so there is a tradeoff. All cameras will have something called a **native iso**. This is the ISO at which the camera is deemed to perform the best in terms of trading off noise vs sensitivity. A very common native ISO in the industry is 800. Sony cameras, including the A7S boast much higher ISO performance without significant noise increases, which can be useful if you're planning on running and gunning in the dark with no crew.
6. **Manual Shutter** - Your shutter speed (or shutter angle, as it is called in the film industry) controls your motion blur by changing how long the sensor is exposed to light during a single frame of recording. Having manual control over this when shooting is important. The standard shutter speed when shooting 24p is 1/48 of a second (180° in shutter angle terms), so make sure your prospective camera can get here (1/50 is close enough).
7. **Lens Mount** - Some starter cameras will have built in lenses, which is fine for learning! When you move up to higher quality cameras however, the standard will be interchangeable lens cameras. This means you'll need to decide on what lens mount you would like to use. The professional standard is called the PL Mount, but lenses and cameras that use this mount are very expensive. The most common and popular mount in the low level professional world is Canon's EF mount. Because of its design, EF mount lenses can easily be adapter to other common mounts like Sony's E-Mount or the MFT mounts found on many Panasonic cameras. EF is popular because Canon's lenses are generally preferred over Sony's, and so their mount has a higher utility.
8. **Color Subsampling** - This is easier to understand if you think of it as 'Color Resolution'. Our eyes are more sensitive to luminance (bright vs dark) than to color, and so some cameras increase effective image quality by dedicating processing power and data rate bandwidth to the more important luminance values of individual pixels. This means that individual pixels often do not have their own color, but instead that *groups of neighboring pixels* will be given a single color value. The size of the groups and the pattern of their arrangement are referred to by 3 main color subsampling standards.
 - 4:4:4 means that each pixel has its own color value. This is the highest quality.
 - 4:2:2 means that color is set for horizontal pixels in pairs. The color of each two neighboring pixels is averaged and applied to both identically. This is the second best quality.
 - 4:2:0 means that color is set for both horizontal and vertical pixel 4-packs. Each square of 4 pixels receives a single color assignment that is an averaging of their original signals. This is generally low quality.
For more info on color subsampling, check out [this wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling)
9. **Bit-Depth** - This refers to how many colors the camera is capable of recognizing. An 8-bit camera can have 16,777,216 distinct colors, while a 10-bit camera can have 1,073,741,824 distinct colors. Note that this is primarily only of use when doing color grading, as nearly all TVs and computer monitors from the past few decades are 8-bit displays that won't benefit from a 10-bit signal.
10. **Sensor Size** - The three main sensor sizes you'll encounter (in ascending order) are **Micro Four-Thirds (M43), APS-C,** and **Full Frame**. A larger sensor will generally have better noise and sensitivity than a smaller sensor. It will also effect the field of view you get from a given lens. Larger sensors will have wider fields of view for the same focal length lenses. For example, a 50mm lens on a FF sensor will look roughly twice as wide-angle as a 50mm lens on a M43 sensor. To get the same field of view as a 50mm on FF, you'd need to use a 25mm lens on your M43 camera. *Theatrical 35mm (the cinema standard, so to speak) has an equivalent sensor size to* ***APS-C***, which is larger than M43 and smaller than Full Frame.

## So Now What Camera Should I Buy?

This list will be changing as new models emerge, but for now here is a short list of the cameras to look at when getting started:

1. [Panasonic G7 \(~$800\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1208931-REG/panasonic_lumix_dmc_g7_mirrorless_micro.html) - This is hands down the best starter camera for someone looking to move up from shooting on their phones or consumer camcorders.
2. [Panasonic GH4 \(~$1,500\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1185322-REG/panasonic_dmc_gh4_camera_body_black.html) - An older and cheaper version of the GH5, this camera is still a popular choice.
3. [Panasonic GH5 \(~$2,000\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1376491-REG/panasonic_lumix_dc_gh5_mirrorless_micro.html) - This is perhaps the most popular prosumer DSLR filmmaking camera.
4. [Sony A7S \(~$2,700\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1186034-REG/sony_ilce7sm2_b_alpha_a7sii_mirrorless_digital.html) - This is a very popular camera for shooting in low light settings. It also boasts a Full-Frame sensor (compared to the GH5's M4/3 sensor), allowing you to get shallower depth of field compared to other cameras using the same field of view and aperture.
5. [Canon C100 mkII \(~$3,500\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1086125-REG/canon_eos_c100_cinema_eos.html) - This is one of the cheapest true digital cinema cameras. It offers several benefits over the above DSLR cameras, such as professional level XLR audio inputs, internal ND filters, and a better picture profile system.

# **3. What Lens Should I Buy?**

Much like with deciding on a camera, lens choice is all about your budget and your needs. Below are the relevant specs to use as points of comparison for lenses.

1. **Focal Length** - This number indicates the field of view your lens will supply. A higher focal length results in a narrow (or more 'telescopic') field of view. [Here is a great visual depiction of focal length vs field of view](https://cdn-7.nikon-cdn.com/Images/Learn-Explore/Photography-Techniques/2009/Focal-Length/Media/red-barn-focal-lenght-rep-image.jpg).
2. **Speed** - A 'fast lens' is one with a very wide maximum aperture. This means the lens can let more light through it than a comparatively slower lens. We read the aperture setting via something called F-Stops. They are a standard scale that goes in alternating doublings of previous values. The scale is: 1.0, 1.4, 2.0, 2.8, 4.0, 5.6, 8.0, 11, 16, 22, 32, 45, 64. Each increase is a doubling of the incoming light. A lens whose aperture is a 1.4 will allow in twice as much light than it would have at 2.0. Cheaper lenses tend to only open up to a 4.0, or even a 5.6. More expensive lenses can open as far 1.3, giving you 16x as much light. Wider apertures also cause your depth of field to contract, resulting in the 'cinematic' shallow focus you're likely familiar with. [Here is a great visual depiction of f-stop vs depth of field](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/444004712_1280x720.jpg)
3. **Chromatic Aberration** - Some lower quality glass will have this defect, in which imperfect lens elements cause a prism-style effect that separates colors on the edges of image details. Post software can sometimes help correct this, as in [this example](https://cdn.photographylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Uncorrected-and-Corrected-CA.jpg)
4. **Sharpness** - I'm sure you all know what sharpness is. Cheaper lenses will yield a softer in-focus image than more expensive lenses. However, some lenses are popularly considered to be 'over-sharp', such as the Zeiss CP2 series. The minutia of the sharpness debate is mostly irrelevant at starter levels though.
5. **Bokeh** - This refers to the *shape* of an out of focus point of light as rendered by the lens. The bokeh of your image will always be in the shape of your aperture. For that reason, a perfectly round aperture will yield nice clean circle bokeh, while a rougher edged aperture will produce similarly rougher bokeh. [Here's an example](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/fd/6a/75fd6aba18cdb3fbe9780e3307b4874f.jpg)
6. **Lens Mount** - Make sure the lens you're buying will either fit your camera's lens mount or allow for adapting to is using a popular adapter like the Metabones. The professional standard lens mount is the PL Mount, but lenses and cameras that use this mount are very expensive. The most common and popular mount in the low level professional world is Canon's EF mount. Because of its design, EF mount lenses can easily be adapter to other common mounts like Sony's E-Mount or the MFT mounts found on many Panasonic cameras. EF is popular because Canon's lenses are generally preferred over Sony's, and so their mount has a higher market share.

##Zoom vs Prime
 This is all about speed vs quality vs budget. A zoom lens is a lens whose **focal length* can be changed by turning a ring on the lens barrel. A prime lens has a fixed focal length. Primes tend to be cheaper, faster, and sharper. However, buying a full set of primes can be more expensive than buying a zoom lens that would cover the same focal length range. Using primes on set in fast-paced environments can slow you down prohibitively. You'll often see news, documentary, and event cameras using zooms instead of primes. Some zoom lenses are as high-quality as prime lenses, and some people refer to them as 'variable prime' lenses. This is mostly a marketing tool and has no hard basis in science though. As you might expect, these high quality zooms tend to be very expensive.

##So What Lenses Should I Look At?
Below are the most popular lenses for 'cinematic' filming at low budgets:

1. [Rokinon Cine 4 Lens Kit in EF Mount \(~$1,700\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=rokinon%20cine&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;Top+Nav-Search=)
2. [Canon L Series 24-70mm Zoom in EF Mount \(~1,700\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/843008-USA/Canon_5175B002_EF_24_70mm_f_2_8L_II.html)
3. [Sigma Art 18-35mm Zoom in EF Mount \(~$800\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/967344-REG/sigma_18_35mm_f1_8_dc_hsm.html)
4. [Sigma Art 50-100 Zoom in EF Mount \(~$1,100\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1234029-REG/sigma_693954_50_100mm_f_1_8_dc_hsm.html)

Lenses below these average prices are mostly a crapshoot in terms of quality vs $, and you'll likely be best off using your camera's kit lens until you can afford to move up to one of the lenses or lens series listed above.

# **4. How Do I Learn Lighting?**

Alright, so you're biting off a big chunk here if you've never done lighting before. But it is doable and (most importantly) **fun**!

First off, *fuck three-point lighting*. So many people misunderstand what that system is supposed to teach you, so let's just skip it entirely. Light has **three properties**. They are:

* **Color**: Color of the light. This is both color temperature (on the Orange - Blue scale) and what you'd probably think of as regular color (is it RED!? GREEN!? AQUA!?) etc. Color. You know what color is.
* **Quantity**: How bright the light is. You know, the quantity of photons smacking into your subject and, eventually, your retinas.
* **Quality**: This is the good shit. The quality of a light source can vary quite a bit. Basically, this is how **hard** or **soft** the light is. Alright, you've got a guy standing near a wall. You shine a light on him. What's on the wall? His shadow, that's what. You know what shadows look like. A hard light makes his shadow super distinct with 'hard' edges to it. A soft light makes his shadow less distinct, with a 'soft' edge. When the sun is out, you get hard light. Distinct shadows. When it's cloudy, you get soft light. No shadows at all! So what makes a light hard or soft? Easy! **The size of the source, relative to the subject**. Think of it this way. You're the subject! Now look at your light source. How much of your field of vision is taken up by the light source? Is it a pinpoint? Or more like a giant box? The smaller the size of the source, the harder the light will be. You can take a hard light (i.e. a light bulb) and make it softer by putting **diffusion** in front of it. [Here is a picture of that happening](http://78.media.tumblr.com/7007ed96712236a6f446f094f946b8fa/tumblr_inline_o1qbhcoXA51rbs4ue_500.jpg). You can also **bounce** the light off of something big and bouncy, like a [bounce board](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Bounce_Board,_by_Brian_Finifter.jpg) or [a wall](http://st.houzz.com/simgs/feb1a53a01e178c6_4-1017/modern-wall-sconces.jpg). That's what sconces do. I fucking love sconces.

Alright, so there are your three properties of light. Now, how do you light a thing? Easy! Put light where you want it, and take it away from where you don't want it! Shut up! I know you just said ""I don't know where I want it"", so I'm going to stop you right there. Yes you do. I know you do because you can look at a picture and know if the lighting is good or not. You can recognize good lighting. Everybody can. The difference between knowing good lighting and *making* good lighting is simply in the execution.

Do an experiment. Get a lightbulb. Tungsten if you're oldschool, LED if you're new school, or CFL if you like mercury gas. plug it into something portable and movable, and have a friend, girlfriend, boyfriend, neighbor, creepy-but-realistic doll, etc. sit down in a chair. Turn off all the lights in the room and move that bare bulb around your ~~victim~~ subject's head. Note how the light falling on them changes as the light bulb moves around them. This is lighting, done live! Get yourself some diffusion. Either buy some overpriced or make some of your own (wax paper, regular paper, translucent shower curtains, white undershirts, etc.). Try softening the light, and see how that affects the subject's head. If you practice around with this enough you'll get an idea for how light looks when it comes from various directions. Three point lighting (well, all lighting) works on this fundamental basis, but so many 'how to light' tutorials skip over it. Start at the bottom and work your way up!

Ok, so cool. Now you know how light works, and sort of where to put it to make a person look a certain way. Now you can get creative by combining multiple lights. A very common look is to use soft light to primarily illuminate a person (the 'key) while using a harder (but sometimes still somewhat soft) light to do an edge or rim light. [Here's a shot](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16600000/The-Shawshank-Redemption-the-shawshank-redemption-16632474-1600-900.jpg) from a sweet movie that uses a soft key light, a good amount of ambient ('errywhere) light, and a hard backlight. [Here](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16600000/The-Shawshank-Redemption-the-shawshank-redemption-16632964-1600-900.jpg) they are lit ambiently, but still have an edge light coming from behind them and to the right. You can tell by the quality of the light that this edge was probably very soft. We can go on for hours, but if you just watch movies and look at shadows, bright spots, etc. you'll be able to pick out lighting locations and qualities fairly easily since you've been practicing with your light bulb!

## How Do I Light A Greenscreen?

Honestly, your greenscreen will depend more on your technical abilities in After Effects (or whichever program) than it will on your lighting. I'm a DP and I'm admitting that. A good key-guy (Keyist? Keyer?) can pull something clean out of a mediocre-ly lit greenscreen (like the ones in your example) but a bad key-guy will still struggle with a perfectly lit one. I can't help you much here, as I am only a mediocre key-guy, but I can at least give you advice on how to light for it!

Here's what you're looking for when lighting a greenscreen:

* **Two Separate Lighting Setups:** You should have a lighting setup for the green screen and a lighting setup for your actor. Of course, this isn't always possible. But we like to aspire to big things! The reason this is helpful is that it makes it easier for you to adjust the greenscreen light without affecting the actor's lighting, and vice versa.
* **Separate the subject from the greenscreen as much as possible!** - Pretty much that. The closer your subject is to the screen, the harder it is to keep lights from interfering with things they're not meant for, and the greater the chance the actor has of getting his filthy shadow all over the screen. I normally try to keep my subjects at least 8' away from the screen at a minimum for anything wider than an MCU.
* **Light the Green Screen EVENLY:** The green on the screen needs to be as close to the same intensity in all parts as possible, or you just multiply your work in post. For every different shade of green on that screen you'll need make a separate key effect to make clean edges, and then you'll need to matte and combine them all together. Huge headache that can be a tad overwhelming if you're not used it. For this reason, Get your shit even! *""But how do I do that?""* you ask! Well, first off, I actually prefer to use hard light. You see, hard light has the nice innate property of being able to throw itself a long distance without losing all its intensity. The farther away the light source is from the subject, the less its intensity will change from inch to inch. That's called the **inverse square law**, and it is cool as fuck. If you change the distance between the light and the subject, the intensity of the light will shift as an inverse to the square of the distance. Science! So if you double the distance between the light and the subject, the intensity is quartered (1 over 2 squared. 1/4). So, naturally, the farther away you are the more distance is required to reduce the intensity further. If you have the space, use it to your advantage and back your lights up! Now back to reality. You probably don't have a lot of space. You're probably in a garage. OK, fuck it, emergency mode! Now we use soft lights. Soft lights change their intensity quite inconveniently if they're at an oblique angle to the screen, but they kick ass if you can get them to shine more or less perpendicular on the screen. The problem there of course is that they'd then be sitting where your actor probably is. Sooo we move them off to the side, maybe put one on the ceiling, one on the ground too, and try to smudge everything together on the screen. Experiment with this for a while and you'll get the hang of it in no-time!
* **Have your background in mind *BEFORE* shooting:** Even if your key is flawless, it will look like shit if the actor isn't lit in a convincing manner compared to the background. If, for example, [this](http://i.imgur.com/pVWZ03G.jpg) for some reason is your background, you'll know that your actor needs a hard backlight from above and to camera right since we see a light source there. Also, we can infer from the lighting on the barrels that his main source of illumination should be from above him and pointing down, slightly from the right. You can move the source around and accent it as needed to make the actor not-ugly, but your background has provided you with some significant constraints right off the bat. For that reason, **pick your background before you shoot**, if possible. If it is not possible to do so, well, good luck! Guess as best as you can and try to find a good background.

## What Lights Should I Buy?

OK! So now you know sort of how to light a green screen and how to light a person. So now, what lights do you need? Well, really, you just need any lights. If you're on a budget, don't be afraid to get some work lights from home depot or picking up some off brand stuff on craigslist. By far the most important influence on the quality of your images will be **where and how you use the lights** rather than what types or brands of lights you are using. I cannot stress this enough. ***How* you use it will blow *what* you use out of the water**. Get as many different types of lights as you can for the money you have. That way you can do lots of sources, which can make for more intricate or nuanced lighting setups. I know you still want some hard recommendations, so I'll tell you this: Get china balls (china lanterns. Paper lanterns whatever the fuck we're supposed to call [these](http://www.filmtools.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/3/8/3877.JPG) now). They are wonderful soft lights, and if you need a hard light you can just take the lantern off and shine with the bare bulb! For bulbs, grab some 200W and 500W globes. You can check B&amp;H, Barbizon, Amazon, and probably lots of other places for these. Make sure you grab some high quality socket-and-wire sets too. You can find them at the same places. For brighter lights, like I said home depot construction lights are nice. You can also by PAR lamps relatively cheap. Try grabbing a few [Par Cans](http://www.greatneckgames.com/images/audio-visual-lighting/large/Par-Can-001.jpg). They're super useful and stupidly cheap. Don't forget to budget for some light stands as well, and maybe C-clamps and the like for rigging to things. I don't know what on earth you're shooting so it is hard to give you a grip list, but I'm sure you can figure that kind of stuff out without too much of a hassle.

# **5. What Editing Program Should I Use?**

Great question! There are several popular editing programs available for use.

## Free Editing Programs
Your choices are essentially limited to **[Davinci Resolve 14 \(Non-Studio\)](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)** and **[Hitfilm Express](https://hitfilm.com/express)**. My personal recommendation is Davinci Resolve. This is the industry standard color-grading software, and you will have free access to many of its powerful tools. The Studio version costs a few hundred dollars and unlocks multiple features (like noise reduction) without forcing you to learn a new program.

## Paid Editing Programs

1. [**Avid Media Composer \($50/mo or $1,300 for life\)**](https://shop.avid.com/ccrz__Products?viewState=ListView&amp;cartID=&amp;categoryId=a3yi0000000011qAAA&amp;&amp;store=shop&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAu4nRBRBKEiwANms5W5aTpnsZUlCqfCPrO-E6gJnPP72AtyPKGqmTgHgRDzzq8h9le_T4jxoCu1EQAvD_BwE) - This is the high-level industry standard, but is not terribly popular unless you're working at a professional post-house for big budget movies.
2. [**Adobe Premiere Pro \($20/mo\)**](http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html?sdid=KKQOM&amp;mv=search&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!193588412835!e!!g!!adobe%20premiere%20pro&amp;ef_id=Wag6FgAABW8Ed9zc:20171202234138:s) - This is the most popular industry standard editor for low-high budget productions. If you want to be an editor, you need to know this program.
3. **[Davinci Resolve 14 Studio \($300\)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1366318-REG/blackmagic_design_dv_resstud_davinci_resolve_stud_color.html)** - This is a decent editing program built into the long time industry-standard color grading suite. If you're big into color correction and grading, and your editing needs aren't wildly extreme, this is your best bet.
4. **[Final Cut Pro X \($300\)](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)** - This is the old standard for low-high budget editing, replaced now by Adobe Premiere. It is available on Mac platforms only, and is still a powerful editor despite several drawbacks compared to Premiere.

7h8eu1,5,2017-12-03,Overly simplistic string interning,CAD1997,rust,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/7h8eu1/overly_simplistic_string_interning/,"I have a small application that I'm working on that seems like it would benefit from [string interning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning). In reality, I could almost certainly get away with just using `String` everywhere, but doing it this way was more interesting!

I wanted simple though, with a static pool, and each interned string being able to be used as &amp;str. So I grabbed a `Mutex` and some `Arc`s, and got the following:

    #[macro_use] extern crate lazy_static;
    
    use std::collections::HashSet;
    use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
    
    lazy_static! {
        static ref CACHE: Mutex&lt;HashSet&lt;Arc&lt;str&gt;&gt;&gt; = Default::default();
    }
    
    pub fn interned(s: &amp;str) -&gt; Arc&lt;str&gt; {
        let mut cache = CACHE.lock().expect(""Poisoned Mutex"");
        if !cache.contains(s) {
            cache.insert(Arc::from(s));
        }
        Arc::clone(cache.get(s).unwrap_or_else(|| unreachable!(""Just added"")))
    }

But then I had a thought about what I had just wrote. There is no way to remove strings from my cache, so all the work necessary to keep track of the `Arc` ref count is pointless. So, the solution to that is obviously to keep `Weak`s in the cache and upgrading the cache's weak reference to give out. Unfortunately, due to how `Weak` works, it's not possible to use it in a simple `HashSet` this way. So I ended up going in the opposite direction: because once each string is put into the cache, it stays there, I can give out fake `&amp;'static str` because the string slice will live for the remainder of the program. So the current state of my simplistic string intern crate (for local use only) is the following: 

    #[macro_use] extern crate lazy_static;
    
    use std::collections::HashSet;
    use std::sync::Mutex;
    
    lazy_static! {
        static ref CACHE: Mutex&lt;HashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; = Default::default();
    }
    
    pub fn interned(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;'static str {
        let mut cache = CACHE.lock().expect(""Poisoned Mutex"");
        if !cache.contains(s) {
            cache.insert(s.into());
        }
        let s: &amp;str = cache.get(s).unwrap_or_else(|| unreachable!(""Just added""));
        return unsafe { std::mem::transmute(s) }
    }

The ideal situation for me would be to have a static LRU cache keeping a hold on `Weak&lt;str&gt;` and `fn interned(&amp;str) -&gt; Arc&lt;str&gt;`. I expect that this cache will get hit by a small number of very common strings, and a largeish number of strings only used a small number of times, with high temporal locality. That said, my use case has changed slightly from when I first wrote the mini-library such that every use of an interned string is now wrapped in a newtype, so I think I'll end up just using [string-interner](https://crates.io/crates/string-interner) like a sane person."

It was my most recent ex. We had a passionate year that ended awfully because I couldnt see us getting truly serious. That ended about 8 months ago.  
We broke up. I mourned. I struggled like I always do with keeping my alcohol in check. And failed a few times. I ran away to Ohio to work an internship. Then i ran away to Greece to find myself. I came back because my city was hit with a motherfuckin hurricane. I unblocked her because I was so worried she mightve died in her commutes to the hospital. It opened a line of communication that culminated with a conversation after a drunked celebration.... We had sex that night. We agreed to be friends.

And all those times of sitting in the shower and being angry at arguements long past just disappeared. All those times of accidentally remembering something good about her and then having to remember something awful to counterbalance it was gone. Its like id found forgiveness in casual sex with her. For me from her and vice versa. 

I slept over at hers last night. I left at 1030 am because we had a late night if just raging fun out at an arcade/bar and great sex and a relieving conversation about how we are each putting ourselves out on the dating scene again. We were happy for each other. Thats when I learn she would have a date today. And I want her to be happy so I'm happy for her. But she seemed so.... Guarded about the whole thing I... Got sucpisoous. Then jealous. I got kind of crazy, hours later and just a few hours ago, and bugged her until she admited she slept with him.   

I never wanted to keep her to myself. I never wanted to be that person to her. But I feel betrayed. I feel used. She doesnt think she owes me an explanation or an apology. In her eyes we agreed to be friends and just Fuck. In my eyes, I didnt think I was reduced to just a Fuck.   

But I also see her point. The timing, while it makes me feel sleezy it is all semantics. Maybe I am upset about the sex in general. Maybe I'm frustrated every date ive been on has been absolutely mediocre no matter how many dates I go on... I'm just walking around my neighborhood now.. In all black and my hands in my jacket, I'm slightly worried whomever sees me will call the cops. And getting this off my chest has helped me calm down a little. I'm going to walk home now.

7h8yay,13,2017-12-03,My big migraine fueled rant,BuachEtiveMor,migraine,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/7h8yay/my_big_migraine_fueled_rant/,"Hello folks, 

Oh yes, the migraine has hit early again this morning and it's the 3rd time this week. My life is falling apart because of my shitty marriage of 20 years with migraine. Between my depression and my migraine, my life is going to absolute shit and I really need to get some stuff of my chest with people that get it. And I hope that is okay. 

Why yes, I could complain about it to my partner (my actual one, not the shitty 20 year marriage), but since we both hit the chronic disease jackpot and if we would both do that our relationship would be nothing more than complaining - and that is what the internet is for, right? Plus, he doesn't get it. As much as he tries, he just doesn't get it. He has his own battles to fight, and I have mine. 

Anyhow. This morning I woke up in bliss. My partner was gone for the night and I could finally sleep in. The grey light of the winter shitty weather morning sky blissed through my windows, hitting me right in the face. I had slept well, i felt great, was about to get up and get a cup of coffee. 
But oh yeah, I actually wasn't alone, cause right there, in the lower left  corner of my eyesight was ziggy. Not David Bowie, but a ziggy zaggity line from hell. 

Then came the ignore phase. it wasnt a migraine. It couldnt be. 
But oh it was. 
Somehwere between stuffing food in my gob so I can take some stuff to take the edge off - oh did I mention I can't take any medication except paracetamol (tylenol for you americanos) because I also have a leaking valve in my heart - and waiting for the aura to go away I realised I am so done with this shit, and really need to complain. Im in front of my dimmed computer with sunglasses now, cause I am too sick and tired being in bed. 

I am finishing up an internship at a company now so I can hopefully hold my degree in my hands in a few weeks. I have 6 more weeks to go but I am worried my dear buddy migraine is not going to let me finish it. Not because I am not pushing through but  because I have been getting so many attacks Ive been missing a lot of time on the job (which I know isn't the best for an intern) and I when I am there I am doing a piss poor job. Ive tried to explain it to the woman that has to grade me and is also my coach in the company, and she just flat out ignores it. It's not a 'it's just a headache' or 'drink more water'. She just flat out ignores it. She stops talking when I mention it, doesn't listen in that silence and gives me a shit feeling about it all. I had to call in sick somewhere this week cause I woke up with the feeling a rugby tapdancing on my head and no feeling in my arm and face. I doubted about going but I also live 1,5 hours from the company which means I am sitting in a train for most of that, which I have dubbed the smelly tube from hell cause oh boy, do I mind smells when I have a migraine. I called into the company she just lost it on the phone. I have felt super shit since, and I know my stress about getting a migraine again at / before work hasn't made it any better. I have gone from 2 migraines a month, to 1 a week, to now 3 a week and I don't know what to do anymore honestly. The company wants me to go to my GP to try and get medication (Because it is dangerous because of my heart, I didn't get it, but surely they will put me on it now cause the company inisists, right?).  

My depression is getting worse because of all of it as well, and I am feeling more and more stressed with the day, which seems to trigger my migraine too. I don't know how to break out of this circle anymore because the internship is only 6 more weeks and I don't want to start it over. 

Around the holidays (any my birthday, and new years, and my partners birthday, and most of my families birthdays which all fall in 4 weeks) my migraines get worse, and I am worried it is going to get even worse from now on and I just don't know what to do anymore. 

I know nobody can say what is the right thing to do, but honestly it already feels good getting it all of my chest. 

Hope you all have a good day.

7h8yhm,42,2017-12-03,The Tale of One-Eyed Throgmar,Assassin2142,Pathfinder_RPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/7h8yhm/the_tale_of_oneeyed_throgmar/,"So I am a long time lurker of the Pathfinder subreddit, but this is my first time posting. I am currently the DM for a group of relatively new players playing online through roll 20, and after this particular encounter we thought it needed to be posted on reddit. This group has a large group of players, but we do not have all of them every session, thus we have a ""caravan"" of characters essentially hanging out ""afk"" in a wagon. Homebrewed in obviously, but it comes into context later.

A bit of backstory: My group is a bunch of murder hobos, but to some degree, so am I. I send them no encounters that I truly expect diplomacy to occur on. In this particular session, the 9th level party had gone through a frozen cave to avoid a large group of frost giants guarding a nearby pass. While inside the cave, they trashed two 12 headed hydras with frost bites, as well as another custom monster. Long story short, it was going quite well for them.

The last planned encounter for the night was as the group exited the cave, the Frost Giant owned mountain in their sight. A group of Frost Giants, three of them to be exact, was camped outside of this cave. Having exited the cave, someone in the party commented about the caravan. Previously, our Ranger had picked up a follower, nicknamed ""Lil' Timmy"". Now the Ranger decided, ""Let's bring Lil' Timmy out and have him go with the Oracle's undead Giant to convince these giants to just let us pass.""

My jaw dropped. I expected a bit of stealth, then a bit of murdering, but not... diplomacy... and RP diplomacy at that.

Lil' Timmy steps forward, Skeletal Giant in tow: ""Mr. Giant, would you let us pass? We have a hurt Giant who needs to go to the Giant Hospital!""

Voicing the Giant, I inadvertently fell into a pirate voice. ""Uhhh What? He's hurt... He's dead!""
Timmy: ""No, really, he desperately needs healing!""

Giant: ""No, I'm not stupid!"" *Steps forward, picks up Lil' Timmy* ""COME OUT YOU LOT! WE HEARD ABOUT YOU ADVENTURERS AND WE AREN'T STUPID!""

At this, the party Oracle steps forward. I asked him what he said, because I wanted words instead of a roll. This is what followed.

Giant: ""You are those adventurers we heard about!""

Oracle: ""I'm Rhein and I'm an intern for the National Society for the Endangered Magical Species. He was the giants disabled helper. If you let him go the giant will hug him because hugs are good for your self-esteem and we believe that a good mental state is healthy.""

At the point where he said ""hug"", I had the lead giant squeeze Lil Timmy, giving him a good ole hug, of the suffocation kind.

Oracle: ""I have my zombie kneel over in pain wailing""

Oracle's Player: ""I step forward and start attempting to fake-heal""

Another giant stepped forward and grappled the Oracle, bringing him into a hug of his own.

""Have a hug of yer own!""

At some point during this exchange, I was asked for the Giant's name. Thinking on the spot, I came up with One-Eyed Throgmar.

Giant: ""My name is One-Eyed Throgmar, maybe you heard of me! I used to be the only Frost Giant pirate in the Eastern Sea! I used to control me own ship!""

The Summoner, an Elf female who enjoys attempting to seduce her way out of encounters steps forward and initiates with a roll. 

Summoner:  ""Hey big boi, how about you put that kid down and pick ME up instead""

Giant: ""Well lookat you lass. I'll make that trade. I haven't had a good wench in me arms since I was still at sea!"" *He reaches his hand out*

Summoner:  *Props boobs up* ""Put down Timmy first.""

The Ranger steps forward and the Giant hand Timmy to him. He then motions towards the Summoner, who walks forward and is pulled in close to him. As she receives her hug, the Barbarian has an insightful thought.

Barb: ""So How'd you lose your eye?""

Giant: ""Well I was with a wench just like this one here. After a long night of debauchery and such, well, you really don't want to know what all happened, but we BOTH lost an eye fer it!""

At this, we all crack up. Everyone is laughing, when suddenly the oracle pipes up.

Oracle: "" Wait... I can restore sight!""

My jaw drops again. 

Giant: *Jaw drops* ""Ye... Ye can? I... I don't know what to say... If ye can really do that, I have a deal for you. If ye restore me sight, my men and I can get you into the King Frost Giant's chambers... Alone. You lot can kill him, and I can finally go and get me ship and me crew back. If that's not good enough, you, Ranger... One of your fellow rangers from the Barrier was ambushed and killed by the Giant King about fifty years ago. He still keeps his bow as a trophy.""

With that, he released the Summoner, the Oracle came forward and returned his sight, and the session ended with these words:

""I'm TWO-EYED THROGMARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!""

After that, we were all dying, and someone asked about leveling/xp, so I just leveled them up to 10. 

Anyways, I hope you all enjoyed the lack of murder hobo-ness as we all did!

Edit: Formatting fixed. Sorry about that."

After 8 day streak and it's after many many failed streaks of which I haven't even crossed 11 days. With determination to finish this streak ending this year with one month, I started with full confidence and I never felt this positive vibes ever before until today that I relapsed. I feel so horrible like I've committed a crime that I can regret for my whole life. The reason is of my uncontrolled urge caused because of YouTube. After relapse I've looked at the date and noticed that  it's 3 and very much disappointed that it isn't 31 of november so that I can complete one month by 2018. But I won't give up and hope with great determination to complete one month streak by first week of 2018. 

I'm going for an internship and gonna explore a new city this whole month and it's a good distraction for me to pass this test. While writing this I feel horrible and also big motivational vibe to my success.

###Personal diary entry

I'm rather silent lately. Part of the reason is because I work a lot of course, but another part of the reason is because I'm in a period of intellectual crisis. It's easy to write long essays when you find yourself convinced of the content. It's more difficult when you're full of doubt. I spend quite a lot of time in silent contemplation.

Every intellectual position is an outgrowth of your own experiences. In my own case, I find myself gradually divorcing myself from my former girlfriend. The peculiar thing about love is that you find a blending together of your concept of self and the other.  As much as I found myself in love with her, I find myself gradually admitting my disgust with her. It's difficult when your sense of self has merged to such a degree, to answer the question of what you truly believe yourself and what you have assimilated.

She has a fetish for an era when my ancestors worked the fields, presumably for her ancestors. Our longing for the past and our love of nature and misanthropy were perhaps compatible, but with the rose tinted glasses removed, I gradually start to find myself able to observe the differences in our mentality. It feels as if she has always considered me beneath her at some level. 

I had a breaking point on Friday, when I headed back to Rotterdam and was stopped by some middle-aged white lady on the street begging for change, who seemed as if she could just as easily have been my mother. She started to cry and said that she would probably not have enough money by the end of the evening to get admitted to the homeless shelter. A cynic might say I should be able to easily see through such an act, but the cynic ignores that at the end of the day I don't have to publicly humiliate myself in such a manner to earn a living.

As I have said before, I consider myself a socialist of some sort. I'm not particularly impressed with any of the Marxist-Leninist projects that have unfolded around the world.  However, I'm not particularly impressed with the United States of Oil and Opioids either. I used to think that the answer is simple and the problem is technology, but the reality remains a bit more complex than that. 

Agriculture doesn't disappear overnight no matter how much I tried to convince myself of such a thing and I'm not looking forward to a repetition of serfdom either. I don't believe in rejecting the world in favor of some hypothesized afterlife either. Religion is what keeps the poor from slaughtering the rich. 

To make everything even more complex, I don't look forward to the idea of Bill Gates, Peter Thiel or Elon Musk having their heads chopped off beneath a guillotine either. You started out as a kid who needed facial reconstructive surgery after bullies pushed you down the stairs and now you're planning on colonizing Mars and addressing existential threats. Ideologies seem to require us to selectively turn off our empathic instincts. I have always been bad at cheering for a team.

What does that leave me with? I don't really know anymore. I think I'm now a Situationist or some kind of Libertarian Marxist. Anarcho-Primitivism started out as an anti-authoritarian form of Marxism with Perlman, we can't pretend that we emerged ex nihilo from a vacuum. 

Like most of the left, Anarcho-Primitivism has been assimilated by the bourgeoisie, whose primary virtue is their self-criticism. Today we have stock brokers who break a two day fast by jogging through Central Park and eating a pound of grass-fed beef, while saving money in hopes of setting up a permaculture farm one day.

The most boring bourgeois form of the left is of course the new left that now dominates progressive discourse, who rejected class struggle in the 1960's, in favor of women's rights and sexual and ethnic minorities. This is how blue-collar country-boys end up publicly humiliated and unemployable because feminist college students with trust funds find out about their racist Facebook posts. White working class indigenous British boys are now least likely to graduate college as a consequence of this cultural transition. 

If you were to speak out in defense of the working classes, you would inevitably alienate yourself from the modern left. ""Racist"" has turned into a term of abuse against the white working class, as part of the natural human tendency towards class conflict. Always remember the following heuristic: Anyone who uses the term ""racist"" without a shred of irony has no desire to represent the collective interests of the proletariat.

Keep in mind that the open border policies in Europe and other first world countries are not genuinely a product of empathy towards the third world. If aiding the third world was the goal, the solution would be foreign aid. The real goal seems to be bourgeois class warfare against the indigenous working class. If you have enough refugees with PTSD or rape traumas stuffed into high-rise apartment complexes, a pink-haired overweight feminist with a sociology degree who grew up in the suburbs and for whom fellating her way into an internship is obviously not an option doesn't have to fear having to settle for a job that doesn't require a college degree.

So with that said, I'm lately reading quite a bit about cryptocurrency and hope to learn more about how they function. I fear that we currently live in a moment of opportunity, during which it is decided what kind of role this new technology will take in our lives. In the early 20th century, cars were forced to adjust to the behavior of pedestrians. A man with a flag was required to walk in front of a car and people insisted that cars should not be allowed to drive fast enough to disrupt the natural pace of traffic and the social function of the streets, where children freely played with each other and neighbors met one another. 

All of this fell apart when the car industry introduced the term ""jaywalker"" into the public dialogue, implicating that the street exists for cars to drive in, with humans existing on the periphery. The street is now the domain of the cars and we are forced to adjust the totality of society to the automobile. Today we're asking a similar question: Does cryptocurrency exist to serve humanity, or do humans exist to serve cryptocurrency, which in turn serves the crypto-oligarchs? I hope to contribute to the development of a cryptocurrency that helps to prevent the latter scenario.

7hb2uc,2,2017-12-03,A somewhat letter to my ex-boyfriend,loveAC,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7hb2uc/a_somewhat_letter_to_my_exboyfriend/,"EDIT: This is really long just had to get it off my chest. No need to read aha

Not even going to bother with salutations. This is how our relationship was to me.

It's been a month since I've broken up with you and honestly I do not miss you as a person I just miss having a person. I was with you for over a year and I loved you, still kinda do but that wasn't enough. I honestly think that I was settling because you didn’t even treat me like a gf for a lot of our relationship, I just stuck around because I don’t believe that anyone would actually want to be with me. 

I honestly shouldn’t even have agreed to be your gf in the first place. We didn’t even go on an actual date yet but I agreed because I liked you and never really had a bf so I didn’t know what to expect. You also told me when I was on the train home that you kind of recently broke up with your ex, so I felt like a rebound but I shoved it off.  

Right after we became official I went away to school for a couple of months and I was only about 2 hours away. Not once did you visit me then.  You would also constantly ignore me and when you did answer me it was short answers. You didn’t even call me or answer my calls. I came one weekend to visit you; of course you were late picking me up from the station as always.  We had sex but you made me take plan b because you didn’t believe me when I said I took birth control pills even though I showed you and we used a condom. After sex you wanted to take me out for food I said anywhere but fast food because I don’t like it much but lo and behold you took me to McDonalds. So much for first actual date huh? I told you this so we end up going to another restaurant in the same plaza. You complained about everything we were eating. 

I went back to school that weekend feeling like shit. I honestly should not have even been with you but I was lonely I guess. I was in school for another month or so, you were still ignoring me pretty much, barely responding and never once did you call me. You wouldn’t even add me on social media so I deleted my requests yet you have the audacity to tell me I’m mean for doing so? 

I come back home asking to go see you but you tell me you’re busy. I ask you what you’re busy with but you tell me to mind my own business. Obviously I’m hurt that you haven’t seen me in over a month much less spoke to me properly and you don’t even want to see me. You eventually tell me because you are watching the finals of some sports thing and I say that’s fine you can see me another day but can only watch that today.

I finally see you and you’re late again. I’m crying about you constantly ignoring me and not treating me like a gf. You kept saying sorry and how you’ll change. I gave you another chance but deep down I really shouldn’t have. You respond to me but barely, you tell me it’s because you got a second job so I let it slide. Even when I know you’re not working you still don’t bother with me. Why did I stay with you?

Like a week later I had enough. I was busy doing my online course work and you had texted me but I didn’t check my phone. After an hour passed you texted me again saying why I wasn’t responding. Oh I’m sorry I didn’t realize I had to text you back within minutes when you only respond to me days after I text you sometimes. I tell you this and that I was busy doing school work. You proceeded to call me a mean name for saying that. I broke up with you via text because you wouldn’t pick up my calls and I’m not wasting close to $20 on public transportation just to break up with you as we were only together a few months. 

You kept saying sorry and how you’ll change. I gave you another chance and you were an ass. You even threatened to commit suicide, which had me still responding to you. I finally tell you to stop talking to me but you said it would be hard to. You did it for months what difference does it make now?

I was stupid, after a month you started talking to me again. I took you back thinking that you actually changed. You told me you didn’t really respond to me in those first months because you lost interest in me but didn’t want to end things when I was in school. I was the only one trying then I should have done it instead of waiting around for you. 

I was back at home working an internship not in school for a good number of months.  Things were going great I guess, I was seeing you once a week usually. The only thing was, was that I was practically always the one to ask to see you you never initiated it. I would ask and you would say, “only if you want to”. Of course I wanted to see you you were my bf. And of course I would be the one going to see you spending almost $10 one way but you had the car and yet always late to get me from the station. You said that you drove me home all the time so that should be enough or to count for you going to me. 

You finally meet my family so you actually come over to my place now, of course always later than the time you said. Your excuse was that you were at the gym or watching a game. Thanks so you couldn’t go earlier to the gym or sacrifice not watching one game? We barely saw each other as it was and you didn’t seem to care. When I went over to yours you barely introduced me to you family and they seemed to hate me. I told you I have to be home by this time as my parents are strict but you always leave last minute no matter how much I say I have to leave. You didn’t care that I would constantly be yelled at cause you wouldn’t care if your parents yelled at you. 

Things are fine as they can get I guess but you were still giving me short responses and making me out to be the bad guy when I tried to tell you how I was feeling or my concerns in our relationship. When I did all you said was “ok” or said I was crazy. You did nothing to change the situation. I knew I couldn’t change you. Why did I stay with you?

At one point you were constantly talking about this one co-worker you had saying how awesome she was. She was your friend I get it but did you have to constantly rub it in my face that I basically wasn’t her? You would tell me stories of you pretty much flirting with her but you thought nothing of it. You also told me how you guys would pretend to be in a relationship at work as a joke. That joke wasn’t funny. So while you were out playing house with this oh so great coworker what were you doing with me? You were ignoring me and losing interest in me. This really upset me and all you had to say about it was “sorry for telling you”. No not sorry for doing it, sorry for telling me. This was a recurring problem in our relationship, as I could not get over it. At one point you’re texting her and I see it, you’re not hiding it. She goes on how these guys wouldn’t hit on her at the club or whatever and you tells her not to worry as she’s really beautiful. That would’ve been fine, a friend consoling a friend telling them they’re beautiful.  But at that point you have never even told me that I was beautiful. Why can you tell her that but not even me? When it was brought up after the fact you said it was just words. Why the fuck did I stay with you? 

Our 1 year anniversary comes and no you don’t come and pick me up at my house. I take public transportation to your area. Again you are late by almost 30 minutes. Your excuse was that your classmate was talking to you and you didn’t want to be rude. It’s so great that your classmate is more important to you than me. Our anniversary sucked, all we did was go to the mall (I hate shopping) and eat food. You didn’t even get me a present so you offered to buy me underwear. You promised me dessert at this one place I loved. We go back to your house, you tell me that we’re not going for dessert anymore because you were too full. Were just laying in bed it was nice I guess but I didn’t want to fall asleep because I had to be home soon. My dad calls me saying I have to be home. I tell you this but you don’t care. You’re just laying in bed while I sit up. You’re upset with me because you just wanted to cuddle but I said I had to be home. I get up to leave to take the train home but you get mad. You eventually take me home. 

I go back to school for a few months and hey you actually visit me this time. It was a good weekend I guess but you were upset at me because I kept pestering to get up and go places. You told me that we’d go there at x time, but when x time came you kept saying 10 more minutes. At that point you were watching YouTube not spending time with me really. 

You actually were responding to my texts and calls when we were 2 hours apart so I was happy for that. When I go back home is when things upset me. I say I want to see you on your days off but you say you’re not sure cause you might be tired. You might be too tired to see your gf you haven’t seen in over a month, thanks. I even offered to go to yours but you didn’t want me at your house for some reasons.  Why did I stay with you? 

Things go fine I guess I do want to end things at one point but you convince me you have changed. I got tickets to this amusement park because you’ve never been there. I don’t like it there too much as it gives me bad headaches but I wanted to do it for you. I asked if you would pick me up and you laugh. I know the amusement park is closer to your house but it would’ve been nice to not have to take the train to your house. I take the train to your area and you are upset that I get there so early. You said before 9 and I was there before 9 wtf? You proceed to tell me that I can’t go to your house for reasons and I’m like ok. So I wait and you tell me to take the bus from the station. I didn’t want to wait so I just walked as it wasn’t too far. I get to your house and you said not to come in yet so I just walk around the area while you’re shitting. You made me wait 40 minutes. You could’ve told me to wait at the station but you made me wait like a creeper outside. The amusement park was fine even though we left early because of you. 

You were really sick one day so I go to your house (the second time that whole summer) to take care of you. While I’m taking care of you I just glance in your bedroom garbage as I’m throwing something out and I see a bunch of opened and used condoms. Obviously they weren’t from me because I hadn’t been over to your house pretty much all summer. You tell me that you were just masturbating with them, which I did believe because I have heard of guys doing that. But I really don’t know why would you not want me over the whole summer and when I do that’s what I find? Why was I with you, I didn’t even trust you?

My birthday was coming up and I asked you to book it off. This was the second time ever I asked you to book a day off. I told you well in advance but you kept telling me that you don’t know if you have it off yet. Everything was up to your schedule. When we’d see each other it was up to your work schedule, which I get, but it was also up to how you were feeling that day. You were always too tired to see me. Bullshit. You were upset with me because I kept asking you if you had my fucking birthday off. Well you didn’t but you had a half-day which was good enough.

I go back to school again and things were fine I guess. But you were back to ignoring me a lot again. You say it is because of school but dude I was in school too. Most of the time when you would talk to me a lot it was because you needed help with school stuff.  When I would forget to text you good morning you wouldn’t say good morning first you would ask me why I didn’t say good morning. I know many instances when you were awake before me but you didn’t even bother to say it but expected me to. I would say I miss you but all you would say it has only been x weeks. So are my feelings not valid, was I not able to miss you? 

I wanted a break from you not a break up. I wanted you to actually realize if you actually appreciated my presence in your life. I said one week no contact yet you still contacted me asking for help in school stuff. You started trying again a bit after that I guess but a couple more weeks you were back to your old ways. 

I had enough of being on the back burner in your life. You put no effort into this relationship when I did. I was not happy. You only tried when I wanted to leave. You were a shitty bf. I guess I was settling when I was with you because I honestly should not have been with you in the first place. I finally left for good before you were planning to visit me. I basically planned that visit for you but I broke it off before you could. There was no point in seeing you when I checked out of the relationship long before.

I really hope you learn from this shitty relationship and actually treat your future gf the way a decent bf should. You can still text me all you want but I will not respond anymore. Maybe there was a reason I was your 12th gf, you don’t know how to treat people you claim to love. You were my first bf and I wasted over a year on you.

7hb6au,1,2017-12-03,Steve Chen appointed to co-lead newly formed Berkeley Blockchain Lab,ExPwner,EchoLinkInfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/EchoLinkInfo/comments/7hb6au/steve_chen_appointed_to_colead_newly_formed/,"Steve Chen, founder of EchoLink, a credentials-verification blockchain project, has been appointed industry co-lead of the new Berkeley Blockchain Lab, a platform for students to gain real-world experience working with blockchain technology. Chen came up with the idea behind EchoLink while serving as the founding engineering director at a NYSE mobile technology company, where he saw the opportunity to create efficiency and value by storing data around engineering graduates’ degrees on the blockchain. As he embarks on helping to lead the Berkeley Blockchain Lab, Chen will draw upon his experience in both enterprise technology and entrepreneurship.
The Berkeley Blockchain Lab is run by the Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology (SCET), and will give Berkeley students one unit for participating in the EchoLink project through The Berkeley Blockchain Lab toward the five required to earn a Certificate in Entrepreneurship &amp; Technology. The SCET has helped create the foundation of Berkeley’s entrepreneurship ecosystem by launching institutions and programs such as SkyDeck, the Fung Institute for Engineering Leadership, the Engineering Leadership Professional Program, Global Venture Lab, and cultivating an extensive network of Silicon Valley and global partners.
The focus of the first Berkeley Blockchain Lab project will be on off-chain data inputs, distributed storage, and web-based blockchain query systems. App development will be evaluated with the objective of minimizing the cost of running decentralized applications (dapps). A secondary objective will be developing a Dapp that can process data in batches. The application focus will be bringing trust-based credentials from off chain including degree certificates onto various blockchains.
EchoLink in partnership with the Berkeley Blockchain Lab has ambitious goals. EchoLink seeks to create its own utility token, the EchoLink token (EKO), which will be an exchange medium within the EchoLink system to pay fees between users and other participants in the system. The data providers (schools and individual students) from public blockchains, alliance blockchains, and even private blockchains will be easily rewarded with EchoLink tokens and the EchoLink token will be used to establish an international education reputation and skill level marketplace.
With the EchoLink token as a common method of value exchange in the system, EchoLink seeks to provide a common measure of the quality of education in different countries, institutions, and disciplines that can be measured in a consistent way.
​To get involved in the Berkeley Blockchain Lab or to get involved as an educational institution seeking to pilot the EchoLink technology, please reach out to Steven Chen at steve@echolink.tech.
 
 
 
More about UC Berkeley:
UC Berkeley’s initial 2-credit “DeCal” blockchain course was supported by the Blockchain at Berkeley student organization which has 567 members in its closed Facebook group and also has Meetup and Slack channels that are extremely active. Collin Chin, UC Berkeley ’19 a current electrical engineering and computer sciences junior, was able to secure an internship at leading blockchain startup Consensys as a software engineering intern the summer of 2017 after getting his first taste of developing use cases for blockchain as a developer at Blockchain at Berkeley in the Fall of 2016.
Collin now serves on the Executive Board at Blockchain at Berkeley and handles recruiting of members and execution of events. Max Fang, President at Blockchain at Berkeley, also involved with the DeCal course, also spent his previous summer as a Developer Advocate Intern at Lightning Labs in SF and is a double major in computer science and economics.
UC Berkeley has been experimenting with programming around blockchain for the past few years, with one of its initial tests around demand for blockchain related programming coming through the Blockchain Technology Collider in March 2016 which was launched to give undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to explore emerging opportunities at the intersection of finance, security and cryptography and have a chance to win $5,000. The event brought together those in engineering, finance, economics, mathematics, across the Berkeley campus. With the success of the Collider, Berkeley set out to launch a new venture called the Berkeley Blockchain Lab, and Chen at the EchoLink project was appointed the industry co-lead. The Berkeley Blockchain Lab will allow students to work on real-world blockchain applications using EchoLink’s open source API.
UC Berkeley is an ideal first pilot educational institution because of its active student blockchain enthusiast community. The student leaders of Blockchain at Berkeley come from diverse professional experiences including serving as analysts of investment banks and software engineers at local tech startups.
There are more than twenty Nobel Memorial Prize Laureates in Economics affiliated with UC Berkeley. With Berkeley’s reputation for strong economics and computer science programs, combined with its culture of student activism forged in the 1960s, the school is well-positioned culturally to take advantage of the focus on decentralization and the elimination of “middlemen” and central authorities that blockchain startups often promote. Berkeley’s ability to work inter-departmentally and pursue blockchain from the economics and technical angles proves to be its main competitive advantage. 
 
More about EchoLink:
EchoLink is building a blockchain-based system that provides verified education, skill, and work experience information. Taking advantage of blockchain technology’s immutability and time-stamp functionality, EchoLink provides users with trusted information regarding a job candidate’s education, skill, and work experience. EchoLink provides savings to recruiters in time and financial resources. The EchoLink system can be also be used for additional industries, such as banking, finance, general notary service.
Chen hopes to have the first batch of credentials stored on the platform by Spring 2018. With students opting in and registrars providing verified information, the information will then be accessible to recruiting partners and will save recruiters looking to hire top talent both time and financial resources."
7hbfs3,3,2017-12-03,[Diplomacy] A Discussion of Two Defense Ministers,HumansOfDecatur,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/7hbfs3/diplomacy_a_discussion_of_two_defense_ministers/,"Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu and two of his top military research officials stepped off their plane at Zvartnots International Airport, where they were eagerly greeted by Armenian Defense Minister Vigen Sargsyan and his men. Soon after arrival Shoigu, Sargsyan, and their respective teams were whisked away in a government limousine to the Department of Defense's Conference hall. It would be here that the talk would be held on how to develop modern anti-air and ground artillery. The discussions began. 

&gt; General Shoigu, before your arrival the Armenian Defense Department has been discussing the need for advanced rocket artillery for quite some time. Nearly all of our inventory is composed weaponry designed in the Soviet period. We hope to change this. We are requesting a re-design of the modern TOS-1 anti-ground rocket artillery system. Along with this, we need to buy or develop advanced anti-air materials, which will likely be done through cooperation with the [KB Mashinostroyeniya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KB_Mashinostroyeniya) Cooperation. Both of these new found weapons added to the arsenal of the Russian Federation and the Armenian Republic. Another factor about this weapon is that it cannot be sold to anyone except Russia and Armenia for the next ten years, as its firepower, design, launching ability, and every other aspect of it needs to be classified. 

Another glass of wine was poured for the men by an intern while Sargsyan's research head got a designs out his suitcase. After carefully laying them out the discussion began again, this time with Sargsyan's research specialist talking. 

&gt; The TOS-1 variation that we're proposing will use a lot of the same feature as the current TOS-1, but will have significant variations as well. The most obvious of which is that it is to be stationary on a rotating platform. While we plan to keep the fuel-air explosive ammunition and most of its interior design, it's necessary that the new design have a longer range and increased accuracy, which can be achieved with new technological developments. After the TOS-1 upgrade in 2001, making the TOS-1A, the range was brought up to six kilometers. Once completed and tested these stationary TOS-1's will be placed on four meter platforms. With this height and the advancements in the range capabilities the goal is to have a 12 kilometer range, which we believe is fully possible seeing as they're on a four meter platform and are stationary, therefore allowing a much heavier weight. In correspondence with his heavier weight it will also have a 4x10 missile grid, instead of the normal 3x8. This modified TOS-1D, as they'll be called, will be used on the battlefield as a defensive system that when put alongside extensive anti-air and other forms of artillery can defend a border against much larger forces. Along with defensive, it can also be used in siege situations, where a battle is expected to be concentrated in a specific area for an extended period of time. 

Here the research man stopped talking and a bald man, Sargsyan's financial assistant, began his short speel. 

&gt; The funding will come from both of our nations, with the Russian Federation covering 75% of the funding and Armenia 25%. While it may initially seem uneven, our vast GDP disparity is taken into account, and our 25% funding is a much larger portion of our GDP than your 75%. We expect the annual expense into this program to be about 20 Million a year. We expect development to be done in three years. 

[M] I did extensive research into cost of developing new artillery and couldn't find an accurate measure so I estimated 20 Million seeing as the TOS-1A costs ~3.5 Million to make. If it is vastly under/overvalued I will edit the cost. This is my first official R&amp;D post so if anything's wrong just tell me. "
7hbko1,4,2017-12-03,The Anime Con and Various Sleeping Arrangements,ohimactuallybi,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/7hbko1/the_anime_con_and_various_sleeping_arrangements/,"Sorry an update took so long. House chores and work have swamped me!!

I left off talking about the first instances of failing to set up boundaries, and Ex's small bits of gaslighting by conveniently not responding to texts he didn't like. Now it's time to move forward a couple of weeks to the holidays and beyond.

I didn't start my internship until the end of January because Disney has interns coming in on a rolling basis so as not to swamp the trainers. So I had a month to kill. 

I'd brought all of my belongings back to my hometown with the intention of finding someone to sub-let my apartment so I wouldn't have to pay double rent. (I had no grounds to break my lease with my apartment despite being sick of management.) (Spoiler alert, I never found anyone and paid double rent for six months.)

My Ex and his dad actually helped bring some of my things back, which was very nice of them. It's how my parents met Ex and his father. My dad was well-behaved, my mom was thankful for the help, there was only one instance where my dad wanted a photo of me and Ex and Ex and I thought it would be cute to smooch. My dad did not find this amusing. Other than that, things went great.

I spent winter break up with my family. It was emotional because I was leaving to go the farthest away I'd ever been for the longest ever time. Still, I texted Ex frequently and we'd call to talk every other day or so. 

There was an anime con in my hometown scheduled for before I was going to leave. My friend and I had found out about it at the previous con. Lo and behold, Ex was planning on going, too. My friend also got her grandparents to let us stay with them to cut back on hotel costs. Friend's mom would simply drive us in the morning. (She was also staying with the grandparents--her parents--that weekend). (My friend's parents didn't trust her driving around a big city 😑, but that's not my story to tell nor a story for this subreddit.) 

In addition to all of this, my sister was going to come to this con. I was very excited. After the con, I was going to hitch a ride back to college town to stay for a week and say goodbye to everyone there. More on that later. 

Considering Ex's motorcycle sucked (see bot for details), he paid to take the airport shuttle from college town to my hometown. The thing ran several times a day because my hometown had the larger airport. All I had to do was pick him up from the terminal. After that, he'd stay at my place for a night before we'd head over to my friend's grandparents'. I took my mom to work and used her car to pick him up.

In the car, Ex talked about how excited he was to sleep next to me. I explained to him that my parents were fairly traditional and he'd likely sleep on the couch. He seemed bummed, but understanding.

We had a great evening with my parents and Ex was on his best behavior. He enjoyed showing off his cosplay props and talked about how he'd gotten a lot of weird looks for bringing a sword on the shuttle. Or, rather, he stowed it. Thinking back on it, it's a wonder the shuttle let him bring live steel, but whatever. 

Then, despite our earlier talk, he asked my dad about ""overnight cuddling"". I wanted to die. I thought for sure my dad would kick Ex to the curb. Cue three hours of me explaining how I didn't put him up to this (in fact, I'd expressly told him not to suggest it), how I know the rules of my dad's house and didn't for a minute think of disrespecting him in such a way, etc, etc. I had to be vague at times because I didn't want to admit that we'd already slept in the same bed before. Thankfully, that part of the conversation happened without Ex in the room. I'm not convinced he'd've been able to help himself and not spill the beans. 

The end result was me sleeping in my parents room, my Ex sleeping in the bed set out for me, and my dad sleeping on the couch. It was a train wreck and Ex would mope about this for months to come. However, it did have me and several of my friends laughing at variations of the phrase ""heaven forbid two people SLEEP together.""

The next day, we went to my friend's grandparents' house. They're nice people and they showed us where everyone would be sleeping. Seeing as they, too, had more traditional values, Ex and I would not be sharing a bed. I had expected something like this, to the point where I hadn't even been planning on suggesting otherwise. Besides, my younger sister was with me, I had to keep an eye on her (she wasn't even old enough to drive yet). 

So my sister and I got the guest bed, my friend and her mom got the hide-a-bed in the office, and Ex got the couch. Cue moping. 

Aside from that, he whined about other things all weekend. Like how I wasn't done with all of my cosplays yet and had to spend time with my friend and sister getting them all together (the three of us did a group cosplay one of the days). Time that I could have been spent sitting next to him as he attempted to upload photos from his phone since there was no WiFi. There wasn't great cell service either at the time. It was a pseudo-retirement community. He complained about that. He also complained about the food (or lack of it.) He was generally ungrateful and honestly embarrassing. My friend and I spent years convincing her parents and grandparents that my sister and I are decent people, it's just my Ex who's awful. 

The con itself went all right. I had a lot of fun. Though, I did notice that Ex liked taking a lot of upskirt photos of girls. And he flirted. A lot. Flirtatious personality or not, it made me mad at the time. Knowing what I know now about polyam relationships and how to handle jealousy, I have to wonder if he's the type of person who is trying to fit a poly-self into mono-relationships. Even still, polyam relationships have boundaries. And I'd never told him I was okay with him acting as such with other women. In fact, I'd expressed concerns. Concerns which he blew off. 

After the con, my friend's mom drove us back to college-town. It was a fantastically awkward car ride. My friend's mom kept trying to talk religion. My Ex is very staunchly anti organized religion. His moral code is driven by science and ""bettering humanity"". Up until that point, he and I had mostly avoided the subject because I wasn't sure how to talk with him about our differing beliefs. (I'm Christian.) 

My friend and I are aware of the difference in beliefs between him and I and kept trying to keep her mom from poking the topic with a stick. She kept asking ""well what church do you go to?!?"" Among other questions of this type. And my friend and I trying to keep him from putting his foot in his mouth and her mom from badgering him unnecessarily. 

Tangentially related to this, my Ex was mad that I wasn't going to be staying with him the whole week and some change I was in town. Despite me no longer having a bus pass (I didn't pay to renew it since I'd be leaving), I was planning on either paying for daily fare, or hitching rides with various friends. I didn't want to be stuck at his house on one end of town, dependent solely on him. He was greatly offended by this fact. Why wouldn't I want to start and end my days with him? And of course he'd gladly drive me wherever I wanted to go. Thankfully, I told him it wasn't happening that way and that was that.

In total, I probably spent two or three nights at his place and bounced around to different friends' houses for the rest. He resented this and complained about it frequently. I gave up arguing with him and would just start to change the subject. It didn't occur to me that under normal circumstances, relationships don't involve one person trying to control the other by monopolizing transportation. 

Somewhere in there, we also started talking about how we were going to handle long distance. We'd talked about it vaguely prior to that, but never really talked about logistics. In a self-depricating conversation, Ex started bemoaning how he didn't deserve me and I was too good to be ""tied down"" to him while away at Disney. He was fishing. Like a complete sucker I told him everything he wanted to hear. How of course I would be faithful and how I wanted to be with him and I'd text all the time and call every day because I really wanted to be with him.

7hbpf9,2,2017-12-03,China sentences Taiwanese man to 5 years in prison for advocating democracy,autotldr,autotldr,https://www.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7hbpf9/china_sentences_taiwanese_man_to_5_years_in/,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-taiwan-china-sentence-20171128-story.html) reduced by 79%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; A court in China sentenced a man from Taiwan to five years in prison Tuesday over his advocacy of democracy, a verdict that could drive the rival governments further apart instead of nudging them toward Beijing&amp;#039;s eventual goal of unification.

&gt; The sentence, which can be appealed nor shortened for parole, will deter Taiwanese from going to nearby China for work, travel or business, some on the island say.

&gt; The island&amp;#039;s ruling Democratic Progressive Party, for which Lee had worked in a branch office 10 years ago, said in a statement that the defendant had been &amp;quot;Concerned about the development of democracy and freedom in mainland China and shared and exchanged views with friends about Taiwan&amp;#039;s democratic experience.""

&gt; China encourages younger Taiwanese to come as interns or employees of start-ups, a chance to earn money in an $11.2-trillion-plus economy that is growing at nearly 7% annually, faster than Taiwan&amp;#039;s.

&gt; &amp;quot;A lot of the pundits, they&amp;#039;re saying China is trying to send a message, and the message is once you&amp;#039;re in China, don&amp;#039;t do anything against the local laws or regulations,&amp;quot; said Raymond Wu, managing director of the Taipei-based political consulting group e-telligence.

&gt; Government opinion surveys since 2015 have found that at least 70% of Taiwanese prefer autonomy from China.

7hbuy1,0,2017-12-03,47[M4F] weekend with my daughter’s roommate,ClearlyALoon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7hbuy1/47m4f_weekend_with_my_daughters_roommate/,"I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa.... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are."
7hc75g,0,2017-12-03,"If any changes to the FO are going to happen during the off-season, the scouting staff should be gone before anyone else.",Lumpycentaur9,Browns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Browns/comments/7hc75g/if_any_changes_to_the_fo_are_going_to_happen/,"Think about it. After all of the coaching and general manager changes and poor drafting that has taken place over the years, the scouting department has gone relatively untouched. 

Bobby Vega, current Director of College Scouting- He’s been here since 2004, then promoted to Director of College Scouting in 2007. 

Chisom Opara, current Director of Player Personnel- He’s been here since 2005. 

Ken Kovach, current Vice President of Player Personnel- He’s been here since 2013. 

Mike Cetta, current Director of Scouting- He’s been here since 2013 as an intern, then hired full time in 2014. 

Dan Saganey, current Director of Pro Scouting- He’s been here since 2009. 

So after all of the GMs and head coaches getting ~~slaughtered~~ fired, and being known for not being able to scout and identify talent, then why has the scouting department gone under the radar and not been changed after all these years? If anyone should go in the front office, it should be the scouting staff. They’ve shown time and time again that they can’t identify talent to save their lives. They deserve to be unemployed after all of the draft and free agent busts over the years that have run this organization into the ground. This is an important off-season, if not *the* most important off-season in our franchise history. We need to select quality talent, and this scouting staff has not been able to identify and help select franchise-changing talent. They need to go at all costs, loyalty be damned. "
7hca1m,1,2017-12-03,USA University Funding advice for UK Based Student,lewisnewson,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7hca1m/usa_university_funding_advice_for_uk_based_student/,"Hello Guys,
So to keep it brief, I am 18 years old and currently have a full-time job as a website developer in the UK (earning £15k a year as a Junior, however this is going up within the next couple of months). For many years now my ambition has been to move to the US to live and work, however I have come to understand just how difficult it is find employment out there without some serious experience behind you or a US degree. So, After alot of consideration I think the best channel for me to go down would be to study Web Design and Development in a US university, with the hope then of gaining an internship at a company willing to sponsor a H-1B work VISA.
However, I come from quite a poor financial background and so there is no way that I am going to be able to afford the tuition fees on my own ($77k for the tuition, excluding room and board). I've dug into some research in regards with Scholarships but am just getting lost amongst it all and am finding it really overwhelming trying to find ones that I am able to apply for and that will also cover the costs. I've considered taking out a Loan to cover it but the UK government won't lend out money to International Students who are not returning back to a UK University/Job and I can't take out a Loan from a US bank without a cosigner who is a US Citizen. I am completely okay with the idea of getting a job whilst im studying to help put towards the costs but from what I understand this cannot happen until I am in my second year of studying (due to restrictions with foreign nationals working). I should also mention that $40k is required upfront, before the course starts which covers the first couple of semesters, application fees etc.
So at this point I don't really know what direction to go in.

Does anyone have any advice at all or has been through something like this themselves and can provide me with some guidance?
Im open to any advice people have to offer.

Thank you very much for your time!"

 I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything, if you read the prompts you will realize I am flexible and open to all sort of things so please don't feel shy of pitching your idea. A bonus if it is something related to r/breeding r/impregPersonals

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the boys had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. In fact, this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (+18??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left aim charge of a few errands because as your parents have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**growing into teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. You started to grow up to (?age), paying more attention to the opposite, boys started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way you saw her dad...which, after all, is everything you can wish for in a man of your own... Without realizing you started to imagine him touching you....kissing you...and even taking you on his bed...such as every night or so you hears your mum moan as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes you a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, your mum (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. You are at home waiting to have your man(dad) around to try something more than just imagining....today you are willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent young adult girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) Summer vacations and you invited 2 of your best friends. During the night sleepover you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them  and there is no internet available, some of your friends are more experienced but still doesn't quite satisfy you, also no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just not slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** (none are deal breakers) are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks) coupled with thick girls, being corrupted/mind broken, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for *how you might look*: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/
*Things I would would like to see* r/girlsinyogapants r/seethroughleggings r/visiblepantyline r/cameltoe 


remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :).

7hcrby,1,2017-12-03,Me [26 M] and my girlfriend [26 F] of 4 years just broke up. We were long distance.,m15t3r,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hcrby/me_26_m_and_my_girlfriend_26_f_of_4_years_just/,"We met towards the end of college, but we instantly clicked. The very first night, when we actually spent time together for the first time, we were talking at my place, we were in my room.... just talking all night, for hours. She slept over - nothing happened. It was just a really good night. After that I felt like she was someone I really knew. A couple weeks later, we're basically dating. Not long after, we're sleeping together every night. However, we were on different paths at that time - we grew up on opposite coasts. She was going to med school directly from college (not too far from her home / where we went to college), I was taking time off and was planning on moving back to the opposite coast, where I grew up. So we didn't really call our thing a ""relationship."" It just... was. But we were so incredibly close. We went to senior formal together, we sat next to each other during graduation, everything... the last few days before school ended and we were parting were sad. We both cried in each other's arms each night. We had no plan as far as what we were going to do. I ended up asking her if she'd like me to visit her, she said yes. She was staying with her parents that summer before med school, so I flew over there and stayed for a week and a half or so. We decided we wanted to continue to be in each other's lives, and we'd continue this relationship long distance.

She started school, I flew over again and went to her med school formal. We spent Thanksgiving and Christmas / New Year's together. I ended up finding a job near her med school and we moved in together. At this point, it would be about 1.5 years before I started med school - I was submitting apps. I applied everywhere. Long story short, I was accepted to the school she attended, but also got a full scholarship to a (much higher ranked) school in my home town. That full scholarship covered nearly $250K. It ended up that I would go to that school... we would continue our relationship, long distance.

During my first year of med school, I flew to her 8 times, staying for about 1 week each time, between exams and sometimes during class that I wouldn't attend. She flew to me several times as well, but not as many because her schedule was busier. She was a third year (I was hitting the books, she was at hospitals) so we both kept busy during the day and spent time together while she was here. We absolutely had a blast when we were together, we loved each other so hard.

It came to the point where she was applying to residencies. With her specialty, she does a 1 year internship anywhere in the country, and the following year starts residency. She was applying to hospitals near where I lived, and in her personal statement she said she was engaged (though we weren't - we wanted to close that gap before we said anything) to make her connection to my coast sound much stronger, increasing the likelihood of her being accepted to a program out here. She had her grandmother's engagement ring fitted to her to wear during interviews. We were going to live together again, in several months, assuming she went to a program out here. She had a 1 month rotation set up at the hospital by my school, in addition to some interviews, and stayed with me during that time.

When she gets here, on day 1, she tells me that she thinks we should break up. She felt that she just needed to be near home, with her family... her mom recently had a surgery, her sister in law gave birth 2 weeks before she flew here. I was devastated. She said she just didn't want me to go through that - having to make the decision to leave my family when applying to residency. She said that since we both are close to our families, one of us would end up unhappy, given that we'd have to move to the opposite side of the country.

During the month she was here, it was nice - we got on just like we've always have. Neither of us did anything bad to each other, there was no hate between us... it was just the circumstance. She left 3 days ago and I am just absolutely crushed. We were supposed to spend the rest of our lives together, we really were perfect for each other. Her family liked me, my family liked her. Everything was perfect. We both want to be friends, because we do like each other as people, there's no reason not to (she actually said she isn't sure if the two of us will ever actually stop loving each other)... but she doesn't want to talk for some time, to adjust to living each day without talking to me, in order to get to a place where she feels that she can talk normally, as a friend.

One detail: I have a very strong suspicion (with reason) that she may have cheated on me about 2 weeks before she flew over here for the month, and have a specific person in mind. She hasn't said anything about it though. Based on how this whole month went... I am guessing that she doesn't have strong feelings for this person and does not plan to pursue anything serious, but... idk it just hurts.  Idk how to interpret this.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Serious girlfriend of 4 years (long distance currently, opposite coasts) decides to break it off months before we would move in together. Was it for the best? How do I move on?"

I've always wanted to visit Hungary. Lucky for me my university has given me the chance to do a 3 month internship in Budapest, where I will work in a hotel - I'm a Hotel Management bachelor student.

It's been tough to find a flat in Budapest. I'm not familiar with any app or website where I can do it. I've tried to look on Google but the websites are pretty suspicious. 

Do you guys know an app I can use to find a flat in Budapest? I have preference for an app because I can use it whenever I have free time.

7hdyjk,10,2017-12-03,Manufacturing Time: 7 Tactics in 7 Days to Finish What You Want to Get Done,wdhaines,TimeManagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeManagement/comments/7hdyjk/manufacturing_time_7_tactics_in_7_days_to_finish/,"I put together a 1 week crash course about how to make more time in the day, and I figured I’d share it here to see if anyone finds it helpful. 

Feedback is very welcome!

## Time Is An Illusion…

Do you ever feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day? You spend 8+ hours working. 6 to 8 sleeping. A few hours to eat, take a shower, run errands. To spend time with your family. To have a social life. Add up all these commitments, and you may find there is no time left over for yourself.

Yet there are people who seem to have it all under control. They go to the gym every day. They start their own businesses and have time for hobbies. They’re not stressed at work. They get so much done that they can take a day off… without feeling guilty.

What are these people doing differently? 

They’re manufacturing time: using a few clever tactics to make sure they make space in the day to work on their priorities. What follows is a 7 day crash course in manufacturing time—one tactic a day to take those hours back. 

Let’s down get to it.

## Day 1: Change Your Location

If you feel like you’re frittering your time away, the first thing you should consider is what’s going on around you. Your environment can lead to low energy and poor focus. Insidiously, distracting environmental cues can also trigger time wasting habits. Go around the problem by taking your project elsewhere. 

A quiet coffee shop, the library, or even just a different room in your house can change your whole perspective. You’re here for a reason—the effort you spent getting here becomes a sunk cost if you don’t work on your project. If you picked your new location wisely, there are fewer distractions. There may even be resources to help you finish your task. At the very least, you hit the reset button your your bad habits. Start fresh.

If the new spot works for you, make it a routine and build a habit of doing productive work in this location. And if it isn’t working out, you can always try going somewhere else!

### Take Action:

Ask yourself how your current location is helping or hurting your productivity. Either way, go somewhere else and pay attention to how it changes how you work.

## Day 2: Apply the Pareto Principle to Your Time Wasters

Now, let’s invert the problem and remove the biggest time sinks in your day. The [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) suggests that around 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. The corollary is that 80% of your effort is leading to only 20% of your results. What are you spending the that 80% on? If you focus on fixing just a few big problems, you can make a huge difference in your output.

For example, maybe you have a tendency to fall off the wagon and spend hours surfing YouTube if you look at even one video. Instead of creating an elaborate time management plan, just figure out a way to cut out the YouTube (maybe using [Self Control](https://selfcontrolapp.com/)). Do you plop down on the couch right after work and watch TV? Put the TV upstairs or maybe move the couch so that you have to stand while watching it. One impactful change, you’ve gotten yourself back hours per week. 

### Take Action:

Spend some effort tracking where you’re wasting time. Identify 1 big problem and how to avoid it. Cutting it out this week and see how you feel.

## Day 3: Use Your Commute

This one has been a huge win for me personally as I’m becoming fluent in Spanish. Multi-tasking usually impairs performance, but a commute is so automatic that it isn’t cognitively demanding. This frees you up to expend some brainpower on your goals. A commute is also something you do regularly 5 days a week. If you can safely insert a valuable task into that time, you build a productive habit automatically.

The main difficulty here is to match an appropriate task to the commute. It has to be something that is easy to do on the go, isn’t awkward in the location, and isn’t dangerous. For me, it’s been listening to [Glossika](https://ai.glossika.com/) to get Spanish-language input while I drive. It’s audio-only so it works great for my use case. Your mileage may vary (pun intended; sorry). If you’re on public transportation, maybe you can listen to an audiobook or simply read through your reading list on a Kindle. The key is to have a plan so that you’re always using this time safely and effectively.

Who knew that having a long commute could be a good thing?

### Take Action:

Identify a regular habit that you can build on your commute. Spend some time gathering together the materials you need to make it really easy to do while traveling.

## Day 4: Bundle up Your Distractions

Time for another problem inversion. You’re probably well aware that distractions (e.g. checking email or frequent short meetings) kill flow and productivity. However, they don’t generally go away on their own. That doesn’t mean that you can’t control them.

Unless your job requires you to be reactive (e.g. working in a call center), you can postpone and group non-urgent tasks to do them all at once. The canonical example here is turning off your email notifications and checking and responding to emails only once or twice a day at a set time. Another is to hold scheduled office hours rather than responding to every impromptu meeting.

This tactic provides two big wins. First, it removes the distractions from of your day. Answering one email might take 2 minutes, but checking email and getting out of your flow could waste 20 minutes. Cut that nonsense out! Second, you’ll often find that by batching up these small distractions you can get through them more quickly and efficiently. If you can handle 1 email in 2 minutes, you might be able to handle 10 or 20 in 10 minutes.

Did you ever think you’d get into a flow state by answering your email? Now you have a chance to test it out.

### Take Action:

Identify your small distracting tasks and schedule some time to do them as a batch. Turn off notifications so that they don’t distract you while you’re doing important work. See how this affects your effectiveness and adjust from there.

## Day 5: Have a Productive Morning

There seems to be something special about the early morning. Much like finding a the perfect location to work, taking advantage of focused, uninterrupted time in the morning can do wonders for your productivity. You can work without distractions, and you are often at your freshest. Even better, by doing the most important thing right away you boost your confidence and set the day off on a productive foot. It’s a win all around.

The hardest part of having a productive morning is getting out of bed and into action. Here are a few hacks to make it easier:

* Prepare the night before. If you want to go jogging, set your shoes by your bed. If you plan to write, leave the outline open on your computer. Decision making is difficult when you’re groggy, so make the first step of your day automatic.
* Get enough sleep. If you just cut down your sleep time, you’re in for some rough mornings. Go to bed earlier… consider using [blue light therapy](https://www.lumie.com/blogs/quick-guides/6302492-beat-jet-lag-with-light-therapy) to reset your internal clock. Keep away from screens before bed. It take a bit of adjustment, but a good night’s sleep is an investment worth making.
* Use psychology to make sure you get up. Schedule an appointment (e.g. a gym session with a partner) first thing in the morning, leaving enough time for more productive work afterwards. Social pressure will get you out of bed and momentum will carry you through the rest of the morning.

This approach doesn’t work for everyone, but it’s certainly worth testing. If you find you’re a night owl instead, at least you’ve learned something.

### Take Action:

Use the hacks above to get up early enough that you can do an extra hour of focused work tomorrow.

## Day 6: Estimate and Triage Task Times

This one is a bit like Tetris. Have you ever had 10 minutes free before your next meeting but not known what to do with it? Instead of wandering over to the kitchen, consider getting ahead of this problem. When you add tasks to your todo list, make an estimated guess about how long each task will take and write that down as well. You can even sort your list by estimated time.

As you go about your day, don’t just do the top thing on your list. Instead, consider how much time you have and do the most important task that fits. If you have some really big projects, you can break them up into smaller pieces or, even better, block off time in your calendar to give them your full attention. By fitting the pieces together more deliberately, you’ll never be at a loss for what to do when. Those 10 minute blocks can really add up.

As you attempt this tactic, remember that you can iterate. Note how long tasks actually took to complete. You’ll get more accurate at predicting your effort as you practice and you’ll become a productivity Tetris master.

### Take Action:

Estimate the time you need for each item your todo list today. Use this extra information to better plan your day.

## Day 7: Delegate It

Let’s wrap up with a less-conventional approach. You can often delegate away your tasks: even if you’re not a manager, and even (especially) outside of work. Today, for each thing that you want to get done, ask yourself: “is this is something that seems like a good use of my time?” If the answer is “no” then think about ways to get someone else to do it.
Here are a few approaches to delegate successfully:

* Trade. Look for win-win scenarios where you can offload something your don’t want to do in exchange for something that you do want to do (or at least are better at). Fox example, if you are great at cooking, offer to cook every day in exchange for not having to spend time cleaning the house.
* Systematize it. You can often let someone less skilled than you handle your tasks, but only if you provide them solid guidance first. For example, give the office intern the opportunity to work on your important presentation, but be sure to build him a great outline first. Someone else can handle the details if the right structure is there.
* Don’t forget that you can pay people to do things. Yes, you can change your own oil, but if someone else can do it faster and for less money than your [time is worth](https://jamesclear.com/value-of-time), pay them to do it. Even if it costs more than the DIY approach, the time savings are often worth it.

Realistically you can’t delegate every task, but a few well-planned handoffs can save hours each week.

### Take Action:

Look at each task on your todo list and ask “is this a good use of my time?” Use some of the strategies above to delegate the most egregious tasks.

## 7 Days, 7 Things

So there you have it: 7 tactics to manufacture more time. While not every approach works for everyone in every situation, your time management will definitely improve if you take the time to test out each idea. As you work through each day, keep track of what is and isn’t working. Give it a week and see how much time you can manufacture.

Now, what are you going to do with all the extra hours in the day?"
7he9wb,1,2017-12-03,Question: transitioning from neuroscience to computer science,BrisklyBrusque,neuroscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/neuroscience/comments/7he9wb/question_transitioning_from_neuroscience_to/,"Hello,

I was wondering if anyone had any advice about transitioning from neuroscience to computer science. I have one semester remaining until I graduate with a bachelor's in neuroscience, but I decided medicine and research aren't for me. Ideally, I'd like to build a resume with a combination of hard science and coding, so I can better market myself in today's information age. For example, many of the recent contributions being made to fields like connectomics involve information science as much as biology.

I have a limited background in statistics and bioinformatics, but no real experience in machine learning, big data/data mining, coding/programming, and software development. I have taken math through calc II.

Because of my coursework, I don't see myself winning entry to a graduate level CS program. So my options seem to be: 
1) complete a second bachelor's in CS 
2) earn an online CS degree 
3) find an entry-level job or internship that will help develop CS skills
4) learn coding on my own.

These options aren't exhaustive (i.e., I could learn to code while working as a lab tech conducting data analysis). Nevertheless it's daunting. I've probably missed the deadline to apply for another bachelor's at most schools. Money is tight, so I am hoping my GPA (3.7 or 3.8) can earn me merit-based scholarships. I'm wondering how to go about learning CS skills if I need to take a gap year.

First and foremost, my name is Zach and I am finishing up my Mechanical Engineering degree in the United States. My fiancee is a history major and is super smart. The reason I'm writing this post is because she was given an offer for the University of Edinburgh for a master program in History. This has been her dream, doing her master's abroad, especially at the University of Edinburgh. She's wicked smart and has pushed herself and worked as hard as she can, graduating a year early, and she has attained her dream, she got the offer from Edinburgh. 

We're getting married two weeks after graduation this year and basically, to have any sort of chance at making her dream happen, I need a job in Edinburgh. I had an internship in the states designing Mechanical and Plumbing systems for commercial buildings, and I work for myself doing 3D modeling and 3D printing. I've been applying to mechanical engineering jobs but at this point, I would work full time at a grocery store to make this happen for her. I understand I need a work visa and I'm hoping that someone will see this who can help me, even if it's just advice or a word of encouragement.

Thanks in advance.

I am new to the Reddit society so this is like my maiden voyage. I am graduated about a year ago and took a gap year to get away from academi

I have just applied to 4 Student affairs programs for the 2018-2019 academic year:

James Madison University: Counseling Psychology, College Student Personnel Administration (my alma mater)

The University of Tennessee-Knoxville:College Student Personnel 

University of North Carolina @ Greensboro:  Student Affairs Administration in Higher Education

Bowling Green State University: College Student Personnel.

I am really excited to see where I am accepted. As I think about the process, I am thinking about all the factors to consider. Some major factors I am considering:

1. Cost- With a good amount of student debt on my shoulders, I am really considering everything I can to think about *reducing debt as much as possible while also choosing a program that has a great fit.* I am originally from Virginia so JMU would be the only school being in-state. I am also considering tuition and fees (especially fees because they add up). Right now every program covers tuition in some way or form.

2. Personal Growth &amp; goals- I was at my alma mater as an undergrad for 5.5 years and so I have spent a lot of time. I am sort of in a dilemma as to whether I need a new experience going out-of-state or whether I should stay at my alma mater. I know that one of my long term career goals is to be a College Planning Education Consultant so I am looking at doing an internship hopefully. I would also want experience in enrollment management (financial aid and admissions), academic advising, and career services.) I 

3. Curriculum &amp; Practical Experiences- This was something I looked closely at seeing the courses. Some have rigid curriculum where every class is mapped out and some have required courses with a choice of electives from different areas. I know that I have an interest in Counseling and Student Development &amp; Learning. Personally, I am not sure which type of curriculum I would go for. I have looked at the curriculum and researched every course description. In addition, I know the amount of experiences that each program has (assistantships, internships, and practicum.)

4. Cohort Size- I have considered a small cohort and a large one. Each having their pros and cons.

So, there's the overview of my thoughts in a nutshell. What are your thoughts and do you all have some suggestions to think about as I consider decisions in the admissions process?

7hem77,17,2017-12-03,What to do when you're at a dead end and full of regret,hopelesslist,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/7hem77/what_to_do_when_youre_at_a_dead_end_and_full_of/,"Hi ladies. I was encouraged to post here after reading some anecdotes on here about your various successes-- which thrill me! But unfortunately, many of you will experience things in life, beautiful things, that I feel like I will never achieve.

I'm an undergrad in my third year studying chemistry. I used to want to be a big researcher, with a fancy PhD, a professor, something elaborate and amazing and awesome while also in the field that I deeply enjoy. 

Yeah, that didn't happen. And it's entirely my own fault. I have a lot of issues. I'm mentally ill-- not just anxiety, or depression, but a nice combination of anxiety-induced depression due to sheer hopelessness, OCD tendencies, and a comorbid eating disorder that I have accepted will dominate the back of my mind at best for the rest of my life. 

I started out pretty well when I first decided to go into chemistry, I worked in two labs in high school and started taking college courses (leading into full time by the beginning of senior year) junior year. I helped manage a 3D printing lab and makerspace alongside working in a chemistry lab, in both of which I won awards and grants for the lab. I was on top of the world. I was well-liked. My horrific eating disorder experiences of early high school were behind me because my weight didn't matter because I was worth *so much more*. 

All of my achievements in late high school got me into a really good university on a full-ride scholarship. And that's when hell began to break loose, although it unfolded gradually. The summer before I moved to college, I developed horrible OCD symptoms that landed me in the hospital because I literally thought I was dying. All summer. Back and forth, just reclusive from fear, but also afraid to be in my own body. I was able to get a therapist again, as well as some medication, and I was *okay* when I finally got to my school. But I still remain convinced that I was brain damaged from the experience I had over the summer, like the development of my severe neuroses permanently destroyed me. In any case, that would have happened from *literally starving myself in high school* anyway, but at least I *looked good* (an irrational, horrible thought, but that's unfortunately how I feel). 

Freshman year ended okay, and I even had an internship that summer at a Fortune 500!!!! Except I was too afraid of a good thing, and I feared that if I took their offer to come back, it'd end up rescinded because they found something wrong with my work over the past summer (never happened. They still use my methods and everything.) and I also worried about making money in my field, so I turned down the offer to go back to a job I *loved*, applied to the engineering program and got accepted and screwed off on my dreams. 

Yeah, that fucked me up. I never got an actual internship again. I've done research, even in a prestigious lab for a semester, but I did jack shit in that lab so I don't even have much to put on a resume about it. I'm currently straddling a 3.0 and require a 3.0 to renew my scholarship by the end of next semester. I'm on a research collaborative team that I regret joining, although I love one of my PIs and he's really smart, the work just isn't going anywhere (although he claims it eventually will). I regret turning down my internship. I regret taking the detour into engineering for a semester only to leave because I fucking hated it. I regret my entire life. I'm not going to grad school-- I can't imagine anything I'd like less. I'll probably be unable to find a job in industry and end up working as a cashier at two places full time... I feel absolute sinking despair and I can barely pull myself out of bed in the morning anymore. My eating disorder is in full-swing-- and I've started de-facto purging, which is great, so now I'm going to lose my teeth, too. I hate myself. I have nothing to be proud of anymore. I have nothing to live for anymore. But the second I tell anyone that, they'd just throw me in a hospital, make me miss classes or my finals or work, and set my life back even more than it already is, so I don't tell anyone. Which means if I ever have something bad enough happen and I muster up the courage, I'm just going to die. I'm being frank. I don't expect to live past 30, or even earlier. I've never been in love. I'll never be in love. I will never have a beautiful life. 

How do you get out of this frame of mind when it seems to be all that's real? Don't tell me to get a therapist because I have one and we're working on it, but it's not happening fast. Don't tell me medication because I've tried the majority and they cause emotional side effects that make them useless because the new bad cancels out the new good. Just give me a reason to keep trying, because speaking pragmatically, there just isn't one. I just want someone to be real with me. "

Vacant: ""Sure. Whatever you want to say Bro. So why we here?""

Slowbro: ""Well, I thought I should bring you to the games that inspired me as a kid. Thought it be a good tag team bonding moment.""

Vacant: ""Ah, I getcha. I can get behind that. Drinking booze and watching the game all day...Not as many pretty girls around, but that's going to change, right?""

A ride of us in the back, planning every segment between us....every punch and kick planned to have some kind of story behind it....we didn't really care who won. We just wanted both of us to walk away with people knowing our name. It just kinda grew over time, and to a degree? I think it's still there. In our tag matches? Pretty sure we are still competing.

7hh0a0,2,2017-12-04,"Advice , fellas",ani_skywalker19,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7hh0a0/advice_fellas/,"So it's been  7-8 months of my nofap journey (hard mode) and it has been luminous. Especially around the months of August, September and some part of October I was ecstatic. I even had 3 internship interviews which I nailed perfectly but didn't join due to forthcoming exams in November.
So coming to my problem, that feeling of joyness is not there anymore and I don't seem to understand the reason. It maybe due to the fact that I haven't meditated in past 2-3 weeks which of course I regret now. Also due to my exams I completely forbade myself from any physical activity , I was continuously studying . Also there's a feeling of heaviness right here in chest. Previously I used to feel that I turned heads while walking (like people claim they become chick magnets with nofap) although I really don't want that but it really feels nice, but that is gone. It's feels like I'm describing a relapse although I haven't.
 
Good news is I'm starting meditation once again (it has been 2 days ) and intermittent fasting along with it.

I don't know what advice I really want but yeah it would feel nice if you could add on something helpful to make me as I was before this.

7hirz0,3,2017-12-04,Emotionally offline,BruddhaBuddha,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7hirz0/emotionally_offline/,"I shouldn’t be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I haven’t started on any of them. But I don’t have the energy to even get started...I don’t know what to do. It’s too late to ask for extensions but I don’t want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess I’ll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it’s gonna be fucking painful.


Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I’ve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that’s definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what’s going on in my life, there isn’t much there.


If my life had a thesis statement, it’d be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I don’t find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have “friends” but I don’t much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I’m still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I’m also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she’s dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I don’t even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck.


The only thing I have is that I’m in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that’s certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I’m also fairly consistent with working out; it’s not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didn’t do it I can’t imagine how depressed I’d be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least.


With my career, I’m interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I’m good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it’d be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that’s sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it’s become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that.


But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I’ve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I’ve pushed through my whole life and honestly, I’m tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it’s lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I’d rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isn’t good to have hanging over my head when I’m asking all of these questions.


I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this.


The social life issue is more simple, I don’t even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that’s gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I’ve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I can’t imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me.


Isn’t it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I’m like a people’s introvert, it makes no sense.


I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time each day imagining myself as a frontman for a successful band; I really look up to someone like Father John Misty, I feel we have similar sensibilities on a lot of things. And there is just something about pouring your emotions and thoughts into an album, performing it live and connecting with people through that authenticity, that really makes me regret not taking learning music seriously up until this point in my life. I could really use that sort of emotional release right now. Same with writing, when school isn’t consuming every moment of my waking day I like to read a lot, so I’d like to write a book one day on something I care about.


I’m reading what I wrote and it’s kind of frustrating. I clearly have dreams and desires, why can’t I manifest them into anything that makes me remotely proud of myself? Like am I even depressed? I feel like way too many people here have it worse than me for me to complain about my “depression.” Maybe I’m just a shitty person looking for an excuse not to do anything useful with my life.


I’m just trying to make it to Friday. My favorite band is coming to my city and it’s the only thing I’m looking forward to. Its the only reason I am ignoring the thoughts of suicide...I need a break from all this bullshit.


I’m gonna schedule a doctor’s appointment today to get a blood panel done to see if anything’s happening there. I might look into SAD because depression always seems to historically hit me around this time (although this time last year was the happiest I’ve ever been, so I’m not exactly sure). I already see a therapist weekly but I might look for a new one because I’m not sure if we’re making any progress. I’m gonna try to get back into meditation if I can find any time.


I just want to know when it’s gonna get better."
7hj4fy,17,2017-12-04,How did you find a strong enough motivation to change your life,WilderAirs,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7hj4fy/how_did_you_find_a_strong_enough_motivation_to/,"Hi r/leaves, I’m Wilder. 


Little origin story:

I grew up in a shit corner of the UK (insert anywhere not in the south east). My closest group of friends (probably the only group of friends I have left now) spent our teens and early adulthood binge drinking and smoking. We were broke, had a pretty bad time at school and a worse time at home, with bud being the cheapest good night. 

After people started leaving for university we got really into smoking. 
Twists of fate had us knowing some guys who became dealers and suppliers. Student loans, jobs and one or two shotting lines = us with the most disposable income we’d ever had. It saw us chewing through a couple halves a week, with a quiet night being an HQ or so. By this point I’d started inheriting my familial mental illnesses, and I was quick to discover bud could delay you from having to face up indefinitely. 

I got my shot at uni, it was stressful and I stopped going in. Got pretty mentally unwell and eventually I was smoking an HQ a day, minimum, and pretending I could quite happily stick my head in the sand forever. It was one of the worst times of my life.


Zooming up to present day and I still smoke a couple hundred worth a week. I still don’t leave my room, have a social life, pretty do much anything. Feels like I’m back at square 1 . 
To quote another post - it’s lonely in here. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to socialise. I don’t know how to do anything but smoke. I can’t do stuff without draw for motivation.
I began so young, and it’s eaten so much of my life that I’ve not had a relationship in two years. It’s swallowed my interest in meeting someone, and I’ve become so used to doing all my day to day alone, that I’m too comfortable with my own company. I don’t know how to have a social time anymore. 


Bud directly caused, or played a big part in, many regrets. Here are my biggest:

- got my mental health so bad I spent a a big part of summer 2017 hearing voices &amp; resisting violent urges 
- fell out of touch with most friends and family 
- spent all my savings and anything I earned or found, to the sum of well over 20,000 in 3 years. 
- I’m weirdly proud of how I supported my habit sometimes, getting a job at the drop of a hat when money got low (only for bud, never good reasons). less proud of myself other times - lying and stealing money, bud, etc to support it. 
- attempted suicide a couple of times. 
- started sleeping with a knife out of paranoia 
- failed my uni course 
- cut and burned myself so badly I haven’t been comfortable being seen without my shirt off in years. 
- pushed away many wonderful people who really cared for me 
- believed my friends and family were stealing from me, gaslighting me, etc. 
- missed dream job internships. 
- did some stupid shit with other drugs I really regret 


I’ve never been perfect, but this bud’s been bringing out the worst in me. I’m ashamed of how I’ve behaved and want to move forward able to look back at this time and know that if this is my rock bottom, it’s all up from here.


So to my question - what was a strong enough motivator for you to stop? I’ve never been able to find that. Even though I’ve said to myself I want to stop, I’ve not managed and can’t kick the desire to ‘just cut back’ so I could still smoke occasionally. 
I feel like if these kinds of bs cop out thoughts are still gaining traction, I’ve not quite reached the mental position where I can stop. 

How did you make that final step to stop lying to yourself and make a stand? 

Also, those of you who’ve been in the bubble for a while - how did you get over the social aspects? 
For example the only friend I’ve made in the past year or so is with my dealer. I go pick up and sit on his couch for hours chatting, drinking. I honestly consider him a friend, and feel like I’m abandoning him by stopping going. He’s disabled and lives in a dangerous area, it’s unlikely we’d link without bud being involved, Same applies to other friends - all we do is smoke. If we catch up, it’s over a spliff and a coffee. 

I can’t break those ties it seems. All I’ve done for three years is smoke alone and, occasionally, with friends. There’s been some amazing times but most? Most I don’t even remember, probably because nothing happened. Just like 99% of the days I’ve wasted smoking dawn till dusk.

Lastly - how do you deal with the craving? Anytime I try to quit, cold turkey or not one second I can be saying I won’t smoke, next I’ve rung my guy and I’m halfway to his, barely remembering when I changed my mind. 



A last quick question for curiosity’s sake - does your sweat smell of weed? No more BO smell for the
past 2 - 3 years, now I just smell like I secrete cannaboid oil haha 


All said and done, thanks for a read, and good luck with your own struggle. 
Wilder.

I'd love to hear about your experiences,  good and bad, before my interview later this month. 

Thank you!"
7hj9d9,0,2017-12-04,Me [30 F] unclear on how to fairly treat husband's cousin [18 F] for college,hubbycousinthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hj9d9/me_30_f_unclear_on_how_to_fairly_treat_husbands/,"My MIL essentially adopted his cousin for logistical reasons. Her parents travel a LOT for work and they wanted her to have steady access to a good schooling. My husband's mom was happy to have her fill an empty nest and lives in a great school district. She sees her parents for visits and they send money for her upkeep and to supplement MIL's income. It's a happy situation for all involved and has been for over 5 years. 


Because hubby was out of the house well before she moved in, he's not super close to her, other than that we see her when we visit MIL or when MIL visits us (we fly both of them out). My baby sister is much younger than I am and about a year older than hubby's cousin. They get along very well and see each other when we vacation together or visit for holidays. 


Because my parents are low income and hubby are both comfortably in the 6-figure range, we were prepared to help with my sister's college expenses. She worked very hard and now has a full scholarship at an elite school. That leaves very little for us to contribute, so we buy her tickets to fly home for breaks, and let her earn a money with a fun challenge (think, pull ups, push-ups, squats, etc), which netted her $8k to her bank account and a nice laptop. I LOVE giving my sister money and doing things for her because she is so appreciative and mature. She doesn't ask for anything and turns down things that she finds wasteful. She also stayed with us to complete an internship last summer and was always looking for ways to help around the house. 


Hubby's cousin is not as mature. She thanks us when she gets presents, but she never pauses to think if she needs something. If we offer her something, she'll take it without hesitation. That's probably perfectly normal for a kid their age, but I do love that my sister spends my money as she would her own. She's a good kid, but she's also not very proactive. If you ask her to help with anything, she'll gladly help, but she doesn't look to offer help. I once struggled with two laundry baskets shortly after giving birth and she passed me in the hallway without offering to help. Again, it's probably normal for a kid her age, and she would've helped if I asked for it. 


Anyways, this long background is to ask if we should offer to help her with college as we did for my sister. Financially, we could without issue, but I'm not sure I want to. I haven't asked yet, but I don't think she needs it. As far as I know, her parents have been saving up for this. The only reason I'd consider doing it is that I don't want to hurt her feelings. So far, we've treated them somewhat equally in gifting them, taking them on trips, etc. We did make the same ""physical challenges"" offer to her, but she's not very athletic. We let her know years in advance that it'd be available to her so that she could work out in preparation. If she tried it now, she could probably make a couple hundred towards college. My husband thinks we should at least get her a nice laptop for college and maybe pay for her tickets to go home for breaks, but I'm tempted to just let the chips fall where they may with the challenge. 


Sorry for the bit of jumble above. I'm at work and writing this out in spurts between projects. I'd appreciate anything to help me organize my thoughts on this. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: MIL ""adopted"" husband's cousin after he graduated from college, but she has biological parents who love her and are financially stable. We voluntarily support my sister for college. Should we do the same for his cousin? "

To start of i'm kinda new to Reddit, but I think after reading the rules I can put my question here? I'm sorry if I would be wrong..

I'm a student at the VUB in Belgium studying physiotherapist. We have In march-april 2019 the chance to go abroad for an internship. They told me they didn't have any contact with physiotherapists in Iceland to go to. But if I could find a place myself they said that they will think about it!
Going to Iceland was always one of my biggest travel dreams especially after going to Norway. If I could combine enjoying this beautiful country together with my passion it would be awesome.
If some of you guys know a place where they take an internship for a physiotherapist I would be so grateful, because I searched myself but with no luck so far.. It can be at a local physiotherapist or at an hospital as long as it is evidence based practice. 

Thanks in advance

I am one semester away from graduating with a CS degree.  I have 5 years of full-time sysadmin experience and hold the CompTIA trio.  I was offered a 6-month co-op that pays decent enough to get by.  The company is huge and a major player as far as security jobs go.  The co-op itself isn't a typical co-op.  I would be doing the normal full-time work that all of their security engineers are doing, no special projects or emphasis on doing everyone's documentation.  However, if I take this internship I will have a 6 month period of unemployment (they will not budge on the dates) and I will be getting my degree a total of 1 year after I originally anticipated.  In your professional opinions, is a 6 month co-op with a large company more beneficial to the security industry than simply trying to find a job after graduation and working my way up the totem pole?"

It seems like our top 10 this week is sort of the same as before, except that Dua Lipa makes a glorious return to the top 10 with 'New Rules' jumping 20 spots to #10! We also see some new Taylor gains (and we might see more of it next week as reputation is now available on streaming services). On its third chart run, 'Delicate' tops this week's chart while 'Call It What You Want', 'I Did Something Bad', 'Getaway Car' and 'End Game' chart at #2, #3, #5 and #7, respectively. Meanwhile, '...Ready For It?' and 'Don't Blame Me' find their way back to the top 10, charting at #8 and #9. As for Tove, she has only two songs charting in the top 10, with 'Disco Tits' charting at #4 and last week's #1 hit 'shedontknowbutsheknows' charting at #6.

Björk takes this week's highest debut as 'Arisen my senses' from her new album Utopia charts at #25. Lorde doesn't seem want to go away from the Hot 50 as 'Perfect Places' gains 22 spots, the biggest gain this week. Poor Tove grabs this week's biggest decline with 'hey you got drugs?' dropping 23 spots to #38..


* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #25. Björk - Arisen my senses
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #11. Lorde - Green Light 
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #21. Lorde - Perfect Places (+22)

7hlfrk,2,2017-12-04,I'm a 25M recently went through my first heartbreak and the future looks bleak !,OceanWanderer92,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hlfrk/im_a_25m_recently_went_through_my_first/,"Hello all,

I am posting here for the first time. I've been following r/relationships for about a month now and it's nice to see some really helpful comments on various posts. 

I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Kindly bear with me.

I'm 25M, dumped by my girlfriend who I was in a relationship with of about 3 years. 

Personally, I'm a very down to earth guy. Faced a tough childhood. Have a mentally challenged, epileptic elder brother 29M. (His being opened my eyes on being compassionate and understanding at a very young age) I come from a lower middle class family where my dad was in and out of jobs whereas all my childhood friends(4 numbers) were/are wealthy which created a lot of self consciousness and insecurity. I'm a very family and career oriented guy.

I've always set realistic and achievable goals since childhood. And looking for my SO after securing a job was one of them and by gods grace have achieved them all; until recently(a year ago) when I was left devastated by my girlfriend. 

I'd dreamt of establishing myself professionally and only then wandering into the relationship world as I always felt responsible towards my parents and my epileptic elder brother.

At 14 I dreamt of being a ships captain and at 23, I had completed my cadetship, cleared my officers exams and was finally an officer of a merchant ship.

It was during that time(when I was 23) when I started seeing a girl I knew back from school. We used to meet often, off beat flirting and smiles, late night texting, etc. I fell in love with that girl and we both knew we shared something special. I hadn't confessed my feelings upfront but she knew it. 

She used to intern 3 days a week and I was preparing for my exams at home so that left us with quite a good amount of free time for meets. Girl and boy in their early 20s, quite the romantic scene.

I got my first assignment as a 3rd mate on one of the worlds largest crude ship and was about to board the ship. Within 2 weeks, she was set to fly abroad for her masters. 

I boarded the flight, and the pain the distance apart would be bringing us was pouring in through the texts. 

Fast forward, my first time working with multi nationality crew, a very demanding foreign master and the pressure of navigating the biggest ship in the world through the busiest straits in the world finally dawns upon me. Had to work for 16-18 hours a day..getting accustomed to the new languages/accents/cultures/cuisines led to fast fatigue..I just used to crash on the bed at the first opportunity and that started communication gaps between us. 

Fast forward 6 months, she starts posting pictures with one particular guy from college and refuses to address any feelings towards him.

I get assigned my 2nd ship and we're into our 3rd year of relationship. Roughly around that time, I confess my feelings for her through texts (the only mode of communication available on the ship). At this time, she replies that she once had the same feelings for me but after our distance apart, she slowly started to lose those feelings. She also went on and blamed it on her impatience.

This came as a total shock to me as I had always pictured her as THE ONE in my mind and soul. I was left devastated. Subconciously smoked around 400 cigarettes within a span on 10 days, went through intense chest pains and I lost myself. 

I was still onboard my 2nd ship at the time, and before the incident, I used to work out regularly, used to eat healthy, always looked on the brighter side of life, always had my family on the back of my head.

It has been almost a year now after we broke up, I'm 25 now and find it extremely difficult to trust girls now. I feel depressed most of the times, I lack motivation at work, skip 2 meals a day when onboard, don't exercise, turned into a chain smoker, don't go out with friends, a

This was my first heartbreak and it came at the age of 25 and I'm completely blank as to how to deal with it.

I'm a 6ft 4 inch, decent looking guy, a man in uniform and from one of the most famous cities in the world thronged by beautiful girls. 

What do I do ? I am desperate to go back to being the previous me. Athlete back in school, played football for my college team, fitness used to run in my lifestyle and after this incident, I don't feel motivated to do anything.

7hlnqh,6,2017-12-04,"Me [24 F] with my sister [19 F] possibly in a cult, how do I convince her to stay with me?",sistersister1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7hlnqh/me_24_f_with_my_sister_19_f_possibly_in_a_cult/,"Hi, this is my first time posting because I have no idea what else to do so sorry if this is a little confusing, i'm happy to answer questions. For some background, my family is very religious (my parents (60s) met in church and attend twice a week, pray before every meal, etc.), but I left the church after graduating high school. I am in the area living with my boyfriend (about an hour away from where my parents and sister live) going to school full time and working. 

My sister (D for short) and I used to be extremely close, like reading each other's minds close, but after graduating high school about two years ago D joined an ""internship"" at the church my family attends. The program was very strict; D couldn't leave without permission, only had her phone at certain times, and she could only see me when she was accompanied by another member of the church for ""accountability"" (i.e. so I wouldn't poison her with my heathen ways). Her friends were all joining so she seemed very happy doing it. My parents were weary of these rules and weren't stoked about the program, but since god told her to do it, and since they were active members of the church who got to see her twice a week, they gave her their support. I protested for the first few months, calling it a cult and saying it was wrong, but my parents said it wasn't a cult and I shouldn't worry. It was too exhausting to argue with them about it constantly so I let it go, only seeing her on major holidays. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. There has been drama at the church and the pastor was forced to step down among some allegations, which D claims are all completely false. She and the other ""interns"" all decided to quit (which I'm guessing was influenced by the former pastor), and are now living in one of the pastor's friends home temporarily. I spoke with her over the phone and she seemed really happy to finally be out of the church, but sad about the situation. They're getting donations of food for now but will eventually find jobs to pay for their rooms and food. She tried talking to my parents but they got angry with her for some reason (didn't get her side of the story on that one), so now she doesn't want to talk to them.

 She also spoke about finally getting a job and maybe even taking classes, which I told her I fully supported and would help with school and a resume in any way that I could. I also told her that despite her fears about talking to my parents about the situation, she should really talk to them since they'd support her no matter what, and she would eventually need money for food since they'll eventually run out, and the interns were never were paid during the program.

I then called my parents after, and my mom told me that they have no idea where D is because she won't talk to them, and that the former pastor is lying and manipulating all of them because they're young and most of them don't have parents. She said D doesn't trust them and won't talk to them because the pastor thinks my parents are believing the lies of the church's administration and will try to convince her of these lies. 

I trust my mom's instincts more than my sister's (especially because my mom finally used the word cult for this situation, and apologized to me for not listening to my protests the past two years). My parents both asked me to try to convince D to come stay with me since she opens up to me more than she does to them, but I'm not sure how to. I'm not spiritual at all so any advice I give isn't going to be taken very well. My roommates and boyfriend are all supportive and are fine with her staying a few days, so that's thankfully not an issue. I just don't know how to bring up that what she's doing isn't safe without her shutting me down and not trusting me anymore. I had already told her I didn't agree with her when she began the program, and she didn't talk to me for a full month. I don't want to lose her, and the pressure seems to be on me to get her out. 

I already set up a date to go shopping with her on Thursday so I'd appreciate any advice on what to say when we meet up.

7hlzk1,1,2017-12-04,Advice if possible,ohimemberrr,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7hlzk1/advice_if_possible/,"So a little background; I’m going into my senior year of college at a school by the ocean in North Carolina. I have roughly a year left, and plan o graduating next Fall with my degree in accountancy. My main problem is that my GPA is not what I would hope it would be at this point, after this semester it will be roughly a 2.8. 

My first question is, do any of you know of any schools that I could even get into to achieve my masters? My GPA is low due to (long story short) my freshman year was a GPA ruiner. 

Secondly, how much will my GPA hinder my future job options? I am going to start looking into internships for later this summer.

Lastly, my main areas of interest are Forensic Accounting and if not there, audit. Any points in the right direction would be great.

If anyone out there happens to need an intern on the East Coast let me know! Thanks everybody. Wish me luck on finals."
7hm13p,1,2017-12-04,Three Months Later,watdoiget,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7hm13p/three_months_later/,"A girl I loved moved to Europe for a few months of work and we were supposed to try and do long distance just as we had done a year before. But after a few weeks of ignored messages, mysterious nights out, and cook cutter responses she told me she didn't love me anymore.

This was unexpected, people had looked up to our relationship and praised us for our communication and how well we worked together. We never had any issues together, but the moment we hit the first road bump you hit the fucking eject button to explore a content I’ve never been to while I informed our friends were no longer together. In one phone call she managed to make the past few years of my life feel meaningless. I went from having found my other half to being just the best guy who was around. 

This isn't my first breakup but it's definitely the one I've felt the most. I know to focus on myself for a while and work on what's best for me but at this point, I'm just worn out. To distract myself I just filled up my schedule with work and school so I never really have a moment to myself. Four days out of the week I go to two unpaid internships from 9-5, then I have night classes from 6-10, and this is all on top of editing my school's publication.  
In terms of my work I've never been more successful, I’m producing great content and I'm starting to become recognized within the local industry. But at the same time I've never felt worse. I have this constant pit in my chest and stomach, I now have problems sleeping through the night, I'll regularly wake up in a panic because my body is telling me I can't sleep because I have work to do, and some days I just find it hard to get out of bed.

I took on all this work so I wouldnt just lay around feeling sorry for myself, but it just made me exhausted and hasnt stopped me from thinking of her every day. This is all on top of the normal senior year stress around finding a job and paying off my loans while still eating. I go to school in Boston and I fucking hate this place, I don't have the option of going home after graduation because there's no work for me and the cost of living is too high. 

Luckily all of this semesters work is finally ending and I get to go home for a month for the first time in a few years. I plan on deleting my social media apps on my phone for the month, I want to be off the grid for a little bit and just be around people I love. The thing is I don't really know how to move forward when I get back.

I know I want what I had a few months ago and i've just forgotten how to get there. I started casually going out with a new girl shortly after the break up, and while we get 
along great I just don't feel a connection or anything right now. It's too soon. I want to just be friends and it's just another thing I've been putting off.

I've lost half of me and i'm slowly learning how to be myself again. I know I need time, I just didn't realize how long the days would feel.

7hmet3,13,2017-12-04,Almost done with my MA in clinical/counseling psychology. Need some much needed career advice!,yanks93,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/7hmet3/almost_done_with_my_ma_in_clinicalcounseling/,"Hello everyone! I have a lot of questions to ask as I will be done with my MA in clinical and counseling psychology next semester and applying to PsyD programs right now for the fall. 

1) I am a 24 Hindu male and I am applying to PsyD programs in the fall and I am constantly in worry because of many factors 
2) In our field, we should be culturally competent and I hope you guys understand where I am coming from. I am the only son in my family and my parents who are in their 60s will be dependent on me to take care of them once I am done with my studies. I understand this may be similar in many other cultures. Therefore, it is difficult for me to take time off and continue to depend on my parents when I just want to get my degree and begin my career. 
3) I am worried about our field not being as lucrative as I'd like it to be. I am very interested in therapy and consulting. Therefore, I would like to get my PsyD in clinical psychology. I do not have much interest in research or academia.  Additionally, I have an interest in sports psychology as well which involves research, but there are not many programs that are diverted solely to that. Therefore, pursuing something like sports consulting/business consulting part time and having a private practice is my ultimate goal. I understand some might ask why do the MA in counseling/clinical instead of I/O, but I love therapy and I love the clinical work I am currently doing in my practicum. I just want further exposure in different clinical settings and also learn more about consulting as well.
4) I am currently applying to PsyD programs. I have a 3.93 masters GPA and a 3.4 undergraduate GPA (3.9 Psych GPA). I have tons of clinical experience, some research experience (1 year in research lab in undergrad), solid LORs from 2 professors and my practicum supervisor. Currently working on fixing up my personal statement as well. However, my GREs are god awful (I can't even hit 300 with hours of studying) It is all very overwhelming, but the application process is what is exhausting me. I love school and learning about the field. It's just the GREs that do not predict your capacity and knowledge in the field that stresses me out. I hate that I can't even get close to a 150 on each section. 
5) I should also mention that I tore both ACLs (one year apart for both) and am currently rehabbing my surgically repaired one (right) and pre-habbing my left until I have time to get surgery in May (after my practicum and grad school is done) So, this is obviously adds to being overwhelmed with the PT taking up a lot of my time. 
6) If I don't get into a PsyD program of my choice, what are my options with my MA? In my program, you accrue the credit hours in order to get your LAC and work towards an LPC. However, I do not want to waste 2-3 years getting those hours when I can count my internship hours during my doctorate towards this. Therefore, what is the best lucrative option for me if I have to wait a year at most with my degree? Is consulting for a company, HR, something business related possible to do with an MA in clinical and counseling psych? Can I do what I want to do without getting the PsyD and still have a comfortable life?
6) I hope I have not come off as incompetent or selfish. I just want to have a comfortable life once I am done in where I can provide for my parents when necessary and live a stable life when I do get married and have a wife and kids. I understand our field isn't ""meant"" to be lucrative. However, with the countless hours in school/practicum in masters/doctorate, I believe it should be. I hope I am not coming off as delusional. When I say a comfortable life, I mean something like 80k-90k a year while paying off the crazy loans (150k+)  I will have as well.  I really enjoy this field and do not see myself doing anything else. I just wanted to get opinions from everyone regarding what I am going through. I understand it is overwhelming, but I have a lot of responsibilities just like everyone else, and I do not want to fail or feel as if I cannot have a comfortable lifestyle post-PsyD.

 Thank you again everyone. I hope I have not offended or confused anyone. I look forward to your feedback and I really do appreciate it. :)

7hmp3y,5,2017-12-04,[REQUEST][STEAM] The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ (WEEKEND DEAL -50% ends Dec 7),Adacool,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/7hmp3y/requeststeam_the_elder_scrolls_online_tamriel/,"Hello r/GiftOfGames,  
This is my first time on this subreddit, and I'm hoping to get a copy of The Elder Scrolls Online.  
*I am not asking for the expansion or any special edition, just the standard edition.*

#What is ESO?

**(I don't really like this part or find it useful, so I'm going to be brief).**  

[ESO](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online) is MMORPG game developed by ZeniMax Online Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is one of the Elder Scrolls games, which includes the masterpieces: Morrwind, Oblivion and Skyrim. It is a fantasy open world game, taking place in the continent of Tamriel. You are able to choose one of ten different races and five different classes. Each with there unique attacks, skills and passive effects. You will venture through Tamriel doing quests, exploring open areas and dungeons, making choices and choosing the path of a werewolf or a vampire.

#What makes it Special for me

First of all, it's an Elder Scrolls game. The whole franchise is known for it's amazing and detailed lore, as well as excellent role-playing mechanics. More importantly, my love for Skyrim. Skyrim is one of my all-time favorites. I can't count how many times I installed and modded it until crashing. I've been playing it since 2012 and when I heard the rumors about an online Elder Scrolls game, I went crazy :D I signed up for the closed beta testing and waited impatiently. I received an invite from Zenimax, but unfortunately, I couldn't download the 20+ GB game in time and I missed it. So, I contacted support telling them about the incident. They were so friendly and helpful that they sent me 2 invites for the next beta testing session to play with my little sister.  

I really enjoyed the game despite the bugs and everybody talking about how plain and boring it was. I enjoyed being able to experience a world, that I'm absolutely in love with, with others (especially with my sister :D) in a new and different era of the Elder Scrolls. I didn't sleep that day to get the most out of that beta session.  
Since then, the game used a mandatory monthly subscription model, which made it impossible for me to think of playing it again. That is until 2015. Now it only needs a one-time payment.    

#Why can't I buy it for myself?  

**For 2 reasons:**  

* Currency difference.  
I live in Egypt and our currency value makes it really hard and madly expensive to buy a lot of things, especially online.  

* My current life.  
I was studying mechanical engineering and just graduated this summer. I worked a couple of months as a beginner graphic designer (because it is my hobby :D) and currently I'm a production engineer intern. But, I can't afford to buy a game when I'm still beginning my life and still don't have a reliable paying job.  

#Why now?  

I saw there is this Weekend Deal and thought it would be really amazing if I tried a new game these days. Especially after all the stress of the graduation project (which I'm still suffering from until now) and the stress of starting my life and a new career.  

#Thank you
  
Thank you so much for reading this request, it means a lot that you've read it all, and sorry for my English :D. I'll be very grateful if someone can get me the game and I'm sure it will make me feel refreshed and pass that phase in my life easier.

7hnbs8,39,2017-12-04,Cold emailing works!,superduperm1,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/7hnbs8/cold_emailing_works/,"Hey r/actuary, just wanted to do a quick follow-up.

From three weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/7d1imx/starting_to_get_a_bit_concerned_not_a_pity_story/

I was devastated to find out that the other company I did a web cam interview with declined me. In the middle of November, I felt that I was in a tough spot and was very, very worried and anxious about it. I began to apply for analyst positions (none of which have responded) and then wondered if there was anything else I could do since I didn't want to give up on the actuarial internship search.

In these desperate times, I did something that the actuary community seems split 50/50 on. I decided to cold email 100+ chief actuaries, sending them my resume and asking for advice (not a position, since I knew it was near the end of recruiting season, but any kind of advice).

To my astonishment, I got about 30 emails back, a lot of which had good substantial advice. Best of all, I ended up with three phone interviews despite not explicitly asking for a position. This was just as many interviews as I had gotten through online applications. One of those (so far) has turned into a web cam interview. I just found out today that the interview turned into an offer! Barring a better offer coming along before the deadline, I will likely accept it.

I know that your first thought might be that I'm trying to brag, but the truth is I've read a lot about cold emailing on here and on actuarial outpost and it seems to be something that a lot of people (not everybody, but a lot) downtalk as unnecessary, a waste of time, and disrespectful to those that you're contacting. Honestly, while it's different for everyone, I feel like I got more success out of it than online applications, and it was far less time consuming, too.

After I had sent 15-20 cold emails, I started to think maybe it was 
a waste of time, but early on, one chief actuary quickly responded that I was ""doing the right thing"" and that I should ""keep sending my resume to people.""

If anybody is ever in a position like me, don't be shy or afraid to send cold emails. It works. It gets your name out there."

In the past six months I've completely changed myself. I had a good internship, got elected captain of my sports team at school, started lifting everyday, and cleaned up the haircut and wardrobe. I feel 100x times better about myself socially, physically etc.


So all the sudden this sexy, awesome girl just falls into my life. She initiated the meeting. We hooked up but she was too drunk to have sex so she just slept over. We hung out all day the next day, and she told me likes me a lot, thinks I'm really cool and interesting, and wish she met me earlier. We've hung out about 3 times and things are going well.


Here's the problem though: she also assumed I was really sexually experienced (which I'm not), based on my personality and vibe. She's not shy about that stuff and I know she's pretty experienced.


Anyways I'm freaking out about this a little. What do I do here? I would consider dating this girl for a long time, we get along really well. Sex isn't really that special to me but I'm realizing I'm pretty self conscious about being a virgin.


We'll probably hook up within the next week and I'm trying to decide if I should:

1) Tell her:

* a) She may think it's odd, be less attracted to me, or possibly not talk to me anymore.

* b) She'll be cool with it and make my first experience fun and less intense.


2) Don't tell her:

* a) I'll be extremely nervous and bad at sex. I'll disappoint her sexually without an explanation.

* b)There's a possibility it goes well and I don't have to let her know I'm a virgin

What should I do here? If I tell her, I want to be confident about it."

1. How hard is it to get into this major? I have a 3.4 right now at miramar

2. What jobs do grads typically get? Are there opportunities for internships and do people look down on the name of your degree because its uncommon? (Last one is a weird question, I know)

3. In ISCOR student society and in all of the classes what type of people am i likely to meet? Like you know how com sci is mostly men and generally driven people while business seems to be more extroverted? Of course these are stereotypes but just an example 

4. Are you happy in the iscor program?

I have 18 credit hours left, with 12 being next Spring and 6 next fall (all night classes thankfully).  I'm currently top of my class in my first Estimating course (I've always had a knack for numbers and cost-engineering) but my ""dream"" is to become involved in a smaller General Contractor as their VDC/BIM director and help their name become known as a ""forward looking"" contractor.

Obviously I have a lot to learn in the field (even once I graduate) and through the many forward-thinking members of the community, and I was hoping you guys (at least being somewhat technological advanced, I mean, it's Reddit) could help me out.

If I had to give a pro's/con's list with my experiences, I hope that maybe you all could help me break down ""resume lines"", conversation starters, and help with further forward thinking.

Pros: Deans list this past Spring
           Product patent for a device I did the design work on in Autodesk Inventor
Experience in Revit, Navisworks, Bluebeam
Previous manual labor experience as well as working in an electrical subcontractors internship
Having the drive to teach myself software if I don't have a firm grasp on it
I'm great at networking but not the best with follow-ups (after career fair, interviews, random run-ins with people in my field)

Cons: I started in engineering and although I still think that way, my GPA definitely suffered.
I had a medical issue occur during my summer internship (hypothyroidism) that caused my performance to suffer.
Although well versed in the softwares listed above, I wouldnt say I'm an expert (although I easily could be with how well I catch on to softwares)
I haven't had as much ""in-field"" experience as others that are finding internships.
I'll get so caught up in one idea or topic that sometimes I have to work late to finish what I actually needed to be working on.

In as much of a summary as I could come up with, do you all have tips for how I should reach out to companies that are either looking for part time work (next semester) or full time work for summer and fall that continues on to a full blown career once I've graduated?

I appreciate the tips and hope there's someone out there that can help me with tips, or maybe there's a chance someone's looking for someone exactly like me for their company, and I'd be ecstatic if that happened. (Dream big, right?)

Thanks guys, look forward to hearing back with both positive and negative criticism."

I'm also in business math, economics and marketing and could talk about what i learn in those classes.

The reason the CISO could be a good option (regardless of presentation skills) is the fact this person is the one in charge of infosec and therefore has authority. The awareness program is also the #1 way to make yourself visible in relation to infosec.

I am the one running the program atm and the most visible because of this, so I am sure of this point about visibility.

In other words: Should we choose for authority or training skills?

(Best option is to combine both but atm that is not an option. Later on, the CISO could be sent to presentation training courses)

Our plan for now:

I am the intern working on awareness, so I will continue my program until I leave. In the meantime, I will gradually hand over the program to my company counselor (who also is the project manager for the certification,management representative of infosec and director People Operations), with the CISO as number 2 for the program.

The company counselor will do the offline courses and the general meeting parts (he already is the one leading the general meeting) and the CISO will be the person for E-learning and phishing as well as backup for the offline training.

Please let me know what you think. I prefer to receive constructive feedback."

I'm writing a thesis on the subject of Information Security, and wanted to use this as a case study. In order to correctly describe the events that transpired, I found the original statement by the power plant. But it's in German. 

Every news outlet had either taken parts of it, did not include the 16.12.2016 update, or just completely interpreted this as they wish. So it would be great to have an accurate translation of what happened according to the power plant company.

I realize this is a long piece of text, and I appreciate the work you guys do here. Thanks in advance!

&gt;Im Kernkraftwerk Gundremmingen ist im Rahmen revisionsvorbereitender Prüfarbeiten in Block B so genannte Büro-Schadsoftware gefunden worden. Diese Software ist in der Fachwelt bereits einige Jahre bekannt; sie zielt unter anderem darauf ab, eine ungewollte Verbindung zum Internet herzustellen. 

&gt;Die im Kraftwerk an technischen Komponenten eingesetzten Rechner, die für die Steuerung der Anlage genutzt werden, sind nicht mit dem Internet verbunden. Die gefundene Schadsoftware kann zudem keine Veränderungen an technischen Steuerungen bewirken. Alle sensiblen Kraftwerksbereiche sind entkoppelt und grundsätzlich redundant sowie manipulationsgeschützt ausgelegt. Das betroffene IT-System, das 2008 zur Datenverarbeitung und -visualisierung nachgerüstet wurde, gehört zur Brennelement-Lademaschine. Einen Einfluss auf die Steuerung der Lademaschine konnte es aufgrund der Systemarchitektur nicht geben. 

&gt;Die zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde und das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) wurden informiert. Die Aufklärung erfolgt mit Unterstützung durch IT-Fachleute des RWE-Konzerns. Im Kraftwerk sind zwischenzeitlich alle weiteren sicherheitstechnisch wichtigen IT-Systeme ohne Befund überprüft worden. Bei einer am 24.04.2016 abgeschlossenen Prüfung von Wechseldatenträgern und Programmiergeräten gefundene Schadsoftware wurde erkannt und bereinigt. Die Vorkehrungen zur IT-Sicherheit sind ausgeweitet worden. 

&gt;Das Vorkommnis wurde gemäß den deutschen Meldekriterien in die Kategorie N (Normal) eingestuft. Nach der internationalen Skala zur Bewertung von Vorkommnissen (INES) ist es der Stufe 0 zuzuordnen (unterhalb der Skala, keine oder sehr geringe sicherheitstechnische Bedeutung). Eine Gefährdung des Personals, der Umgebung oder der Anlage war damit nicht verbunden. 

&gt;Aktualisierung 16.12.2016: 

&gt;Untersuchungen zu Schadsoftware-Fund abgeschlossen – Schutzmaßnahmen optimiert 

&gt;Die mit Unterstützung von IT-Fachleuten des RWE-Konzerns durchgeführten IT-forensischen Untersuchungen nach einem Fund von Büro-Schadsoftware im April 2016 sind abgeschlossen. Als Konsequenz aus dem Ereignis wurden die Schutzmaßnahmen gegen das Eindringen von Schadsoftware optimiert und massiv verschärft. 

&gt;Die Erstinfektion mit der Büro-Schadsoftware erfolgte über einen Laptop der Ausbildungsabteilung, der u. a. auch für Präsentationen bei Ausbildungsmessen eingesetzt wurde. Der installierte Virenscanner wurde nicht aktuell gehalten, da das Gerät weder für den Einsatz im Internet vorgesehen, noch mit der Kraftwerks-IT verbunden war. Die Schadsoftware wurde über einen infizierten externen USB-Wechseldatenträger auf den Laptop übertragen. 

&gt;Im zweiten Schritt wurden zu Ausbildungszwecken Daten zwischen einem Rechner aus dem Werkstattbereich des Betriebsgeländes des Kraftwerks und dem Rechner der Ausbildungsabteilung übertragen. Die Übertragung erfolgte mit Hilfe eines weiteren eingesetzten USB-Wechseldatenträgers. Die Infektion des Visualisierungsrechners der Brennelementlademaschine von Block B erfolgte schließlich über einen weiteren Wechseldatenträger, der zuvor durch den Rechner aus dem Werkstattbereich infiziert worden war. Hierbei wurden existierende Betriebsvorschriften (Virenscan von eingesetzten USB-Wechseldatenträgern) nicht beachtet. 

&gt;Die Sicherheit der Brennelemente-Handhabung war zu keiner Zeit gefährdet. Zur Programmierung von digitalen Steuerungen im Kraftwerk verwendete Rechner haben auch künftig keine Verbindung zum Internet oder zum Firmennetzwerk. 

&gt;Die für die sichere Reaktorsteuerung verwendeten Systeme sind mit analoger Leittechnik ausgestattet und können durch Schadsoftware generell nicht beeinflusst werden. 

&gt;Als Konsequenz wurden an allen RWE-Kernkraftwerksstandorten die Schutzmaßnahmen gegen das Einbringen von Schadsoftware noch weiter verschärft. Insbesondere der Zugang mit Rechnern und Wechseldatenträgern zu den Kraftwerken wurde enger reglementiert, der Umgang mit USB-Wechseldatenträgern innerhalb der Kraftwerke völlig neu geregelt. So sind Kraftwerkstechnik und Kraftwerks-IT, gestuft nach der jeweiligen sicherheitstechnischen Bedeutung, nun in Zonen aufgeteilt. In diesen dürfen nur noch neu beschaffte, intern kodierte und system- oder personenbezogene USB-Wechseldatenträger zum Einsatz kommen. Die USB-Wechseldatenträger sind vor Drittzugriff geschützt."

I feel like I can't get any straight answers regarding the SMP program.
Does the unit take precedent over my education? For example my last guard unit had people drop out of school for the semester to attend AT. Also it was common to miss out on school on Thursdays and Fridays for drills. Is the SMP cadet exempt from these things? 

From what I have heard I am stuck going to an engineer unit when I start SMP (currently aviation). Does it really matter what type of unit you are in while you are in SMP?

Lastly from what I have researched my first pick of branch would be cyber. I want to do something that involves my degree. altho understand that this branch is extremely competitive. Currently I have a 3.9 GPA with a computer science major. I have three internships in the industry and usually score around a 290 on my PT test. 

I am a little worried that I will commission and be stuck doing something not related to my career goals at all. How realistic is it that I will get a branch that involves work in my field of study?

Sorry for the barrage of questions. I would appreciate any help!

7hq4k9,4,2017-12-05,I get so depressed from working,starlightryouchi,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7hq4k9/i_get_so_depressed_from_working/,"This year, I have had 5 different jobs. 

The first I was at for a while, working during summer and winter breaks from college and then I just stayed for a while after graduating. I really disliked it because of the company itself, they just didn't treat their employees well and I figured that I should work in the field I studied, which is plant sciences. ...i realized it's super difficult to get a job in that field.

Anyway, my second job this year was working at a nursery. I figured I could get experience, but I hated it. I worked 54 hours a week with no overtime pay. I was miserable and felt like they were taking advantage of me, so I left.

Third job was at another nursery and I actually really liked this one. I was really just a cashier  but I learned a lot about which plants grow best in what conditions. The other employees were super sweet and caring, it felt like a family and everyone was very close. I still felt crappy going in on some days, but this was by far my favorite job. It was only seasonal though, so I couldn't stay.

Fourth job was at another nursery which sold to Lowe's and Home Depot, big stores like that. My job title was assistant grower and I thought I would really be able to start a career. My first day, they had me pulling weeds with the interns. Second day, I was setting up tubes for indoor irrigation with the interns again. I just wasn't understanding why I was doing this when I my job was supposed to be assistant grower. I may have stayed longer, but the place was extremely dirty. The main bathroom didn't have soap and other smaller bathrooms around the facility didn't even have sinks. I ended up getting a really terrible UTI, I had the shakes when I got home, maybe I was being a baby  but I figured I should put my health before a job even if it meant a career.

My fifth and current job is a barista at a local coffee shop. I used to really like working here  but now I've really come to hate it. I don't agree with a lot of the things the manager/owner's significant other is doing. It's putting a lot of stress on us. She's already fired 5 employees just because she doesn't like their ""attitude"". Now we are down to three employees and she won't hire anyone else. Besides that, I get customers telling me they won't come into the shop when they see that she's here. 

I feel like I mostly have problems with the management and how the business is run in most of my positions or maybe I'm just nitpicking, but it gets to the point where I'm crying every night and morning because I don't want to go to work. I'm scared that I'm always going to feel this way no matter what job I have. I just don't know what to do anymore.."

Although the essence of the show is exploring people's feelings and relationships among a hospital staff, the lack of ""punishment"" bothers me in the earlier seasons (i've only watched the first 3 seasons) now that i'm rewatching. 

For instance, when the whole Denny storyline aired i was totally on Izzie's side, and didn't understand why Bailey was so hard on her. 
But now my GOD i cannot believe i ever felt that way. Their love was cute, but the total lack of punishment for Izzie's actions is really mind-blowing. I mean girl, your actions led to his death and you dragged your friends in the situation...  

I also hate when any of the characters has a personal issue and takes it out on the whole hospital : the staff, the patients, the fucking chief of surgery... I mean could you imagine interns behaving like that in real life ?   I'm all for drama, but they could make it a little more believable"

throwaway because people know my main.

I'll try keep this short but there's a bit of backstory.

My girlfriend (Kelly) and I met last year in June. We had both applied to do a summer job at a hotel on the beach during the holidays, there were quite a few of us student interns as the hotel gets very busy over that time and needed short term staff. I went with a friend of mine and she went with her ex boyfriend (Steve). They had committed to going before they broke up and they broke up in January last year. 

Whilst we were working a few of us students got to know each other and we partied alot together, her included. He was not part of this partly because of her and also because the rest of us didn't really like him. She and I bonded on the trip and the ex got kicked off the program for causing a fight in the hotel bar. Once he was gone she and I got closer and we eventually got together in the last week we were there.

She told me that the reason they broke were that he was very controlling and aggressive with her about even seeing guys whilst, he fooled around with other girls ( he lied to her constantly, but she said she never found proof of infidelity, but she had alot of suspicions). Anyway, he stayed in her home town whilst she was moving to another city. Which happened to be where I am studying as well.

This was a big factor in us getting together - that we would both be staying in the same city after the holidays. Our families live in different cities but we were staying in the same one. Everything was awesome, we hung out almost everyday, and had regular sex and  became friends with each others friends(she had some who had moved as well).

Then in December during break we both went to our home towns for the holidays. We spoke on the phone often and had an awesome time with our families. 

A week or two before she was meant to leave she mentioned that she'd run into Steve and that he was begging to get back together with her. I thought nothing of this, and we joked together about it, she told he was delusional and whatever. Then one night she tells me she's going out with friends and I let her know that's cool and she must have fun. 

I go to bed, and at 2 in the morning my phone goes off and it's her. She tells me she was in a car accident and that she was freaking out. I made sure she was fine, and she said it was just a minor collision but she was quite shaken. She sounded pretty drunk on the phone which wasn't unusual for a party with the friends she mentioned.

 The next morning, I did my best to console her on the phone. She didn't mention many details but she showed me a picture of the car and it didn't look very uber like(which is how I assumed she was getting around). I asked her who's car it was and she broke down and said it was Steve's. This broke me a bit and I hung up the phone. 

When I cooled off I asked her what happened and she said nothing bad they just had drinks together. She assured me that he was an asshole (could confirm, I had met him) and that she was happy with me, and that he had just kept pressuring her until she said yes. I was pretty confident they didn't cheat since it's a small town she's from and if anyone saw something, rumors would fly, also she had been so adamant about how bad of a boyfriend he was I didn't think she would consider doing something with him. I was still really upset though and trust had definitely been broken.

We chatted for a while when she got back, and I forgave her but asked her to remove all contact with him. She deleted all his info and he also deleted his facebook to ""stop trying to get what he can't have"" or something. 

Anyway, the rest of the year has been great, we've gotten closer, been on trips together and she met my family in June. 

Fast forward to last week. I was in her town visiting her family. We met up with some of her childhood friends and we ended up playing a drinking game on an app. Somewhere in the night she got challenged to ""call an ex"", I laughed and said you don't have to do it, but she said ""come on it'll be fun"".

She used my phone and called Steve and they had a pretty awkward conversation and the whole party felt it as well. I told her to hang up and we carried on playing. 

The next day I'm sitting next to her and her phone goes off in her hand, I look over and see she had a message from Steve. His name was in her contacts already. I saw this and asked her why he was messaging her, because I thought she blocked him. She told me that she deleted his number but thought he blocked her. 

I got upset by this and told her that I didn't like it. She said to me that she had proven already this year that she was trust worthy and started getting angry with me. I couldn't really refute that but at the same time I had asked her not to contact him. I felt bad however for acting like I didn't trust her so I dropped it for the rest of the time I was there. I know that they texted at least a little bit more while I was there.

I'm now at home and she's still in her home town. I feel bad for not trusting her but at the same time I find myself getting paranoid when she tells me she's going out. I know I'm no saint but from what she described of her relationship with Steve I feel like I have treated her so much better at least. Do you guys think I'm overreacting here? How should I approach this ?
 
Just an edit: I do think that her having his number was a result of the call during the drinking game. We've been pretty much around each other all the time and she never hides her phone or anything.
---   
  **tl;dr**: Met girlfriend while working at a hotel. We live in the same city but she lied to me about seeing him when she went home. I told her to cut ties, he's now texting her again a year later and the paranoia is back. What do?"
7hqx4y,2,2017-12-05,My drug psychosis,blackbobni99erpants,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/7hqx4y/my_drug_psychosis/,"Kinda boored waiting for trip to settle after failed micro dosing attempt. So here we go.

TL;DR - go down to (*). 

Me and my mates where going to switzerland on internship and decided to party before to say good bye to the others. Bought some speed for 30€ we shared 4 people but i believe i ended up getting the better half of it all. 

Party was lit dancing and babbling with strangers and me and my friend went to his parents to sleep for the night and go to the airport in the morning. Was awake all night staring at him in the dark as he took shapes of dolls and other hallucinations. At one point everything got to lsd level visuals for a few, that was a strange moment. Anyways i pee in a bottle bcs i was afraid to go to the bathroom. 

The morning i was super sketchy around his old folks, my friend wearing glasses was much more laid back. Didnt sleep in the car and realised i had the bag of goodies left when we got to the airport so i took some toilet paper and bombed it all. 

On the plane i felt like being watched by all the people, and i probably looked whacked as fuck by now. Had the coziest sensation tingling my chest :)

Made a stop in vienna for many hours. Night time and the few people there gathered once in a while in the smoking booth. Ended up talking with some arabs, mostly using google translate, and took OG pictures with them for some reason with my other friend. When everyone went to sleep i couldt sleep since someone might steal the passport i was grabbing on to so tight. Also the coffee here was very good and u think the people next to us were fucking. 

Fast forward to final destination zurich were we have to wait hours until the host picks us up. Was told i had to sleep so I went outside and so I did.

*When I woke up I realized I had slept on the very same spot some relative or similar was murdered! ..at a bus stop. I was devistated, torn up to the max, crying to myself how could i do such a thing. I went all around the place and realized I had to get my headphones I mustve dropped. I got to some people now sitting in the spot waiting for the bus and prolly looked hella pathetic crying to them about my headphones next to them, super sad by now. 

Very blurry memory in this part, I was trapped in the dreamy reality and did not question or comprehend the context of anything. I for example asked this police man if I could sleep in a bed at their arrest. He was the definition of ""dafuq"".

Lol got interupted by an old lady rn, gotta have convo with those if u can.

Anyways I believe I have dreamt some stuff and when i woke up it was my reality. I ended up on the windowledge of a big window where i could see everyones feet walking by. This specific place was a monument raised by a golden hearted homeless man who spent his fortune on building this, as a sanctuary for homeless people. Me not living in this country and nowhere to go, was technically homeless, and i lived this role to the fullest. I lied there as a homeless beggar looking at the people walking by like nothing and cried some more about the fact that no one remebered this place anymore. The world had become too cold for such a gesture to still be remebered. 

The guards took me. Scary ass automatic rifles. Not even them would have any compassion. I was shoved away from this small window and homeless sanctuary built for people like me.

Fuck everybody then! I trashed some stuff around and unplugged the vending machines. Did no longer try to telepathically call out to people. 

Finally the host came and I could go with the subway to the hostfamily. I could not eat the food i was served because my hand was shaking too much. 

Took a few days before i was back to normal. 
Fuck that never again. And am so sorry host family! Those kind people dont know it but they helped me get on top of my drug use. Forever thankful."

I was a finance major and was looking forward to getting placed on finance related projects but it seems most of the ""Financial Services"" work are tech implementations. Additionally, due to the regional model, real FS related projects are scarce in my region (Midwest). Additionally because of fear of changeability(staffed for only 6 weeks in 5 months) I rolled on a project for the next year that has to do with healthcare so... it could be up to 1 year and a half, if that, before I start getting into FS projects. Thus instead of wasting the next two years looking for FS work (my options include looking at transferring to other offices at ACN where FS is heavy e.g. NYC) which might even not be FS at all, I've decided to look into other companies as well. My questions about this are listed below:

1. I plan to look at are KPMG because I've had previous internships with them (was in another country though). How will interning at these places help my chances?

2. What is the best method to look for opportunities at KPMG. I am planning on contacting recruiters at KPMG.

3. Although I would be planning to change jobs after at least a year of working at ACN, I heard it is hard to get a job at another Big 4 with less than 2 years of experience. Is this true? If so, do you suggest I go down the switch jobs route or transfer offices route?

Out of the all of the consulting work I've done for ACN, KPMG and EY, I enjoyed my experience at KPMG the most because I actually learnt a lot in 2 short months about consulting in banking. I also talked to a friend about the type of work he's doing with KPMG, in the office I would like to be in (DC) and it's exactly what I want to be doing.

Any advice y'all?"

Should I turn off this feature so that recruiters don't message me, and I reject them, and then they stop looking at my profile down the road in 18 months when I need them to? Or it doesn't matter? Basically, will it backfire on me in 18 months when I'm looking for a permanent job if I keep rejecting recruiters now? If so, do you suggest I turn off this feature for now?

My other question, how legit are those messages. Are they mass sent based on keywords of people's profiles? Or are people handpicked?

Been kind of going through a internlife crisis where I’m not sure I’m learning fast enough. 

How long did it take for the individual returns you prepare to stop having mistakes? 

I have ~2 mo experience and my returns still have all these little errors that are tiny mistakes but still matter a lot. Transposition errors for example. And where I don’t know the tax law AND I also don’t know where to enter it into the software anyways or why something is entered somewhere. Everyone helps me and explains stuff to me but I still feel dumb. 

I have problems understanding estimates and calculating them and projections too. Are these common hurdles for interns? 

I started learning taxes 3 months ago, I literally knew nothing hadn’t even filed my own return ever before I just want to make sure I’m learning fast enough, what do you guys think? Should I be making mistakes still? I mean it’s been 2-3 months...seems like a long time.

Supporting info:
I’ve prepared roughly 15-20 returns so far

10 have been easy and progressively harder, then the other 5-10 were the hardest returns in the office. Good learning experience, however. It is a regional firm so hardest returns are probably not the same here as B4 but still. "

Why were you like this? Why did you treated me like shit? Why did you used me like this? And why did you never said anything? You never apologized, you never realized what you did. How you treated me. It feels so bad. I feel so sad that someone can hurt me so much. I was innocent and alone, looking for love and support. And you treated me like shite, eventually being neutral to me, but in the end I felt like exploited. Like you eploited the life out of me.
I had the hardest time of my life. THose two months felt like ages. They were like glue, I tried to walk through a thick layer of sticky glue. Not coming forward.

I was lost and helpless and you exploited my vulnerable situation. My depressive episode got worse and I realized how I felt after watching this movie on the weekend of my birthday. Melancholia showed me exactly how I felt. Anxious and helplessly depressive. It was so sad to see myself from the outside. I looked at my life before that event and it was alright. It had normal ups and downs. And then this two months were horror. It was living the horror. It had nice parts too but it was 95% bullshit. I am happy that I got over it. I feel so much better now and I have it under control.

I was so sad that on my 21st birthday I had to sit there and be sad. I had no friends around me but this weekend I chose to meet up with a dear friend who saved me. If she wasn't there I don't know if I would have had the will to pack my bags and go back home. I'm happy that this happened in a city where I will never go back to, I have no strings attached there. NO family no friends.
So I could just leave after my 2 month internship. Leave you shitty lizard piece of shit behind and go my way to my beloved study town. You shit ass fucker were even enraged when I declined your visit in summer. why the fuck should I host you and your sucker friends in MY city when you treated me like bullshit?

I was so young and naive. I thought I would gain your love and attention if I sleep with you. I wanted to have that what others always talk about. Orgasm with someone else etc pp. Friends with benefits seemed like such a cool concept. I was so dumb. And you were the one exploiting me.

BUT NOW IT STOPS. YOU ARE NOT EXPLOITING ME ANYMORE: It has been nearly 3 years and I will stop being the victim. You are a piece of shit and I hope that you die soon. I hope you get to feel how I felt. To feel the pain, the grieve, the self-hatred you get when someone treats you like shit over and over and over again although you have done nothing wrong. Although you were TOO NICE: 

I WILL STOP. You have no power over me anymore.

I had a depressive episode. "
7htig1,11,2017-12-05,"Me(23M) with my girlfriend (22F) of 4 years have been fighting a lot lately because her mother threatened me, and I don't want to see her again. Am I being stupid?",alex_agape94,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7htig1/me23m_with_my_girlfriend_22f_of_4_years_have_been/,"Hi guys! This is going to be quite long, so I'm sorry for that.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 4 years. All went really well until this summer.

We are not living together, but we live quite close by from each other, so it's been quite easy to meet and go out together in the beginning. After a year I started to go to her house, and hang out there because she asked me consistently. I said okay, and after a while I was even sleeping there for a lot of time (almost a year, I would sleep there like 3 or 4 times a week, and then go back to my house for a few days). But, despite this, I never felt okay in that house, beside her mother(45F, single) and her sister(24F). I don't know why, but something inside me was telling me that it's not good that I'm staying there for so much time.

Fast forward a couple of months (summer, 2016), we wanted to go to the mountains here in our country for a couple of days. Her mother just went crazy when she heard about our plans, and forbid her to go anywhere. Her sister went to the seaside with her boyfriend(27M), so I started to ask questions about why they could go and we couldn't. When I got upset, her mother said that her financial situation is not good at all, and that she will let us when we'll have our own money. I then told her that we have some money saved, so it's gonna be enough, but we ended up fighting, so I just gave up just to avoid starting a war.

This summer(2017), we both got an internship, which was quite well paid, so money was not an issue anymore. Her sister went to the seaside once again, and we started to plan our vacation once again, being certain that this year she would let her go with me. And surprise surprise, she lost her shit again. I then asked her mother why is her sister allowed to do anything she wants, but we aren't. Her mother obviously didn't like that I was asking why, but she just ignored me. After a couple of days, exactly on my birthday, I went to take my girlfriend out to a restaurant to celebrate. Her mother didn't even want to see me, so I knocked to her door. When I opened the door and asked if she was upset, she gave me the most disturbing look I've ever seen, and she told me ""If you will ever have the disrespect to ask me why I decide something, we will go further"" (I don't know how to translate this, English is not my first language, but it was essentially a threat. In other words she told me to shut the hell up, and get out, if not, things will go bad - whatever that means; Honestly I was concerned for my girlfriend, so I didn't say anything and just left).

I then got out of the house, and in the car I told my girlfriend that I will not get back in her house ever again, because it's obvious that I'm not wanted there. She agreed then, and we went on, but of course our vacation was canceled once again. 

And I never went back there ever since. But now, my girlfriend is telling me that I'm destroying our relationship, because we don't spend any time together other than college (we study at the same university). She told me to go back with her to her house. I just don't want to do that. Something snapped inside of me that day, and this made me not wanting to get inside her house any more. My girlfriend told me that I'm the only one who still remembers what happened in the summer, and that I should go talk to her mother to sort things out. If not, she will break up with me, because it's obvious that I don't love her. She told me that if I loved her, I wouldn't even care about her mother, and just ignore her. But I think it's the other way round, honestly.

But I don't know why, I just can't do it. I don't want to, and I feel like I don't have to do it. Am I being stupid? Should I just forget what happened and try to go to her house again so that we'll stop fighting? I know this whole situation sounds completely stupid, because it is, but I'm struggling with it a lot, and I don't know how to deal with it.

TLDR: My girlfriend's mother threatened me, and I don't want to see her any more. After 6 months since that incident, my girlfriend is blaming me that our relationship is not going well. She told me that I should go and talk to her mother and sort things through. But something inside of me just doesn't want to do that, and every time I get close to her house, every cell in my body is telling me to go away. Am I being stupid? Should I just forget what happened and try again? 

Sorry if it's hard to understand, English is not my native language."

7hukop,1,2017-12-05,M4A - TV Comedies (and Other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7hukop/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

----

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

I really hate that I can't transition and pursue hobbies and a field I like without people(especially family members) saying that I'm too dumb or passing hypocritical statements that I'm smart enough and I can do anything as long as I work hard , only for them to turn around when I'm not perfect in the subjects I'm good at and tell me to give up and try something else because I'm not perfect. I'm done with their N behavior, gaslighting, and cynicism just because they weren't able to achieve things at my age.

I can't stand them, I want to leave. I'll never get better if I'm around people who don't support me and bring me down if I do pursue my dreams. But I can't because I don't have any internship experience plus I'm still in school for a few years before I graduate college. I want to move out of my state as fast as possible and start transitioning and school (to get prereqs done and get into science grad programs)again. I don't want to wait and finish school later than I suppose to get. 

I'm definitely going to have some obstacles, especially since my parents won't let me move out of state let alone let me move out without a roommate. How am I suppose to be independent if they don't let me be independent? I just want to move out smoothly and without stress. So anyone that has dealt with this, how do you deal with this? What should I know about moving and moving to another state especially since I'm planning to get a car soon?"
7huvp4,130,2017-12-05,Vietnam Allstar team can't attend to All star 2017 due to Visa problem,Drk_shd0w,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7huvp4/vietnam_allstar_team_cant_attend_to_all_star_2017/,"As far as i know, Only Levi can join up the GPL all star with Jisu, Patrick(Thailand),Kra,Dantiz(Singapore).
Hope,Naul,Noway,Palette was refused to get US visa.
This is a status on Tinikun's timeline

Because this will concern players in our GPL regions then i'm gonna write it down in English.

Speaking of the Visa issues, as we all know, applying for a U.S Visa is never easy for a Viet, especially gamers, so it's unfortunate.Only Levi could make it through out of 5 players, it should be because he'd traveled around since last year's December: Spain, the Phillippines, Brazil, Thailand, China, and he's quite popular then the embassy could easily check his information online(they really did).

Actually, RIOT and Garena already tried their best, they applied for those Visas in Vietnam, then came all the way to Thailand to apply again, but somehow got rejected.

So now, the GPL All-stars team consists of : Jisu, Levi, Patrick, Dantiz and Kra, and the coach OMO.

About Jisu, i always think he is the most skilled top laner in GPL, and feel sorry for him that he can't communicate quite well with the teammates 'cause of language barrier, but even that, he always did well, right?

For other positions, including the coach, they should come from SG team, because they did really well in GPL allstars event, a region with a small player pool, considered a dead region, but they blew us all away, they prepared well, they tried to fight for win, they really had the discipline, and they won the 1st runner-up, and they deserve it as well. I wanna highlight it here, we, VN players, unfortunately couldn't make it through, and SG players are here to help us to fulfill the task, they are here to help.

For Arykelic, he stuck with his internship so he can't join, and Patrick replaces him. As i recall, Patrick was there to help Indonesian team H2H when their mid laner got sick from the last GPL, the tinkerman, and tell you what, i love Claudio Ranieri.

Mentioning of Levi, after seeing other Vietnamese players couldn't make it, he asked me if he should join or not, and i told him he should, cause he deserves it, 2017 is a significant year for VN League of Legends, he should go to the U.S for himself, for GAM, for GPL, and ofc, for Viet Nam.

For me, i forfeited my slot, personally, going to an event with players i haven't prepared well enough turning out being like a vacacion, going on a vacation is great, but going on a vacation while other players are feeling pretty sad now, is something not quite right for me.

Anyway, guys from Vietnam, we have Levi to cheer, and we have SG guys + Jisu + Patrick, who are here to help us, then we should appreciate it. As long as we still do our best, we still have the next time, then, heads up. Go, GPL Allstars team."

This is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this.

Let me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). 
I have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. 
Basically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :))
I consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.

I've always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the ""odd one out"", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. 
Eventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 ""classes"". 
This is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was ""depressed"" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone.
But that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.

I thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided 
 in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. 
After 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. 
The only way i felt better was with playing runescape.

YEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined
Year 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy.
And on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. 

Year 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. 
All the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**COLLEGE**
This was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study ""orthopedagogie"", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that.
Ofcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE.
In my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a ""friend group"". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.

I was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later.
During the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.

I liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. 

So here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february.
I still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT.

My whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with ""depression"" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was. 
To be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster.

I dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because ""i work to slow"". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use ""common sense"" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x... 

Remember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a ""mental"" side to it. I can come across different then the ""normal person"", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly. 
My parents just said im a slow learner but with ""hard work i get there"". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of ""ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you"". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself.
I feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed.

BUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw). 
As i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Im not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating...
""Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job"" ""Grow up for once"". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it.

They don't teach web dev too much where I go to school with the exception of a few electives. Most of the projects are done in C++. I took both a front end and a back end class where I picked up HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, and I like working with these languages very much. I've also done a bit of PHP and MySQL in a few other classes too so I'm quite familiar with a variety of languages and am confident that I will be able to learn more. There's definitely large variety of languages and technologies that companies are asking for... So how often will companies hire someone who is experienced in web development but not with the specific tools that they're using? (i.e. .NET, C#, Angular, React, gulp, grunt, etc...). 

For what it's worth, I'm also currently a web developer intern that does mainly front end work (HTML, CSS, Javascript). "
7hx9ny,2,2017-12-06,I just really need to vent...,aaron_nels,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7hx9ny/i_just_really_need_to_vent/,"For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I’ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I’m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I’m asking for help, guidance, I don’t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE... 

I’m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn’t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision  and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. 

After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn’t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled.

My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I’m here today. 

My, now fiancé, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I’m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), “why doesn’t he move here?,” or “why don’t you move there?” 
Here’s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I’m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancé visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil’s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. 

I know I have talked a lot about my fiancé but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said “I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!” Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well, I moved in with my best friend due to a dispute I had with my parents, which really crumbled me, but they still don’t know how upset I am about it. 

I moved to Portland... and now I believe I’m regretting it... 

I moved with that same best friend where we would also share the space with two others, a couple from Hawaii. We had Skyped then ahead of time in our excitement of moving and we were all excited to meet each other. I had a job lined up for me as a barista, I had a savings plan lined up for what I could and couldn’t spend for money, school would be starting soon, things were looking pretty nice! 

Well... it’s not nice. Not nice at all. 

The Hawaiian couple does not like my friend and I. They stop our oven mittens and tried to say they were there’s and hid them from us, refused to let us use the garbage can in the kitchen, and held little meetings about what it is we were doing wrong and how we could fix it.. I was so thrown back I ignore them at any chance and even had to take time out of my life to tell them how upsetting it is we had reached a level where they had to actually put sticky notes on things we could touch and could not touch. I find myself to be quite tidy and clean and fair but I guess there are two sides of the story always. 

That’s the first thing. 

That job I had lined up as a barista? Big joke... I met with the boss who said the store isn’t open yet and asked if I wanted to be a cashier for the university instead. I said why not, the pay was amazing at $12.75 an hour and had benefits. I did my on-boarding and was quite interested. First day on the job however they lied and put me in food service where I was demanded around by two chefs and four managers who didn’t know what the fuck they were doing. One of the chef’s actually spilt boiling grease on my foot and didn’t even apologize. The other chef was racist and talked bad about the Indian workers so much I had to leave his presence. It was a toxic environment. Income tax in Oregon was so high I wasn’t able to afford my apartment and realized I need to be working minimum wage to sincerely support myself here. I left after a month and am now struggling on finding a full time again. On a side note, because of costs and issues with finding a co-signed for a loan, I had to pull my enrollment for school as well.

That’s the second.. 

When my fiancé came to visit me for a month, my best friend/roommate was very difficult... it’s a harsh word to use but she has a lot of learning to do. I have been on my own since I was 16 in doing things myself (with the exception of paying my phone bill and buying a car). Taxes, jobs, appointments, etc., were all me. She needs some help getting there and she has done and amazing job to get there but... every opportunity I hand her to take one more step of becoming independent she rejects and shuts down completely. The whole month was very hard for my fiancé and I over how jealous and upset she got and it was too much. Currently she is back home for Christmas and I am alone and quite frankly I needed it. I just don’t know how to handle that situation. It was as if she was using her emotions against me and it was poisonous. It go so bad my fiancé and Igor an Airbnb our last two nights together so it could just be me and him. 

That’s the third..

I had to go to the emergency room as well when my fiancé was here due to yet another kidney stone. I got one in the 7th grade, near the end of my exchange program and one in a restaurant where the pain was so bad I needed to call an ambulance... more money on shit I can’t afford. 

I can go on and on with these stories but I need to get to this... it’s my anxiety. I was diagnosed with depression in high school but was taken off of medication. I was doing actually quite well! But most recently, with everything that’s been going on, it’s gotten really really bad. I am constantly anxed about everything.. when I walk down the street, I fear what people look at me as. Now I’m not fat, I’d say I’m average but my cheeks are so puffy and it really embarrasses me to even look in a mirror. I am constantly wondering why my fiancé wants to be with me, if he is cheating on me, lied to me, etc. I over stress about the smallest smallest things. Example: I cried and broke down because I failed my drivers test for the Oregon license. I physically felt like I was going to die or the end of the world was happening... why? Why was that happening to me? Why is this ALL happening to me? I miss my fiancé, I can’t get stable, I now starting out as an adult isn’t supposed to be easy but guys... this is really hard. I spend any day I have off in bed and I have only had one meal within two days. I know I need help but I don’t have the money for it or the time. I have never felt this insecure about my life, future, body, everything. I feel like I’m climbing up an escalator that’s going the wrong way, and no amount of running will get me to the top. 

I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. I feel like I’ve annoyed everyone already enough about me that I no longer want to talk to literally anyone. My fiancé sometimes even. 

Well if you’ve made it this far I thank you sincerely... I just really needed to vent.

John Oliver grills Dustin Hoffman about sexual harassment allegations = By Steven Zeitchik December 5 

NEW YORK — HBO host John Oliver hammered Dustin Hoffman about allegations of sexual harassment and the actor fired back with a ferocious defense, as a seemingly benign screening became an explosive conversation about Hollywood sexual misconduct on Monday night.

“This is something we’re going to have to talk about because … it’s hanging in the air,” Oliver said to Hoffman at the discussion, an anniversary screening of the film “Wag the Dog.” He was alluding to an allegation made by Anna Graham Hunter last month that Hoffman groped her and made inappropriate comments when she was a 17-year-old intern on the set of the 1985 TV movie “Death of a Salesman.”

“It’s hanging in the air?” Hoffman said. “From a few things you’ve read, you’ve made an incredible assumption about me,” he noted, adding sarcastically, “You’ve made the case better than anyone else can. I’m guilty.”

The “Last Week Tonight” personality was moderating a 20th-anniversary screening panel at the 92nd Street Y on behalf of the Tribeca Institute, with stars Hoffman, Robert De Niro, producer Jane Rosenthal and director Barry Levinson on the stage. About halfway through the hour-long talk, Oliver brought up the issue to Hoffman, saying he found the actor’s statements about the matter wanting. Nearly the entire rest of the discussion was then dominated by Oliver, Hoffman and the subject of sexual harassment.

Hoffman had offered a conditional apology at the time of the allegation, and on Monday he underscored an “if” included in that statement, noting several times that he didn’t really believe he had done anything wrong. He said that he had not engaged in groping, that he didn’t recall meeting Graham Hunter and that all his comments on set were simply how members of “a family” talked to one another.

“I still don’t know who this woman is,” Hoffman said. “I never met her; if I met her, it was in concert with other people.”


Oliver dismissed that as insufficient, then cited Hoffman’s response at the time of the allegation that the actor’s behavior on set was “not reflective of” who he really is.

“It’s ‘not reflective of who I am’ — it’s that kind of response to this stuff that pisses me off,” Oliver said. “It is reflective of who you were. If you’ve given no evidence to show it didn’t [happen] then there was a period of time for a while when you were a creeper around women. It feels like a cop-out to say ‘It wasn’t me.’ Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?”

Hoffman accused Oliver of “putting me on display” and said he felt blindsided because neither Oliver nor Tribeca organizers had told him that the moderator would raise the subject.

Several times, however, Oliver sought to move on and talk about the film, but Hoffman returned to the subject of harassment, growing testy as he said Oliver was not keeping an “open mind” while unquestionably believing accusers.

“Do you believe this stuff you read?” Hoffman asked.

“Yes,” Oliver replied. “Because there’s no point in [an accuser] lying.”

“Well, there’s a point in her not bringing it up for 40 years,” Hoffman said.

“Oh, Dustin,” Oliver said disapprovingly, putting his head in his hand.

At one point, Rosenthal tried to jump in and defuse the situation.

“You also have the way men and women worked together [in the past]; you are in a situation where ‘that was then, this is now,’” Rosenthal said. “[And] what difference is all this going to make? … This conversation doesn’t do any good. We have a platform here. How are we moving [the issue] forward?”

Oliver, though, said he felt it was imperative to talk about it. “This isn’t fun for me,” the TV personality noted. “[But] there’s an elephant in the room because, this particular incident, a conversation has not been had.” He noted that the film they were gathering to discuss, “Wag The Dog,” dealt with sexual misconduct by a powerful man.

Rosenthal then said of the film, “It wasn’t produced by Weinstein or Miramax…Kevin Spacey wasn’t starring in it. Let’s look at real sexual criminal predators.”

“That’s a low bar,” Oliver retorted.

The back-and-forth mainly centered on the Graham Hunter allegations, and also at times invoked an accusation by Hoffman’s “The Graduate” co-star Katharine Ross that he had groped her on the set of the classic film. It did not manifestly address another claim, by the writer Wendy Riss Gatsiounis, that Hoffman had propositioned her inappropriately in a pitch meeting in 1991.

The showdown happened as sexual harassment issues continue to roil the entertainment world, with a growing number of men falling under suspicion and being held to account, often publicly. The exchange, however, marked a rarity in the post-Harvey Weinstein era, which has seen accused harassers generally offer short statements in response to allegations, if they respond at all. Very few have engaged in long public conversations about it, and almost none have sounded as defiant as Hoffman did Monday night.

The conversation grew increasingly angry as it wore on. When Hoffman began talking about his long career, Oliver interjected with “Oh, Jesus.”

“So now I can’t even finish a sentence?” Hoffman asked.

Hoffman also cited “Tootsie” as evidence of his feminist bona fides.

“I would not have made that movie if I didn’t have an incredible respect for women,” Hoffman said. “The theme of the movie is he became a better man by having been a woman.”

He said he had an awakening of sorts when, dressed as a woman for that film, he was ignored by some men on the set. “I said when I came home to my wife that I never realized men were that were brutal, that men are that obvious,” Hoffman recounted. “They didn’t find me attractive and they just erased me.”

He added, “What makes me sad is that I grew up in an environment in which we were taught to want the girls on the covers of magazines, the models, and I said to my wife ‘Look at how many interesting women I passed up … look at how many women were erased by me because of the generation I was born.’ That was a very strong reason for me wanting to make that movie.

“It’s shocking to me you don’t see me more clearly,” he then said to Oliver. “That you go by a couple of things you read.”

As the panel went on some in the crowd became involved.

“Move on. Let it go,” one woman could be heard shouting to Oliver. She was soon drowned out by other people, one of whom said “Shame on you.” Another yelled to Oliver, “Thank you for believing women,” to loud cheers.

Oliver said that he considered not addressing the subject at what was intended as a genial chat but then decided he bore an obligation.

“I can’t leave certain things unaddressed,” the host said. “The easy way is not to bring anything up. Unfortunately that leaves me at home later at night hating myself. ‘Why the … didn’t I say something? No one stands up to powerful men.’”

“Am I the powerful man?” Hoffman asked.

The actor asked why the questioner wouldn’t hear his side. “Keep a kind of open mind if you can, John.”

“I’m trying,” Oliver said.

“Well I’m trying harder than you are,” Hoffman shot back.

Tensions did not cool throughout the session.

“You weren’t there,” Hoffman said to Oliver about the “Salesman” set.

“I’m glad [I wasn’t],” the host replied.

The showdown happened as sexual harassment issues continue to roil the entertainment world, with a growing number of men falling under suspicion and being held to account, often publicly. The exchange, however, marked a rarity in the post-Harvey Weinstein era, which has seen accused harassers generally offer short statements in response to allegations, if they respond at all. Very few have engaged in long public conversations about it, and almost none have sounded as defiant as Hoffman did Monday night.

The conversation grew increasingly angry as it wore on. When Hoffman began talking about his long career, Oliver interjected with “Oh, Jesus.”

“So now I can’t even finish a sentence?” Hoffman asked.

Hoffman also cited “Tootsie” as evidence of his feminist bona fides.

“I would not have made that movie if I didn’t have an incredible respect for women,” Hoffman said. “The theme of the movie is he became a better man by having been a woman.”

He said he had an awakening of sorts when, dressed as a woman for that film, he was ignored by some men on the set. “I said when I came home to my wife that I never realized men were that were brutal, that men are that obvious,” Hoffman recounted. “They didn’t find me attractive and they just erased me.”

He added, “What makes me sad is that I grew up in an environment in which we were taught to want the girls on the covers of magazines, the models, and I said to my wife ‘Look at how many interesting women I passed up … look at how many women were erased by me because of the generation I was born.’ That was a very strong reason for me wanting to make that movie.

“It’s shocking to me you don’t see me more clearly,” he then said to Oliver. “That you go by a couple of things you read.”

As the panel went on some in the crowd became involved.

“Move on. Let it go,” one woman could be heard shouting to Oliver. She was soon drowned out by other people, one of whom said “Shame on you.” Another yelled to Oliver, “Thank you for believing women,” to loud cheers.

Oliver said that he considered not addressing the subject at what was intended as a genial chat but then decided he bore an obligation.

“I can’t leave certain things unaddressed,” the host said. “The easy way is not to bring anything up. Unfortunately that leaves me at home later at night hating myself. ‘Why the … didn’t I say something? No one stands up to powerful men.’”

“Am I the powerful man?” Hoffman asked.

The actor asked why the questioner wouldn’t hear his side. “Keep a kind of open mind if you can, John.”

“I’m trying,” Oliver said.

“Well I’m trying harder than you are,” Hoffman shot back.

Tensions did not cool throughout the session.

“You weren’t there,” Hoffman said to Oliver about the “Salesman” set.

“I’m glad [I wasn’t],” the host replied.

John Oliver grills Dustin Hoffman about sexual harassment allegations = By Steven Zeitchik December 5

NEW YORK — HBO host John Oliver hammered Dustin Hoffman about allegations of sexual harassment and the actor fired back with a ferocious defense, as a seemingly benign screening became an explosive conversation about Hollywood sexual misconduct on Monday night.

“This is something we’re going to have to talk about because … it’s hanging in the air,” Oliver said to Hoffman at the discussion, an anniversary screening of the film “Wag the Dog.” He was alluding to an allegation made by Anna Graham Hunter last month that Hoffman groped her and made inappropriate comments when she was a 17-year-old intern on the set of the 1985 TV movie “Death of a Salesman.”

“It’s hanging in the air?” Hoffman said. “From a few things you’ve read, you’ve made an incredible assumption about me,” he noted, adding sarcastically, “You’ve made the case better than anyone else can. I’m guilty.”

The “Last Week Tonight” personality was moderating a 20th-anniversary screening panel at the 92nd Street Y on behalf of the Tribeca Institute, with stars Hoffman, Robert De Niro, producer Jane Rosenthal and director Barry Levinson on the stage. About halfway through the hour-long talk, Oliver brought up the issue to Hoffman, saying he found the actor’s statements about the matter wanting. Nearly the entire rest of the discussion was then dominated by Oliver, Hoffman and the subject of sexual harassment.

Hoffman had offered a conditional apology at the time of the allegation, and on Monday he underscored an “if” included in that statement, noting several times that he didn’t really believe he had done anything wrong. He said that he had not engaged in groping, that he didn’t recall meeting Graham Hunter and that all his comments on set were simply how members of “a family” talked to one another.

“I still don’t know who this woman is,” Hoffman said. “I never met her; if I met her, it was in concert with other people.”

Oliver dismissed that as insufficient, then cited Hoffman’s response at the time of the allegation that the actor’s behavior on set was “not reflective of” who he really is.

“It’s ‘not reflective of who I am’ — it’s that kind of response to this stuff that pisses me off,” Oliver said. “It is reflective of who you were. If you’ve given no evidence to show it didn’t [happen] then there was a period of time for a while when you were a creeper around women. It feels like a cop-out to say ‘It wasn’t me.’ Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?”

Hoffman accused Oliver of “putting me on display” and said he felt blindsided because neither Oliver nor Tribeca organizers had told him that the moderator would raise the subject.

Several times, however, Oliver sought to move on and talk about the film, but Hoffman returned to the subject of harassment, growing testy as he said Oliver was not keeping an “open mind” while unquestionably believing accusers.

“Do you believe this stuff you read?” Hoffman asked.

“Yes,” Oliver replied. “Because there’s no point in [an accuser] lying.”

“Well, there’s a point in her not bringing it up for 40 years,” Hoffman said.

“Oh, Dustin,” Oliver said disapprovingly, putting his head in his hand.

At one point, Rosenthal tried to jump in and defuse the situation.

“You also have the way men and women worked together [in the past]; you are in a situation where ‘that was then, this is now,’” Rosenthal said. “[And] what difference is all this going to make? … This conversation doesn’t do any good. We have a platform here. How are we moving [the issue] forward?”

Oliver, though, said he felt it was imperative to talk about it. “This isn’t fun for me,” the TV personality noted. “[But] there’s an elephant in the room because, this particular incident, a conversation has not been had.” He noted that the film they were gathering to discuss, “Wag The Dog,” dealt with sexual misconduct by a powerful man.

Rosenthal then said of the film, “It wasn’t produced by Weinstein or Miramax…Kevin Spacey wasn’t starring in it. Let’s look at real sexual criminal predators.”

“That’s a low bar,” Oliver retorted.

The back-and-forth mainly centered on the Graham Hunter allegations, and also at times invoked an accusation by Hoffman’s “The Graduate” co-star Katharine Ross that he had groped her on the set of the classic film. It did not manifestly address another claim, by the writer Wendy Riss Gatsiounis, that Hoffman had propositioned her inappropriately in a pitch meeting in 1991.

####/r/TokyoGhoul

**29,811** Doves *investigating* for **3 years!**

---

Tokyo Ghoul is a Dark Fantasy Seinen manga serialised in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump. The story takes place in an alternate reality in Tokyo where monsters that take the form of people prey upon human flesh. Events revolve around a young college student, Ken Kaneki, who is thrust between5 the two worlds of Human and Ghoul when he is involved in a freak accident, leading to his vital organs being replaced with those of a Ghoul. Kaneki subsequently becomes a 'One Eyed Ghoul' (Half-Human, Half-Ghoul) and must face his changing nature and new bloodthirsty desires head on among cataclysmic hostilities between the two races. 

If I were to describe /r/TokyoGhoul in a single word, I would call it *Shrewd*. A good deal of the community's user base can often be seen engaging in quirky theorising or getting in those juicy one-liners in every chapter thread (I know I do).  

The Community Moderators play an active role in the general way of life that /r/TokyoGhoul takes upon itself by always being around and posting alongside the non-staff users. Always quick to answer any queries and help out in any way they can. 

Negativity isn't much of an issue from what I have observed in my time with this community, as most people are very supportive of other's submissions and more often than not seem keen to launch into any Tokyo Ghoul related discussion. Every Monday (Or Sunday for some) is always one big hype train with everyone poised, ready for the next chapter. I hope to see this community grow even more with the inevitable influx of new fans with the upcoming third season for the anime in 2018.

Some of my personal favourite content this community has to offer is:

- [A Memorable Scene from a Different Angle...](/65lt7t/)

- [The best chapter in this whole series](/6c96yb/)

- [Some results of the Panel Colouring trend](/7d5d1w/)

---

*Some Moderators of /r/TokyoGhoul were happy to offer some input of their own:*

&gt; **What has your experience with this community been like?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/Nindzya -** Pretty great! The mods here are all very respectful and friendly with each other. We discuss almost EVERYTHING with each other - the little talks remind me of morning coffee. It's much more janitor focused (spam, fixing flair, fixing tags) than other subreddits, so we don't really need to deal with lots of negative users. I've been sent straight to the -100s for my opinions, but have only a select few times has mine or any of our status been called into question.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/TheMikarin -** Honestly stressful a lot of the time, but enjoyable too when I get to do things like make flairs for the community.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Do you have a favourite submission? If so, which one?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/Nindzya -** One in particular. I'm not really a fan of theory posts which are really just baseless speculation or stretching to find meanings that aren't there for any fandom, but every fandom has one shining theory that stands above the rest and becomes headcanon for everyone. My favorite submission is from long ago that ended up being perfect. It's from way back when we were just a tiny little subreddit.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/2gjabc/spoilerspierrot_tokyo_ghoul_ch_143_ending/**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/TheMikarin  -** 
**https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/3pbh6y/furuta_kijimas_assistant_and_rose_spoilers/**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;This one is pretty memorable for me, given how accurate it turned out to be. Was shortly before the &gt; actual reveal, but was pretty cool nonetheless.
&gt;
&gt; **What kind of content do you enjoy seeing the most?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/Nindzya -**  Fan art and chapter discussions. I tend to vocally disagree with a lot of speculation that gets submitted and rank the series somewhat low (people here LOVE Tokyo Ghoul, it's insane!) so I'm viewed as a bit of a negative Nancy who hates everything, but I just want to have a good 15 minutes every Sunday and these kinds of posts are all about the fun.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/TheMikarin -** I generally really like seeing posts/comments about details like callbacks to events from earlier in the story, hints that we'd otherwise miss due to language differences, and other stuff like that. Aside from that, well thought out theories (ones that aren't reaching too much anyway), really cool fan art and unique cosplay are things that I love to see.
&gt;
**What are your hopes for the future of this community?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/Nindzya -** When our new wave of users come around for the new season I'm hoping our users become a bit more friendly rather than being so defensive in the face of criticism and slamming the downvotes. We try very hard to promote and open space and not be an echo chamber, we're slowly getting there.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/TheMikarin -** I hope more people will flair their posts and stop putting spoilers in titles by the time the :re anime comes, for now it's mostly just manga readers but by then we'll get lots of anime only newcomers, so it will be difficult for them to check the sub if spoilers aren't properly labelled or are plainly visible in titles. Really grateful to everyone who remembers to follow the rules and helps out by reminding others when they've forgotten to do so. Hope the community will be accessible and welcoming for all the newcomers from the :re anime.
&gt;
**Are there any other points you would like to add?**
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/Nindzya -** We have two very basic ideas that well describe our environment: be excellent to each other, and be passionate enough to put effort into your submissions. Many other fandoms are shitposts a plenty and can feel like white noise at times, so our subreddit is like a breath of fresh air. Our show just got a new season announced and the manga is in the most exciting arc yet nearing endgame, so now is a pretty great time to just catch up and join in on hype season.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**u/TheMikarin -** We'll eventually resume the Weekly Lax Threads, had to temporarily stop them due to issues with automod. Will add another batch of flairs some time, once we've gotten some more official art of newer characters. I'm somewhat hopeful that the :re anime will be good, but I'm at least happy that we'll likely get some decent :re merch from it.

7hxzvq,3,2017-12-06,"My first job was 5K/month high-pressure job and now I'm burned out and depressed - super long post, sorry",Lifecha,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/7hxzvq/my_first_job_was_5kmonth_highpressure_job_and_now/,"I created a throwaway for this post as I don't want my main account to be associated with these things... However, I really feel like I need someplace to vent about my feelings.

I have always been successful at school and after graduation, I got a very high-profile, well-paying job at a large company thanks to good grades and good performance at an internship. The kicker here is that I was never all that interested in the job, but as I managed the internship, knew that this might be a ""stepping stone"" to future success and was a position that most of students of my field wanted, I sold my soul to them for a 5K/month starting salary and non-tracked working hours. The days are regularly 12-14+ hours long and the pressure to succeed and to create value is immense. I was unhappy right from the beginning, but thought I'd manage a year or two and then go somewhere else.

However, right from the start I started to feel things were going wrong. I've never suffered from sleep issues, but for the first three months on the job I slept approx. 4 hours/night. I got medication for that and haven't been able to sleep without chemical help since. I have a history of depression, and I had just gotten rid of my medication 6 months before starting the job, as I was feeling good and stable. Well, after 9 months of starting I fell apart and had to go on sick leave for 2 months due to burnout from the work, and started my antidepressants again. 

I felt absolutely worthless and horrible for the sick leave. I felt (and still feel?) like I'm an absolute failure, other people manage that job, why can't I? I never liked the job, but outwardly it's an amazing job everyone is envious of, and failure feels horrible. I know my health come before anything and all that, but I think my self-worth has always been largely built around my successes at work/school/hobbies/etc, so failing really stings and makes me feel worthless. I also have no idea what else I could do, I'm only interested in things like history, but that's nowhere near my ""sensible"" good degree and educating myself again isn't really an option right now. I hate my job and am indifferent about every job option my degree comes with. 

I started seeing a therapist again, but I think she's really not suitable for me. I feel like she is judgmental, doesn't want to listen to me and jumps to conclusions right away and gives outright stupid advice. E.g., I cannot talk about my last project before sick leave without crying, and her very strong suggestion when I mentioned it and started to cry was that I should talk to someone in the company about it. I'm in therapy and talk about it BECAUSE I WANT TO HANDLE MY FEELINGS AND UNDERSTAND THEM IN THERAPY, not go to hr to cry like a madman about something that isn't their fault. I have had great therapists before, so i know it's not just me feeling conflicted about the process.

When I left her office 2 days ago I also sprained the ligaments in my ankle, so on top of this being the first week back at work I got a shitty therapy session, sprained ankle (meaning that basically only rubber boots fit my foot right now with the support), and the social events I'm supposed to partake in this week include(d) a party thrown by my sister, visiting in-laws who know about the sick leave but I DON'T WANT TO discuss it with them (My partner told them without informing me which at first I didn't mind but now it really hurts), going somewhere with my mom, and one Christmas party with friends. I'm an introvert so this is super hard. I went to my sister's party yesterday, had awful time, and I skipped in-laws visit today. My partner was crying and super sad and disappointed about it and I feel horrible. I just can't handle polite discussion for hours and hours, plus discussions on my career and sick leave, and we would probably have to spend the night, there, too, and go straight to work from their place and I'm super stressed about a meeting tomorrow. Everything just feels too much and I'm lost and tired."

I'm currently applying for jobs and wondering what your suggestions would be as far as what I should include in my cover letter.

Edit: Heres what I've got so far

To whom it may concern,

My name is mavman16 and I am a December 2017 graduate of X College with a degree in economics. I think I would be a strong candidate for this position based on my past experience in managed services and my strong work ethic. 

I had extensive internships the past two summers for the managed services division of DatacenterName in Location, NY. I am particularly impressed with ProspectiveEmployer's business model and your high levels of employee and client satisfaction. I have a strong background in system troubleshooting and network issue diagnosis as well as working directly with clients. I also gained hands-on experience with VMware, LogicMonitor and AWS . My education in economics and research experience puts me in a position to provide feedback and suggestions on emerging technologies and innovative business practices as well. 

Thank you for the time you’re taking to review this letter and I would appreciate any feedback you could provide. I hope that you’ll find my experience and education worthy of a follow-up and I would look forward to a face-to-face meeting. I’m available as soon as January to start work.

7hzk8v,1,2017-12-06,[M4F] The naive/oblivious girl,ThisIsDark,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7hzk8v/m4f_the_naiveoblivious_girl/,"So I'm really into the idea of corrupting a super naive/oblivious girl right now. Naturally most of them will be dub-con but we can play it in a consensual light too. I have a few ideas for this:

**The Sister**

So you'd be my sister and you take up a sport, football, gymnastic, ballet, etc. One day you come home and you're just incredibly sore. Usually our mother would give you a massage, run a bath for you, etc. However she's visiting family right now, it's only you and I in the house. So of course you ask me, your big bro, to give you a massage. Things start off normal, get those sore muscles worked. However when a man massages you it's different. Maybe it's my smell, my hormones or just the feeling of stronger rougher hands, you start to feel something. Then it comes 'Hey big bro I'm getting this tingly feeling between my legs and it feels really weird.' You drop the bomb on me. Trust is I always wanted to fuck you but never got a good chance. Now that you were offering yourself up to me I wouldn't say no. Time for big bro to educate his sis.

**The Student**

I'm a university professor and you are my student. You're an absolute A+ student however I don't think you're living up to your potential. Your potential as a slut! You have the hottest body in the entire class but you are an incredible prude! So I fake some evidence and accuse you of plagiarism on a paper and threaten you with expulsion. I offer you a deal if you come to my house and we have some 'lessons in morality'; I'll let you redo the paper and give you a pass. However these lessons are obviously just a cover up. Alone in my private quarters I'll convince you of some 'stress relief' techniques. I'm looking to incorporate some hypnosis and possible drugs into this too. This can be a long term.

**The Intern**

I'm a high level manager at a finance company. I hire you as my 'personal assistant'. You're a super sheltered girl and this is your first job so you do just about everything and everything I ask you to. I notice this and start taking things a little further. I'm 'clumsy' and drop things a lot so I make you bend over and pick them up. Maybe sometimes I 'accidentally' bump into you and your shirt gets wet and I can see everything. When you come in I have you feel you up because it's a 'security check'. This one I prefer to be a long term roleplay. I want to gradually escalate how far I can push you until I can come up with a reason for fucking you that a naive/oblivious girl would think acceptable.

**The maid**

Very similar to the intern prompt however in the workplace we have to sneak around more. In my home, well I can get a lot more daring. This one would be faster and would include the cute outfits of course.

**The Gymnast**

I'd be your coach, and honestly speaking you're under performing. You know it, I know it, the team knows it. So I come up to you and offer some 'extra lessons'. Lessons that will really 'stretch you out'. This will move at a medium ish speed. There's going to be a lot of touching, a lot of 'here let me help you stretch'. Which is really just me putting you in sex positions and dry humping you. Then I'll say something like 'oh I found the problem! You're too wet!' You have no idea what that even means so I take this chance to 'educate' you. The sexual frustration you're feeling impacts your performance, and as your coach I need to keep you in tip top position. Personally.

**The Therapist**

You've started seeing a therapist for recurring nightmares you've been having. What the nightmares are can be decided by you. My conclusion will be that you have a sort of trauma from your childhood so I put you under a little hypnosis to make you mentally regress. While you're under that state you've forgotten all about decorum and start doing things that would be considered highly inappropriate. Maybe you start taking your clothes off just because, or you come and sit on my lap, or you start playing with your tits a lot because you don't remember having those great funbags.

John Oliver grills Dustin Hoffman about sexual harassment allegations = By Steven Zeitchik December 5

NEW YORK — HBO host John Oliver hammered Dustin Hoffman about allegations of sexual harassment and the actor fired back with a ferocious defense, as a seemingly benign screening became an explosive conversation about Hollywood sexual misconduct on Monday night.

“This is something we’re going to have to talk about because … it’s hanging in the air,” Oliver said to Hoffman at the discussion, an anniversary screening of the film “Wag the Dog.” He was alluding to an allegation made by Anna Graham Hunter last month that Hoffman groped her and made inappropriate comments when she was a 17-year-old intern on the set of the 1985 TV movie “Death of a Salesman.”

“It’s hanging in the air?” Hoffman said. “From a few things you’ve read, you’ve made an incredible assumption about me,” he noted, adding sarcastically, “You’ve made the case better than anyone else can. I’m guilty.”

The “Last Week Tonight” personality was moderating a 20th-anniversary screening panel at the 92nd Street Y on behalf of the Tribeca Institute, with stars Hoffman, Robert De Niro, producer Jane Rosenthal and director Barry Levinson on the stage. About halfway through the hour-long talk, Oliver brought up the issue to Hoffman, saying he found the actor’s statements about the matter wanting. Nearly the entire rest of the discussion was then dominated by Oliver, Hoffman and the subject of sexual harassment.

Hoffman had offered a conditional apology at the time of the allegation, and on Monday he underscored an “if” included in that statement, noting several times that he didn’t really believe he had done anything wrong. He said that he had not engaged in groping, that he didn’t recall meeting Graham Hunter and that all his comments on set were simply how members of “a family” talked to one another.

“I still don’t know who this woman is,” Hoffman said. “I never met her; if I met her, it was in concert with other people.”

Oliver dismissed that as insufficient, then cited Hoffman’s response at the time of the allegation that the actor’s behavior on set was “not reflective of” who he really is.

“It’s ‘not reflective of who I am’ — it’s that kind of response to this stuff that pisses me off,” Oliver said. “It is reflective of who you were. If you’ve given no evidence to show it didn’t [happen] then there was a period of time for a while when you were a creeper around women. It feels like a cop-out to say ‘It wasn’t me.’ Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?”

Hoffman accused Oliver of “putting me on display” and said he felt blindsided because neither Oliver nor Tribeca organizers had told him that the moderator would raise the subject.

Several times, however, Oliver sought to move on and talk about the film, but Hoffman returned to the subject of harassment, growing testy as he said Oliver was not keeping an “open mind” while unquestionably believing accusers.

“Do you believe this stuff you read?” Hoffman asked.

“Yes,” Oliver replied. “Because there’s no point in [an accuser] lying.”

“Well, there’s a point in her not bringing it up for 40 years,” Hoffman said.

“Oh, Dustin,” Oliver said disapprovingly, putting his head in his hand.

At one point, Rosenthal tried to jump in and defuse the situation.

“You also have the way men and women worked together [in the past]; you are in a situation where ‘that was then, this is now,’” Rosenthal said. “[And] what difference is all this going to make? … This conversation doesn’t do any good. We have a platform here. How are we moving [the issue] forward?”

Oliver, though, said he felt it was imperative to talk about it. “This isn’t fun for me,” the TV personality noted. “[But] there’s an elephant in the room because, this particular incident, a conversation has not been had.” He noted that the film they were gathering to discuss, “Wag The Dog,” dealt with sexual misconduct by a powerful man.

Rosenthal then said of the film, “It wasn’t produced by Weinstein or Miramax…Kevin Spacey wasn’t starring in it. Let’s look at real sexual criminal predators.”

“That’s a low bar,” Oliver retorted.

The back-and-forth mainly centered on the Graham Hunter allegations, and also at times invoked an accusation by Hoffman’s “The Graduate” co-star Katharine Ross that he had groped her on the set of the classic film. It did not manifestly address another claim, by the writer Wendy Riss Gatsiounis, that Hoffman had propositioned her inappropriately in a pitch meeting in 1991.

The showdown happened as sexual harassment issues continue to roil the entertainment world, with a growing number of men falling under suspicion and being held to account, often publicly. The exchange, however, marked a rarity in the post-Harvey Weinstein era, which has seen accused harassers generally offer short statements in response to allegations, if they respond at all. Very few have engaged in long public conversations about it, and almost none have sounded as defiant as Hoffman did Monday night.

The conversation grew increasingly angry as it wore on. When Hoffman began talking about his long career, Oliver interjected with “Oh, Jesus.”

“So now I can’t even finish a sentence?” Hoffman asked.

Hoffman also cited “Tootsie” as evidence of his feminist bona fides.

“I would not have made that movie if I didn’t have an incredible respect for women,” Hoffman said. “The theme of the movie is he became a better man by having been a woman.”

He said he had an awakening of sorts when, dressed as a woman for that film, he was ignored by some men on the set. “I said when I came home to my wife that I never realized men were that were brutal, that men are that obvious,” Hoffman recounted. “They didn’t find me attractive and they just erased me.”

He added, “What makes me sad is that I grew up in an environment in which we were taught to want the girls on the covers of magazines, the models, and I said to my wife ‘Look at how many interesting women I passed up … look at how many women were erased by me because of the generation I was born.’ That was a very strong reason for me wanting to make that movie.

“It’s shocking to me you don’t see me more clearly,” he then said to Oliver. “That you go by a couple of things you read.”

As the panel went on some in the crowd became involved.

“Move on. Let it go,” one woman could be heard shouting to Oliver. She was soon drowned out by other people, one of whom said “Shame on you.” Another yelled to Oliver, “Thank you for believing women,” to loud cheers.

Oliver said that he considered not addressing the subject at what was intended as a genial chat but then decided he bore an obligation.

“I can’t leave certain things unaddressed,” the host said. “The easy way is not to bring anything up. Unfortunately that leaves me at home later at night hating myself. ‘Why the … didn’t I say something? No one stands up to powerful men.’”

“Am I the powerful man?” Hoffman asked.

The actor asked why the questioner wouldn’t hear his side. “Keep a kind of open mind if you can, John.”

“I’m trying,” Oliver said.

“Well I’m trying harder than you are,” Hoffman shot back.

Tensions did not cool throughout the session.

“You weren’t there,” Hoffman said to Oliver about the “Salesman” set.

“I’m glad [I wasn’t],” the host replied.

7i0sti,10,2017-12-06,Does John Conyers Know Who Murdered Chandra Levy?,wildfireonvenus,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7i0sti/does_john_conyers_know_who_murdered_chandra_levy/,"...Multiple women have come forward with similar accounts of Conyers using his House position to run a harem of sorts for decades. With his resignation, the 88-year-old congressman cuts short inquiries into his rumored misdeeds in office. Some stories now appearing are alarming, none more than that proffered by Courtney Moore, now 36, who claimed that she was a 20-year-old college student when Conyers propositioned her for sex.

When Moore rejected his advances, she states, Conyers brought up the then-current case of Chandra Levy, a Washington, D.C., intern who disappeared mysteriously in the summer of 2001. “He said he had insider information on the case. I don’t know if he meant it to be threatening,” she told the Washington Post, “but I took it that way. I got out of the car and ran.”

The sensational Levy case was the talk of the town in our nation’s capital back in mid-2001, dominating local headlines in that long, last summer before jihadists took down the Twin Towers and America commenced its seemingly endless War on Terrorism. Chandra Levy, a pretty young intern, became a sensation after her disappearance. She belongs to a now-vanished age in Washington, swept away by 9/11, and her case remains as mysterious as on the day she disappeared: May 1, 2001.

What he’s saying doesn’t make sense. The words all do, sure, but it’s the meaning of it. You now belong to someone else?

Minutes ago, he rushed in the door and began to tell you that someone was going to publish his novel. His eyes were bright with the news that someone was going to help him achieve his life goal! This mysterious benefactor is even willing to pay your father a living wage while he edits and polishes it, which means he doesn’t have to rely on the slowly thinning customer base of his store. As the years have gone on, you’ve seen less and less of your father as he let go of employees one by one that he couldn’t afford to keep on. The stress and exhaustion has him looking 10 years older than he is.

This amazing news had a catch though, a big one. The rich man had seen you, and was immediately taken. When he approached your father, he already knew a lot, and had the terms of the deal already lined up. You tell your father he can’t possibly take the deal, and that’s when his eyes fall to the floor.

“It’s already done,” he tells you, the excitement slipping from his voice, “I signed the papers.”

You protest, standing up and stomping your feet. This is illegal!

“The contract was very thorough,” he says as sweat forms on his brow, “you’re going to be an intern of sorts. This will give you the best education, and opportunities I never could.”

Tears form in his eyes as you beg him to take it back. You clutch at his sweater, and he takes your hands in his. You can feel now how much he’s shaking.

“If I do, he’ll take away my funding. And- and he owns the shop. If I back out, he could take it away,” he says. “Please, do it for me.”

A knock at the door makes both of you turn towards it. Your father stands up a little straighter and informs you that the driver is here for you, ready to take you to your new life. He wraps his arms around you, hugging you tight to him.

“I’ll come visit if he lets me. I love you,” he says, kissing you on the forehead. He steps back, and nods towards the door.

I am looking for someone for a long term roleplay. I am as into the plot and world building as I am the smut. We can discuss some details before hand, or you can jump right in to things. While there’s definite dubcon elements, I think there’s still a lot of room for fun and some lighthearted parts. Perhaps you take to the lifestyle instantly, or maybe you need a firmer guiding hand.

As for ages, we can discuss that or just both decide in the moment. I wouldn’t want you to be younger than 13, or me older than 50.

My kinks are oral, anal, teasing/edgeplay, partially/clothed sex, dom/sub, rough sex, age gaps, public/risk of getting caught, name calling, light pain, group (preferably FFM), and a lot more. If it’s not listed, I am likely still open to it.

My limits are gore, scat, beastiality, futa, and rape."
7i1h2k,1,2017-12-06,Should I [24F] interfere with my sister's [19F] relationship?,AccomplishableInk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7i1h2k/should_i_24f_interfere_with_my_sisters_19f/,"My sister Mia (of 19 years) is in community college because she wasn’t admitted to our prestigious local university and wants to transfer in. Her boyfriend Frank [19M] is there because he needs to work his way through school.

Due to our family’s income and knowledge of resources, Mia has been able to publish as a volunteer research assistant, hire private tutors, and land an internship with a prestigious company. Frank works retail, has a low GPA, and will need a third year (at least) of CC. Mia is starting to worry that Frank will hold her back in life and has told him so, driving him to tears. In addition, Frank’s seasonal job is ending and a relative of his is dying. Frank wants to see a therapist for possible depression, but is concerned about the bill. Mia is sympathetic but, perhaps correctly, is concerned he won't transfer and is still close to breaking up with him.

I feel like I’m watching a case study in the cycles of poverty and privilege, which bothers me quite a bit. Mia is a hard worker and is smart with her resources, but she doesn’t even need money and will soon make almost thrice what Frank does. Meanwhile, Frank's life is falling apart despite having done nothing wrong.

The thing is, I could probably help Frank quite a bit; I can help him figure out transfer and internships the same way I helped Mia, and I have friends in social services who could recommend resources for him. I’ve told Mia this, but she doesn't want to reveal that she broke his confidence by telling me about his issues. She also hopes that Frank will take the initiative to find resources himself and thereby prove to her that he's working toward transfer.

And that’s why I’m here. I doubt Frank even knows where to start looking for resources. Should I message him myself to offer help, potentially damaging his relationship and my relationship with Mia? I’m not close to Frank at all, I've never said more than ""hi"" to him. If it’s relevant, our parents are *very* against Mia dating so Mia keeps Frank a secret from them.

  **tl;dr**: I could connect my sister's possibly depressed, low-income boyfriend with valuable resources. My sister doesn't want to convey this to him. Should I reach out to him myself?"
7i2ad7,37,2017-12-06,My family is breaking my heart,TokenMachineNo7,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/7i2ad7/my_family_is_breaking_my_heart/,"Hi, all, I've been a lurker on this subreddit for about 6 months now--ever since I realized that I was bi---and I could really use some advice or some people with whom to talk about everything that's been happening in my life recently.
So, some basics about me: I'm 19, a cis male, and am in my second year at university (I'm commuting from home so as to save money). I was diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder and social anxiety disorder, which have made it difficult to have many friends--actually, I only have one truly close friend in my life. I've yet to come out to literally anyone, as I come from a very small, rural town and a fairly conservative, religious family. 

Now, I really care about my family, and I always have felt fairly close to them. However, upon heading to university (I actually lived there last year), I realized that pretty much everything that they had taught me was extremely biased in their religious values, and that perhaps ""the homosexuals"", as they would say, were not awful or ""going to hell"". Eventually, during counseling that I sought out for my disorders, I realized that I was bi. Basically, I had felt like something was missing during all of the introspection that I had been doing, and when I heard ""bisexual"", everything just sort of clicked. Given my family's background, however, I still haven't felt comfortable with the idea of coming out to them, or at the very least not while I'm under their roof. My best friend and I might be getting an apartment next summer, but if not, I'm not sure that I could stand living like this any more.

To elaborate, I guess, I constantly am faced with my parents' constant phobia toward LGBTQ+ individuals. My mother won't let my 7-year-old sister watch Disney channel anymore, because one of the shows has a gay main character and ""I won't stand to let her watch that sort of thing"". When I last went to see a movie with my father, a trailer played in which two women kissed briefly, and he said, out loud in a crowded theater, ""I just don't know why they have to show that stuff in public"". My younger brothers, both of whom are in high school, fully subscribe to their mentality and really look down on LGBTQ+ individuals, and I'm increasingly concerned for my sister, who will undoubtedly grow up in this environment and will be pushed to adopt this sort of mentality.

So, I definitely rambled there for a bit, but does anyone have any suggestions on how to maybe handle the situation with my sister, or perhaps, what I should do if the apartment plans with my friend fall through (which they might, he could be getting an internship in another state next summer instead)? Thanks in advance."

It's already in my cart!,yaylindizzle,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/7i3kf8/should_i_just_go_for_it_its_already_in_my_cart/,"Remember a couple weeks back, the iPhone X came out, and it was a super big deal for a day or so? It was so cool and shiny and best of all, NEW! 

I must admit, with a little bit of shame, I've been such a big Apple fan-girl since 2015, when my internship made all the developers use Macs. This was a major upgrade from using PC's all my life! Now I have matching rose gold (it's a real color too!) Macbook, Apple Watch, and iPhone (just the 6s+! so old!). 

The problem is, if I buy the iPhone X, I can't even use it as my PHONE. My current cell phone and cell phone plan is through my company. They upgrade phones every 2 years, and I just got mine last year. I don't think my company allows us to BYOP (bring your own phone). So if I buy it, I would have to carry around 2 phones. (But one of those would be an iPhone X! Animoji's all day every day!)

So really, I just want it for fun. I love new gadgets! MKBHD's review of it made it look SO good! I'm also feeling a bit sad these days, and I can just imagine how much joy, albeit temporary, a new phone would bring to my life right now. 

It's in my cart. I'm 1 step away from checking out. My palms are sweaty and my heart is beating so fast! "

7i3sh1,1,2017-12-06,[M4F] The super naive girl,ThisIsDark,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7i3sh1/m4f_the_super_naive_girl/,"So I'm really into the idea of corrupting a super naive/oblivious girl right now. Naturally most of them will be dub-con but we can play it in a consensual light too. I have a few ideas for this:

**The Sister**

So you'd be my sister and you take up a sport, football, gymnastic, ballet, etc. One day you come home and you're just incredibly sore. Usually our mother would give you a massage, run a bath for you, etc. However she's visiting family right now, it's only you and I in the house. So of course you ask me, your big bro, to give you a massage. Things start off normal, get those sore muscles worked. However when a man massages you it's different. Maybe it's my smell, my hormones or just the feeling of stronger rougher hands, you start to feel something. Then it comes 'Hey big bro I'm getting this tingly feeling between my legs and it feels really weird.' You drop the bomb on me. Truth is I always wanted to fuck you but never got a good chance. Now that you were offering yourself up to me I wouldn't say no. Time for big bro to educate his sis.

**The Student**

I'm a university professor and you are my student. You're an absolute A+ student however I don't think you're living up to your potential. Your potential as a slut! You have the hottest body in the entire class but you are an incredible prude! So I fake some evidence and accuse you of plagiarism on a paper and threaten you with expulsion. I offer you a deal if you come to my house and we have some 'lessons in morality'; I'll let you redo the paper and give you a pass. However these lessons are obviously just a cover up. Alone in my private quarters I'll convince you of some 'stress relief' techniques. I'm looking to incorporate some hypnosis and possible drugs into this too. This can be a long term.

**The Intern**

I'm a high level manager at a finance company. I hire you as my 'personal assistant'. You're a super sheltered girl and this is your first job so you do just about everything and everything I ask you to. I notice this and start taking things a little further. I'm 'clumsy' and drop things a lot so I make you bend over and pick them up. Maybe sometimes I 'accidentally' bump into you and your shirt gets wet and I can see everything. When you come in I have you feel you up because it's a 'security check'. This one I prefer to be a long term roleplay. I want to gradually escalate how far I can push you until I can come up with a reason for fucking you that a naive/oblivious girl would think acceptable.

**The maid**

Very similar to the intern prompt however in the workplace we have to sneak around more. In my home, well I can get a lot more daring. This one would be faster and would include the cute outfits of course.

**The Gymnast**

I'd be your coach, and honestly speaking you're under performing. You know it, I know it, the team knows it. So I come up to you and offer some 'extra lessons'. Lessons that will really 'stretch you out'. This will move at a medium ish speed. There's going to be a lot of touching, a lot of 'here let me help you stretch'. Which is really just me putting you in sex positions and dry humping you. Then I'll say something like 'oh I found the problem! You're too wet!' You have no idea what that even means so I take this chance to 'educate' you. The sexual frustration you're feeling impacts your performance, and as your coach I need to keep you in tip top position. Personally.

**The Therapist**

You've started seeing a therapist for recurring nightmares you've been having. What the nightmares are can be decided by you. My conclusion will be that you have a sort of trauma from your childhood so I put you under a little hypnosis to make you mentally regress. While you're under that state you've forgotten all about decorum and start doing things that would be considered highly inappropriate. Maybe you start taking your clothes off just because, or you come and sit on my lap, or you start playing with your tits a lot because you don't remember having those great funbags. Of course I can't resist, I mean you won't remember anything when you wake up right?

Hope to hear from you!"

# Title

&gt; [REQ] ($1000) - (#Hillsboro, OR, USA), (1-2 Months), (Payment Plan) - Need $1000 by Sunday, Me and my GF Can't get a loan anywhere, will pay it back in weekly/monthly payments.

# Post contents

---

Me and my SO's living situation is very bad a toxic at the moment with the people we live with, Every week its almost a situation where the cops need to be called. We finally found a place that would be perfect but need $800 to move in by Sunday, I also got a car recently and do not have the money to register it, ($200). My girlfriend just started a new job yesterday which is amazing, but no proof of income for a loan, as well as her terrible credit.  I have average credit myself but my Internship ended last month and I'm currently on unemployment, which is not seen as a source of income. 

We have been denied by every loan agency we went to so far and things are not looking good, I have no family here, same with her, my friends don't have extra money to lend out. 

I get paid weekly from unemployment and will have a job shortly, she will be getting paychecks here in a few weeks, so making payments would be no problem, I'm not sure where else to ask, I would be willing to sign a contract and pay interest.  

If anyone has any other serious ideas please let me know, I feel like I've exhausted my options thus far.

7i44y4,1,2017-12-07,Do you think I came on too strong and/or looked insecure and ruined it?,DaftLink_I17,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7i44y4/do_you_think_i_came_on_too_strong_andor_looked/,"I'm 23, male, in university. I used a dating app and matched with a 22 year old graduate student a bit over a week ago. We got coffee last Thursday and it was pretty fun. She texted me a few hours later that she had a good time.

On Sunday, I picked her up at her house and we walked around a park together and then I showed her the Governor's mansion and I also offered to take her to Home Depot since she texted earlier about needing a bigger base for her Christmas tree. After that, we went to her house and she introduced me to her two dogs and I helped her put the tree into the base. She told me she had fun that day. We hugged and I asked to kiss her but she said she has a rule about not doing that until after the third date to see who's really getting to know her.

I didn't get a text from her after the date and I texted her late Sunday night about enjoying it and having fun meeting her dogs and to let me know if I could help with any more tree stuff this week. No reply that night or next morning. That next day, in afternoon, I texted about deleting my account on the dating app and the app itself. Eventually it was almost 10pm and I hadn't heard back and so I texted something like ""If you're not feeling it, it's okay. I hope you had a good day :)"". She texted that she was just then getting off work when she was supposed to get off at 8pm. She also mentioned preparing a presentation and class in the morning. 

Tuesday evening, I texted her and asked how the presentation went. No reply last night or this morning. By this point today, I was feeling more aware of how my texts had probably been coming off and because she had been responsive in the same day before these past few days, I was just feeling very insecure.

I texted her earlier today that I'd let her go since exams and winter break were coming up and we wouldn't be in the same area for winter break(3 weeks long) so continuing things wouldn't be the easiest. I did feel like that was a real thing to consider, though ending it was also a result of me feeling like I was losing, so to speak. She texted that she understands and told me to enjoy my break.

Keep in mind, she's a graduate student with both a job and an internship so she's busy though she had pretty much always been responsive in the same day up until Sunday night so things felt off these past few days.

Should I have not texted the same day as our date and then not double and triple texted?

I definitely thought she was attractive and I enjoyed spending time with her, though I wouldn't necessarily say there was a huge spark either. I'm a bit bummed but also not too devastated. Mixed feelings.

Thoughts?"

While researching working in the IT industry, I ran into a couple of websites promising IT internships with no experience necessary. So far only one website asked for money, the other two said that the companies pay for the service like a hiring agency. 

The main one I'm looking at says that they will test me, and put me into one of 3 pools depending on level of competency. Then they will send me out to interviews that other companies will request me for, and if hired, they will do all the training themselves. It's promising 15/hr min, for a full time 12 month program, where the hiring company trains me with the end result being a fulltime job at an increased pay rate at said company. It even says that some of the bigger companies will outright pay for me to get an education and degree to work for them.

This just seems too good a deal to be true to me. I'm very skeptical, so I came here to ask, do these kind of opportunities really exist in this industry?"
7i4su0,21,2017-12-07,Have we lost future Einsteins due to inequality?,paypalthrowaway1,AskTrumpSupporters,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/7i4su0/have_we_lost_future_einsteins_due_to_inequality/,"From [Promarket](https://promarket.org/americas-lost-einsteins-dealing-blow-innovation/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork)

&gt;Innovation is widely viewed as the engine of economic growth. As a result, many policies have been proposed to spur innovation, ranging from tax cuts to investments in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of such policies is unclear because we know relatively little about the factors that induce people to become inventors. Who are America’s most successful inventors and what can we learn from their experiences in designing policies to stimulate innovation?

&gt;We study the lives of more than one million inventors in the United States using a new de-identified database linking patent records to tax and school district records. Tracking these individuals from birth onward, we identify the key factors that determine who becomes an inventor, as measured by filing a patent.1) Our results shed light on what policies can be most effective in increasing innovation, showing in particular that increasing exposure to innovation among women, minorities, and children from low-income families may have greater potential to spark innovation and growth than traditional approaches such as reducing tax rates.

&gt;Our analysis yields three main lessons.
 
&gt;**Lesson 1: There are large disparities in innovation rates by socioeconomic class, race, and gender**

&gt;Children with parents in the top 1 percent of the income distribution are ten times more likely to become inventors than children with below median income parents (Figure 1). There are analogous gaps by race and gender: white children are three times more likely to become inventors than black children and only 18 percent of inventors are female. The gender gap in innovation is shrinking gradually over time, but at the current rate, it will take another 118 years to reach gender parity.

&gt;Differences in ability, as measured by test scores in early childhood, explain very little of these disparities. Children at the top of their 3rd grade math class are much more likely to become inventors, but only if they come from high-income families (Figure 2). High-scoring children from low-income or minority families are unlikely to become inventors. Put differently, becoming an inventor relies upon two things in America: excelling in math and science and having a rich family.

&gt;The gap in innovation explained by test scores grows in later grades; by 8th grade, half of the gap in innovation by income can be explained by differences in test scores. This is because low-income children steadily fall behind their high income peers over time, perhaps because of differences in their schools and childhood environments. We next turn to analyze what specific environmental factors contribute to these disparities.

 
&gt;**Lesson 2: Exposure to innovation substantially increases the chances that children become inventors**

 

&gt;Children who grow up in areas with more inventors—and are thereby more exposed to innovation while growing up—are much more likely to become inventors themselves. Exposure influences not just whether a child grows up to become an inventor but also the type of inventions he or she produces. For example, among people living in Boston, those who grew up in Silicon Valley are especially likely to patent in computers, while those who grew up in Minneapolis– which has many medical device manufacturers—are especially likely to patent in medical devices. Similarly, children whose parents hold patents in a certain technology class (e.g., amplifiers) are more likely to patent in exactly that field themselves rather than in other closely related fields (e.g., antennas)

&gt;Exposure matters in a gender-specific manner. Women are more likely to invent in a given technology class if they grew up in an area with many female inventors in that technology class. Growing up around male inventors has no impact on women’s propensity to innovate. Conversely, men’s innovation rates are influenced by male rather than female inventors in their area. Our findings are consistent with recent evidence that exposure to better neighborhoods in childhood improves children’s life outcomes. Neighborhood effects have typically been attributed to factors such as school quality or residential segregation. Since it is implausible that some neighborhoods or schools prepare children to innovate in a single field, such as amplifiers, the exposure effects here are more likely to be driven by mechanisms such as mentoring, transmission of information, and networks.

 

&gt;Children from low-income families, minorities, and women are less likely to have such exposure through their families and neighborhoods, helping explain why they have significantly lower rates of innovation. For example, our estimates imply that if girls were as exposed to female inventors as boys are to male inventors, the gender gap in innovation would fall by half.

 

&gt;Stepping forward in children’s lives, we find that innovation rates vary widely across colleges, but students from low- and high-income families at the most innovative colleges (e.g., MIT) patent at relatively similar rates. This finding reinforces the view that factors that affect children before they enter the labor market, such as childhood environment and exposure to innovation, drive much of the gaps in innovation we uncovered.2)

 
&gt;**Lesson 3: Star inventors earn more than $1 million per year, suggesting that further increasing financial incentives or reducing tax rates may have small effects on innovation**

 

&gt;The average patent holder earns approximately $256,000 per year in his or her mid-forties. But the individuals who make discoveries that have the greatest scientific impact—i.e., those who produce the most highly-cited patents—earn more than $1 million on average per year (Figure 4). Scientific progress is largely driven by a few star inventors who are highly compensated for their work by the market.

&gt;Women, minorities, and individuals from low income families are as underrepresented among star inventors as they are among inventors as a whole. Given our finding that innovation ability does not vary substantially across these groups, this result implies there are many “lost Einsteins”—people who would have had high-impact inventions had they become inventors—among the under-represented groups.

 

&gt;These findings suggest that changes in financial incentives (e.g., by reducing tax rates) have limited scope to increase innovation, for two reasons. First, changes in incentives affect only the small subset of individuals who have exposure to innovation. Second, such policies are unlikely to influence the decisions of star inventors who matter most for economic growth. Star inventors—who typically earn more than $1 million per year—would presumably be happy to work in their field even if they earned say $950,000 instead of $1 million per year.3) We caution, however, that these predictions remain to be tested empirically and that taxes could potentially affect economic growth through other channels, for instance by changing the behavior of firms or other workers.

 
&gt;Policy Implications

 

&gt;If women, minorities, and children from low-income families were to invent at the same rate as white men from high-income (top 20 percent) families, the rate of innovation in America would quadruple. Our findings therefore call for greater focus on policies that harness the under-utilized talent in these groups by providing them greater exposure to innovation. Such policies could range from mentoring programs to internships to interventions through social networks. Our analysis does not tell us which programs are most effective, but it does provide some guidance on how they should be targeted. Targeting exposure programs to children from under-represented groups who excel in math and science at early ages is likely to maximize their impacts. Furthermore, tailoring programs to participants’ backgrounds may be valuable: for example, women are more influenced by female rather than male inventors.

 

&gt;More broadly, our results suggest that improving opportunities for disadvantaged children may be valuable not just to reduce disparities but also to spur greater innovation and growth."

7i6l76,5,2017-12-07,Unemployed graduate – feeling tired and ashamed of my life,pamplemoussex,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7i6l76/unemployed_graduate_feeling_tired_and_ashamed_of/,"Sorry for the wall of text. I'm just in a bad place at the moment and need to vent. 

Depression has derailed my 'life plans' and motivation for the last five years or so (though I think it was brewing up for a long time before that). I dropped out of university, after sticking it out for a year, in 2014, because my depression was so bad that I couldn't get out of bed and spent most of my days crying, eating and sleeping.

I moved home, got a part-time job in retail and eventually decided that I would finish my degree through the Open University so that initial year at uni wasn't totally wasted. I finally completed my degree this summer.

Before and after graduating, I have been searching for work. No luck. I must have applied for hundreds of jobs, and I have been to two interviews, but I haven't got anywhere. Most of the time my job applications seems go out into the aether and I hear nothing back. As every day goes by, my mood gets worse. I'm now at the point again where I don't want to get out of bed, and I cry a lot. 

I have a first-class degree and lots of work experience on my CV. Throughout my part-time degree studies I've worked in retail, done unpaid internships in the field I want to go into (copywriting, content writing, editorial roles, PR – that kind of thing) and built up my own portfolio of freelance work, including some for impressive clients. I just feel like I'm exhausted now, as I've tried so hard to keep my depression at bay by keeping myself busy, but now that my degree's done with, everything has stagnated. I feel crap all the time, have no motivation and have started drinking a lot every evening. I know that I can get a job in retail again if I want to – which I'm considering doing just to get me out of the house more – but the last time I did it, it was completely soul-destroying and made my depression worse. Being treated like crap by customers doesn't really help your psyche. 

I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and will never be able to move out of my parents' house and feel like a 'proper' adult. I have been picking up freelance work to keep me going financially, but I don't earn enough to be able to move out, because unfortunately rental prices (even flat share prices) in my area are so high. I'd say a good 90% of my work is done from home, too, so I feel extremely isolated just being stuck working from my bedroom/living room all day, and then hanging out there all evening. 

I've been shutting myself off from a lot of people because I feel ashamed of my life. I'm tired of being introduced to friends of friends and having to explain that I don't 'do' anything and that I still live with my parents. It's embarrassing. I feel so small. 
 
Anyway, Christmas is coming up, and I'm really dreading it. I'm going to be seeing lots of family and friends who I haven't seen for a while. I'm really struggling to not compare myself to my friends, all of whom finished uni and went straight into full-time employment. Am I ridiculous for wanting to shut myself off from them all, just because I don't want to have to explain my current life situation? I feel like we're at completely different levels right now, as they're all thriving and I'm... flailing, still living with my parents without a proper job. "

In order to keep away from crippling nervousness from these annoying evaluations, it is important to approach them with a clear brain and an understanding of how to deal with stressful situations more broadly


 
Preparing for the Test

1) Take notes: Take your class time seriously by taking notes summarizing what your teacher has said. If you are feeling exam pressure, you can review your notes; this will help you remember things that happened in class that you didn't even take notes on, further giving you a sense of mastery over your material.

When taking notes, focus on jotting down keywords and key ideas, rather than trying to take dictation. Copying out the exact sentence is not as important as getting down the main ideas. Review your notes weekly.

2) Manage your time wisely. Do not pay attention for an exam last minute; this will surely guide to exam stress. Break up your study time into hunks over days, or weeks even. When you ""hunk"" your study time over the course of a longer period of time, such as a few days or weeks, you will retain more of the information.

3) Know where you study best. Consider about the kinds of factors that permit you to be most comfortable and relaxed as you prepare for your exam. When setting up a dedicated study space:

Examine your work space. Choose whether you work better with a bit of confusion or if a clean, fresh work space is what you prefer.

Find an interchange place to study such as a library. A change of surroundings can give you a fresh look at the material and also provide additional resources.

4) Take frequent breaks. According to psychologist, the normal human brain can only focus on one task successfully for about 45 minutes. In adding, research in psychologist suggests that focusing on the same thing for too long diminishes the brain's capability to exactly development it.

5) Stay hydrated. Be sure to drink plenty of water. Aim for at least 8 eight glasses of water per day. Not drinking enough water can make you feel lethargic and worried.

A cup of herbal tea can help you feel more relaxed and stay hydrated. Peppermint, chamomile, and passionflower are good choices.

6) Reward your achievements, no matter how small. If you are feeling stressed about an exam, be sure to reward yourself for your study time. This will motivate you to continue studying and may even reduce stress. For example, after studying hard for an hour, take a break and play on the internet for 20 minutes or watch an episode of a TV show that you enjoy.

7) Exercise. Regular aerobic exercise can relieve stress, so if you find yourself a nervous before an exam, go for a run or the gym.

When you work out, listen to upbeat music that keeps you motivated throughout your workout.

Meditate or do yoga after your upbeat exercise. This lets the mind focus and calm down

8) Eat healthy foods. You eat only hygienic foods it can make you feel positive, which can interfere with your exam preparation. Therefore, it is important to eat right if you want to have the best odds of doing well on your exam and not stressing about it.

Try eating lean meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables.

9) Get sufficient sleep. An excellent night's sleep may not be high on the schedule for students across the country but, according to research, it could be key to victorious learning.

Psychologist found that learners were able to remember and consolidate material more effectively having slept on the new information.

10) Ask yourself whether you have a learning disability. It may be the case that you have something like ADHD or other learning disability that impairs your ability to perform well on an exam. Be sure to reach out to a college psychotherapist or lecturer for how to proceed in getting help.

7i75zj,6,2017-12-07,[20/F] Miscommunication has caused rift between me and boyfriend [21/M],birb-brain,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7i75zj/20f_miscommunication_has_caused_rift_between_me/,"Reposting because apparently I posted this when no one was awake and it got buried by everything after.

Hey everyone, so a little background before all this started: My boyfriend and I both go to the same college and we're in the same year. He's an engineering major while i'm a biology major. We started dating almost a year and a half ago, and everything had been going great. He is one of the most supportive people I know, and he always helps me get back up when I have breakdowns or if I'm just really stressed from everything. We were always able to set time for dates on a lot of weekends when we weren't busy with schoolwork, and we always found time throughout the week to just chill and hang out with each other and doing normal things, like watching movies, playing video games, or just helping each other study.

When this semester started, at first things were normal, but my schedule slowly got busier and busier since I am taking higher level classes as well as trying to fill in hours for a research internship. My boyfriend is also in marching band, so 3 nights a week he will be at practice and will be busy all weekend with football games and catching up on work he couldn't do on football days. This meant that we couldn't spend as much time with each other and less almost no weekend dates. Before this semester started, we used to text each other daily about how our days went and would have random fun conversations throughout the day just to keep in contact with each other during break since we both live on opposite ends of the state. 

However, when we started spending less time with each other, we also stopped texting as much. I actually don't know how or why it happened, but we just gradually stopped talking with each other, and it eventually just turned into us sending each other random reddit pages or memes and then making really short conversations about whatever we just sent and that'd be it. 

He told me he was feeling lonely without me there, so I told him to go join some clubs and make some friends outside of his classes, so he went to anime club with some mutual friends. He really like anime club and I was happy for him, but he really quickly became friends with this girl who was there and also lived in his dorm building. At first I was happy he made friends with someone new, so I encouraged him to keep going, but soon he started hanging out with this girl more and more, and eventually he barely spent time with me while spending a lot of the night with her. I was really hurt when he told me about everything they did together because I felt like he had replaced me with someone else when he couldn't do those same times with me that we used to. I confronted him about it, and he did admit that he felt like he was replacing me just because I wasn't there.
Now you're wondering, you both are in college, why can't you spend nights together? Well the problem is, I don't live on campus. I'm a commuter student who lives at home with helicopter parents, so I have a time I need to be home by or else I will be in a lot of trouble and that's honestly too much for me to deal with because my parents kinda crazy, but that's another story for another time. 

So, back to the problem: he's spending a lot of time with another girl he quickly became friends with after I go home for the day, and I got jealous. Every time he would talk about her, I would sulk and tell him that I wanted to spend more time with him. He would say back, ""how can you spend more time when you need to home to not get in trouble?"" Well that got me really angry, and I basically told him i was the only one who was putting effort into this relationship and that I was trying to ask him for help and advice on how we can arrange our schedules while he was out fooling around with some other girl and completely ignoring me. He calmed me down, saying that he wanted to help, but our schedules are already fixed since it was in the middle of the semester after this happened, and he was really sorry that he didn't tell me earlier that we have been having issues because we haven't been talking or spending as much time with each other. He noticed it but he never brought it up to me because he thought it would resolve itself on its own.Eventually we talked out about some of the problems we've been having with each other, and we both agreed to take a break for a few weeks, just to re-compose ourselves and our lives back on track. 

Well, I might have messed up a couple days ago and ruined the progress we've been making. He told me he wanted to take this girl to go see the christmas lights at the botanical gardens near our school and I got extremely upset. I cried a bunch and said it wasn't fair how he was going out and doing all this stuff with a girl he hasn't even known for 3 months and not making any effort to go out on dates with me anymore and that every time I'm with him all he does is text his friends and only half listens to me when I talk. i told him that if he wanted things to work between us, then he needed to put more effort in rather than just using someone else as my ""surrogate"". I straight up asked him if he had any feelings for this girl, and he said only a tiny bit because she reminded him so much of me and what our relationship used to be. He understood why I got jealous and he was angry, and he was extremely apologetic on being negligent towards me and that he wasn't putting the effort in. 
At that point, I suggested that we should extend this break between us and he agreed. We both promised each other to start talking more again even if we can't spent a lot of time with each other. We both said we were going to start asking each other how our days went again and tell each other any problems we have with anything. Right now, we're back to just being friends, and we're trying to completely start over. We have an extremely close friendship, since he's the person I always went to when I was stressed and needed comfort or when I just needed someone to talk to about things, and I was also always there for him to lean on. So I'm just wondering, is this course of action the right one? Can things between us be fixed if we talk through it and continue improving our communication between each other?

7i7mer,3,2017-12-07,[M4F] The naive girl,ThisIsDark,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7i7mer/m4f_the_naive_girl/,"So I'm really into the idea of corrupting a super naive/oblivious girl right now. Naturally most of them will be dub-con but we can play it in a consensual light too. I have a few ideas for this:

**The Sister**

So you'd be my sister and you take up a sport, football, gymnastic, ballet, etc. One day you come home and you're just incredibly sore. Usually our mother would give you a massage, run a bath for you, etc. However she's visiting family right now, it's only you and I in the house. So of course you ask me, your big bro, to give you a massage. Things start off normal, get those sore muscles worked. However when a man massages you it's different. Maybe it's my smell, my hormones or just the feeling of stronger rougher hands, you start to feel something. Then it comes 'Hey big bro I'm getting this tingly feeling between my legs and it feels really weird.' You drop the bomb on me. Truth is I always wanted to fuck you but never got a good chance. Now that you were offering yourself up to me I wouldn't say no. Time for big bro to educate his sis.

**The Student**

I'm a university professor and you are my student. You're an absolute A+ student however I don't think you're living up to your potential. Your potential as a slut! You have the hottest body in the entire class but you are an incredible prude! So I fake some evidence and accuse you of plagiarism on a paper and threaten you with expulsion. I offer you a deal if you come to my house and we have some 'lessons in morality'; I'll let you redo the paper and give you a pass. However these lessons are obviously just a cover up. Alone in my private quarters I'll convince you of some 'stress relief' techniques. I'm looking to incorporate some hypnosis and possible drugs into this too. This can be a long term.

**The Intern**

I'm a high level manager at a finance company. I hire you as my 'personal assistant'. You're a super sheltered girl and this is your first job so you do just about everything and everything I ask you to. I notice this and start taking things a little further. I'm 'clumsy' and drop things a lot so I make you bend over and pick them up. Maybe sometimes I 'accidentally' bump into you and your shirt gets wet and I can see everything. When you come in I have you feel you up because it's a 'security check'. This one I prefer to be a long term roleplay. I want to gradually escalate how far I can push you until I can come up with a reason for fucking you that a naive/oblivious girl would think acceptable.

**The maid**

Very similar to the intern prompt however in the workplace we have to sneak around more. In my home, well I can get a lot more daring. This one would be faster and would include the cute outfits of course.

**The Gymnast**

I'd be your coach, and honestly speaking you're under performing. You know it, I know it, the team knows it. So I come up to you and offer some 'extra lessons'. Lessons that will really 'stretch you out'. This will move at a medium ish speed. There's going to be a lot of touching, a lot of 'here let me help you stretch'. Which is really just me putting you in sex positions and dry humping you. Then I'll say something like 'oh I found the problem! You're too wet!' You have no idea what that even means so I take this chance to 'educate' you. The sexual frustration you're feeling impacts your performance, and as your coach I need to keep you in tip top position. Personally.

**The Therapist**

You've started seeing a therapist for recurring nightmares you've been having. What the nightmares are can be decided by you. My conclusion will be that you have a sort of trauma from your childhood so I put you under a little hypnosis to make you mentally regress. While you're under that state you've forgotten all about decorum and start doing things that would be considered highly inappropriate. Maybe you start taking your clothes off just because, or you come and sit on my lap, or you start playing with your tits a lot because you don't remember having those great funbags.

I'm new here. Joined my uni club team and love it/hate it/love it. I'm wondering about strategies on losing weight. Im 5'10"" and have been a consistent non-muscular 165 since I was like 12. (I'm 25 now)  After doing an internship on a farm over the summer I weighed 175 (without much fat gain, woot) and after rowing I'm now 185. I'm not over weight, I'm actually pretty healthy, but id like  to trim the jiggles and muffintop. (to weigh less in the boat, and for da ladies) With All this exercise, I had hoped to trim some body fat, but instead It seems I've just been building muscle. I'm eating pretty healthy, salads and lean protein, carbs before practice and much less throughout the day. Skipping dessert much more frequently. What kind of things should I change up? Extra cardio? Or am I just impatient? I want to try to get back down to 170 or so, while retaining the muscle mass. I want to do this healthily. Any pointers would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
Hi everyone!


**JayCrypto**
What is blockport



**dr10**
Welcome!


**lars **
Welcome !

**Pascal (Marketing at Blockport)**
Hey everyone!


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@JayCrypto Blockport is a hybrid-decentralized exchange with a strong focus on user-friendliness, social trading features and building a knowledge sharing community.


**tranzer**
How is blockport different than other exchanges? Are you gonna offer fiat pairs?

**Crasha**
What do you need a token for?

**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
Hey Crasha, good question, we use the Blockport token to create a micro-economy inside the Blockport exchange to incentivise experienced traders for sharing their knowledge and trading activities. In order to ""govern"" this micro-economy we therefore create our own token :slightly_smiling_face:


**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)** 
Hey all


**munich (Ark.Land Delegate)**
Welcome!

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)** 
@tranzer Blockport focuses on user-friendliness and simplicity. This means that anyone, beginner or advanced, can use the Blockport exchange without having any prior knowledge or experience with professional trading. Unlike other exchanges, Blockport is not just about trading. As a social platform, we implement social trading and knowledge sharing features in the core of our exchange. Additionally, we offer our members the best of both worlds by combining centralized trading with decentralized storing of crypto assets. For more technical information about the Blockport functional design, please read our white paper.


**munich (Ark.Land Delegate)**
Will there be any fees for using Blockport?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@munich (Ark.Land Delegate) yes, we handle fees. Since we're also connected with other exchanges we have to cover their fees as well. We work towards a decentralized way of trading so that fees become minimum.

**pieface**
Hello and welcome

**Blazeron**
how does the token have value?


**munich (Ark.Land Delegate) **
Has the whitepaper been released? (edited)

**Zowie Langdon (Chief technology of Blockport)** 
@munich (Ark.Land Delegate) The whitepaper is indeed released and available here: https://blockport.io/read-the/whitepaper.pdf :slightly_smiling_face:



**Spiros (Chief Design at Blockport)**
Hey everyone


**ovsh**
@Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport) As your previous background is comprised of an MBA internship and a 4 month startup that has no current available website right now (poolhere.com), what makes you confident you have the ability to deliver such a huge platform?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
It's not just about me. We are a team with different capabilities. I have a strong network and social skills and built a great team around me. Having said that, I have also been a project manager at the biggest insurance platform in the netherlands where I was leading a team on conversational AI / chatbot technology.

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
Great question by the way:)


**ovsh**
^ pointy question, but this is an AMA


**pieface**
Could you please define social features? Is it a platform which will allow you to add other traders as friends or ""follow"" them etc? Also, what's the method of connecting with other people you don't directly know?


**pieface**
For example, i'm a lonely trader on your platform and want to socialise, how does that happen?


**strengthbst2**
Yes I don't understand how the social features would be useful.


**munich (Ark.Land Delegate) **
Will your token be used as a way to get fee discounts? Like Binance and KuCoin


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@munich (Ark.Land Delegate) Yes, one of the utilities of the token, is to pay for discounted trading fees like Binance. The other utility is to pay for social trading features.

**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
@Crasha ""Why do you need a token"" Hey Crasha, good question, we use the Blockport token to create a micro-economy inside the Blockport exchange to incentivise experienced traders for sharing their knowledge and trading activities. In order to ""govern"" this micro-economy we need a token that we can control.


**ovsh**
^ @Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport) Can you expand on the 'incentivise an experience trader' part? Assuming I'm an experienced trader, how would that work? And as most tokens are held right now as a form of investment, what prevents the token from being grubbled up to expect a price hike?

**cam**
When's release goal?


**Crasha**
So what will be the experience for these difference permutations of users? 
Experienced trader with many tokens
Experienced trader with few tokens
New trader with many tokens
New trader with few tokens


**Pascal (Marketing at Blockport)**
Hi @pieface, Blockport offers our members a professional platform where they can demonstrate their skills, and explain their strategies to the community. Social trading features consist of you being able to follow other traders and paying experienced traders to have a peek into their portfolio.

For more information on these features, check our recent post on Medium:
https://medium.com/blockport/blockports-social-trading-features-b4fdb646dd43 (edited)

**Zowie Langdon (Chief technology of Blockport)**
@cam Hi! You can find our roadmap on our website here: https://blockport.io/#home_route-map :slightly_smiling_face:
Blockport
The first social crypto exchange
We are building a user-friendly crypto exchange that combines social trading with a hybrid-decentralized architecture to help people safely trade crypto assets. We bridge the gap between the crypto economy and the traditional world of finance to shift towards a digital and decentralized society.

**Spiros (Chief Design at Blockport)**
:+1:

**cam**
How is one considered experienced? Word of mouth? Paid via blockport tokens or preferred form of payment?

**pieface** 
thanks @Pascal (Marketing at Blockport)



**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
@ovsh Beginner traders can pay experienced traders Blockport tokens (BPT) to follow or copy their trading activities.
In return, experienced traders can earn BPT to share their portfolio, knowledge and insights with beginners. This opens up a new stream of revenue for experienced traders, next to earning returns on trading. When it comes to people holding the token as an investment, we cannot prohibit this.


**tranzer**
You also going to offer margin trading?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@Crasha I don't know if I correctly understand your question. But experienced traders who perform well, will probably gain more of a following so that they will earn more BPT as a reward. Members who don't have a lot of BPT can earn them by gaining followers or sharing information or buy them in the Token Shop within the Blockport exchange.


**KidCDN**
I like that idea personally!

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@tranzer That's not on our current roadmap, but we will not exclude it from future plans.

**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
@cam For every member we will track their performance based on certain indicators, such as: ROI in the past 6 months, amount of followers, etc. We have not defined these KPI's yet but it is definitely something we will develop in Q2/Q3 of 2018.
 

**ceibaweb**
will I be able to buy Ark with fiat on Blockport
     


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@ceibaweb We are open to discuss the possibilities :slightly_smiling_face:

**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
@KidCDN Thanks! Could you explain why? :slightly_smiling_face:

**tranzer**
Are you all from Netherlands? Have your own office or working from your homes ?

**lars**
They are all working in my basement :trollark:
 

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@tranzer Yes, we're all from the Netherlands. Our HQ is located in TQ, which is a curated tech hub backed by Google and KPMG in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.



**arno**
@Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport) will you accept USD deposits?


**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
@lars hahaha

**KidCDN**
@Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport) As someone who is pretty darn new in the world of cryptocurrency and looking to actually progress, having more successful traders' tips and portfolio to use as reference (not necessarily a copy as you want to make your own decisions so you don't blame anyone for potential losses) would be very appealing. I also know that some people would rather keep their successful methods to themselves, so having some form of compensation for sharing with others could be very appealing. 

It also makes you want to study up, build a following and communicate with the community more frequently, because gaining followers is just generally beneficial and gaining tokens for doing so seems like a great added reward.


**JayCrypto**
Can you share your teams tech experience

**tranze**
How much you aim to raise? Must say kind of like this idea of hybrid exchange.


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@arno because we're located in the Netherlands we will start with accepting EUR, this is also due to our partnership with CardGate (payment provider). However, we will move forward to accepting creditcards and other currencies. Regulatory wise this is a challenge.


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@tranzer Great :slightly_smiling_face: the hardcap for the pre-sale is €1M and for the crowdsale it is €9M.

**munich (Ark.Land Delegate)**
So you will accept credit cards right away? How do you plan to deal with possible chargebacks and fraud?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@munich (Ark.Land Delegate) No we will not accept them right away. We will be moving forward as fast as possible to accept creditcards, exactly because of the chargebacks.


**munich (Ark.Land Delegate)**
Ok, what about IDEA, SEPA transfers?


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@munich (Ark.Land Delegate) Yes, those we will accept :wink:


**ovsh**
what is this 'referral code' on the pre-token sale form?


**ovsh**
&amp; is there a reason the design &amp; UX language on blockport is very very similar to that of Coinbase?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@ovsh We issue referral codes to community members who like to be ambassadors and wish to spread the news with their network. They will get a reward for referring people. If this interests you, you can join our community here and request one: https://t.me/blockport

**ovsh** 
Sounds cool! As a dev, how do I pitch in if I'm interested?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@KidCDN Great to hear:)

**Azek**
It doesn't seem exactly fair or open to have a private pre-sale and then a public pre sale. What is the reasoning for this, and why not just have a public token sale, in the spirit of being open and transparent.


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@ovsh You need to talk with our CTO :slightly_smiling_face: @Zowie Langdon (Chief technology of Blockport)



**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
@KidCDN Wauw, thanks for the elaborate feedback :slightly_smiling_face:

**Zowie Langdon (Chief technology of Blockport)**
@JayCrypto Our technical team consists of people with a diverse set of expertise! I myself function as a lead engineer at my own company that specializes in web application development, and and I mainly work as an architect and Python developer and love to tinker in/around security related subjects and infrastructure management. 

We also have an engineer, Laurens Profittlich in our team that is lead developer for a company that specializes in fraud detection, working for some of the largest banks in the Netherlands (including Rabobank). 

Then there is Jan Bolhuis, Ethereum developer, experienced Audit &amp; Security specialist and has worked for the Dutch Navy as an IT specialist.

Also, Erik Terpstra, who is founding engineer of Blendle, API specialist and early Bitcoin investor/trader is part of our team.

Additionally we have an experienced Blockchain dev that is still currently working for a large BTC Merchant payment provider, he wishes to stay anonymous for now.

And then there is Bas du Pré, currently lead developer at ABN Amro, who is joining us to build our MVP!

**Azek**
Sounds like an awesome team :slightly_smiling_face:


**Spiros (Chief Design at Blockport)**
@ovsh Good questions; We made careful decisions on which elements to include and exclude form our platform. In the end we wanted to focus on simplicity of use.  We came to a set of functionalities that we all agreed should cover the basic functions for beginner traders to be able to enter. These choices also gave us the ability to build on these functionalities for future additions with regards to experienced traders using our platform.

Indeed some functionalities resemble other trading platform but we strongly believe Blockport has a strong (Ux) identity and you will experience this for yourself when the time comes to have a full look at our platform including the trading platform and social features. These are all unique in feature and design.


**ovsh** 
One thing I'm worried about is the timeline. Q2-Q3 in 2018 crypto-land is roughly 500 light years in real time. Assuming a more 'relaxed' (increased) financial cap, what's your flexibility in ramping up development time?


**Azek**
I had the same concern as you do ovsh when I read the timeline


**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@Azek  Everyone can signup for the pre-sale but participants have to purchase the minimum amount of BPT. In that sense, the pre-sale is publicly accessible to everyone, however, the public crowdsale starting 1st of March is more accessible for ""the crowd"" because of the lower minimum participation of 0.1 ETH. We are also in contact with some bigger players who requested a private sale, but we have gotten more attention than we'd expected so now the private also looks more like a public sale.

**Azek**
Ah okay. That makes more sense.


**Azek**
Got my +1 now :wink:


**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
We just (1 hour ago) launched our new website, do you guys have any feedback?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@Azek Great! :slightly_smiling_face:

**Kai Bennink (Founder of Blockport)**
www.blockport.io

**Azek**
So the private one is one that you have to register for (and I think it costs 2.5 ETH) and the 'public' one is one that anyone can grab for only a min of .1 ETH

**rootbark**
so your UI is designed for newbies to be user friendly but you have large private investors getting discounted undisclosed rates.  Can you give us a breakdown of how many coins for the stages in your sale? (edited)

**Zowie Langdon (Chief technology of Blockport)**
@ovsh @Azek Good question! And a valid concern. As a developer you can probably acknowledge that there is a certain maximum you reach in terms of development performance, especially when working on something that can be considered quite experimental (startup in crypto land). We are definitely aiming to increase our team capacity and thereby the speed with which we build Blockport, but we value stability of our platform and want to ensure proper delivery. Therefore we might be able to speed it up, but we don’t want make any promises that we might not be able to keep. As you know, big promises that may or may not be kept in the end are not scarce in crypto land :slightly_smiling_face:



**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@Azek Exactly.



**ovsh**
What's the status of the tech right now?


**ovsh**
&amp; more importantly, what's the ""decentralized"" component of the exchange itself?

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)**
@rootbark We keep the amount for private investors relatively low (13% of the total tokensales amount). So that the private presale total token amount is 6.400.000 BPT and for the crowdsale it is 43.200.000 BPT. The biggest amount of all the BPT available is for the crowd. Also of all BPT ever being minted, 71,4% is going to the token sales.

**dr10**
OK, we are approaching the 60 minutes mark. Any last questions for Blockport team? Anything the team would like to add or tell - feel free to do.

**rootbark**
im sorry if this was asked but where are you based?

**mward**
@Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport) so for the pre-sale we need to apply on the website and wait for mail

**ovsh**
what's the ""decentralized"" component of the exchange itself?

**mike**
any chance the platform will let you follow multiple traders, assign a weight to their porfolios, and combine them into a single displayed portfolio. also, have you heard of Marketocracy, ran a similar type of service without crypto a few years back?


**Zowie Langdon (Chief technology of Blockport)** 
@ovsh We have been experimenting with the necessary components needed for our MVP in Q1. Basically, our infrastructure is more or less defined and we have been able to hook up some components to assess feasibility of our roadmap. Now, we are focusing on getting our MVP in the air before January 2018 excluding the actual trading of crypto on the platform.

As for the decentralized part of the exchange we are currently looking into using an open-protocol such as Kyber Network, Polkadot or Loopring (0x is also a good option but they only offer ERC20 based tokens). We know that the decentralized protocols are hot, but can lack the needed performance. Therefore, we have not specified exactly what protocol we will work with for now, to allow for flexibility we might need.

**Sebastiaan Lichter (Founder of Blockport)** 
@mward That's correct, you will get a mail when the whitelisting process is live.


**mward**

Sorry if this has been asked already, you say on your site that the user owns the private key to the Wallet.  Does this mean it goes straight to your own wallet (the users wallet) or is it still held by you guys?

@mike Yes we allow you to follow multiple traders and decide how much of your funds you wish to allocate to each of them. I haven't heard of Marketocracy, could you share a link?

7i9dwd,2,2017-12-07,December 11th,pclever1,keepkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/keepkey/comments/7i9dwd/december_11th/,"As December 11th is this coming Monday I am trying to prepare myself for some large market changes. I have been asking myself 2 main questions:


* What are the odds of bitcoin crashing on Monday the 11th?
* If/As bitcoin goes down in value will the other crypto currencies go up in value?




My guesses here are that if bitcoin ends up crashing some of the other currencies that have been suffering this week will intern start going up. The main three that I am watching are obviously Bitcoin Cash, Ether, and Bitcoin Gold. 




The large amount of bitcoin growth in the past week has been largely due to people buying (mostly through coinbase as their price is much higher than the rest of the markets) and for right now that is a stable reason for growth. I have been wondering what the objective is of the typical person buying this week as I am assuming many of them are in it for the short term ride up. Many people expect the market to continue rising until the 11th and then not many people have an idea for what is going to happen. As the new future markets allow investors to short the market I am assuming many will especially after what has been happening this week. If anything causes the market to appear to be crashing there is a very good chance it will and as much as I don't want to contribute to a crash I do want to ensure I am making a good decision with my coins.

So I have a plan. First, I am working on myself. To do this I plan to take a semester off. After that break, I hope to be in more control of my life.

When I'm at that point I plan on transferring all my valid credits/grades to a smaller school near me. As I am an accounting major(who works in accounting), I am going to use this school to fulfill get:

* Associates Degree in Accounting (Forensic focus)
* Bookkeeping Cert
* Computer-Integrated Accounting Cert
* Fundamental Payroll Cert
* Enrolled Agent Cert

I should be able to finish all that within 3 semesters (The certs only require a few extra classes and mostly stack).

After that, I will hopefully still be working at my current job(sole AR clerk at a small company that promotes from within), but with a higher position due to newer credentials. Then I will focus on completing my Bachelor's.

**Now** my question for all of you. Does my Cumulative GPA matter in the end if I'm not going for internships or B4? I know my GPA will end up as garbage at the end of school. 

Let me know if I need to clarify any of this.

Also any tips advice on how to move forward. Thanks all.

7ig3e5,0,2017-12-08,[REQUEST] Assassin's Creed Origins (20% discount on Steam),EpicChiguire,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/7ig3e5/request_assassins_creed_origins_20_discount_on/,"Hi! I hope you guys are doing great. I am EpicChiguire and I'm a gamer from Venezuela (and currently in Argentina).

**So, a little bit about me**:

I'm a 22 year old Modern Students born in Venezuela and lived all my life there up until this year, I am currently living in Argentina because I am taking an Internship as a Spanish as a Second Language Teaching Assistant. My interest are not only gaming, but History, Writing (I have a blog with short stories and poems that I update every once in a while), and Filmmaking (in fact, I am planning on shooting a short film in January with a couple of friends, God willing).

**What game would I like?**

I would like to ask for Assassin's Creed: Origins. As many of you may know, Assassin's Creed is one of the biggest sagas of the last years. Groundbreaking and recognized for its incredible renditions of many cities and places of the ancient worlds (from the Middle East to the Caribbean), it has many followers and haters alike. I, for one, am one of the fans of the saga. I played the first Assassin's Creed back in 2008 when I was in High School, and I was hooked on ever since. The possibility of playing as a badass Assassin during the Third Crusade (one of my favorite periods) was super cool, and then trying to uncover a conspiracy in the Modern Day at the same time... man, those were the days. 

I remember I'd play it on my dad's PC with his GeForce 8400GS of 512mb DDR2 with all minimum and still have lots of fun. I still can remember that melancholic Sunday when my relatives came over and I played a bit after I left (not that it's a meaningful memory, but it really takes me back to when everything was better... no crisis, no having to live away from my pops, etc). Then came Assassin's Creed 2. First time watching an E3 trailer. 13/14 year old me was ecstatic. That's when I was introduced to Ezio and the Renaissance. Up until then, everything I knew about that historical period was a couple of facts and that was it. Now armed with my dad's powerful GPU on my own PC (yep, still that 8400GS), I submerged myself into that beautiful world of Florence and Venice (and still had one of my nerdiest moments when I played with Desmond in the MD), and subsequently, in Rome. Revelations was kinda good but the performance was a little bit lacking (my GPU was struggling a lot with it). Come AC3, and my PC couldn't handle it. I had to wait until the Christmas break in order to play it on my dad's laptop (an i3 with an HD3000). It was something, and it allowed me to play that (and have one of the biggest nerdgasms when playing as Desmond in Abstergo) and Black Flag (all in minimum at 15-20 FPS), and regardless of the terrible performance, I completed both those games because I was really into that saga (even though I hated what happened with Desmond). 

I wasn't able to play Unity and Syndicate up until a couple of months ago (thanks to a couple friends that let me play on their consoles while I was able to upgrade to a better machine), and even though both were underwhelming, they're still not that bad. (And don't kill me for this, but I loooooved the AC movie. For real.) Now, Assassin's Creed: Origins has earned good reviews and has been praised by critics and fans alike. It has been said (according to Reddit lol) that it is the worthy successor to AC2 and that it is not only as good as AC2, but to some it's even better than Ezio's first game. As a huge AC nerd, I would love to play this game, for real.

**Why can't I get it by myself?** 

Now, I can't buy this game because it's worth 48 bucks right now (with the Steam discount). I'm taking my Internships in Argentina (and I basically moved here from Venezuela), and I literally can't work because said Internships are full time and I don't have the time to work somewhere else. Given the fact that this University is giving me food and accommodations, they deemed necessary to give me 100$ a month in order to pay for my personal expenses. I can't complain because I get food and a place where to sleep, but taking into account the fact that I am from Venezuela (my country is in the worst crisis of its history, to the point where the minimum wage is 1 DOLLAR A MONTH), and I am living in another country on my own (away from my parents and my siblings, whom I miss with all I am). 

I need to save every single penny I can in order to start maintaining myself while I get a job and a place to live after I'm done with these internships. I don't even have the money to go back to Venezuela for Christmas, and I am very much likely to spend my first Christmas ever away from my old folks and my brother and sister (and the sole idea of it breaks my heart and really depresses me, to be honest).

So... **TL;DR:** the idea of getting Assassin's Creed: Origins, a good game from a saga that means a lot to me and that takes me back to when I lived better days, in order to play it in the following days, where I'll be away from my parents in what is (arguably) the most important date of the year. I know videogames aren't the answer, but I think that they can help to cope with some stuff (like this, for example). [Here's my Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/id/coqueroman/) and [here's Assassin's Creed Origins Steam page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/582160/Assassins_Creed_Origins/).

7igeyw,0,2017-12-08,"The Reporting System: Remove the ""Giving Up"" Option",Syrif,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7igeyw/the_reporting_system_remove_the_giving_up_option/,"I recently had a really nice winstreak, going something like 18-2 across 20 games, mostly solo. I thought I finally had a good read on the preseason meta, I was playing pretty well. I climbed from G5 0LP to G3 promos in the span of 3-4 days.

That's when it happened. The first of 6 games that was taken hostage by a 'teammate' of mine.

**Now before I explain, a disclaimer: Yes I could have played those 6 games better, I understand that.**

So what happened? I will leave summoner names out of it for now, I'm not here to Doxx players, what happened happened. They were reported but as far as I can tell, not punished. I'm more concerned with preventing this in the future.

**TL;DR on the game descriptions:** Someone on my team took the game hostage, was reported, but no punished.

**Game 1:** I was playing Morgana support. Our Jarvan jungle got counterjungled and fell behind. He got 
really frustrated. He kept trying to surrender, but my duo and I kept blocking all the votes because I was in my         
promos and didn't want to give up. We both spent a good few minutes between catching waves trying to 
convince the Jarvan to play, but he just wasn't having any of it. Eventually, he sat on the fountain until the game 
was over. He received minimum 3 reports for giving up / AFK, as declared by post-game lobby reporters.

**Game 2:** This game, I picked Kogmaw because the enemy team had 3 tanks, and our support had also 
picked Lulu. ""Perfect"", I thought. ""This is the chance for me to start up another winstreak, that last game was 
just bad luck, getting a teammate who refused to play the game out and try, even though he was behind"". Alas, 
the exact same thing happened again. The enemy Zac jungle got a few good ganks off on top and mid, giving 
himself a huge lead. As me and Lulu fell further behind, I predicted what happened next. The good 'ol ""I'm done 
with this game"", followed by a surrender vote. Since I was still in my promos, 1-1 (including my free win), I 
thought ""No way, I will play it out. We can do this lategame if we just stall"". But then the Lulu acted the same 
way Jarvan did in the previous game. She refused to play. She would just walk around and watch us teamfight, 
pretending to help. Or she would sit on fountain. She had officially taken the game hostage, forcing us into a 
4v5 to end it quicker because we would not surrender. We lost, of course, and my duo and I reported her under 
the same flag, giving up and AFK. Not sure if any other teammates did or not.

**Game 3:** I was now playing solo, and picked Morgana support again. We had a rough start, Fizz facechecked the enemy jungle before minions were up, and ended up blowing flash to escape their Lee sin. I knew it would be rough, their Lee and Taliyah were both 1-tricks, with hundreds of games on the champions. Lee counter jungled our Kindred and then ganked Fizz, on repeat for about 10 minutes. Fizz was feeding, Kindred was feeding, I was feeding. But it was our Shen top who decided enough was enough. After his surrender vote failed 1-4, he sat on the fountain, said ""ok"" and left the game. ""A summoner has quit"". He made sure to come back to the post-game lobby just as the game ended though, to flame us some more. Despite the fact that the other 4 team members were all willing to try and play, hoping for the enemy to make a big mistake, one player took the game hostage and decided we did not get to win, because he didn't feel like playing anymore.

**Games 4-6:** The same thing happened in these 3 games. Our team got off to a rough start, 1 player on our team tried a surrender vote, and then went partially or completely AFK after a failed surrender vote, explicitly saying in chat that they had given up and were no longer going to play. All of these games, of course, I wrote up a nice detailed ""giving up/AFK"" report, including quotes from the player in-game.



Yes, in all 6 of those games, I performed poorly. Some of it was me being tilted, some of it was just being against a better player. But in all 6 of those games, 4 people on my team, including myself, were prepared to make the long haul and try for a lategame win. ""It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile, winning is winning."" But for 6 consecutive games, someone on our team decided they no longer wanted to play and took the game hostage. Myself and the rest of the team tried our hardest to convince them to play, being as positive as we could in the situation, congratulating them whenever something went right. But, In all 6 games, they were reported by anywhere from 1-3 people at least, plus anyone else that reported them but didn't say anything.

**So how does this relate to my title?**

I think the ""Giving Up"" option in the report system needs to be removed, or, ideally, it is actually enforced. People often get chat restricted or banned pretty quickly for racial slurs, hate speech, and ""literal inting"" (running down a lane over and over, ending the game with an obscene amount of deaths, no kills, no assists, and no CS). But why does nobody appear to get banned for taking a game hostage inside of a game? I have even seen popular high elo players showing others getting banned for taking champ select hostage, or doing it themselves. But why not when it's done in-game? And take for example that video RossBoomSocks did on the duo that played Tahm and Anivia, and inted their team not by dying, but by using their abilities to ensure their teammates deaths. What happens to these players?

I don't mind when someone feeds in my games. I couldn't care less, so long as they are still willing to try their best. But when someone decides for me that my game is over, and I no longer have agency in the situation, I think that is a major problem. So I have a few questions that hopefully some people will answer.

**1) Have you ever had champ select taken hostage before? What happened? Did someone dodge, did you have to play, did you lose the game, were there any reports/punishments?**

**2) Have you ever had the game taken hostage by having someone refuse to help or play, by either sitting on the fountain or by purposely just walking around and not helping? Did they get reported? What was the result?**

**3) Do you think this is a major offense? Is it as bad as hate speech? Does it ruin the game? Is it not a big deal? Do people actually get punished for it and I am simply biased because of my own experiences?**

**4) How can Riot improve upon this concept?**

**5) Is there anything I can try to say/do to convince someone to try? I've tried being a dick, I've tried being nice, I've tried using logic, I've tried encouragement, I've tried report threats. Nothing seems to work.**

A bit lengthy, but I'm sure my frustration is reasonable. It's mentally exhausting to feel as if you have no agency in the outcome of the game, because one player decided that you don't get to win. Let me know how you guys feel about this, what your experiences have been, and what we can do about it.

Cheers,
Syrif

EDIT: Formatting

EDIT 2: My own solution. I would think Riot has some AI engineers that could develop a basic machine learning environment capable of analyzing the in-game chat logs for players reported under this flag. Specifically looking for keywords like ""done"", ""gg"", ""no"", ""I dont want to"", stuff like that, and combine it with a heatmap of the character (e.g; they spend 45 seconds on the fountain, walk around to avoid AFK flag, and go back to the fountain, or they sit on fountain but keep typing to avoid AFK flag). These reports could then be sent to some poor Riot intern who would sort through possible cases. 

Someone can probably come up with something more efficient that that, but hey it's a starting point. Note, I also have no idea how the reporting system works now, or to what degree it is automated. I still remember the Tribunal days."

7ihfzm,172,2017-12-08,Going Home,proudgayguy,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/7ihfzm/going_home/,"It had been a tough few months for me. My homophobic Mother had died, and despite cutting me off for the past 6 years, it still hurt. She was, after all, my Mom. I still had lots of good memories from my childhood. I returned early from the funeral, unable to bear the reactions from her family; particularly my Aunt Jeanne. Much to my surprise, my Mom had made me Executor of her estate, and left her estate to me. I suspect it was my Dad behind that, and he had never told my Mom. Dad had always supported me, paid for my college against her objections, and stayed in touch with me until he died a year before. I did not attend his funeral, as my Mom got word to me I was not welcome. I kind of enjoyed watching my Aunt Jeanne have a meltdown. 

After I met with the realtor and arranged for the estate sale, I returned to New York a day early. When I walked into our apartment mid-day, I was greeted by grunts and moans coming from the bedroom. I walked in on my partner Ken balls deep into his twink summer intern from work. Son of a bitch wasn’t even wearing a condom. I burst out of the apartment in tears. I had never felt so low in my life. 

My mom’s house sold, and I headed back South to oversee disposing of the items left in the house for staging, moving the items I was keeping. The closing was on the Tuesday after Labor Day, so I had exactly a week to get organized. I pulled into the driveway with a lump in my throat. I could hear the mower in the backyard, and was impressed on how buttoned down the front yard looked. I had arranged for Tommy from down the block to handle the yard at the funeral, and he had done an exceptional job. 

I dropped my bags in the front hall, and got the bare essentials I had picked up at the grocery store and took them to the kitchen. I stowed the perishables in the refrigerator, listening to the drone of the mower. I cracked open a Stella, and gazed out the kitchen window. The wide patio led to the sparkling blue pool, and the long wide expanse of green lawn which ended at the wooded conservation area behind the house. It was a stunning setting. I saw Tommy emerge from behind the bedroom wing of the house, pushing the mower. He was shirtless, and wearing a pair of tight cutoff jeans which were slung low on his hips. I did a quick double take.

I had been surprised by Tommy’s transformation from the short dorky 12 year old I had known in high school, to the handsome young man I saw at the funeral. What I didn’t see at the funeral was the sculpted firm body glistening with sweat from the hot Texan sun. His smooth chest, arms and legs were a perfect bronze from the summer months. He pivoted and headed towards the woods, and I perved over his tight bubble butt and lean strong legs. My cock stirred, and knew what my jerkoff fantasy would be before bedtime. 

I grabbed my bags, and headed upstairs to my old room. I unpacked, and went to take a leak. I heard the mower turn off, and looked out the window at Tommy pushing it toward the pool apron. He walked toward the pool, and slid off his cutoffs. My mouth dropped as he stepped out of them. The band of white skin contrasted sharply with his deep tan line. His soft cut cock draped down over large low shaved nuts. He quickly dove into the pool, and slowly waded to the far side. His white tight smooth bubble butt flexed as he slowly scissor kicked. My pissing cock began to immediately rise in my hand. 

I had told Tommy to use the pool whenever he wished, as long as he didn’t have parties there over the summer. He flipped onto his back, and his soft cock bobbed just above the water line. It wasn’t huge, but by no means small either. I flushed the toilet, grabbed a towel off the rack and headed down the stairs. When I called out to him opening the back slider, his head whipped around with a look of surprise. I gave him a cheerful “Awesome job on the lawn, Tommy! Never looked better! Glad to see you’ve been using the pool”.  His face broke into a broad smile revealing cute dimples, and perfect white teeth. He began to walk into the shallow end, saying he didn’t realize I’d be in town. I could see his cock bob in the water as he walked toward me unashamed. He walked up the steps in full glory, and I handed him the towel. Rather than covering himself, he began to dry his longish curly blonde locks. I asked him how the water was, and he replied great, and I should join him. 

I was startled by how assured he was standing naked in front of me. He obviously knew I was gay. Everyone in town knew I was gay. It was like role reversal. I felt like a nervous teen, and he more like a self-assured 24 year old. I gulped, and stammered I hadn’t packed a suit, And he just smiled and while slowly toweling his crotch said “didn’t stop me. So private back here anyway.”  I was in a trance. Here this hot kid was asking me to get naked and join him in the pool. I pulled me shirt off quickly, struggled out of my shorts, and pushed my underwear down. He definitely checked me out. I’m not a huge guy soft, but the skin had me expanded more than usual. He tossed the towel and reentered the pool. 

He splayed his arms over the apron, and asked me how long I was in town, and told me he was starting college on Tuesday. I began to chill down, and enjoyed talking with this mature young man. He asked me if I had a boyfriend. At first I thought it was odd, as no one in this town had ever acknowledged the fact I was gay, they simply ignored it, and mostly ignored me too. I gave him the edited version of Ken cheating on me, and asked him if he had a girlfriend. He laughed, shook his head and then said “Nope. Been batting for your team since I was a sophomore. Can’t wait to bust out of this homophobic town like you did.”  

The shock must have registered on my face, because he laughed again. His hand brushed my shoulder, and I shivered at his touch. “You up for some fun?” he said slyly. I couldn’t believe this young stud wanted to mess around with me. He didn’t even wait for an answer, and turned and slid his hand across my chest and around my back and pulled me into him. His lips pressed against mine, and then his tongue into my mouth. Our naked bodies pressed together, and our cocks mingled below the cool water. He hopped up on the apron, and spread his legs. I stared at the 6 inch cock that pointed toward his navel, and those large low shaved nuts inches from my face. 

He didn’t have to ask, and I quickly dove onto his hard cock. He sighed as I worked his teen cock, and ran his hands through my wet hair. I lapped each nut, and then sucked each one into my mouth. I ran my hand over his tight smooth abs, and up to his erect hard nipple and teased them as I worked his cock. His teen hormones had him close after only a few minutes, and I felt his abs tighten, his nuts pull up tight for release, and his soft moans of pleasure. His hand pushed down on my neck and his ass rose from the cement, and he unloaded a sweet stream of cum into my mouth with a long sigh. 

I pulled off his cock with a pop, and it bounced against his abs. He slid back down into the water and kissed me lightly. “Best blowjob I’ve ever had” he murmured. “Your turn”. I quickly hopped onto the apron, and he moved between my legs. I felt that tingle I had missed those past 3 months, as his wet tongue swirled my cock head. Tommy worked my cock like a seasoned pro, and when he looked up at me, my 6 inches buried  deep in his warm mouth, I spasmed and filled his greedy mouth. He fed me some of my jizz, and we left the pool and laid on the freshly mowed lawn, and I caught my breath. 

He lightly ran his fingers over my abs, and then up to my sensitive nipples. His head turned to me, and he asked if he could fuck me. There was nothing I wanted more at that moment than to have this young stud sliding in and out of my ass. I ran mu hand over his smooth soft abs, and squeezed his plump soft cock. I told him I wanted nothing more than to get fucked by him, but I arrived in Texas unprepared; no condoms or lube. His dimples flashed, and he hopped to his feet. “Be right back!” as he pulled his tight cutoffs up, and pushed his mower through the gate.

He was back in a flash, his crotch bulging in obvious anticipation. We moved inside the house, and headed to my room. As I passed my Mother’s open door, I pulled him onto her bed. Fuck the bitch, I thought. Make her roll in her grave. Tommy didn’t waste anytime smearing my ass with lube and thrusting his fingers into me. I parted his cheeks and dove onto that hairless puckered hole feeling the warmth surround  my tongue and his sphincter squeeze it. He was hitting my prostate like a pro, and I moaned buried in his ass. My cock ached in anticipation of getting fucked by that young stallion. 

He gloved up quickly, pushed my thighs into my chest and pressed into my hole. “Easy” I pleaded, knowing my ass hadn’t been invaded in 3 months. He popped in with a tinge of pain, and slid balls deep into me. His youthful exuberance took over, and began to fuck me in earnest. God it felt so good. Figured I’d give him a good ride, something his young high school friends hadn’t learned. I squeezed his shaft as he pulled out, and relaxed for the incoming thrust. He began to pant and strain, and fucked me with abandon. The sex noises were sexy as hell, as we both  grunted and swore like animals in heat, above the cacophony of the squeaking bed, slapping thighs, and banging headboard. 

I knew he would blow soon, so quickly jerked my cock to cum first. I needed that extra pressure on my prostate to increase my orgasm. When I clamped down hard on his cock and squirted over my chest, I locked his cock deep in my bowels. He grunted, then twitched as his orgasm coarsed through his veins. He collapsed on my cummy chest heaving to catch his breath. His cock twitched inside me, expelling his last drops into the reservoir. 

He fucked me twice a day until Tuesday morning arrived, and departed for college. As I did the final walkthrough with the new owners later that day, I stared into my mother’s empty room, felt the ache of a well fucked hole and smiled.

Maybe you want me to lactate for you and every day I bring you lunch in you office and then you feed from my tits. Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I'm not looking for a novelist, but someone who wants to get into these characters and find fun ways to explore them as well as write some fun sexy scenes. Lets figure out how I got to be your mistress, what the relationship is.

7ijdrz,4,2017-12-08,[Diplomacy] The Negotiation of all Negotiations,HumansOfDecatur,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/7ijdrz/diplomacy_the_negotiation_of_all_negotiations/,"It was snowing lightly as the two leaders sat down for the talk's commencement. [Batumi during the winter](https://www.georgianjournal.ge/pictures/image2/2d6e240884007a792d272c20464c4076.jpg) truly was a winter wonderland, and though both leaders were nervous about the talks at hand, the beauty outside the window was certainly one positive thing about the experience. A few months earlier Azerbaijan had staged the [Tbilisi Negotiations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/7i17ec/diplomacy_the_tbilisi_negotiations/), which were not endorsed by Armenia and therefore not attended. Despite this we have realized that it was simply an error by an Azerbaijani intern, and no hard feelings were had. 

While we did not attend this conference, we did a feel for what the Azerbaijani government was requesting. Their four main points they proposed were as follows:

&gt; 1. Armenia will withdraw all its support for the so-called ""Republic of Artsakh"" in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. In return, the Azerbaijani government is prepared to create an autonomous region for the ethnic Armenian population roughly coexistent with the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (see map)
&gt; 2. A treaty shall be signed whereby Azerbaijan and Armenia recognise the official border between them, and in return they will mutually allow citizens of either country to cross that border. Both states will also agree not make territorial claims on the other
&gt; 3. Armenia will assist Azerbaijan in negotiating with the separatists to accept their status as part of Azerbaijan.
&gt; 4. Azerbaijan will persuade the Turkish government to lift the blockade on Armenia and will assist Armenia in acquiring recognition from Pakistan
&gt; 5. Armenia and Azerbaijan will enter separate talks about a future trading relationship, including a potential energy deal.

It was these points that Armenian President Tsarukyan slid across the table to President Aliyev of Azerbaijan. 

&gt; ""We simply cannot agree to any of these, for reasons you fully understand. The Azerbaijani people in and around Nagorno-Karabakh have committed a series of human rights violations against the Armenians in the region before your withdrawal, and with the effects of the war and the subsequent events these abuses are fated to continue. 98% of the [Nagorno-Karabakh region](https://www.nationalia.info/imatges/noticies/armenia_azerbaidjan_karabak.jpg) are ethnically Armenian and speak the Armenian language, and the 2% that don't are either Russian, Georgian, or Persian-- not Azeri. Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of an Armenian government for 930 of the last 1000 years, and the Independent Republic of Armenia has controlled it for the last 30. In recognition of these facts, we counter with the following proposals, which we hope you may find in your best interests as a sovereign nation.""

He handed another piece of paper to President Aliyev, a classic piece of Armenian parchment stamped with the Armenian seal and the signatures of the Armenian Foreign Minister and the President. On it lay the proposals of the Armenian Republic of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.

&gt; #Batumi Negotiations: Requests and Concessions

&gt; ###Requests:

&gt; 1. The Republic of Azerbaijan will withdraw claim to the Nagorno-Karabakh Region. 
&gt; 2. The Republic of Azerbaijan will allow for a UN Moderated referendum in the Artsakh Republic with the following options on the ballot:
&gt;  1. Remain an Independent Armenian State under the name of the *Republic of Artsakh*
&gt;  2. Unify with the *Republic of Armenia*
&gt;  3. Become an Autonomous Province under the *Republic of Azerbaijan*
&gt;  4. Unify with the *Republic of Azerbaijan*
&gt; 3. The Republic of Azerbaijan will cede the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic to the Republic of Armenia because:
&gt;  1. The Nakhchivan region is historically Armenian,^1 as shown by scores of Armenian heritage cites in the region.
&gt;  2. The Nakhchivan people have long fought for relations with Armenia, as shown by their [recent protest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/7hj2a9/event_change_is_urgent/). 
&gt;  3. The Republic of Azerbaijan have been [destroying Armenian cultural cites in the region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_cemetery_in_Julfa). These cites must be protected and it appears Azerbaijan has encouraged the destruction of these valuable and historical cites. 

&gt; ### Concessions:

&gt; 1. The Republic of Armenia will discontinue the blockade on Azerbaijan
&gt; 2. The Republic of Armenia will inform the members of CSTO, CISFA, and the Eurasian Economic Union of Azerbaijan's agreement, henceforth Azerbaijan will be viewed as an ally and brother to these organizations, with the option of joining them in the future. 
&gt; 3. The Republic of Armenia will allow full access of trans-national highways to Azerbaijan with complete tax excemption so they may trade with Turkey as much as desired without the heavy fines and taxes involved with going through Iran and Georgia. 

&gt; We hope you will find these agreements acceptable,

&gt; Foreign Minister &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; President

&gt; ###*Edward Nalbandian &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Gagik Tsarukyan*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&amp;nbsp;

President Tsarukyan made sure to remind his fellow president of a few things.

&gt; ""Mr. President, there's a lot to lose for both of us if we don't agree with this document. With a unified Armenia, a pure Azerbaijan, and a steadfast alliance we can cut military spending and put that money towards much needed domestic and foreign goals, of which I know we have many. 

&amp;nbsp;

^1: ^Before ^the ^Armenian ^Genocide ^it ^was ^nearly ^80% ^Armenian, ^and ^even ^during ^Soviet ^times ^there ^was ^a ^significant ^(20%+) ^Armenian ^population. ^It ^was ^only ^till ^Azerbaijan ^deported ^all ^Armenians ^during ^the ^Nagorno-Karabakh ^War ^that ^it ^became ^overwhelmingly ^Azeri."

Lately, I discovered the UI/UX. I have found out that It possible to learn it by myself from the internet, do an internship, make a portfolio and then get a job.
I saw recommended books, tutorials, mini-free-courses, expensive courses, blogs and etc... I really drown in this things. too many choices and feedbacks and everyone say something else.

I am interested to get into this field.
I have no experience with Adobe, sketch,Balsamiq and all those Softwares. No experience in design.

I have creative vision and mind, I love design, I love beautiful interface and good experience. This field is for me.

My question is: What in your opinion should I do? What would you do if you were in my place? Learn from free content? Paid-course? if so, which one. Keep in mind that I like to know a subject from inside out, I need a source that will teach me basic design and how to work with software (Adobe etc..). 
I'm totally confused with all this information and people's opinion.



Thank you guys for help!

This community is amazing.

7ijln6,27,2017-12-08,My (21F) BF (25M) holds resentment towards me because I didn't give him a job 2 years ago.,throwawaytoronto314,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ijln6/my_21f_bf_25m_holds_resentment_towards_me_because/,"Throwaway account just for this... My apologies for the long post/crappy format, I'm relatively new to reddit.

I (21F) been with my bf (25M) for almost 3 1/2 years now. Let me start off by saying that we come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and while I never thought this would be an issue, it very much has been. While I am a student (in a highly competitive program), I have also been working a well-paying job since last summer. It begun as an internship for school, but the company decided to hire me. I live at home so I don't have many expenses of my own, besides eating out + gas + phone bill + other small expenses here and there - this has allowed me to put quite a big amount into my savings. I also come from a well-off family, but they have always taught me the value of hard work and savings money, as well as spending it wisely, so I'm quite frugal with my spending in general. My BF, however, took a few more years in school and graduated from a program that he didn't really enjoy, and one that didn't yield the greatest job prospects. He also doesn't have any immediate expenses, as he still lives at home as well, but the only job he could find was a low-end one with hours that weren't great. 

This is where things get messy. Less than a year into our relationship, he learned that my parents owned their own company (a small one, but one they worked very hard to build, being new immigrants to Canada). He asked for a job at my parents' company almost immediately, despite not being qualified and not having the right work experience. He essentially wanted my parents to give him a pass on the qualifications. I'm a pretty cautious person in general, so I was wary of mixing business with pleasure (we had then only been together less than a year, so what if we broke up?). I also knew he wasn't too great with money in general, as he was a few thousand dollars in credit card debt even before I met him and he still regularly spent WAY more than me. I admit now that my reasoning was stupid, but I told him I would think about it. It didn't end up happening (partly because I wasn't totally comfortable with it, and partly because their company was dealing with a few crises that year). 

Ever since then, my BF took a retail-like job and has been miserable. He has been moody on and off, and bears resentment towards me because of finances. He blames me whenever he can about being miserable getting up at 5am for his job (his shift is from 6:00am-2:30pm), and he also uses the job situation as a trump card in all of our arguments, even ones that have nothing to do with it. Since I earn more, I help him out whenever I can. I have loaned him over $2000+, paid for pretty much ALL our meals in the last two years, paid for his gas, his pet food, etc. We could be having a great day one second, and then he can do a complete 180 for no reason and give me the silent treatment for an hour, with me asking repeatedly whats wrong and what can I do to help, only for him to reply with a snarky comment like, ""well, a job would've helped"". This frustration about finances has also caused him to be mean to me in general, calling me a ""trust fund baby"" who has no idea what ""the real world"" is like... despite the fact that I worked extra hard to be awarded almost full scholarships to 14 different universities in Canada, and my parents literally immigrated from a third-world country and worked at Mcdonalds when they came here. If I bring up the fact that I've tried to help him with finances in the past in any way I can by loaning him money, he'll call me a shitty person for bringing it up and ""using it against him"". If I try to make him feel better by saying that other people also have to wake up at 5am for their job and it's not the end of the world, he will call me selfish and insensitive. If I talk about work or talk about my day, he makes me feel bad by bringing up his own day at his job (ex: ""I'm *glad* you had a great business dinner... I couldn't even afford a hot dog. **cue eyeroll**"") I never buy myself anything nice, but one time I was receiving a nice Christmas bonus and I was browsing purses online...he got upset with me because I was looking at expensive purses but I still hadn't transferred him the $1000 he asked for. I'm at my wits end, I hate tiptoeing around him and making sure not to talk about work because it may upset him. On multiple occasions, he has picked a fight with me because he has to save up to buy my christmas gift, which I've told him MULTIPLE times I'd rather he save his money and write me a card or something ... he then proceeded to call me ""mother theresa... of course I have to get you a damn gift"", as if I was just pretending to not want one (???). 

I know giving him a job two years ago might've helped, and maybe I was being selfish, but I can't go back in time. I have no idea what to do and how to fix it. 

He's a wonderful, great boyfriend when he isn't thinking about finances, and I know debt can be stressful, but he definitely holds resentment towards me because of a job I couldn't give him two years ago. I have no idea how to help or fix his resentment. Any advice? :/

TL;DR My BF is in a bad financial state and blames me because I didn't give him a job two years ago, and it's really messing with our relationship. How do I go about mending it? "

So I have a kind of weird question and would love opinions/suggestions /advice from derby peeps. 

I just got Bonts (hybrid carbons), and am skating barefoot for the first time. I have ankle booties. My problem is that after about an hour or so of skating, my forefoot gets REALLY hot. Like, it feels like my skates are in a heater or that I'm being subjected to some kind of freaky torture. Super uncomfortable. And I need to clarify - it's not athletes foot. No itching or burning in that way - just legit feels like I'm way too close to a heater or something.

I've never been a person to go sockless in any closed-toe shoe, because #gross. But I love the control I have over my skates without socks on. I currently use Odor Eaters powder on my feet for odor/sweat/friction control. I don't have any blister or friction issues.

Does anyone else have this problem?? If so, HALP. It's awful and I hate it and I can't seem to find any info on the interns.

#**Harry Potter**

You're quite well known around Hogwarts, one of the Slytherin girls in Year Seven. Ever since 1998 the stigma around the house due to its connection to the Dark Arts had declined quite a bit, specially with the fact that the most recent Dark Wizard had actually been a former Ravenclaw student that terrorized Muggles in a small town in Wales. As such, there was much more interaction between houses these days than there was before. Not everyone knew each other though, which was the case with you and me, since we end up meeting by accident when we bump into each other while late on the way to a Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw Quidditch match. The match's not really the most interesting prospect for a Gryffindor and a Slytherin but what else was there to do today?

#**Teacher/student**

You're one the most popular and well-liked teachers in the school, in part because you can connect with students since you're younger and much more amicable than the rest of the old, stuffy faculty, as well as the fact that you're incredibly gorgeous and dress with that fact in mind. Like the rest of the guys, I was quite fixated on your clothing as well as your body from the moment you entered the classroom. The difference is that I had the guts to stick around and become one of your favorites, so much so that eventually you gave me your number and we'd occasionally text to riff on the ridiculous bullshit that happened around the school and what not. One day, after class, you told me that I was welcome to swing around your place if I wanted to help you with tests from the two classes you taught to eleventh graders. 

#**Older/More experienced GF**

We'd met each other at a college party about two months ago or so, where we talked for quite a bit and did nothing more than make out for a while and exchange numbers. We texted for a few weeks before finally deciding to become a couple. Even though we're together, the relationship is still new so I'm still somewhat nervous since you're older and more experienced than me, something you tease me about. While hanging out in my dorm, I get a text from you saying that you were coming over once your current class was done. I start pacing around the room, a bit tense and waiting for you to knock on the door. 

#**Boss/employee** 

Thanks to some family connections, I had managed to snag a position as a paid intern in your office, working closely with one of your associates. The reputation of the place was enough to make it worth it, but on top of that the pay was pretty good all things considered and you worked there as well, the director of this particular department at the law firm. You were brilliant as well as beautiful, which led to some moments that were less than befitting of the situation, where I had looked away quite noticeably at your ass as you walked away, or at your breasts as you walked towards my general area.

7ik7yp,2,2017-12-08,Looking for future planning advice,financethrows99,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ik7yp/looking_for_future_planning_advice/,"Hey there y'all

While procrastinating on my 10 page essay due Monday, I happened to start wondering about my finances, and eventually turned to Reddit, looking for advice on how to keep making money and have good financial habits.

Currently I am/have:

* A freshman Computer Science major in a 4-year university in the UC (University of California) System
* Only taken out one subsidized loan for this year, thanks to CalGrants I don't have to pay that much this year
* A large amount of money for college left for me by my grandfather (around ~70,000)
* Some money saved from an internship I had last summer in a mutual fund account (around 1,500, a moderately risky fund)
* Not much personal funds, I've only kept around $500 from my summer internship in my personal savings account

So I had a few questions on how to continue to earn money and save for my future, making sure I graduate with no debt and that I won't have to worry about debt when I'm older:

* Is it wise to pursue a double major in Business Management and Econ if it will add to my time in college and possibly more that I have to pay for college?
* I have an internship lined up for next year with the same company I had last year, but this year I'll be getting paid double what I was last year, how much should I put into the mutual fund I have open, and how much should I be allowed to spend for myself?
* If not into a mutual fund, should I invest in normal stocks? Or should I skip investing all together and just put my money in a savings fund and forget about it?
* What habits should I start now that will keep me debt-free into my future?

Sorry if that's a bit much, any advice is appreciated!"
7ikjm4,34,2017-12-08,Was Eric (and not Cory) *the* Boy who Met the World all along?,UnwellHiC,boymeetsworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/boymeetsworld/comments/7ikjm4/was_eric_and_not_cory_the_boy_who_met_the_world/,"I think Eric's arc (in seasons 1-4 before the show went off the rails goofy) was the real journey alluded to in the title of a boy who met the world. It was not Cory who met the world. 

Eric was the one who had the journey of a sheltered boy who goes out into the real world, gets defeated, regroups, and succeeds. Meanwhile, Cory never left the cocoon of the school or the safety of the Topanga/Cory relationship for long periods of time. 

In fact, I would argue his desperate need to cling to his high school girlfriend is a perfect microcosm of his sheltered life. Most people who cling to a high school gf/bf tend to be people who are scared to be out in the world without a safety net. 

Early in the series of show (season 1-4) Eric starts off as a superficial preppy boy obsessed with his looks and girls. Didn't care about grades or what he wanted to be. 

As he got to his senior year, it became clear he wasted his potential at that point. He did poorly on the SATs, had no real plan for college or any other path. 

He thought he found a calling as a weather guy, was psyched about his internship, had passion for something for the first time in his life outside of girls/looks..........and then he loses it because he dropped out of high school temporarily around his 18th birthday (one of the best episodes in my opinion). 

He tried to buckle down and to the show's credit he didn't succeed at first. One of the best moments of the show was when you could hear the defeat in his voice ""Who am I kidding, thinking I could goof off for three years and make it to college"". Goes on a road trip and almost gives up....almost. 

Later, gets fired by his own father, gets a job as a security guard, takes the SATs again and does well. It felt like a genuine moment when Alan tells Eric how proud he is. 

The last scene of genuine Eric is when he wakes up Feeny to go over potential schools he can now apply to.....it was a very sweet moment. 

It was Eric who really made a genuine growth as a character. It was Eric who went out into the world and learned the most relatable lessons. Therefore it is my thought that Eric (pre season 5-7 disaster) was indeed the Boy who met the world. 

Agree or disagree? "
7ikwbi,1,2017-12-09,[M4A (playing F/Futa)] Seduced by RoosterTeeth,Nmarshall273,CelebDPP,https://www.reddit.com/r/CelebDPP/comments/7ikwbi/m4a_playing_ffuta_seduced_by_roosterteeth/,"Hey CPP! I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

7ilv8l,102,2017-12-09,Less than minimum wage in an scam business build on the back of interns,throwaway58473857349,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/7ilv8l/less_than_minimum_wage_in_an_scam_business_build/,"Hi guys, I want to share my story about my horrible experience with my new job for the last 3 months. English isn't my first language, so please excuse any mistakes. Maybe this doesn't perfectly fit into this subreddit, but I still want to share it.

Since spring 2017 I was receiving government aid. I was struggling finding a job after an aborted masters program, a considerable gap in my CV and no reference letters from any previous positions. I was (still am) in debt and very desperate for job. Luckily there are very helpful support programs in my country: When you are on government aid, they pay for continued education and training and a job coach, that optimizes your CV and cover letters (those have higher importance in my country than compared to US) with you. So I visited two courses, to improve my English and to learn about project management to open up futher job opportunities.

In August I found a startup consulting firm in my city that where advertising open trainee position in the field of technical project management. This not only fit with my recently concluded training program, but also with the background of my bachelors degree in a technical field. After applying there, they called me back the next day and told me they can't offer me the trainee position, but they would be happy to have me as an intern for 4-5 months and then advance me to the next free trainee position afterwards. I was sceptical, but I couldn't afford to be a choosing beggar and agreed to an interview.

I was interviewed by only one person from the human resource department. In the interview, they mostly presented the company and weren't really interested in my qualifications or cv. They gave me a case study to work on at home and sent back in one week. They would make their hiring deciscion on the case study. I was mostly happy that I could use that to proof my qualification without having to justify my choppy cv. But they also now changed the story and said that the internship can only be for three months for some legal reason (the justification didn't make any sense). But they still said a trainee position after the internship was likely.

Now when they talked about salary, I got really suspicious. They offered a little less than 60% of my countries minimum wage. Additionally they introduced a weird bonus System: For every project one can finish per month, there is an exponentially rising bonus. With one reasonable sounding example the HR-person gave, this turned out to be a very livable wage. Still, this sounded very sketchy. After the interview I looked into my countries labour rights, and the ""legal reason"" why the internship can't be longer than 3 months became obvious: For employments this short, the ""universal"" minimum wage doesn't apply.

Still, I was desperate for any kind of employment, and I gave excuses to myself that I am just overly suspicous. The company was obvioulsy financially very succesful with a huge office on the top floor of one of the most prestigious building complex in the city. Surely their bonus system will turn out to be very generous.

I put a lot of work in the case study. It turned out to be more difficult than expected, but after putting many nights into it I found workable solutions. When sending the case study back to the company, they called me back the next day and sent me an employment contract to sign. After getting only rejections for my CVs for the last months, I was over the moon for a few days. I thought I genuinely impressed them with my case study.

On my first day at the job, it was immediately obvious that 80% of people working there are interns. The company was structured into teams. The team-leaders had proper unlimited contracts, the co-leaders where trainees and the rest of each team (4-10 people) were interns. Most interns were actually compulsory interns (I don't know what the proper translation into English would be). They are currently pursuing a university degree and have to absolve an internship for one semester. They have even less protection under our labour law than regular interns. They can get payed less than minimum wage for their whole 5-6 months employment and they don't get any PTO (I had 5 days PTO in my 3 months, according to my contract). The turnover rate at the company is just a few months (because internships don't last longer than that). After figuring those things out, I assumed all the talk about getting into a trainee position after the internship was bullshit anyway and started searching for another job. But I still wanted to complete the internship, because a proper reference to use for future applications was worth more than gold at that point (for me at least).

The actual work at the company turned out to be even worse than the paycheck: While a consulting firm for technical project management at the surface, it is really a business to scam the government out of subsidies while fucking over small companies at the same time. In my country there is a subsidy programm for small and medium sized companies (&lt; 500 employed people) to receive development funds to develop and introduce innovative products on the market. The government carries half of the development costs (up to the equivalent of  approximately half a million $) if the product is truly something new on the market. It is supposed to stimulate the economy and help small companies to compete with big corporations on development projects. Some interns had the job to blind call companies to ask if they have any product development plans for the near future that could be helped by with subsidies. Usually small companies are eager for these subsidies, because they would develop their products anyway. So they sign a contract with our company to handle all the application forms and bureaucracy, while they can just focus on the actual technical aspects of product development. If the government approves the application, they pay between 10% to 15% of the received subsidies to our company. If the application gets denied, they don't have to pay us anything. So it sounds like there is no risk at all for the customer and they sign the contract with us. The interns who make those blind calls receive a bonus based on how many contracts they can sign with customers per month. Logically, they then don't care about the actual inovative value of the product development the customer is planing, they get mostly contracts for product developments that are nothing really new on the market and honestly don't deserve subsidies at all. Think: ""Let's develop a lawn-mower that is 5% wider than usual."" 

Another team of interns (the one I was part of) had the task to write the subsidy application for those non-innovative products. This included among dozens of pages of forms a ca. 40 page long description of the planed project. To give the customer even a remote change of receiving subsidies, we basically hat to invent ""good"" sounding ideas and include them in the product development to make them appear more innovative. Think: ""Let's attach a laser and radar system as well as drone controlled by neural networks to the lawn-mower. This will make it easier to avoid molehills. Because none of us where experts and new anything about the actual planed product, we were bullshitting on a ridiculous level. Because our bonus was dependent on the number of subsidy applications we can write each month, there also was a huge pressure on quantity over quality.

Here is how we fucked the customer over: Our job was also to maximize the suppsidy amount as much as possible: Even if a product development would just take 50.000 $, we would add so much bullshit to it that the costs of developing that all baloon up to the maximum the government is inclined to support. And the government is only subsidizing half the development costs. The other half has to be carried by the customer itself. So we were pushing our own customers (sometimes small companies with less than 10 people) into commiting to hugely expensive bullshit projects that don't actually have any thought put into them. Those small companies often are family led and don't have the expertise or forsight to get out of the contract we made them sign. They are forced to commit to invest the majority of their income into something they thought would just be a small side project. This sometimes drives them into bankruptcy. 

Because our subsidy applications were mostly bullshit, a majority of them wasn't approved. (We send them to the government in our customers name, so the officials don't know it is coming from us.). But just a small part of them have to be approved to make a profit for our company.

The whole business model sounds highly unethical. But the company is making sure that everything stays barely legal. But obviously it is a scam that is leeching of an regulatory oversight that needs to be closed as soon as possible.

There is a third team of interns, that is tasked with hiring interns. Because of the high turnover rate, they are spaming job offers everywhere, promising good career opportunities and attractive pay. They get their Bonus based on how many interns they can hire each month. There is at least one person visiting per day for an interview and regulary new people every two weeks to replace the interns that leave. 

All the bonus payments are designed in a way that makes them see highly attraktive (because of their exponential nature), but in reality everybody is struggling to even reach the minimum that is required to get any bonus at all. In my three months there, I received approximately 200 $ bonus overall.

The contract specifies 40 hours per week. But we aren't payed by the hour and there is no system in place to track overtime. Most people have lost track of all the overtime they are doing to desperately reach at least the minimum requrements for a bonus. 

There are flexible hours with a core time window where everybody has to be there. In a reasonable company the core time window would probably be from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. That way early birds could start at 6:00 and leave early while others can sleep as long as they want and work until later in the evening. But in this company the core time is from 9:15 to 17:00, giving basically no flexibility. I would love to come their early and have much of the afternoon for myself, but the promise of flexible hours is just another empty promise to make the job sound more appealing in the interview stage.

My teamleader is actually upset, that I take my pto days off. According to him it is disloyal to my coworkers because the compulsary interns don't get any pto and get envious. By the way, the PTO they are giving me is the minimum legal requirement they have to give me.

While working there, I managed to line up a much better job offer, starting immediately after my internship ends. It is a fixed position with a small but established and solid company. I then talked to my teamleader about the projects I won't be able to finish before I leave. He was shocked that my internship was over so fast and quickly made me an offer to continue as trainee immediately. This time they even were so generous to offer a little over minimum wage!!! /s This made me realize that they actually are desperate to keep their interns working there in a fixed position, but they are completely failing at it because they make the job so unattractive. The boss and my teamleader pulled my into their office and asked why I don't want to continue working there, that they are struggling to keep their good employees 

TLDR: Company is hiring only interns for cheap and exploitable labour. Their business model is scamming the government out of development subsidies and driving family owned businesses into bankruptcy. "

**Lessons learned**

Don't do this! It was fun in the beginning but it became a chore near the end. Sometimes you feel like doing something else than watching a movie, but you don't because you 'have to reach your quota'. You're watching movies based on quantity, not quality. You're gonna prefer watching two short shitty movies than one long good one.

Learn from my mistake. Don't do this."
7in7y3,26,2017-12-09,Getting engaged. Fiancee has 102k in student debt. I'm a veteran in college. I need a plan.,redwingpanda,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7in7y3/getting_engaged_fiancee_has_102k_in_student_debt/,"Well, it's how it sounds. This isn't a surprise, I've known about her debt since about ten days into dating. We've been very upfront about our financial situations. She's a high school teacher who's teaching internationally right now, I'm former military and in my second year of college at a top-tier private school. 

We're getting engaged this summer when she's home, and probably doing a domestic partnership so that we have some form of legal standing in case of emergencies (we've run into this issue twice now). Wedding will wait until after I graduate. We'll be meeting with a CPA during the summer before signing any legal documentation, because taxes are going to be a bitch. 

RE: GI Bill... 
I'm on a full ride here. I'm waiting for the last two years of school/if I go straight to an MBA program/when I go to grad school. My monthly stipend would be about $900 a month here, and $1,500 a month where I want to get my MBA. That difference + full ride = not touching it. 

I have about 20k in student debt from community college, and my sights set on consulting. My credit is not great, hers is absolutely brilliant. I have 4.5k in savings, she has 7k. I have $500 more in credit card debt than I have in savings, but just did a balance transfer to a 0% APR/1 year card with a lower overall interest rate, and am on track to pay that off within the year. We go over YNAB together with Google Hangouts, and there are no illusions about where we both are financially. 

I'd like to see her in a position to pay off her debt, she's currently paying half of her monthly salary to loans. She is torn between resigned to paying this forever, and wanting it gone. I know that when I graduate, I'll be on track to make more than her in a very short period of time. 

I'd like to see her pay these off. I also want to pay my debt off. My current thoughts on this:

* 1) Work on paying my debt off, once it's gone, start saving that same amount with intent to pay on her loans eventually. Worst case scenario for our marriage, I have a large savings account. 
* 1a) She's told me she doesn't want my money. She refuses to let me put myself financially out of sorts for her in any way. I would have to save the money, and then tell her about it. 
* 2) Ask to divide household expenses by income and debts, so that she can continue to make payments on more than interest. We've discussed this, but are not sure how to best do this while I'm in school (she comes back my senior year).
* 3) Miraculously have a windfall from a grandparent, which is more likely than the other option -- become rich on crypto (I have some crypto, I've held it for quite a while, but it'll take a miracle for it to become worth 120k after taxes haha).
* 4) We also need to save for retirement. I have about 4k in a 401k and 5k in a ROTH IRA. She has a pension from teaching domestically, but currently isn't contributing to it because she's overseas. 

I also have to decide if I'm going straight from undergrad to an MBA program, or if I'm going to try and work for a year or two. My GI Bill will pay for most of MBA program at any one of the top business schools, plus the living stipend. If I get an associate's position at a consulting firm, I'm looking at a starting salary around 65k. If I get an MBA first (getting in to the top three without a firm sending you is almost impossible), that starting salary is up to around 140k. This is not including benefits and possible bonuses, etc. 

I make $11.75 an hour and work 10 hours a week. I've saved enough money to go on my first vacation ever this Christmas, and it's completely paid for. I started school with literally $5 to my name, and now have around $4,500. I get a monthly disability payment that covers my bills, I've paid down a lot of debt with that $11.75 an hour. Essentially my life is in a holding pattern, though, until summer internships roll around. I used most of my income last summer to pay off a loan and paid down two credit cards, I've since paid them off. 

So my question is, how and where do I start to make a plan? How do we make a plan? "
7inc98,3,2017-12-09,Need Suggestions.,DarkHoody,Schizoid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/7inc98/need_suggestions/,"I don't know how to begin so I'll just start writing and fill in as needed.

So my family(mother, father &amp; sister) think that I'm a lazy twat who just wants to live on what they've left for me. I can't blame them, it does look like it and I am a bit lazy. I can't talk to people, I don't go outside or do anything really. They say that I don't put effort in doing anything. Again I don't blame them. I do want to change and be able to do things but I don't know I just can't seem to do anything.

I tried to explain that I have SPD and well it just sounds like excuses to them and to some extent to me as well. The relationship has become very tense atm, if it were someone else I wouldn't have cared.

I don't really know what to do and how to get better. I just want to tell them that I'm not lazy and worthless. Talking and explaining won't help, the only way I can do that is by showing them.

It's a bit difficult, I hate cities it's so crowded, too many people.
At times I think about doing things but after a few minutes I just loose all the drive and interest. I can't even play games for more than an hour or read books. I just hate everything and myself the most.

A friend of mine is starting up his own company and he'll give me some work I won't get paid in the beginning but I won't have to spend money on food and house.

I don't want to fail again, about a year ago I used to work, I worked at 3 places, one was a 2 month internship, I quit from one and was fired from other. I haven't worked for the past 1 year. I need suggestion on how to keep myself motivated so I can work.

I live in India, it's an overpopulated country living in a quite place away from people will be difficult; getting job in such places will be even more difficult. Always living in my room is frustrating, so is going out. Too many people, not an inch of space between buildings, too many vehicles, too much noise.

I need a little help. If there's any information or detail you want to know, just ask."
7indf1,1,2017-12-09,"[M4F] Seeking Writers Who Play Internet Celebrities [ShoeonHead, Suzy Berhow, + More)",LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7indf1/m4f_seeking_writers_who_play_internet_celebrities/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7ino10,21,2017-12-09,The Lonely Freak Delusion - [Ff][inc],blinkern,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/7ino10/the_lonely_freak_delusion_ffinc/,"I can almost guarantee that every adult you know is operating under the same basic misunderstanding. Let's call it the Lonely-Freak Delusion. All of them, your boss, your parents, your friends, share this delusion: they all think that *they* are uniquely, or at least unusually, messed up, while everyone else has got their shit together. 

This conclusion is so obvious, so natural, that it takes concerted effort and training to overcome it. Everyone you know is fucked up, just as much as you, and yet they *all* think that everyone else has their ducks in a row.

Let me show you: here is the subway and here comes the train, kicking up little puffs of dust in its wake. The doors slide open and we glide silently into the carriage. It's late on a Saturday afternoon and most of the seats are vacant. This is George. He is 37 and works in the building trade. He wants, more than anything, to share his wife of ten years with another man. Sometimes he thinks of particular men: his boss, his best friend, his father, but mostly the men are faceless. Just cocks with which to ravage and degrade Jenny, his wife and his best friend in the whole world.

On the other side of the carriage, next to an abandoned Happy Meal, is Martha. She sat in this same carriage six weeks ago, reading 50 Shades of Grey, and was so helplessly aroused that she frigged herself to orgasm on the empty daytime subway, with only an elderly gentleman in the next carriage to bear witness. For his part, he has thought of nothing else ever since, and racks his brain for ways to find her again - this 47 year old Goddess, with the sagging breasts and flabby thighs, this avatar of sensuality that visited him, one Thursday, between Prospect and Union.

Here is Amos, an accountant, 29, on his way back from a client meeting uptown. Amos's secret is this: after a meeting, when everyone else has left, Amos walks furtively over to the seat where you sat in your pant suit, or your pencil skirt, and he kneels down and sniffs the seat pad. The warmth of your recently departed bottom, and the faint (imagined) odour of your vagina will sustain him later through marathon masturbation sessions.

We'll skip over Tariq, because, quite frankly, the less said the better.

Under the burka, four seats along, sits Aaliya. She would have been a classic beauty but for the accident of biology that gave her a cleft palate. Her surgeries were successful but left her with deep scars that cause her to feel a profound and irrational shame. Her body, below the billowing black robe, is perfect, ample and taut, a teenage wet dream. When alone at night Aaliya, undersexed by her neurotic husband, plunges three fingers into her wet pussy and thinks about the neighbour's doberman.

Lastly, Miriam. 53 year old Miriam, dressed in her respectable three-piece lemon yellow suit, with the skirt that comes below the knee and the blouse buttoned up to the chin; Miriam in her sheitel and her sensible flat shoes, right at this very moment, is thinking about Hilary Rodham Clinton. She's imagining how Mrs Clinton, fresh from a tub-thumping stump speech, exhilarated by applause and public fervour, would seize Miriam - aged 23, a political intern of uncertain duties - and bend her over the richly engraved walnut desk to fuck her mercilessly with a nine-inch black strap-on. Her fantasies lose coherence around the time that Hilary pulls out from Miriam's dripping pussy and produces a packet of Cuban cigars. Miriam has more self-control than Martha and, though she feels a heated dampness growing between her legs, does not frig herself in front of her fellow passengers, but is contented instead by squeezing together her thighs and guiltily enjoying a warm throb of muted pleasure.

Miriam has been plagued by these fantasies for months and has spoken of them, in oblique terms, to her Rabbi who does *not* share the delusion that only he is messed up, and has listened sympathetically, and advised her that all marriages ebb and rise with the tides of the moon and the factors of daily life and the broader socio-economic environment, and that she should be happy with her lot - a loving husband and two fine children who are a credit to their community.

Tonight, though, Miriam is going to shock herself, and you, and this is how it will happen: in a few minutes time, just another few stops to go, Miriam will exit the train, look quickly around herself, and walk to her apartment. There she will remove her sheitel and kick off her shoes before pouring a glass of wine. She will wonder whether to order takeout but decide, for the sake of the household budget, that she is fine with the leftovers from the other night, especially because there is ice cream in the freezer. Miriam adores ice cream.

She will remember, with a girlish delight, that she can watch RuPaul this evening because her husband is away on business, and she will busy herself with preparing the leftovers and washing some dishes when her phone will ring. She will make her way to the phone, shaking suds from her fingers, and pick up with a ""Hello?"" that speaks of her displeasure at having this cozy moment disturbed, but her reticence will be replaced with joy when her daughter, Sarah, answers, ""Hi Mom.""

Sarah has had a bad day, you see. This morning - it will later transpire - she argued with her husband, David over whose turn it might be to empty the bins, but the argument has escalated, and the question of the bins has risen to assume a terrible significance as a kind of Rosetta stone by which to understand the failings of their marriage, and  - in particular - David's continued underperformance as a bread-winner and provider of affection. As the day wore grimly on, doors were slammed, plates were smashed, and things have been said by both parties that perhaps oughtn't to have been said, and certainly weren't meant, not really, not in their heart of hearts.

David has left. He has stormed angrily from the brownstone and out into the chill December air, and so Sarah will turn to her mother - her once and always source of comfort and safety and refuge. She will make her way across town, on the very same subway full of freaks, and she will arrive at Miriam's apartment and Miriam will behave *exactly* as you would imagine a Jewish mother to behave in these circumstances, and after tears and sympathy and recriminations, the two women will feel better about themselves and start to drink wine.

Perhaps because they are both, in some sense, dissatisfied with their respective lots, they will drink more wine than they intended, and Miriam will forego Rupaul's Drag Race in order to watch Bad Moms with her daughter, which both women will find *impossibly* hilarious and the laughter will beget happiness, and the happiness will beget drinking, and the drinking will beget laughter until they are simply overflowing with hilarity and joy and a sense of the deep, rich closeness of their maternal-filial bond.

At some point their conversation will turn to men, and - encouraged by the wine - they will talk of things that tightly-buttoned Jewish ladies do not normally discuss with their mothers and daughters, and they will compare notes on their husbands' sexual performances and they will roar with laughter and relief to know that they are not alone in their sense of having missed a connection, of other possibilities in lives not lived.

Sarah will confess that she is the proud owner of three vibrators, and that her favourite - a recent Lelo model - is so powerfully effective that she must hold her pillow between her teeth when she uses it, so as not to distress the neighbours. Miriam will then make her confession: her secret shameful desires on Hilary Rodham Clinton and her cigars and her strap-on, and she will admit to her gluttonous consumption of lezdom pornography. Sarah, for her part will find this admission *so* unbelievable that Miriam, hopelessly drunk and happy, will offer to show her a selection of her favourites and so the two women find themselves sat on the couch, giggling and snuggled up together, with the PornHub logo shining brightly from the television.

Miriam will choose a video that she has watched many times, it's a classic scene where Nina Hartley dominates Rachel Steele. If you haven't seen it, you should go and do so right now, it's good, you'll like it, I promise. 

At first Miriam and Sarah giggle like schoolgirls at the obvious fakeness of the setup and the two porn stars' incredible reactions to one another; the clear unreality of the situation in which they find themselves, but then a peculiar thing happens. As Nina begins to seduce Rachel, it occurs to both watchers simultaneously that what they're doing is capital-W Wrong, and a sense of panic overcomes them, but the lonely-freak delusion kicks in, and neither woman feels able to articulate, without alarming the other, that what they're doing - drunkenly watching lesbian dominance/submission porn together - is, while legally and technically innocent, a close neighbour of something that looks and smells a whole lot like incest.

Since Miriam remains silent, Sarah will assume that only she is disturbed by these darkly intimate thoughts of illicit lesbianism, and will say nothing so that Miriam, in turn, assumes that she is the only one depraved enough to be aware of this sick, wicked framing of their blameless circumstance.

In fact it is this very blamelessness, juxtaposed against their mutual fear of less charitable interpretation, that will keep the two women rooted to the spot, essentially paralysed by their own moral compasses, which - of course - is a problem: the video is a modern classic for the very simple reason that it is fucking _hot_, and so the shame and fear felt by our heroines will, moments later, be joined by a steadily growing arousal.

This miasma, this cauldron of eroticism, shame, and pre-existing sexual frustration will simmer away in silence, and the longer Miriam and Sarah sit together, the hornier they will become, and the more implausible it will seem that they could say ""Hey, this is pretty messed up right here, a bit incestuous. We should stop at this point."" In fact, the shared awareness of carnal impropriety only intensifies their arousal, and the unthinkable thoughts - the dark fantasies of lesbian incest that they so quickly put out of their minds - become continual and intrusive desires. Miriam thinks longingly of her daughter's warm mouth suckling at her hardening nipples, while Sarah can't help but imagine, alternately, her mother and Hilary Rodham Clinton, dressed in shining red latex, furiously pegging her, Sarah, with an improbably large cock.

Five minutes into the video, Nina grabs Rachel by the hair and leads her with a gentle forcefulness to the bedroom. Miriam's hand seeks out her daughter's hair and strokes it soothingly. Sarah rests her head on her mother's shoulder, no longer giggling, as Nina - in a career defining tour de force - undresses a reluctant Rachel, stripping her of her blouse and her natural chastity before kissing her hungrily on the lips. Her hand seeks Rachel's crotch through her underwear and Rachel swiftly succumbs to her arousal, moaning despite herself.

Sarah, reminded suddenly of teenaged indiscretions begins to wonder just how her mother would taste, whether her pussy would be sweet, how her juices would feel on her tongue. Without conscious oversight, her hand seeks Miriam's and their fingers intertwine as the buxom women on screen begin to groan and push into one another, Rachel's mouth on Nina's full breast while Nina grinds her thigh into Rachel's overheated cunt. It is, by now, completely impossible to discuss what is happening. It is simply too shaming and too, too erotic for words.

Miriam kisses her daughter's hair and strokes her neck, lets her fingers play over her shoulder blades while Nina is squeezing and grabbing Rachel's pussy. She rides Rachel's face, rubbing her clitoris into Rachel's mouth while reaching back to abuse her labia. Her fingers push deep inside over and over while the camera lingers on Rachel, her eyes closed, sensuously kissing Nina's engorged pussy.

Fifteen minutes into the video Nina is sucking on Rachel's clitoris, and rubbing her G-spot when Sarah lifts her head up from her mother's shoulder and looks into her eyes. Both of them are agonisingly aware of their own arousal, and the shock of recognition, of the heat reflected back from each other's eyes, makes them both shiver. Their lips meet for the first time at exactly the moment that Nina begins to lick and finger Rachel's asshole while diddling herself furiously, and at that point - quite honestly - it's all over. Tongues and hands fly, high-necked blouses are doffed, and orthodox sensibilities are forgotten.

Miriam's first delicious taste of Sarah's wet hole occurs at 24 minutes and 31 seconds into the scene, while Nina is massaging Rachel's cunt lips, stretching and probing them, while spanking her soft, warm buttocks. By the time that the video comes to an end - unheeded by its audience - Miriam's tongue will have wormed its way deep into her daughter's vaginal canal and will be busily stroking her g-spot while her hands are furiously working her own pudenda.

The train comes to a stop and Miriam disembarks. She looks around herself quickly and heads for the exit, still without any inkling of what's in store for her. She is immediately replaced by a new passenger. Here is Peter, charming, clever Peter whose dissertation on Henry James' ""The Europeans"", recently finished, moved his spinsterish English professor to quiet tears in her office. Peter takes secret photographs of probably-legal teenage girls on his smartphone, looks at them only once, and deletes them again. He feels a crippling sense of shame about this activity, which makes it impossible for him to approach an actual adult woman despite his striking looks and his sparkling wit. This perpetuates a cycle in which he seeks gratification through shameful shuffling and candid snaps. He sits in the seat where Miriam sat only moments before (Amos pulls a grimace of disappointment at this) the doors sighingly shut and the train whisks them all off into the darkness."
7inotm,1,2017-12-09,"[M4f] Looking for a long term chat/rp partner. Details, ideas, and more inside.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7inotm/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood morning DPP. My name is Jeremy and as the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

7iogbp,3,2017-12-09,Help me understanding the ESFJ that changed my life,Forna15,ESFJ,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/7iogbp/help_me_understanding_the_esfj_that_changed_my/,"Hello fellas, 

I'm gonna explain briefly my situation.

I'm an ENTP dude that used to go from women to women and never be serious about anything.
Two years ago I met that person, I instantly felt that she would be special for me.
I kept waiting for her an entire year but she had someone for a long time. 
After a year and being in the same uni then afterwards in the same class, she was free and within two months we were together.

The beginning was really great, I did not know how to act properly because it was my first time being serious (btw I'm 23 now and she is 20), but we managed it.
After a few months she started complaining that I was ""distant"", not seeing her enough and stuff. 
Of course as dumb entp I was acting like she was crazy and all but ..
Eventually I had to deal with hardships in private life, I failed a internship that was important to me, and both my grandparents nearly died.
Of course she knew about it but I acted like it was not much of a deal.
After 6 months, seeing her sad because of my evasiveness and distance, I decided to propose her to break up.

Eventually I got better after a month, I realised that I had gone through quite a big depression phase during 3-4 months.

But I had already damaged our relation, she thought I didn't care and let her go instead of letting her in my life.
So I chased her from Late april to august.

To the world and me, she said it was over, she did not know why but it was, but at the same time, she always said ""I don't want you completely out of my life"".
and a common friend of us whom she used to speak to told me she was clearly hesitating.

End of august I caught her with a dude, it would not have been a problem since I'm a civilised man, but it was someone I hated for years, she did not know about it but shit began.

We were really mean to each other, I brought her every presents or little words I had of her then after an alcoolised night, I ended up beating the shit ouf of that man.

In the end we never spoke again from september till recently, but they never were together.
Since september we are in the same class, she hangs with a dear friend of mine, one day of that month he phoned me asking loudly why I did not bang some random chick I talked to him about, she heard him and went to him saying ""I can't believe he told me I was important for him all these months and now he's off fucking random girls""

Then we went in a one month internship, since september I did alot of work on myself, not only for my clothes style and stuff but also my mind, I'm trying to become the man she saw in me and wanted me to be.

So I wrote her a letter, sayin that she changed my life forever and that I would always be thankful for that and other stuff.
I gave it to her and tuesday she came to me asking to talk, she told me a bunch of things that I can resume in : 

- She did not want me to hope for nothing but it calmed her alot
-She """"nearly"""" felt happy about it 
- She has a new boyfriend ( I already knew) 
- She received two months ago a very late gift of mine, she wanted to give it back to me, I said I can't force you but I can't take it back, throw it away if it's impossible for you to keep it, she answered ""No I won't throw it away.. That's why I wanted to give it back to you but ..""
- She wanted us to stop ignoring each other and greet once again.

So, of course me becoming another person is first for myself before than being for her, and I should let go, but even when I try, no other women gives me the vibe she used and still gives to me.
So, it may be childish and dumb and nearly impossible. But now that I have break the shell of her late hatred towards me, I want to keep improve and try to make her being attracted to me again, I could go to any girls it's not a problem for me, but she really is special for my heart.

So.. any advices on how to get in her high esteem again ? "
7ip58g,219,2017-12-09,Me (19F) uncomfortable with my roommate (19F) because of new information coming to light about how she’s acted while we’ve lived together,collegetimethrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ip58g/me_19f_uncomfortable_with_my_roommate_19f_because/,"This is going to be a long post, sorry!
Using a throwaway because she does sometimes use reddit and I don’t know if she frequents this sub.

I am a college sophomore living in an on-campus dorm building. Last year, I had a great relationship with my roommate. We’ll call her Brittany. We didn’t argue the entire year, respected each other’s privacy, and used each other to vent about things without judgement. We were going to live together this year. Brittany joined a sorority and ended up getting a last-minute opportunity to move into the sorority house to save money, which she took (I didn’t have any problem with this, there’s no ill will between the two of us and I still talk to Brittany all the time). However, this did leave me with a predicament. I had to find someone else to move into our double with me, or I would get stuck with a random roommate. This may work for some people at other schools, but at my college, going random has a reputation for turning into disaster, mostly because it’s such a large campus that if you don’t have someone you can room with and have to be a random, chances are there’s a reason (you’re messy, rude, etc. etc.). I took to my class’s Facebook page, and found my current roommate. We will be calling her Molly. Molly seemed nice, she agreed with all the basic stuff that I wanted in a roommate (not looking to smoke/party in the room, had a similar sleep schedule to mine, etc.) and two days before room assignments closed, she officially “jumped into” the empty spot in my room.
We’ve lived together now for almost an entire semester. Things were awkward at the beginning as we didn’t have the time to meet face to face before living together, but I thought that overall it was going great. From my point of view, it seemed like we were developing a relationship that was similar to the one that I had with my roommate from last year, which I was happy about. Until last night.
I was hanging out with one of my other friends in a ground-floor lounge in our building. We’ll call this friend Danielle. Danielle and I were sitting and talking when Molly came around the corner of the lobby (the lounge is all glass so you can see people entering and exiting our building via the lobby, which shares a wall with the lounge). We both waved at her. Danielle looked at me funny and asked why I waved at her. I explained that she was my roommate this year, and told her the story of how we became roommates. She said, “oh. I didn’t know that....” I haven’t known Danielle long but I could tell something was up, and after minimal prodding, Danielle told me the whole story. Apparently, Molly has a finsta that she uses to complain about stuff in her day to day life, kind of like a semi-public diary (she gets to decide who can see her posts on this account). I didn’t know about this finsta, but Danielle had been part of a group in one of their shared classes last year, and knows her well enough that Molly let her follow her account and see her posts. Danielle had seen a couple posts on the finsta about how Molly’s roommate was getting on her nerves. Danielle didn’t tell me about these posts because she didn’t know I was the roommate until last night (when this happened). This did hurt a little bit, but I figured it was alright, she just needed to vent. But when Danielle showed me the posts involving me, it was a little more than that.
A little background: My major is in the college of social sciences, whereas Molly is double majoring in two deeply-STEM fields. She is also trying to go to med school and graduate undergrad at least a year early, so she takes 20+ credits a semester. I knew all of this. She had always seemed vaguely judgey of how much work I had to do (15 credits worth of classes, on track to graduate in 4 years), versus her workload of 24 credits worth of classes/labs plus a highly involved internship with a lab on campus, and a schedule of regularly volunteering/working in the pediatric ICU at the hospital near our college, all in one semester (on track to graduate halfway through junior year with plenty of padding for her resume and med school applications), but she is very busy, and I have always been understanding of this.
A couple months ago I had entered a contest to win a free 500 dollar gift card for one of my favorite stores. I was excited about it, and admittedly, I did talk about it a lot with her when it was just the two of us in the room. However, the reaction she had had to my face, versus the one she had on her finsta, was like night and day. To my face, she was super excited for me. I even asked if I was talking about it too much, to which her response was “no of course not! I can tell you’re excited about this!” Here is a copy and paste, with any personal/identifying details taken out, of what she wrote on her finsta:
“My roommate is talking about how stressed she is over this contest to win $500 at *favorite store*. I’m like, b$$$$ I have had three exams and two quizzes this week, the fact that you even consider yourself stressed is laughable to me. I low key wanna follow the contest and beat her to it, just so I can f$$$ up her day and make her realize this is nothing compared to what I have to deal with on a daily basis. If you wanna help me f$$$ with her, the link to the contest is in my bio. Good luck!”
Obviously, reading this startled me. I considered us pleasant acquaintances at the very least, and I had been considering asking her if she wanted to live with me for our junior year (her last year) next fall. As far as I know, I have done nothing to her that would justify this kind of hatred, and she hasn’t ever asked me to stop any of my behaviors or anything like that. I am completely blown away now, and am obviously not looking to room with her anymore. She told me when we were talking during the summer that she was bi-polar, and had a personality disorder, but I figured it wouldn’t be a huge deal. I am now a little worried that she would actually mess with me in other ways, including academically, just to “f$$$ up my day” and “make me realize that what I do is nothing compared to her”. Am I overreacting? I have already arranged a meeting with my RA, without my roommate, just to make her aware of these posts, so that there is a paper trail of these “threats” (I don’t know if that’s what they should be considered but I don’t know what else to call them). Danielle also told me that she had my back if anything happened, and she sent me screenshots of all of the posts pertaining to me, which included time stamps and Molly’s username, which show that she was the one making these posts and when they were made. I have also sent the screenshots to my boyfriend’s phone for safekeeping, just in case (I’m an anxious planner, can you tell?) I guess I’m looking for any advice, words of wisdom, or even just a validation that I’m doing the right thing. 

TL;DR: my roommate, who I have never had problems with before, has made vague threat-like posts about me on her private finsta account. Am I overreacting, and what should I do next?

Edit: I am not saying that her mental disorders have anything to do with this, I just don’t know if those disorders make it more likely for her to actually try to “f$$$ up my day” rather than JUST talking about it. I don’t believe that having mental disorders automatically mean you’re a bad person."
7ipcfs,19,2017-12-09,Could I get in trouble with DOH for doing stand up comedy or having a podcast?,iamanis,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/7ipcfs/could_i_get_in_trouble_with_doh_for_doing_stand/,"Hey all

I'm not sure if anyone here can answer this, but I thought I'd give it a try.  I used to do stand up comedy in college/grad school.  I stopped doing it when I became a counselor and started my internship.  I became afraid of clients seeing me do stand up, follow me on social media (which did happen so I deleted social media), or my biggest fear which is reporting me to the Department of Health for doing material that was offensive.  I was NOT a clean comedian.  I would also want to start a podcast to help promote my practice, and part of that would be talking with local artists and comedians.  So this podcast would NOT be clean.  

I guess I'm just curious if I should be concerned about doing stand up or a podcast, or if I'm just nervous about nothing here.  Could I do my creative expression without fearing someone filing a complaint with the DOH and my license being revoked?

Thank you"

7iq98x,1,2017-12-09,During the Play 'Death of A Salesman' I Was Sexually Harassed By Dustin Hoffman Night After Night - by Kathryn Rossetter (Hollywood Reporter) 8 Dec 2017,FinnagainsAwake,WomenLiberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenLiberation/comments/7iq98x/during_the_play_death_of_a_salesman_i_was/,"In 1983, I was an aspiring actress in New York City. I did not have the privilege of going to Yale or Juilliard. I studied privately and pounded the pavement trying to get work. I had little-to-no real experience (other than one show) when I submitted my picture and resume in the hopes of securing an audition for a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman, starring Dustin Hoffman. I had played Maggie in After the Fall, also written by Arthur Miller. Miller had come to see it and was highly complimentary of my work, so I took a chance that he might take notice of my submission.

A miracle! I was being called in to read for Willy Loman’s mistress, ""the Woman In Boston."" I was much too young but felt the opportunity alone was the reward so I prepared and went. To my surprise, Dustin was reading with everyone. I was the last actress to read. He was silly and fun, and we did the scene and I laughed and he went crazy. “I love that laugh. I want her, I want her!” I couldn’t believe my ears. The director felt I was far too young and wanted another actress. Final callbacks were four days later. Dustin told me to get a wig and age makeup and to look older when I came back. The night before my final audition, he called me and said he and his makeup artist were coming to my apartment to get me ready. I was astounded. It was a little bizarre. She stuffed towels into a body stocking so I would look fatter, did my wig and aged me. Frankly, I looked like Tootsie. Thus, I went to the callback the next day.

After my turn, I was released. A half-hour later I got a call saying I needed to hurry back to the theater. I did, wig in hand. All the other actresses were gone. I had to read again. They openly argued about me in front of me. They made me take off my dress so the producer and director could see me stuffed with towels in my body stocking. Then there was another hushed meeting of the men and they offered me the job — if I would gain 12 pounds. I was dumbstruck. I was going to be on Broadway in one of the most iconic revivals of the time. Dustin took me to his home for dinner to meet his wife and called my mother to tell her I was going to be on Broadway. The whole experience was overwhelming. He was my hero.

Three days later, during the first week of rehearsals, he took me to lunch. Walking back to rehearsal, he said he had to stop by his hotel room to pick up something he forgot. I asked, ""Why a hotel room?"" He only lived a little over a mile away. He said so he could take naps at lunch, if needed, and when they were working on scenes he wasn’t in he could go there and relax and study his lines.

When we stepped into the room, he jumped on the bed and said, ""Give me a back rub."" He pulled off his shirt. I didn’t know what to do. I said we had to be back at rehearsal in 15 minutes. He said, ""Just a quickie."" I was a nervous wreck, but sat on the bed and gave a very lame rub. The maid walked in and I almost fainted. He laughed. As we prepared to leave, he looked at me and said, “Now we have our 'hotel room.'” Ah, I thought — Method Acting! I was his mistress and our scenes were set in a hotel room and Biff walks in. He told me to return to rehearsal a few minutes after he did and left me there.

That was the beginning of what was to become a horrific, demoralizing and abusive experience at the hands (literally) of one of my acting idols.

Since they loved my laugh, it was decided that I would stand in the wings on stage left at a mic and laugh on cue in a memory scene being played out on the stage. My laugh had to be choreographed and timed. That scene led directly into the scene in the second act with Dustin and me in the hotel room and Biff walking in on us. My costume was a vintage slip, no bra, garter belt and stockings. The wing space was limited, so directly behind me was a chair where Dustin would sit, with his dresser in attendance, to take water and a short rest before our final scene together. 

One night in Chicago, I felt his hand up under my slip on the inside of my thighs. I was completely surprised and tried to bat him away while watching the stage for my cues. After the show he was busy with the producer and director so I had no access to him to address it. It then happened almost every show. Six to eight shows a week. I couldn’t speak to him in the moment because I was on a live mic. He kept it up and got more and more aggressive. One night he actually started to stick his fingers inside me. Night after night I went home and cried. I withdrew and got depressed and did not have any good interpersonal relationships with the cast. How could the same man who fought to get me the job, who complimented my work, who essentially launched my career, who gave me the benefit of his wisdom as an actor, how could he also be this sexual power abuser? Was I doing something? Was it my fault?

The groping continued. After the shows at parties, whenever he had a picture taken with me, he would put his arm around my rib cage and then grab my breast just before they snapped the picture and then remove it. He was very skilled at dropping his hand just as the picture snapped to avoid it being recorded. But it was pre-digital. You didn’t know what was there until they were developed. Only by luck do I have one such picture — where the camera caught him in the act. A picture I had taken with hopes of sending it to my family. A millisecond in time. There I am — big smile and my arm moving toward his with the intention to push it away. But caught as it is, it seems I’m complicit with the gesture. I was not. Not ever.

Everyone around always laughed when he did this. Does that make him just a jokester? Or is he extremely smart choosing when and how to pursue his actions? Everyone standing around laughing worked for him. He gave us gifts, paid for parties. Bait and switch.

I have a quick wit and my humor is my first line of defense. It’s how I survive. I tried everything to get him to stop. I tried to laugh it off, smack him and say witty, pointed things. I begged him nicely with tears in my eyes to please stop it. To no avail.

His dresser came to me during the show one night. Dustin wanted to see me in an offstage dressing room where he rested while the scene in the kitchen with mom and the boys took place. I thought he wanted to give me a note on our first scene. But he wanted me to rub his feet. Get on my knees and rub his feet. I froze. I gave a little foot rub and ran out. His dresser would then continue to come get me whenever Dustin felt like it.  Whenever possible, I hid and tried not to be found. But the boss was relentless. Dustin would whisper, “higher, higher,” trying to get me to move up his pants legs toward his genitals. I didn’t do it. I would stop at his calves. I understand how women say they just go inside themselves to another place as a form of protection, to distance themselves from the abuse. I felt trapped. We were just a few feet from the stage and I couldn’t say anything for fear it would be heard on stage or in the audience. His dresser stood guard outside the door.

Then one night I was in my position at the mic preparing for my laughing scene. Dustin arrived and took his seat behind me. There was an unusual number of the crew backstage that night — men who were not needed until intermission or the end of the show. Dustin started his grope. I started my batting him away and laughing on cue. Suddenly he grabs the bottom of my slip and pulls it up over my head, exposing my breasts and body to the crew and covering my face. I missed one of my laugh cues. Dustin had spread the word to the crew to come backstage at that time for a surprise. What a jokester. Mr. Fun. It was sickening.

After the show, one of the actors in the stage scene screamed at me and accused me of being totally unprofessional because I missed my cue. I tried to tell him what happened and he said it was my fault and walked away.

When at last I found an opportunity, I pushed Dustin up against the wall screaming, ""Fuck you! How would you like it if someone did that to you before you walked out on stage every night, Mr. Method Actor? Leave me alone!"" He did... for three days. And then it was back to groping as usual.

By the time we got to the Kennedy Center, I considered reporting him to Actors Equity. But I was cautioned by some respected theatre professionals that if I did, I would probably lose my job and, because he was such a powerful star, any hope of a career. It was Dustin's playpen. He controlled the purse strings. I now knew I was alone and didn’t know what to do to survive.

I returned to acting by day and crying by night. I hardened. The play closed. We reunited to film the television movie a month later. My work shot out in three days so I had no knowledge of his treatment of interns or any other women. Nothing I hear surprises me. My experience filming was fine. I loved working with director Volker Schlondorff. (I was horrified and saddened when I saw his defense of Dustin. He uses his public forum to discredit a woman — a girl at the time — and discuss something without any of the facts. Disrespectful to everyone involved. Seems like Dustin is Teflon.)

In the fall of 1985, we screened the film. I was very proud of my work and secretly sighed with relief that I would never see anyone involved in this project again. As Dustin was leaving, a photographer stopped him and asked for a picture with me and another actress from the film. He stood between us and put his arms around our rib cages. On cue, he grabbed our breasts. Without thinking, a knee-jerk response built up over two years, I grabbed his crotch. How would he like some of his own medicine? In that moment I understood how women abused for many years by husbands or boyfriends will pick up a gun or a knife and suddenly attack back. I also knew I had snapped and what I had done was awful. I was terrified and humiliated. My pathetic attempt at fighting back could have horrible repercussions. After all, I was not a jokester, or famous or powerful. I went home and cried for hours.

The dust settled and I did another show with wonderful actors who were healthy and professional. Three months after the party I was in a restaurant with fellow actors when another friend came racing in with a Playboy magazine. There in the back was a picture of me and Dustin and the other actress and I am apparently, gleefully grabbing his genitals. Yes, the millisecond had caught the act. But it hadn’t captured the story. The caption was to indicate how fun-loving we serious theater people are. And it read, “Reviving a dead Salesman."" All my friends could say was, ""Oh my God, your career is over."" How ironic. Abused women who fight back usually go to jail.

The next day I got a call from my mother in Florida. “Kathy, what are you doing in Playboy?” “Mom, what are you doing reading it?” Someone in her bridge club had brought it to her. I had never said a word to my family about the abuse. My mother was a very, very reserved, proper woman. I felt sick. I told her a condensed version of the story. After what seemed like an interminable pause, she said, “Good for you. But don’t tell your father."" She died four years later. My father is 91 and neither he nor my three brothers know this story.

I wrote a one-woman show in the early 2000s looking at themes from my life and my relationship with my mother. I included the story about the Playboy picture because it was hugely relevant to my show and my life. I was presenting readings of my piece around New York as I developed it and it was getting a very good response.

Two days after a reading I got a call from my agent that Dustin’s office had heard of a reading of a film script I had written and were very interested in seeing it. My agent was excited. I paused. Then it dawned on me. Did he want to see the script so his lawyers could issue an injunction? Sue me? Who knows what. All those years later, was he still manipulating his power? I said, ""Tell them I have no film"" (as indeed I didn’t). I stopped working on my show. So he got what he wanted.

I’ve always wondered if he prevented other women from coming forward through similar intimidation. After all, I have no money and no power.

Now it’s 2017. Harvey has opened a floodgate. But as I write this, Dustin still seems immune. 

It was a long time ago. This is not the red badge of courage I have worn for 32 years. I buried it deep. I am a tough dame... now. I continue to read the accolades pouring forth for him: Generous to a fault, kind, best man to work with. Women are overly sensitive to dirty jokes. Toughen up, ladies, etc. There is no denying I learned an enormous amount from him about acting. He was generous in the many presents he gave us and the many parties he threw. He can do all that and still be a man who manipulates, abuses his power and is a pig to women. They are not mutually exclusive.

My issue isn’t what he said, it’s what he did. Along with the nightly sexual harassment, he eroded my confidence, my dignity. He humiliated and demeaned me. He robbed me of my joy in the experience and he left dirty fingerprints on my soul.

I guess those were lessons, too.

The next day I got a call from my mother in Florida. “Kathy, what are you doing in Playboy?” “Mom, what are you doing reading it?” Someone in her bridge club had brought it to her. I had never said a word to my family about the abuse. My mother was a very, very reserved, proper woman. I felt sick. I told her a condensed version of the story. After what seemed like an interminable pause, she said, “Good for you. But don’t tell your father."" She died four years later. My father is 91 and neither he nor my three brothers know this story.

I wrote a one-woman show in the early 2000s looking at themes from my life and my relationship with my mother. I included the story about the Playboy picture because it was hugely relevant to my show and my life. I was presenting readings of my piece around New York as I developed it and it was getting a very good response.

Two days after a reading I got a call from my agent that Dustin’s office had heard of a reading of a film script I had written and were very interested in seeing it. My agent was excited. I paused. Then it dawned on me. Did he want to see the script so his lawyers could issue an injunction? Sue me? Who knows what. All those years later, was he still manipulating his power? I said, ""Tell them I have no film"" (as indeed I didn’t). I stopped working on my show. So he got what he wanted.

I’ve always wondered if he prevented other women from coming forward through similar intimidation. After all, I have no money and no power.

Now it’s 2017. Harvey has opened a floodgate. But as I write this, Dustin still seems immune.

It was a long time ago. This is not the red badge of courage I have worn for 32 years. I buried it deep. I am a tough dame... now. I continue to read the accolades pouring forth for him: Generous to a fault, kind, best man to work with. Women are overly sensitive to dirty jokes. Toughen up, ladies, etc. There is no denying I learned an enormous amount from him about acting. He was generous in the many presents he gave us and the many parties he threw. He can do all that and still be a man who manipulates, abuses his power and is a pig to women. They are not mutually exclusive.

My issue isn’t what he said, it’s what he did. Along with the nightly sexual harassment, he eroded my confidence, my dignity. He humiliated and demeaned me. He robbed me of my joy in the experience and he left dirty fingerprints on my soul.

I guess those were lessons, too.

7iqas7,0,2017-12-09,During the Play 'Death of A Salesman' I Was Sexually Harassed By Dustin Hoffman Night After Night - by Kathryn Rossetter (Hollywood Reporter) 8 Dec 2017,FinnagainsAwake,SpaceFeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceFeminists/comments/7iqas7/during_the_play_death_of_a_salesman_i_was/,"In 1983, I was an aspiring actress in New York City. I did not have the privilege of going to Yale or Juilliard. I studied privately and pounded the pavement trying to get work. I had little-to-no real experience (other than one show) when I submitted my picture and resume in the hopes of securing an audition for a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman, starring Dustin Hoffman. I had played Maggie in After the Fall, also written by Arthur Miller. Miller had come to see it and was highly complimentary of my work, so I took a chance that he might take notice of my submission.

A miracle! I was being called in to read for Willy Loman’s mistress, ""the Woman In Boston."" I was much too young but felt the opportunity alone was the reward so I prepared and went. To my surprise, Dustin was reading with everyone. I was the last actress to read. He was silly and fun, and we did the scene and I laughed and he went crazy. “I love that laugh. I want her, I want her!” I couldn’t believe my ears. The director felt I was far too young and wanted another actress. Final callbacks were four days later. Dustin told me to get a wig and age makeup and to look older when I came back. The night before my final audition, he called me and said he and his makeup artist were coming to my apartment to get me ready. I was astounded. It was a little bizarre. She stuffed towels into a body stocking so I would look fatter, did my wig and aged me. Frankly, I looked like Tootsie. Thus, I went to the callback the next day.

After my turn, I was released. A half-hour later I got a call saying I needed to hurry back to the theater. I did, wig in hand. All the other actresses were gone. I had to read again. They openly argued about me in front of me. They made me take off my dress so the producer and director could see me stuffed with towels in my body stocking. Then there was another hushed meeting of the men and they offered me the job — if I would gain 12 pounds. I was dumbstruck. I was going to be on Broadway in one of the most iconic revivals of the time. Dustin took me to his home for dinner to meet his wife and called my mother to tell her I was going to be on Broadway. The whole experience was overwhelming. He was my hero.

Three days later, during the first week of rehearsals, he took me to lunch. Walking back to rehearsal, he said he had to stop by his hotel room to pick up something he forgot. I asked, ""Why a hotel room?"" He only lived a little over a mile away. He said so he could take naps at lunch, if needed, and when they were working on scenes he wasn’t in he could go there and relax and study his lines.

When we stepped into the room, he jumped on the bed and said, ""Give me a back rub."" He pulled off his shirt. I didn’t know what to do. I said we had to be back at rehearsal in 15 minutes. He said, ""Just a quickie."" I was a nervous wreck, but sat on the bed and gave a very lame rub. The maid walked in and I almost fainted. He laughed. As we prepared to leave, he looked at me and said, “Now we have our 'hotel room.'” Ah, I thought — Method Acting! I was his mistress and our scenes were set in a hotel room and Biff walks in. He told me to return to rehearsal a few minutes after he did and left me there.

That was the beginning of what was to become a horrific, demoralizing and abusive experience at the hands (literally) of one of my acting idols.

Since they loved my laugh, it was decided that I would stand in the wings on stage left at a mic and laugh on cue in a memory scene being played out on the stage. My laugh had to be choreographed and timed. That scene led directly into the scene in the second act with Dustin and me in the hotel room and Biff walking in on us. My costume was a vintage slip, no bra, garter belt and stockings. The wing space was limited, so directly behind me was a chair where Dustin would sit, with his dresser in attendance, to take water and a short rest before our final scene together.

One night in Chicago, I felt his hand up under my slip on the inside of my thighs. I was completely surprised and tried to bat him away while watching the stage for my cues. After the show he was busy with the producer and director so I had no access to him to address it. It then happened almost every show. Six to eight shows a week. I couldn’t speak to him in the moment because I was on a live mic. He kept it up and got more and more aggressive. One night he actually started to stick his fingers inside me. Night after night I went home and cried. I withdrew and got depressed and did not have any good interpersonal relationships with the cast. How could the same man who fought to get me the job, who complimented my work, who essentially launched my career, who gave me the benefit of his wisdom as an actor, how could he also be this sexual power abuser? Was I doing something? Was it my fault?

The groping continued. After the shows at parties, whenever he had a picture taken with me, he would put his arm around my rib cage and then grab my breast just before they snapped the picture and then remove it. He was very skilled at dropping his hand just as the picture snapped to avoid it being recorded. But it was pre-digital. You didn’t know what was there until they were developed. Only by luck do I have one such picture — where the camera caught him in the act. A picture I had taken with hopes of sending it to my family. A millisecond in time. There I am — big smile and my arm moving toward his with the intention to push it away. But caught as it is, it seems I’m complicit with the gesture. I was not. Not ever.

Everyone around always laughed when he did this. Does that make him just a jokester? Or is he extremely smart choosing when and how to pursue his actions? Everyone standing around laughing worked for him. He gave us gifts, paid for parties. Bait and switch.

I have a quick wit and my humor is my first line of defense. It’s how I survive. I tried everything to get him to stop. I tried to laugh it off, smack him and say witty, pointed things. I begged him nicely with tears in my eyes to please stop it. To no avail.

His dresser came to me during the show one night. Dustin wanted to see me in an offstage dressing room where he rested while the scene in the kitchen with mom and the boys took place. I thought he wanted to give me a note on our first scene. But he wanted me to rub his feet. Get on my knees and rub his feet. I froze. I gave a little foot rub and ran out. His dresser would then continue to come get me whenever Dustin felt like it. Whenever possible, I hid and tried not to be found. But the boss was relentless. Dustin would whisper, “higher, higher,” trying to get me to move up his pants legs toward his genitals. I didn’t do it. I would stop at his calves. I understand how women say they just go inside themselves to another place as a form of protection, to distance themselves from the abuse. I felt trapped. We were just a few feet from the stage and I couldn’t say anything for fear it would be heard on stage or in the audience. His dresser stood guard outside the door.

Then one night I was in my position at the mic preparing for my laughing scene. Dustin arrived and took his seat behind me. There was an unusual number of the crew backstage that night — men who were not needed until intermission or the end of the show. Dustin started his grope. I started my batting him away and laughing on cue. Suddenly he grabs the bottom of my slip and pulls it up over my head, exposing my breasts and body to the crew and covering my face. I missed one of my laugh cues. Dustin had spread the word to the crew to come backstage at that time for a surprise. What a jokester. Mr. Fun. It was sickening.

After the show, one of the actors in the stage scene screamed at me and accused me of being totally unprofessional because I missed my cue. I tried to tell him what happened and he said it was my fault and walked away.

When at last I found an opportunity, I pushed Dustin up against the wall screaming, ""Fuck you! How would you like it if someone did that to you before you walked out on stage every night, Mr. Method Actor? Leave me alone!"" He did... for three days. And then it was back to groping as usual.

By the time we got to the Kennedy Center, I considered reporting him to Actors Equity. But I was cautioned by some respected theatre professionals that if I did, I would probably lose my job and, because he was such a powerful star, any hope of a career. It was Dustin's playpen. He controlled the purse strings. I now knew I was alone and didn’t know what to do to survive.

I returned to acting by day and crying by night. I hardened. The play closed. We reunited to film the television movie a month later. My work shot out in three days so I had no knowledge of his treatment of interns or any other women. Nothing I hear surprises me. My experience filming was fine. I loved working with director Volker Schlondorff. (I was horrified and saddened when I saw his defense of Dustin. He uses his public forum to discredit a woman — a girl at the time — and discuss something without any of the facts. Disrespectful to everyone involved. Seems like Dustin is Teflon.)

In the fall of 1985, we screened the film. I was very proud of my work and secretly sighed with relief that I would never see anyone involved in this project again. As Dustin was leaving, a photographer stopped him and asked for a picture with me and another actress from the film. He stood between us and put his arms around our rib cages. On cue, he grabbed our breasts. Without thinking, a knee-jerk response built up over two years, I grabbed his crotch. How would he like some of his own medicine? In that moment I understood how women abused for many years by husbands or boyfriends will pick up a gun or a knife and suddenly attack back. I also knew I had snapped and what I had done was awful. I was terrified and humiliated. My pathetic attempt at fighting back could have horrible repercussions. After all, I was not a jokester, or famous or powerful. I went home and cried for hours.

The dust settled and I did another show with wonderful actors who were healthy and professional. Three months after the party I was in a restaurant with fellow actors when another friend came racing in with a Playboy magazine. There in the back was a picture of me and Dustin and the other actress and I am apparently, gleefully grabbing his genitals. Yes, the millisecond had caught the act. But it hadn’t captured the story. The caption was to indicate how fun-loving we serious theater people are. And it read, “Reviving a dead Salesman."" All my friends could say was, ""Oh my God, your career is over."" How ironic. Abused women who fight back usually go to jail.

The next day I got a call from my mother in Florida. “Kathy, what are you doing in Playboy?” “Mom, what are you doing reading it?” Someone in her bridge club had brought it to her. I had never said a word to my family about the abuse. My mother was a very, very reserved, proper woman. I felt sick. I told her a condensed version of the story. After what seemed like an interminable pause, she said, “Good for you. But don’t tell your father."" She died four years later. My father is 91 and neither he nor my three brothers know this story.

7iqxv6,58,2017-12-09,[Manga Spoilers] The Twin Suns of Class 1-A: A Theory on the Future of Bnha,youreaskingmewhy,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/7iqxv6/manga_spoilers_the_twin_suns_of_class_1a_a_theory/,"(This theory covers manga chapters 1-163)

If you like Star Wars in addition to BNHA, keep reading, because I love analyzing both of them; don't worry if you don't know SW, it's just used as a comparison and everything's explained.

There’s something exciting about seeing one of your other all time favorite franchises repeatedly referenced in your new obsession. Kamino Ward, Dagobah Park, The Wookiees shopping mall; it’s great, Horikoshi loves Star Wars. Then I noticed something about the wording of when Midoriya and Bakugo are described (by either AM or Aizawa, can’t remember) in regards to their class: twin cores, or something. I immediately thought of the twin suns of Tatooine, the home planet of Darth Vader and where one of his twin children was hidden from him. “Ah, so a set of ‘twins’ who were childhood friends who both are protagonists in this series, nice,” I thought, “another reference.” All Might is like Midoriya’s master, passing down the ways of this immense power used for the good of all, with a stark antagonist; a parallel to Yoda and Luke, the light side and dark side of the Force. Awesome, I love it. **But as I looked deeper, as I tried to see any more of this influence which I love so dearly in this new story (which I love to death as well), I began to see something else.**

**Let me remind you now, Star Wars, in the scope of the first six movies, is a tragedy.** The life of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader is a tragedy, and he was both a hero and a villain, the weight of a legacy and prophecy on his shoulders, too great to bear for too long. Ultimately, he transformed the galaxy, but also freed it at long last, and at the cost of his life (obviously that’s quite a summary, but it plays in, just wait).

I love analytical meta, and stumbled across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/5n21a9/imitation_is_the_sincerest_form_of_tragedy_a_boku/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/603qte/you_can_be_a_hero_boku_no_hero_academia_theory/) follow up theory on the future of BNHA, and it struck me hard. Once I thought it over, it reminded me of other pieces to the puzzle I could give, which I’m now going to add. **This is where I think the plot and themes of BNHA are going and how it will end, based on my knowledge of SW and foreshadowing. So, here we go.**

(Disclaimer: this is the first manga I’ve read and I don’t know the tropes associated with shounen well at all. I’m aware there’s an expected plot form, but from what I understand, Horikoshi has done something rather mold breaking with this series. So, I wouldn’t put it past him to compose a story with such different conclusions from what everyone is expecting.

Also, I'm brand new to reddit, so hey.)

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Episode I: “A hero is a hero because…”**

**All Might really is the greatest hero.** And, we have to re-establish why. It’s not because of One for All, and you’ll see I say that a lot. He didn’t defeat All for One with his Quirk, but his spirit. But it goes deeper than that, to the core of this series’ dichotomy. Let me demonstrate. Endeavor is a character I don’t really want to see redeemed, but maybe he can learn something. See, he’s the number two hero, with has the most wins tallied— he is the greatest winner in history, apparently. He does his job well, but people can’t accept him as number one after AM retires. Why? He’s missing something crucial. The Hero Killer Stain can tell you what it is, since he’s the opposite in a specific way. He completely gave up his own person (and his nose, apparently) in order to serve an ideal. It’s stated that he chose his name because he was ready to dirty his hands for the sake of what he thought was the greater good. In his own twisted way, he sacrificed himself for a cause (also ultimately inspired by AM, not by coincidence) that ensured heroes would be entirely self-sacrificing themselves. Now, Stain is a villain most definitely, but his purpose had truth in there. **Heroes must be self-sacrificing- but they must also win, to keep on serving, as Endeavor shows.** 

Undoubtedly, Jedi can be paralleled here, since they were heroes in their universe. Yet, their code instructed them to die for a cause, if they had to, but sometimes needlessly. **To beat their enemy though, they really had to be willing to survive to fight another day, and this was a dilemma that caused tension among the Order’s body (and one of the reasons they died out).** But in BNHA, the phenomenon is reversed, with the implication that **heroes are winning more than they are sacrificing. Because if they were really putting everything on the line for peace, we would see greater heroes, and along with that, we would encounter greater tragedy.** For example (not real life, but this *is* a comparison), think of two Jedi, great in (almost) every way, who sacrificed so much to only survive in exile to survive another day? Yoda and Obi-wan are two other tragic characters from SW that, even while once great, lost as much because of what they put on the line, and the kind of evil they were up against. **Yes, because in this life and even in those of fictional heroes, you are not guaranteed a reward or fame for doing what’s right— and that is the tragedy.** A hero gone unsung and the world continues to turn.

In what I see as realistic heroism, **tragedy is as inherent as the risk involved in taking a chance.** Superpowers can’t save you from the consequences of trying to make a change; and you can’t always save everybody. This is a truth I believe BNHA shows well; AM understands this aspect and overcomes it...for now. Hopefully I didn’t just waste my breath on stuff everyone already knows, but now it’s clear.

**Now, there are two students who both have their own mottos when it comes to finishing the sentence, “A hero is a hero because…”** The ones AM specifically called out during their fight on ground beta. We have the one who always wins, and the one who mostly always loses— but that’s not what’s really going on, thematically.

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Episode II: “...They always find a way for justice to be served!”**

This is how All Might finishes the sentence, paraphrased of course, when he beats the Nomu meant to kill him. He flat out says the formula to being a hero to Midoriya and Bakugo when he stops their late night fight. Each has what the other lacks (in almost every way, actually, so that’s satisfying). **What this becomes then, between “A hero always wins,” and “A hero always selflessly gives help,” is “A hero always makes sure the selfless help wins.” Another way of saying making sure justice is served. This is the true definition of a hero, wherever you apply it.** Otherwise, you’re just a prideful winner...of tally marks, or a self-sacrificing loser...of time, energy, and even health. This is the spectrum we’re dealing with in BNHA, and all of our characters fall on there somewhere, trying to become the best version of themselves they can be, according to their ideals. And this is a spectrum we can apply to the world at large, which is why superheroes based in our reality are so popular, besides the ones in a galaxy far, far away. Because these are questions people ask themselves all through their lives.

...Annnddd, not to parallel any one side with the dark side (since we know how everyone generalizes the thematic significance of it into pure evil), but the light and dark side set the spectrum in the Star Wars universe, just like we see one set in BNHA. But, being so black and white isn’t healthy thinking at all, so don’t pick just one side and one side only. **It is not just a balance, but a harmony, that should be the goal.**

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Episode III: The weight of the world (peace)**

I also love all the references to Greek mythology, which I’m not well versed in, so I won’t reach. But damn, All Might, when passing on the torch, **how do you forget to mention that One For All is a death sentence?** Hmm, not even a peep? It’s a literal crushing weight of responsibility, secrecy, and pressure. I have to agree wholeheartedly that AM is a horrible teacher, and it hurts me to say it since, he’s trying his fucking best. **But man, you just passed on Atlas’ punishment (OFA is literally referred to as a punishment at its conception) to a kid who would do anything for you.** As much as I believe in Midoriya, I...just don’t think he can do what All Might expects him to do. **The burden of becoming the next Symbol of Peace is much, much too big, just as the burden of being the chosen one in SW gnaws at Anakin for years.** Hell, look what happened when it was revealed AM was retiring— everyone becomes afraid. No more Symbol of Peace, he’s not coming to help. All for One predicts how it plays out (*cough* like Darth Sidious predicts people turning on the Jedi by the end of the Clone Wars *cough*), and we see UA teachers apologizing: “We’re sorry, AM, we didn’t realize how *big of a burden* you were carrying all by yourself.” Uh, you sure as hell didn’t— he doesn’t even know. **No one knows just how bad it is, that’s the kicker.** No one can see the end as it’s happening (things are happening pretty fast); no one is prepared to take on the mantle of Best Hero. And, no one should be. **The key here is, no one - no *single* person - can carry on this weight by themselves.**

Plus, just because Midoriya will not live up to AM’s, or even his own, expectations, does not in any way make him a disappointment. What I mean by this is, **Deku will become his own hero. He will take the legacy he is given, learn the ropes of heroism, and become his own person.** We see this already with how it’s a lesson he’s already learned with creating shoot style. But more on this next.

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Episode IV: Symbols are good, as long as they don’t Substitute**

Everybody loves symbols. They’re are fantastic— manifold meanings conveyed with a single mark, a representation of something more. But, once and in a while, they require some explanation. **All Might knows the power of symbolism, and how far reaching that power is.** He merely had to show up at the USJ during the villain attack, and people felt instant relief— while on the other hand, the audience knew how weak he was, already past his limit. The audience shares the same fear we see in Midoriya’s reaction— we know this is bluffing, we know the truth of AM’s condition. **And just like that, we understand how symbols, as strong as they are, are not substitutes for the reality of what they represent.** In the end, All Might would have died if reinforcements didn’t show up. **That is how worn the Symbol of Peace has become (the cracks are starting to show, as several characters point out)**, and how strong evil has grown. And passing OFA on does not mean that peace survives in every sense, not at all. We already see how in the rush of forcing the legacy on, Midoriya’s arms are basically ruined (ligaments don’t heal, guys). In UA’s rush to prepare these first years, a group faced a Hero Killer on internship, one got kidnapped from another villain attack, and now, four first-years controversially participated in internships that were very dangerous. **Why? Because the Substitute for Peace is fading away.** People are scared. Now, things will get interesting, when the eggs and pros are faced with these truths and challenges. It will make for a great plot, the details of which I’m not sure. I like [this theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/7h2472/the_constant_of_greek_mythology_a_sequel/) that Gigantomachia will break AFO out of Tartarus with a bunch of other villains to start a “war” on heroism. But now, All Might won’t be around to stop them. Class 1-A and B will be thrust into the mess because the great Symbol had been covering for it by himself.

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Episode V: Future of One For All**

Remember that **harmony of winning and giving?** Time for that again. **What I believe happens now, is that we see the rise of heroes in the place of the Symbol of Peace.** A resurgence of heroism, a different brand. **And leading the way are two heroes who define winning and giving. It’s not who you think.** Before reading the theories I referenced in the beginning, I would have said who you’re thinking: Bakugo and Midoriya, obviously. That feels right, too, it feels satisfying. But the more I payed attention, the more obvious patterns show up. **It always bothered me how self-sacrificing Midoriya is** (think the night the villains attacked the lodge, or even during the Battle Trials, when he used OFA to give Uraraka an opening to win) because it seemed...just blatantly self destructive. It worries me, honestly. **Because, as the opposite of winning may hint at, he loses. A lot. What he also does, though, is save.** Over, and over, and over again. He even saves All Might from scrutiny, right at the beginning, by inspiring him to action. Or as the posts I reference put it, he is a teacher (teaching by doing, that is). **He saves people from their own problems, showing them how to be the best hero/version of themselves they can be. It’s his own ‘superpower,’ it’s never really OFA** (I don’t actually think it’s a Quirk tho). It’s really quite wonderful….except, **it’s going to cripple him, if not outright kill him.** I don’t think [this theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/603qte/you_can_be_a_hero_boku_no_hero_academia_theory/) was that far off. The only way he’ll survive is if Bakugo does the opposite of win, and saves him (which, I’m hopeful about). **But remember, this is a story of the greatest hero. The greatest tragedy, if you ask me.** Midoriya has entered his life into the stakes of a game he just barely understands. **He is blind to his weakness, when he so ardently displays his strength, while being wildly idealistic.** And his mentor and friends might provide too little direction too late before it kills him. **In my theory, as built up to in the last two sections, OFA ends with Midoriya, and therefore, for good.** It’s at its peak and has done its job. (And there’s no way it can be split between people, which I think I saw in another theory, there’s no indication that’s possible.)

Oh, plus we’ve seen several times how Midoriya’s almost let the secret of OFA spill. Like Bakugo said, why the hell can’t he keep his mouth shut? AM heard him do it *again*, when Midoriya offered OFA to Togata. **The kid’s going to dismantle all the work AM’s put into his legacy as he creates something new.** And like we see how bitter Yoda was about the way Luke acted as the last Jedi, AM will likely be bitter and slightly broken by what happens. I don’t think AM’s going to die, I just think he’s going to have to watch as it all goes south, at least in his eyes.

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Episode VI: *You* can be a hero, too.**

Don’t think I like where this is leading any more than you do. **Anyway, I have a problem with the whole chosen one/prophecy thing. Star Wars had it, but Lucas did do something interesting with it. He allowed choice into the equation.** Anakin Skywalker had a choice, when Darth Sidious revealed himself as a sith lord: fulfill the prophecy now or later. He chose later. Darth Vader had a choice - *again* - when Darth Sidious was about to kill his son: fulfill the prophecy...now? Now, sure. He was the one who had the opportunity to kill Sidious for a second time, and he did. **But actions have consequences; *choices* have consequences.** He died because of his choice to delay the inevitable, and his son, Luke, went on to finish the prophecy: ensuring balance in the Force. Luke, by default, became the hero the galaxy remembered. And that kind of tragedy may very well be emulated here, in BNHA. Let me elaborate on this first (skip to the next section, if you’re dying to know how it ends).

I don’t want this to be a tragedy, per se. Yet, it’s important to note that Horikoshi’s work has a more tangible feel than SW, because we are familiar with some form of real life heroes. Quirks are marvelously tangible because they seem like another physical ability. And because of how each one of us has had struggles like the characters. Proving yourself, making money, fulfilling your dreams. Stepping in and saving someone from being bullied, putting aside your caring side to beat a friend in a game. Rushing into a burning building to save someone you don’t know… Would you? Deku would (we all knew that, no judgement on you). **But we’re provided with a series that asks us that question.** Would…*you* be a hero, too? Could you make that choice, and what would you pick? **See, in real life, there is no prophecy, no guarantee. There is, however, the right time, the right place, the right choice. A hero is made then.** Maybe before they were a crying nobody scribbling in their journal. Now, they just became the greatest hero of all time, because of their choice to make sure justice won. Or, I really hope that’s what Horikoshi is trying to say. **Because we can’t rely on some great power to fall in our lap, or for a symbol to save us, or even someone to come save us (just ask Shigaraki...). OFA’s Symbol of Peace will be dismantled, and a new age of a nation of self-peacekeepers will emerge.** Replacing a symbol with the real thing.

Another note on why I think it’s obvious OFA is done is from something I find interesting in OFA’s hero names. **We got Deku “I can do it” and All Might “all mighty.” In his hands, OFA becomes something like “one with the mighty power who does it for all.” In Deku’s hands, it becomes something more like, “one with the power who shows all, *they* can do it.”** As AM got one, huge injury from his use of OFA by himself as a consequence, there is something going on with the way Deku is using OFA *for others*. There is a consequence for that, too. Now, for the end.

_______________________________________________________________________________

**Episode VII: “I will repeat the same scene, like the arc before me.”**

The Force Awakens should have tried to be its own movie, that’s all I’m saying about it... (Still going to see Ep 8, though, still going). If you’re still reading, you might like the theory I referenced in the beginning with all the images of the panels that explain this well, if you already haven’t looked. But just as the sequel trilogy is trying to bank on this, **repetition creates familiarity. It also creates foreshadowing. Like, big time.** And I love it, when it’s done right. So, so right, that no one sees it coming until it’s too late. ...Yeah.

**Midoriya didn’t get into UA because of his Quirk; he got in because he saved Uraraka.** Remember, he was going to run away from the 0P robot, but he saw she was stuck? Like how AM was going to leave Tatouin station, but he saw Bakugo captured by the sludge villain? And then- Midoriya remembers how it’s *her*, that girl who was kind to him, so he decides to save her, racking him up hero points? And- how AM remembers how timid and Quirkless *that kid* was - now running into action - so he saves both boys, plus his reputation? So what do the holders of OFA do after? They thank the instigating person with a gift of their own. One was a Quirk, the other was a quirky habit of his. His offer of a notebook/knowledge, in Midoriya’s case, as my guy with the powerpoint points out. But Uraraka refuses, saying she needs to become a hero on her own at the festival. Uhm, what could that mean?

Over and over, Izuku has shown almost every person he encounters that they have the power to be a hero: Uraraka, Todoroki, Kota, All Might, etc. **A common repetition here is, Midoriya always makes the opening first.** He gives Uraraka the opening in the Battle Trials, gives Todoroki the opening in the festival, Kota gets the opening for forgiveness, AM, for saving his pride (twice). Over and over. Even in the latest arc, who handcuffed Overhaul? Uraraka, guys; while Midoriya fought the whole battle and almost died from Eri’s Quirk. Midoriya didn’t even *care*; he just wanted to make sure the girl was okay.

And that is foreshadowing. **OFA is going to end, the Symbol of Peace will fall away, choices have consequences. A hero in this world, like in our world, makes choices in the circumstances they are in and can’t escape them. Tragedy arrives when we see no justifiable reward given to the greatest hero (Deku) who may very well be out of the picture by the end, after he creates *that* opening.** He must have consequences for his sacrifice, if done so by standing by his ideal of *self*-sacrifice. **In his place is the rescue hero: Uravity.** The one he believes in and trusts with his gift and legacy— over and over until, at the end, she finally accepts. **Remember how she idolizes Thirteen, and Uraraka’s Quirk is described as a rescue Quirk? That’s one of the reasons why her battle against Bakugo was so...hard to stomach. They’re opposites, in this way. They will stand as the future twin cores of rescue and victory, in the wake of the original who led the way.** There is no *direct* SW analogy this time (I’m trying to be brief lol). Simply, Deku would hand his legacy to Uraraka, without OFA, but as an opening. (Leaving a giant, gaping opening of a hole in our hearts…)

And as a response to the theory that Uraraka is actually narrating from Deku’s book, yeah, I can believe it. Deku wanted to become the greatest hero, one who outshines them all by saying, “This is the story of how I become a great hero.” And he did— at the very least, to Uraraka. **All Might is to Deku, as Deku is to Uraraka.** She strives to be like him with a kind of comparable determination. **He is Uraraka’s hero.** To her, it is the story of how he became the greatest hero there ever was. **(If it’s not just to her, there’s the scenario where Deku is only a footnote in history...like Nana Shimura seems to be...)** Also, look at the theory I referenced in the beginning if you want in story proof that there’s something strange going on with the narration, however subtle right now.

**As Sir Nighteye said to AM, the world needs “a bright and shining light” to replace the Symbol of Peace, once it’s gone. And they’re getting just that, as time runs out, as the war begins, as the end of this era *transitions* them into the *next*. It comes at a cost. As the saying goes, “the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.”** Left behind are ashes, out of which the hero world is due to be reborn. And as bitter of a taste that leaves in your mouth and mine, **I think it perfectly depicts what it actually means to be a hero who changes the world.**

**EDIT: I kept thinking my conclusion over, and I think the probability of Deku dying is less than him just ending up quirkless again.** He'll sacrifice his hero status and OFA when he makes the final opening (kind of like how mirio made that sacrifice, but lived. But I think Deku's battle is against AFO/Shiggy and not the bullets). He'll therefore be relatively unknown, and Uraraka and Bakugo will continue leading the hero world with their quirks. Which would still be kind of unpopular, but not as insanely tragic as him dying. Also, if this is still relevant (idk the date of this message), I thought [Horikoshi guessed Bnha might not always be popular.](https://i.redd.it/rau2ywmzcutz.png)

7irhav,1,2017-12-09,I realized how my ex girlfriend felt in the months before we broke up today,Throwaway-horay,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7irhav/i_realized_how_my_ex_girlfriend_felt_in_the/,"A bit under 3 years ago I started dating one of my best friends. We were in high school at the time, and had already decided where we were going to college. I was staying within a few hours of home while she was going to school about 9 hours away. While it was hard, we stayed together for the first year she was at school. Her school had a coop program, meaning the fall of her sophomore year she would be doing an internship. She wound up getting an internship near our hometown so she was here for a semester after summer ended. We broke up about a year ago after dating for just shy of 2 years. 

After we broke up, she told me that in the months after the school year starting (and her other high school friends moving back to school) she felt emotionally isolated from me, her other friends, and anyone else her age. At the time I didn’t really think much of it and blamed her because I had tried to include her in my group of friends from school but she didn’t seem interested. 

Fast forward a few months after our breakup and I have once again started dating a close friend. We’ve been together for around 8 months at this point. She goes to school around 2 hours away so if I’m lucky I'll see her once a week. Better than 9 hours away and seeing her once every other month. My other close friends are all gone for various reasons. Some changed schools, some have internships out of town, one moved back in with their parents. Regardless of the reason I feel completely emotionally isolated from all of them. I think one of my more distant friends has picked up on this and has been doing a lot to include me in their other friend groups, but I just can’t. They’ll invite me to parties or bars and Ill see all these people hanging out with their closest friends and I always feel like an outsider and realize I used to have that but don’t anymore. Its not that I’m not interested in making new friends, it’s that seeing how people who have been friends for the last few years interact makes me miss being with my friends more than normal so I just avoid it. I finally understand how my ex felt because it’s exactly how I feel now. 

Anyways, I’m posting here because I’m now dating the person I used to talk to about this kind of stuff and they’re in the middle of exams. They’ve felt distant for the last month anyways so I don’t think I’d go to them regardless. You’d think at some point I would realize dating your friends is a bad idea, but apparently I just enjoy hurting/being hurt by the people I’ve been closest to. We’re probably going to break up soon, making this the 3rd friend I’ve lost because we started dating (one came back into my life a few years later but that’s a whole other thing). My ex and I were good friends before we started dating, and the only conversation we’ve had in the last 8 months was me asking if she still had something of mind. She’ll be home for the holiday, and part of me wants to see if she’s free to get coffee so I can apologize. Part of me also feels like it’s a terrible idea so realistically I’m not going to do it and then kick myself for a few months because of who I am as a person. "

Would really love and appreciate any advice or thoughts around my situation. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating a year. We both went to Iowa for undergrad (didn't know each other), and I met him when I was visiting for a weekend last fall while he was back at Iowa getting his PhD. I'm born and raised in Chicago and have been living in LA for the past couple of years. We did long distance for about 7 months (Iowa City to LA), and he moved here to LA over Memorial Day Weekend. We're very much in love and I do think he's the one. We both hated long distance, but he also was unhappy with his program at Iowa, the people in his program, and was disappointed by the experience so far, which was a lot of the reason why he came out west. He finished his first year of his program, and now is taking a year off, and has to let Iowa know by February if he's going to continue. If so, he would have 3 years left, plus an internship year. He's currently a therapist here in LA (he has his masters so he can practice) and loves it.

We've both been missing the midwest and our family/friends a lot, and want to move back to the midwest next year, but we cannot come to an agreement where we should move. His family is in Des Moines, which is a couple hours from Iowa City, and he's now been saying he wants to finish his program at Iowa so he can be closer location-wise to them. He would also get to do research with his program (not a ton though), which he likes.

I, on the other hand, have absolutely nothing for me in Iowa City. I've been at my job in tech for 5 years and have a lot of job opportunities in Chicago, my whole family is there, most of my friends, my family's 7 year old golden retriever, I absolutely love the city and was so excited to move back. Career-wise, there don't seem to be any opportunities to advance my career in such a small town. I don't know anyone there. There's very few things to do, especially in the winter. I'm a city person, and while I enjoyed my 4 years at Iowa for undergrad, I couldn't wait to be back in Chicago.

Socially, my boyfriend and I are fairly different (I've always had a wide group of friends which is important to me, and he keeps a small circle). His best friend lives in Chicago, but his parents and sister live in Des Moines. I know I would be lonely, bored, and feel ""stuck"" in Iowa City, and have told him that. He's close with my friends and family in Chicago and there are career opportunities for us both there. Even if we were in Iowa City, we would be a couple hour drive to his parents, and I would be about 4 (more or less) to Chicago, which I likely would want to go to every few weeks. 

It it selfish of me that I don't want to spend the next 3-4 years (I'm 28) of my life living in Iowa City with nothing for me there besides him? "

I recently bought a course (ugh) where a guy claimed that people were desperate for people who can manage PPC/AdWords accounts and that some agencies were even willing to train a newbie... but the more I apply to jobs, the less I'm beginning to think it's really true.
In about a month, I will be moving to another state to finish college, and this time when I return to college (major digital marketing) I want to get some experience under my belt. So I was thinking about cold pitching some agencies, asking for paid trials, internships or entry-level positions to gain some experience while I finish up school. I mean I feel like I have a lot to offer, I can code (help with website maintenance and experience with WordPress), Write content (for SEO) and I'm teaching my AdWords and SEO. So I'm trying to figure out before I scam some people's inboxes, if that would okay? Thoughts from people who have done this before or who own agencies?"

I'm in panic mode. Totally freaking out. I'm worried that I can't get it done. 

All the anxiety has made me over analyze my actions and my ability to be a good teacher. I have always had social anxiety and it is a billion times worse now, and it has impacted my ability to do my job. 

I was really close with my narcissistic father and cut him out of my life this quarter, and that made me depressed, and my sister has advanced kidney disease and doesn't have a strong prognosis. That didn't help either.

An issue I am struggling with as a result is lying. I had to get extensions on some of my work this quarter due to depression. I've lied to my mentor teacher and in-laws about how far behind I am in my homework because I don't want a lecture or people to think I'm lazy. I exaggerated my sister's illness to get the extensions I got because I didn't want to disclose my depression and bipolar disorder to the university that will be recommending me to certifications and writing me letters of recommendation. At some point I decided to stop lying, but now I'm having a hard time because eventually I have to fess up to the people I lied to, and how do you explain that and still keep your job and reputation, and not get in trouble/kicked out of your university?

Today I lied to a girl in my cohort about what my boyfriend and I did for our anniversary because I know she would be super judgemental about it. We got a descent hotel room, took a bath, ate room service, and just relaxed for a night. I felt obligated to make up a story about going to a nice restaurant, it was all romantic, yada yada yada. And now I'll think about it for like a week.

7it3po,12,2017-12-10,Why do I keep getting rejected by guys?,erc010,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7it3po/why_do_i_keep_getting_rejected_by_guys/,"
I am 20 (F) and simply trying to understand why I keep getting rejected by guys, both romantically and as friends. I've tried not to take these rejections personally, but after so many embarrassing incidents, I'm starting to wonder if theres something I'm doing that maybe I can change to get a better outcome next time.

1) 8th grade: Some ""friends"" of mine tell a guy that I have a crush on him. He confronts me, and I admit that it is true. He and his friends laugh in my face and tell me no one will ever like, that I'm too short, and I look like a child. This one didn't really hurt (obviously the guy was a jerk) but I was definitely embarrassed.
2) 10th grade: I confess to a very close friend that I like him. He tells me sorry, that he doesn't see me that way and is interested in someone else. Obviously this sucks, but the thing that really hurts isn't his rejection; its the fact that he was so repulsed that I liked him that he completely stops talking to me, quits all of our mutual activities, and never speaks to me again.  
3) 12th grade: I tell a guy I like him over text. He never responds. Hint taken. 
4) Freshmen, college: This guy I met in my chemistry lab asks me on what would have been my first date ever. Right before the date, when I am already at the place we are supposed to meet, he texts me canceling without a reason. I get stood up for the first time. 
5) Sophomore, college: I have my first kiss with a guy I am friends with, but have always kind of liked. After this, he keeps flaking or standing me up for plans we've made, saying that he forgot, he has something he has to do, etc. I take the hint and stop being friends with him. 
6) Junior, college (present): This guy I have a massive crush on in my physics class sits next to me every day in lecture and eventually asks me out. The date goes very well and we have a lot in common. He cancels plans he had with his friends to keep the date going, telling me that he'd rather be spending time with me anyways. At he end of the date, he kisses me. A month passes without him asking me out again, even though I am still hanging out with him in class. He says that he is busy and I don't take it personally, because I know that he is studying for he mcat and getting ready to apply to medical school. But something doesn't feel right, so I ask him if he is still interested in me. He tells me that he just got out of a long term relationship a few months ago and isn't looking for a relationship right now and wants to focus on his applications/research.

I've had other rejections but these are are main ones. It used to not bother me, but after so many failures  and not a single success I'm starting to worry a bit. So what if noone asked me to prom in high school; I didn't go and instead went to a comic book event. I figured there would be time for guys in college, and that I would just focus on my school work and my own interests. I'm a straight-A student, biology major, and hope to apply to medical school. I do biomedical research and work a medical internship. I'm an artist, and make money on the side by taking commissions and selling my work. I have a passion for music (I used to be a band geek in high school) and play the flute, saxophone, and very recently the electric guitar. I'm a 2nd degree black belt, and used to work as an instructor in addition to tutoring calculus when I was in high school to save up for medical school. My interests may be a bit odd/nerdy, and maybe that is off-putting? I like reading classical literature (Keats, Austen, Machiavelli, Shakespeare), enjoy attending symphonies for classical music, composing my own poetry, painting, collecting vinyl records, video games, comic books, Star wars, anime, and studying theoretical physics and the nature of the cosmos is one of my passions as well. Overall, I think I am a friendly and approachable person, and always try to helpful and kind to people I meet. I'm pretty secure in my abilities, interests, and physical appearance, but the rejection I keep facing is starting to make me feel lonely and doubt myself a little. What can I do about this?

7it7hs,4,2017-12-10,"[F4A] What's a little quid pro quo, [Detective]?",etxbkst,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7it7hs/f4a_whats_a_little_quid_pro_quo_detective/,"“What the fuck is this?” The red envelope stamped “sensitive” landed on her desk and immediately complicated her strategically planned exit from a shit day at the office. 

“You fucking know what it is. And don’t think I haven’t noticed how you’ve pushed your last report off onto that bimbo in steno so you can leave early. You’re gonna get her canned, you know.” The boss gloated widely at having fucked with her plans. This cunt thought she could fuck off whenever she wanted to simply because she was a better detective than anyone who’d ever worked the Sexual Crimes Unit. He’d had it though, and no matter how many deviants she brought in, she still answered to him. 

Most of the time the department head would give her all the space she needed to bag her quarry. He knew she occasionally let the Sapphics off with a little *quid pro quo*, and how she had that red haired slut from the steno pool wrapped around her finger. He overlooked her perversions because she brought in the real sickos. The pedos, the beastlovers, the faggots. Those fucking degenerate pieces of shit who deserved *so much more* than the chemical castration the law prescribed. And let’s be honest, despite what the law says, who doesn’t find two women fucking a turn on? Even the old bastards in congress who wrote the thing loved a little girl on girl action, and it was an open secret that the only reason they allowed female interns was so they had a fresh rotation of tail to have fun with. It’s how they proved to each other they weren’t a bunch of queers, even though every now and again DC Crimes would catch one of them giving foot signals in the stalls of the men’s restroom at some shithole train station. It was a badge of honor to get to crack the skull of some homo congressman, one that elevated the lowly beat-cop to a detective or a lieutenant. But this wasn’t DC, and no one in Lighter, Texas was important enough for SCU to single out. 

When Alex Fanshaw decided to become a cop the last place she thought the great state of Texas was going to send her was a fucked up meth-head town. Cadets who graduate in the top 3% get their pick of assignments, and she hoped for Austin or Dallas or some other place *not known* for its abundance of Mt. Dew loving drug addicts. What she didn’t know was that graduating in the top 3% of your class when you’re a woman usually meant dishing out blowjobs and buttsex along the way. She foolishly thought good old hard work and study would get her to a top notch gig in some enlightened enclave of a generally backwards state. And so despite her grades and her expert ability to handle firearms and club plastic dummies in the head she was told that she wasn’t a *team player* and as such she didn’t get to pick her poison. 

During her four years at the academy Alex never showed interest in men or women or sex. That fact never occurred to her because all she focused on was getting that badge and the hell out of the sort of tiny, shitty towns she spent her itinerate youth in. People asked her if she was queer, and spurned men especially would accuse her of that when she’d laugh at their advances. But she was smart and focused and driven, and those slanders never stuck with her. It wasn’t until the day she was handed her first duty assignment that she actually thought about sex in a less than clinical manner. As she sat in the commandant’s office waiting to find out where her four years of hard work would land her, she dreamt dreams of a life she would never know.  

“Lighter.” Closing her file with a smirk, the commandant waited for her response. Alex sat staring at him, unsure of what he said. *Lighter,* she thought to herself? What the fuck does that mean? She’d never heard of Lighter, Texas. With a nervous chuckle she looked him in the eyes. “Lighter?” 

“Yeah, *Officer,* Lighter. Lighter fucking Texas.” He spat the words at her, annoyed that she was still sitting in front of him. 

“Uhh... that wasn’t on my duty station wish list, sir.” It took a fair amount of restraint not to skip the *sir* and go with *asshole,* but she managed it. The commandant wrinkled his eyebrows and smiled at her.

“See, *Officer*, the key word there is *wish*. As in *wish* list. You get to wish, I get to tell you where the fuck you’re going, and you’re going to Lighter.” His chair creaked loudly as he reclined back and stared at the beautiful woman. What a fucking waste, he thought. Why God would give such good looks to a woman who was either queer or asexual was beyond him. A body like that was meant for fucking, and it still pissed him off that in the four years he had to see the bitch he never once got to touch her. He had her by the balls now, and if she wanted to go to Austin she’d have to do what every other woman who sat before him did. “You’re not a team player, Fanshaw. You could be. There’s still time.” With one hand on the folder holding her signed transfer papers, he moved the other down to the zipper on his dress uniform pants. What he wanted was unmistakable. She knew it the second the words “team player” left his rotten mouth. And she considered it. Genuinely. What’s one fuck? One quick fuck and she’d get the assignment she wanted. One fuck. Her body bent over his desk as his hands grabbed her by the waist, her navy blue uniform skirt hiked up, her blouse unbuttoned and her bra pulled up. That’s what she saw when she thought those words, “one fuck.” Her entire four years had been reduced down to two words: *One fuck.*

The stale smell of his office and the warmth of a soon to be summer day held her captive. She wanted to move, but she couldn’t. She wanted to let him do what he needed to do so she could go where she was meant to be, but she couldn’t. No one ever writes about the girl who fucked her way to the top, because her record always has an asterisk by it. Alex didn’t want an asterisk by her name. Somehow after four years dodging unwanted advances she still managed to have faith that if she did right, right would be done by her. Is it possible to hear a heart break? Alex wondered if it was, because she felt and heard hers crumble. Everything she had dreamed of was gone. All because she couldn’t make herself stand so this piece of shit could screw her on his oak desk. Somehow standing up for her principles wasn’t as satisfying as she thought it would be. Maybe it would feel ok later, but at that moment all she could do was mentally curse herself for not being able to give in. Alex sat frozen, trying to find the will to move when the commandant stood. He knew even before she did that it wasn’t going to happen.

“Enjoy Lighter, Texas, Fanshaw.” 

Lighter fucking Texas. She said those three words to herself at least a dozen times a day. It didn’t matter that she’d been in Lighter for almost two years, or that she’d advanced to the rank of Detective without fucking anyone. There was still a feeling of incredulousness, that maybe she was dreaming this whole thing. Sometimes Alex thought if she just willed herself enough she could go back to that office on that singular day and let the dirty old man fuck her in exchange for an assignment to somewhere not *Lighter fucking Texas.* And now her early start to a long weekend was ruined by a red envelope. The color was significant. It usually meant that a priority case was handed down from the sixth floor. One that took precedence over every other case. One usually the result of some grudge being held by an “important” asshole who decided to rat on a rival or a friend for a very personal reason. That’s what her life had become. Taking out the trash to settle petty scores. 

“So what the fuck *is this?*” The flap to the envelope was held closed by a string wrapped around a silver brad. Alex rolled her eyes as she untied the string and reached in. 

“I don’t know what the fuck it is, *Detective,* but they asked for you to handle it, so just get it done, yeah?” 

Alex’s boss walked away as she pulled the contents free. Instead of the standard single page report a stack of wallet sized snaps fell to the floor. As she reached down to pick them up she saw a familiar face. Hers. Alex paused and surveyed the photos. They were all of her. Each featured Alex and a different women engaged in illegal sex acts. The detective looked around as she gathered the photos, panicked that someone may have seen what they contained. Still holding the red envelope she shoved the incriminating photos back inside. Alex looked in to see what else the envelope held, and she saw a note. The paper was thick, white cotton, 6” x 9”, and folded in half. Words were scrawled in a dark black ink, and as Alex examined the note she saw tell tale splatters of a fountain pen. After looking the document over as if the paper itself and not the message would reveal its truth, she clutched the red envelope to her chest and read the carefully crafted words. 

*Twelve. Twelve photos and twelve women all sullied by you…*

****

Yeah, I know it’s stupidly long. Sorry ‘bout that. Sometimes I can’t get to where I need to be as quickly as I might like. So here’s my train of thought.. The note can continue after the line I’ve written, I just wanted to leave that sort of open. Each photo is of a different woman Alex has fucked illegally. Someone has this information and has decided to reveal that they know she’s just another degenerate. Who is it? Who are you? You could be the blackmailer, male or female. You could be the red head from Steno. She’s a tad crazy, obsessive, and she likes Alex way more than she should. Perhaps she’s pissed that Alex is a bit of a womanizer, and she wants to convince her wayward detective that she’s the only woman who should matter. Tell me who you are and why you sent Alex the photos. What do you intend for her to do? She’s gay, so maybe it’s just about sex. You want to fuck the hot detective who turned you down. You’re such a stud, and it’s obvious the only reason she likes girls is because she hasn’t taken a ride on your magnificent dick. Maybe your the husband of one of Alex’s conquests and you want to punish her for exposing your wife to such disgusting acts. Or maybe your one of the women in those photos, and you hate that you were lead to sin. Or maybe you’re another degenerate and you don’t like the hypocrisy of this detective arresting your friends when she’s participating in the same acts that have been declared immoral and illegal. Who are you?"

He worked there for over 10 years, when it was still MCI Worldcom before the Verizon buyout. With the economy that Obama put us in after a year, he was unable to find a job, even with his experience. Car reposed, house foreclosed, bankruptcy declared. We were forced to move across the country to live with my grandparents for the next 2 years as he worked as a GM at a Sonic, still constantly applying for jobs. He got a second job and we were finally able to move out. A family of 5 living off of 2 wages from fast food. We went a year and a half without gas, so no heat and no hot water. Days where I would come home and power would be out. Learned to live without cable, and to use my neighbor's wifi after asking them. We had (still have) the most Saint of a land lord, she understood our circumstance and allowed for so much grace on the rent. It was rough for a high schooler. Over 4 years after, my dad gets a job in the IT field again. For the 2.5 years he worked there we still struggled since he was trying to pay off our bills that accumulated. He left for an even better job later. With the economy booming under Trump we've gotten our lives back. I was able to even get an IT internship myself after getting a certification. It's going great. With the hard work of a family man (90+ hours a week), and Trump taking office, we were able to overcome. 

BY THE WAY, as my dad's boss was walking him out of the building for the last time, he asked him if he wanted to know why he was chosen to be let go. ""Because you were the only middle aged white guy, you wouldn't have been able to sue us"". There was a Korean, two 55+ men, a black guy, and a women in the department."
7itluw,1,2017-12-10,"My ex [21f] and I [22m] have been off and on for 3 years. I genuinely think that I love her, but she is skeptical and rightfully so.",goodlukchuck101,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7itluw/my_ex_21f_and_i_22m_have_been_off_and_on_for_3/,"So my ex and I met a few years ago in the marching band at college.  It started beautifully as most decent dating relationships do.  However, eventually I started being distant and almost cold towards her.  I broke up with her.  It was a pretty normal breakup at first and we started talking again and eventually grew together and started back up.  Again the relationship is always great with the obligatory arguments here and there but nothing too horrible that we didn't work through as it came.  Honestly the reason behind the second breakup is lost and I couldn't tell you who did I but it happened.  Sometime later on spring break I was with some on my guy friends staying at a condo and partying and what have you.  Something happened.  We were eating at a restaurant, and I saw two old people sitting together and smiling.  They reminded me of my aunt and uncle (married 49 years and took me in when my father passed away).  I thought of her and a couple days later we were together again.  Flash forward a year or so and we decide to move in together.  It was amazing, but it seemed we would fight more often.  I could be wrong, but I always felt it was my fault.  Not because she made me feel that was but because I started getting frustrated more often.  I was stressed out and I didn't know how to handle it.  I would take it out on her.  Although I never hit her or physically harmed her I got aggressive and finally she broke up with me in January of this year.  This one was tough and I took it harder than ever.  We both did.  One day we sat down and has a conversation about us.  We decided that we cared for each other deeply, but at this point in time we couldn't be together because of what I did and how I acted.  I was a piece of trash.  We decided that if we were going to do this again that we wouldn't consider it for at least 6 months.  Be single for a while and work on ourselves.  I started working on myself everyday trying to improve who I was and figure out what I wanted as well as who I wanted to be.  In this time we still remained extremely close even though she was long at home for a summer internship.  In this time I thought about her and us and why we got here.  I started meditating and working harder at my job and my school work.  Things were going well and I got a promotion.  Fall comes around and I think I'm close to asking her out again but no not quite.  When she got back I noticed she started talking to more guys fairly often some of them everyday even.  At the same time she still talked to me.  I didn't take it well which drove her away a bit, but one day after she spent some time with this guy she liked she said she wanted to work towards a relationship but take it slow.  I agreed and away we went but not very slow.  This was both of our faults.  Although I had improved there were still bumps in the road for me, and she's the kind of girl that decides to do something and does it.  It doesn't take her long to accomplish something she puts her mind to.  It wasn't good enough and according to her we broke up again but according to me I was back at square one way back in January.  I was devastated.  Then, I did something I've never done.  I prayed about it, and actually accepted god into my life.  I don't claim to be any sort of denomination but I do believe in a higher power of some kind.  Something clicked in my head and everything that she had always wanted to do or control became so easy, and I was able to think clearly about her without breaking down.  I wanted to show her more than anything however I found out about a guy she has been getting close to.  Somehow I convinced her to spend some with me and the past few days have been better than ever and I'm the happiest I've been in years.  Not only that I feel like I can do anything.  We even got matching tattoos.  I came over tonight after working late and he was here.  She said they weren't doing anything and asked me to leave after I kinda panicked a little.  She texted me an hour or so later telling me he left and I came over.  I bought her roses and her favorite chocolate to apologize.  She said it was okay and I was continuing to talk her about the changes in my mind but it felt weird.  She got tired and went to bed and I crawled up with her and I couldn't sleep for obvious reason, so I got up and got her to tell me that they slept together not too long ago maybe a week.  It was kind of a shock but I was okay.  A few months ago I would've freaked out and yelled at her but instead I said I don't care I'm still in love with you it doesn't change anything.  She was stressed out and mad because I got it out of her but I calmed her down by convincing her I was okay and that I loved her and I know she feels like she's heard this before but I want to show her how really different things are this time around.  Theres more to the story, but this is a good detailed summary.  If anyone makes it this far and replies I will genuinely appreciate anyway words you have, and if you want more of the story I'm happy to share.  I'm currently sitting in her bed and before she fell asleep she said I could have a chance to show her (not as a boyfriend) but by giving me time over other guys in some cases.

Should it bother me more?  
Should I just back off?  
Does it sound like love?
Am I setting myself up to get hurt?
Am I holding her back?

I just want her to be happy and I feel that I've gotten to know exactly what she deserves.  I feel like I can give it to her, and cherish her.

TL;DR
Been dating to basically dating for 3 years with a few breakups.  Most recent was the longest going on almost a year.  I spent the time working on myself and bettering myself realizing how much she truly means to me.  I'm finally at a point I'm convinced that I'm ready but she's hesitant because multiple breakups.  She slept with a guy but it doesn't bother me.  I think I'm in love."
7iu8zw,3,2017-12-10,What are the next steps?,outofthebox21,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/7iu8zw/what_are_the_next_steps/,"Hi guys! I’m looking for some direction here but before I start, here’s a little background about me: 

- I graduated with a marketing degree December 2016
- I found my current job as a Marketing Associate 6 months after graduation on Craigslist (started part time at 15.50/hr then got full time for 40k a year)
- Prior to having this Marketing Associate position, I marketed for the restaurant I worked at to not waste time and practice my marketing skills (I did this for 4 months before finding my current position)
- I had an internship in event coordination during college (kinda marketing related) 

So my question is, what are the next steps after being a Marketing Associate? I’m 23 now and a 40k job a year is fine for now but I’m not sure what marketing specialization I want to get into. I know there are many. 

How many years should I give this before moving on and to what? Or if I decide to stay with this company, which I really love, when would be the right time to ask for a promotion? How do promotions work? I work directly with the CMO, CEO, and the head of sales. 

I also find myself really good with people. I can understand the consumer needs and wants. I can connect with people and make people love product/service. I started looking into being an Account Executive because those fit my personality but I’m not sure. I know I definitely have a knack for business and was thinking maybe I would be good at content marketing since I understand consumers well and what they would like/need.

I had a point-dense group assignment due last month that I fully contributed to, the thing is our professor expects us to submit a ""peer evaluation"" for all of our group members.  On the assignment description it says in bold letters that **If you do not turn in the peer evaluation, you get a zero on the assignment.**  The peer evaluation is a template that she provides and all we have to do is fill it out.  It's so easy and I did complete it before it was due, BUT I FUCKING FORGOT TO SUBMIT IT!  I swear I remember uploading it onto my portal, but I must have closed the window before or something I don't know.  I didn't realize this until I saw my grade for the project 2 weeks later and saw a zero (out of 100!).  Then I checked my submission history and saw that I didn't submit it.  I emailed my professor right away and sent her a screenshot of my file folder that shows that I last modified the document on the day it was due to show that I did complete it before the deadline.  Some of you might say ""oh she should understand.""  Except BEFORE THAT, I let the deadline pass for a really important online quiz as well because guess what? I forgot about that too!  Why do I keep doing this!?

I emailed her at the beginning of the semester and explained to her that I was pregnant and that I had been so tired and stuff, but I just feel like i've built a really bad reputation with her.  She is the professor that everyone begs to get a letter of recommendation from for internships because getting a good one from her almost guarantees you a spot in a good internship, and i've only made an ass of myself this semester.  I would like to go see her in her office, but I don't even want to show my face in there.  I just feel so embarrassed and incompetent that I'm starting to think that I may have to put off an internship after graduation.  I'm fucking up this much now and the baby isn't even here!  

Also, I started an overnight position in September and found out I was pregnant 2 weeks into the job.  I work 12:30am-9am 5 (sometimes 6) straight days a week with no nights off in between except Saturdays.  Although the schedule is tough, I'm making a lot more money which is a God-send to me right now.  However, I spend most of my available free time sleeping and it never feels like enough time.  In between rests, I try to get my assignments done, but sometimes I forget obviously.  This semester has just been an absolute shit show.  I graduate in May which is also the month that I'm due.  I'm scared that things are just going to get worse next semester.  I'd love to take the semester off to have a stress-free third trimester until I give birth, but I'm SO close that I just need to ride it out until May.

Don't get me wrong I can't wait to meet my little girl and I know it will all be worth it in the end, but I also have career goals that i'm afraid I won't be able to attain because I just feel so stupid and incompetent.

My first 'real' was here, Markham and Associates, they gave me a shot, which lead me on a rollercoaster of professional development. 

Now, not so bright eyed I've come back to the fold. During the year I interned there I had made a lot of friends among the interns and Jr. Execs. We would frequently go out and party together, get lunch or just hangout. While I was close to a lot of them, none so much as (you). Everyone in the office joked that we were secretly dating. I think at one time there was even a bit so secret office pool to see when we would show up together in last night's clothes. 

My last day was conveniently our holiday party. Since it ended so early and we were all feeling good, we decided to keep the party going and head to our favorite dive bar, just down from the office. 

You and I were walking near the end of the group. I had my arm intertwined with yours trying to keep warm in the brisk winter night. 

I kept teasing you about something, I don't even remember what now. But we were flirting like crazy. Everyone kept shooting us convert looks and glances. 

We all had a great time and as I was leaving the bar from last call, you pulled my hand, put my drink at our table and asked me to dance with you. 

We slowly danced to some generic Christmas song and when the song ended we were in a dimly lit corner of the bar. You whispered near my ear that we should get back to our group. I said we didn't have to and then lightly bit your neck. You breathed in a rough breath and told me I shouldn't start something I couldn't finish. I cockily responded, who said I couldn't finish it. The next thing I know, you've got me pushed up against the wall my dress pushed up to my hips and my legs wrapped around your waist. Your mouth is on my neck and I'm trying to not scream in pleasure, when the lights come on and the bartender yells thread the car is closing. Our dim corner disappears under the harsh florescent lights and one of our friends sees us wrapped around each other and we quickly separate. 


I'm lost in memories and stand in my office without seeing anything. Suddenly there is a polite knock at the door and one of the executive assistants walks in and tells me it's time for my meeting. I straighten my skirt and walk towards the boardroom. 

I've been here about a week and I haven't seen you, I'm not sure if that's because I've been avoiding you, or you've been avoiding me. I round the corner and literally run into someone. My hands are on their chest and I look up to apologise and I'm staring at you."

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

**Hawt Chocolate to Warm the Soul**

Her holiday parties were always the best, and after the eggnog began flowing, the party always took a turn for the sexual. She was the hot chocolate for the soul, and loved to lure her guests upstairs for some one-on-one time away from the party. *Hot Chocolate bimbos must be of the darker variety, enjoy sneaking around the holiday parties, give heartwarming blowjobs, and be fond of finding coat closets, washrooms, and pantries as acceptable places to fuck!*

**Office Party**

The holiday themed office party was the highlight of every calendar year. The managers always padded the booze budget, there was a tacky sweater contest, and the office paid for everyone's ride home. It was a license to let loose before the holidays. That being said, some of the newer, sluttier, bimbo-y employees decided that the would all wear holiday themed lingerie underneath their sweaters! By the end of the night, they might be the main attraction. *Office BIMBOs must love getting ""white-girl wasted"" on holiday themed drinks, showing off their lingerie underneath their sweater to their direct superiors, having that one, big, strong intern come help them move something in their office, and having the happily married guy from accounting help take photocopies of their tits!*

**BIMBOGRINCH**

She wasn't green, she just wore green lingerie while she tried to steal Christmas. Every Christmas Eve, the BIMBOGRINCH would follow directly behind Santa and snatch up all the toys that he laid down for good boys and girls. This grumpy BIMBO would fuck senseless anyone who caught her in the act, but what if she was just fucking cocks that were three sizes too small? What if, one day, she found a cock that turned her BIMBOGRINCH-ING days around? *BIMBOGRINCHES must love the color green, the 26th of December, other humans who hate Christmas, Dads who fall asleep on the couch, and a cock so big, it could make her heart grow three-sizes in a single fuck.*

**New Year's Resolutions: The Stepford Wife**

She was already baking breakfast on January 2nd, at 6am. He liked the idea of having a Stepford Wife, and so far, so good. Those new tits went a long way in whatever she wore, and she had resolved to be the perfect woman for him and doted on his every command and need for the new year. She was his perfect little wife. *New Years Stepford Wives should love doing domestic duties in little or no clothing, love to drop everything they are doing to give her husband exactly what he wants, and love to collect lingerie of all types, from classy to slutty!*"
7ivi6i,5,2017-12-10,First working experience. Things got bad. Need advice please.,[deleted],introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/7ivi6i/first_working_experience_things_got_bad_need/,"I have been dealing with this for months now. I don't know anymore what to do.

So i'm an intern. When i first started, I tried to be friendly and socialize. It started feeling forced and I did not trust this one two-faced intern. I felt exhausted having to go to lunch in a group, having to listen to talks about weekend plans, weather, food... or be competitive and brag. I wanted to be left alone. It got worse. That person I mentioned went on saying ""you don't like us..  you're a workaholic..."". She was too pushy about everything. I wanted her to leave me alone. It didn't help that i was going through a breakup too. I didn't know how to deal. I was angry. I started ignoring her, being rude, so that i am left alone. Of course she used it as more fuel to talk more behind my back. 

Fast forward to today, everyone in that intern group hates me. Intern weekly gatherings are though. I've only been to 3 events (in 10months). I couldn't have done that much damage! I didn't even talk to many people! Her girl group gives me nasty looks and comments. My social anxiety is getting worse. I feel bad when I'm with them, and judged when i am not.

The only intern friend i had left the company (we still meet :)) and the only thing that keeps me going is the older people in the office. Their compassion and encouragement. My manager brightens my day with his Italian humor. But it takes one comment from that group to ruin my day. I'm scarred that this will be my life in working places.

I have 2 months left.. what would you do? Keep ignoring? Try and feel bad again? What should i do in the future.. so that this wouldn't happen again?"
7ivjx2,23,2017-12-10,AITA for telling my boyfriend to confront his parents?,SpyroRampage,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7ivjx2/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_confront_his/,"So my boyfriend and I will have been together for 4 years in March and we are both a junior in college. Our degrees could possibly take us across the United States except I have no desire to move across the country with someone I've never lived with. We go to a Christian college but I'm not Christian and while he is he doesn't see everything the same as most. We dated online for our first year and met in real person in real life on our one year anniversary and this was highly arranged by his parents. I was a secret for about 7 months, to the point he hid under his stairs to call me and hung up whenever he felt his parents were coming down. It was mildly exhausting but I understood the precautions. 

Anyway, I'm 20 and he's 19 and he just got an internship for Software Engineering and I could not be more happy or proud of him. I have told him before I don't feel comfortable moving across the country with him unless we live together and he said he understood but that he didn't want to talk to his parents about it. Now, you have to understand my parents are divorced and have each been married and divorced like 5 times EACH. Marriage is not an ever lasting thing in my family and when I get married I want it to be once. I love my boyfriend with all my heart but I don't believe in getting married and then moving in together. I feel like people are most comfortable at home and that's when you get to see the true them. I have been wanting to live with him for our senior of college so that we can get a feel for how we do and if we can handle it. The problem is he doesn't want to confront his parents about it. This has been an on going argument along with other things about his parents.

This next part is relevant I swear.

My family doesn't care. While I know my parents love me they're shitty parents to put it bluntly. For the first 10 years of my baby sisters life she called me mom on accident so many times I was disappointed by it. I'm not around much anymore since I go to a uni in a different state. I've also lived with my best friend since I graduated high school to get out of the toxic household I lived in. Since then I've only had my own bed a handful of times. I appreciate everything my best friend and her family has done for me but to come home for break and live out of my suitcase, share a bed and be surrounded by other people's stuff is exhausting. Eventually we got an apartment ( more her than me since I'm gone a lot) but even though we shared a room the room was big enough to fit three Queen's in it and still have floor space and dressers. I had my own bed and a place to unpack. The roof blew off the apartment and she was forced to live with her grandparents since she wants to join the military there was no point in signing another lease. I cannot live with them over the summer due to the lack of room. So I have no where to go. My best friend has always been the rock in my life. I will never be able to repay her because she is why I am here at University and doing what I want to do. She found me a place to stay, in our friends trailer named Tammy. He was never there because his job was in another town so I was alone all the time. On top of it, he sold Tammy after the summer and so for Thanksgiving break my bff was talking about how I couldn't stay with her because her grandparents were having family down so now I have no were to stay for a week. A mutual guy friends said he could ask his mom if I could stay in their guest room. So I spent a week in a different house again. I am a burden. Over Christmas break I have no where to go so I saved up and bought a $500 plane ticket to Montana to live with my mom who I have only seen once in 9 years. So I have a place to stay for a little. The fun part? I have no where to live this summer. My best friend will be gone in the military and I don't have any desire to drive my car all the way to Montana. I don't think I could afford it. When my boyfriend got the internship it's for over the summer so he has to get an apartment. Some of his friends were talking about getting one together. He mentioned me moving in with them and while his friends are totally cool with it he hasn't told his parents. I would love to not only live with the guy I love but to have a place to live in general. 

Am I they asshole for saying I'm not going to live with him if he doesn't tell his parents about me? Am I the asshole for asking him to confront his parents?

Just a little note my boyfriend is not upset about having to confront his parents but I feel like I'm forcing him to. I feel like a burden to him."

7iwojj,0,2017-12-10,[f4M] kinky little plaything seeking well-written fun (roleplay),sirensong_,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7iwojj/f4m_kinky_little_plaything_seeking_wellwritten/,"Hey there! I'm Natalie, and I'm looking for some well-written, taboo fun. I'm interested in detailed roleplays with multiple paragraphs per exchange, first person present tense writing, and a scene where we only control and describe our own characters. I'm a big girl who can write all for herself and trust me, you'll prefer it if I do. ;)


kinks: dominant men, bareback (talk me out of condoms!), creampies, age gaps with me younger, infidelity, dirty talk, ddlg (who doesn't love being called daddy?), anal play (receiving), and taboo pairings.

not into: shy guys, pain, humiliation, extreme kinks, facials.


scene ideas:

 - Public fun. I want to be somewhere that you can discreetly slip beneath my skirt, pushing aside my token reluctance and helping me keep quiet while you make me feel things that deserve full bodied moans. I like someone in a position of power over me, an older man I definitely shouldn't be doing this with, especially not where we could be caught. Are you my boss, in the form of an executive or just the dad I babysit for? My sister's boyfriend, my step dad?

 - The Next Morning. All I know when I wake up is that this bed isn't mine. Crimson locks spilling over an unfamiliar pillow, and suspiciously little clothing leaves me propped up on my palms and sleepily inspecting the room I wake up in. A cliche scene of course, but filled to the brim with potential for delicious detail. I like the idea that I was knee deep in tequila last night and the details are fuzzy. Who are you to me? Did we even do anything last night? I'd like to be college aged for this but your age is flexible, let me know your ideas and how you'd like this to play out.

 - Holiday Office Party. An open bar, a ritzy ballroom, dimly lit corners with abundantly hung mistletoe - it's like they're begging for us to cross lines we shouldn't. Maybe you're my supervisor, the CEO of the company, someone fun while I can be your employee, an intern, or your coworker's date he shouldn't have brought.


If you're interested in playing, shoot me a detailed PM with your thoughts. Please put your own interpretation on the scene and don't just repeat what I wrote above back to me."

Until now, these groups have been the fractured column upon which our future sits. Such an obvious weakness that should it fail would bring down our nation, our future and our dream with us.

~President Sutikno

With no formal military to depend on, and a reliance on voluntary paramilitaries the Nusantaran State's defense has been in a state of disrepair. A state that changes today with the establishment of the **The Standard Syndicate of Paramilitary Unions**.

This unit is to be the merger of the patriotic paramilitaries across the nation, including but now limited to the:

* **Sutikno-Youth** A youth movement teaching nasakom values, under the patronage of the President
* **Revolutionary-Youth** A youth wing of the **The Children of the Revolution and the Future**.
* **Future-Fighters** A survival and hunting group closely associated with the **The Children of the Revolution and the Future**.
* **Independence and Freedom** A legal assistance group, and self-declared civilian police, linked as a component of the **The Supporters of our Great Nation's Constitution** who see themselves as enforcers of the constitution.
* **The Agricultural Protection Syndicate** A syndicate who create and maintain security solutions for farms. Part of the **The Grand Alliance of Worker's Unions and Syndicates**.

This process will be overseen by the secret *Elders* group to help remove subservsive elements in the process.

The finalised **Standard Syndicate of Paramilitary Unions** referred to as the **Soldier Syndicate** will comprise a 10,000 man strong division of soldiers. Where possible existing unit structure will be maintained, however future expansions will exist of a *standard* Officer Ratio of 1:10. As the fighting force of Nusantara, their history shall prove a vaulable resource for the creation of *moderate* training plans, and their initial equipment, maintenance and resupply shall be *standardised*. Overall for fighting in the rugged mountainous jungle terrain, an emphasis on anti-personnel weapons will be provided.

To support them the **Standard Syndicate of Military and Logistical Support** shall be created as a 30,000 man strong department of the Government. Taking where possible from the paramilitary's support elements it will be this departments duty to keep the **Soldier Syndicate** supplied, fed and aware of their orders.

&gt; Safety in Numbers

&gt; Nusantara today is going to be safer. Before it had lots of lile sold-ers. Now it will have one big group of sold-ers. All being friends and together means we are stronger.

7ixz0u,3,2017-12-10,[F4A] What’s wrong with a little quid pro quo? [Super duper long],etxbkst,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ixz0u/f4a_whats_wrong_with_a_little_quid_pro_quo_super/,"“What the fuck is this?” The red envelope stamped “sensitive” landed on her desk and immediately complicated her strategically planned exit from a shit day at the office. 

“You fucking know what it is. And don’t think I haven’t noticed how you’ve pushed your last report off onto that bimbo in steno so you can leave early. You’re gonna get her canned, you know.” The boss gloated widely at having fucked with her plans. This cunt thought she could fuck off whenever she wanted to simply because she was a better detective than anyone who’d ever worked the Sexual Crimes Unit. He’d had it though, and no matter how many deviants she brought in, she still answered to him. 

Most of the time the department head would give her all the space she needed to bag her quarry. He knew she occasionally let the Sapphics off with a little *quid pro quo*, and how she had that red haired slut from the steno pool wrapped around her finger. He overlooked her perversions because she brought in the real sickos. The pedos, the beastlovers, the faggots. Those fucking degenerate pieces of shit who deserved *so much more* than the chemical castration the law prescribed. And let’s be honest, despite what the law says, who doesn’t find two women fucking a turn on? Even the old bastards in congress who wrote the thing loved a little girl on girl action, and it was an open secret that the only reason they allowed female interns was so they had a fresh rotation of tail to have fun with. It’s how they proved to each other they weren’t a bunch of queers, even though every now and again DC Crimes would catch one of them giving foot signals in the stalls of the men’s restroom at some shithole train station. It was a badge of honor to get to crack the skull of some homo congressman, one that elevated the lowly beat-cop to a detective or a lieutenant. But this wasn’t DC, and no one in Lighter, Texas was important enough for SCU to single out. 

When Alex Fanshaw decided to become a cop the last place she thought the great state of Texas was going to send her was a fucked up meth-head town. Cadets who graduate in the top 3% get their pick of assignments, and she hoped for Austin or Dallas or some other place *not known* for its abundance of Mt. Dew loving drug addicts. What she didn’t know was that graduating in the top 3% of your class when you’re a woman usually meant dishing out blowjobs and buttsex along the way. She foolishly thought good old hard work and study would get her to a top notch gig in some enlightened enclave of a generally backwards state. And so despite her grades and her expert ability to handle firearms and club plastic dummies in the head she was told that she wasn’t a *team player* and as such she didn’t get to pick her poison. 

During her four years at the academy Alex never showed interest in men or women or sex. That fact never occurred to her because all she focused on was getting that badge and the hell out of the sort of tiny, shitty towns she spent her itinerate youth in. People asked her if she was queer, and spurned men especially would accuse her of that when she’d laugh at their advances. But she was smart and focused and driven, and those slanders never stuck with her. It wasn’t until the day she was handed her first duty assignment that she actually thought about sex in a less than clinical manner. As she sat in the commandant’s office waiting to find out where her four years of hard work would land her, she dreamt dreams of a life she would never know.  

“Lighter.” Closing her file with a smirk, the commandant waited for her response. Alex sat staring at him, unsure of what he said. *Lighter,* she thought to herself? What the fuck does that mean? She’d never heard of Lighter, Texas. With a nervous chuckle she looked him in the eyes. “Lighter?” 

“Yeah, *Officer,* Lighter. Lighter fucking Texas.” He spat the words at her, annoyed that she was still sitting in front of him. 

“Uhh... that wasn’t on my duty station wish list, sir.” It took a fair amount of restraint not to skip the *sir* and go with *asshole,* but she managed it. The commandant wrinkled his eyebrows and smiled at her.

“See, *Officer*, the key word there is *wish*. As in *wish* list. You get to wish, I get to tell you where the fuck you’re going, and you’re going to Lighter.” His chair creaked loudly as he reclined back and stared at the beautiful woman. What a fucking waste, he thought. Why God would give such good looks to a woman who was either queer or asexual was beyond him. A body like that was meant for fucking, and it still pissed him off that in the four years he had to see the bitch he never once got to touch her. He had her by the balls now, and if she wanted to go to Austin she’d have to do what every other woman who sat before him did. “You’re not a team player, Fanshaw. You could be. There’s still time.” With one hand on the folder holding her signed transfer papers, he moved the other down to the zipper on his dress uniform pants. What he wanted was unmistakable. She knew it the second the words “team player” left his rotten mouth. And she considered it. Genuinely. What’s one fuck? One quick fuck and she’d get the assignment she wanted. One fuck. Her body bent over his desk as his hands grabbed her by the waist, her navy blue uniform skirt hiked up, her blouse unbuttoned and her bra pulled up. That’s what she saw when she thought those words, “one fuck.” Her entire four years had been reduced down to two words: *One fuck.*

The stale smell of his office and the warmth of a soon to be summer day held her captive. She wanted to move, but she couldn’t. She wanted to let him do what he needed to do so she could go where she was meant to be, but she couldn’t. No one ever writes about the girl who fucked her way to the top, because her record always has an asterisk by it. Alex didn’t want an asterisk by her name. Somehow after four years dodging unwanted advances she still managed to have faith that if she did right, right would be done by her. Is it possible to hear a heart break? Alex wondered if it was, because she felt and heard hers crumble. Everything she had dreamed of was gone. All because she couldn’t make herself stand so this piece of shit could screw her on his oak desk. Somehow standing up for her principles wasn’t as satisfying as she thought it would be. Maybe it would feel ok later, but at that moment all she could do was mentally curse herself for not being able to give in. Alex sat frozen, trying to find the will to move when the commandant stood. He knew even before she did that it wasn’t going to happen.

“Enjoy Lighter, Texas, Fanshaw.” 

Lighter fucking Texas. She said those three words to herself at least a dozen times a day. It didn’t matter that she’d been in Lighter for almost two years, or that she’d advanced to the rank of Detective without fucking anyone. There was still a feeling of incredulousness, that maybe she was dreaming this whole thing. Sometimes Alex thought if she just willed herself enough she could go back to that office on that singular day and let the dirty old man fuck her in exchange for an assignment to somewhere not *Lighter fucking Texas.* And now her early start to a long weekend was ruined by a red envelope. The color was significant. It usually meant that a priority case was handed down from the sixth floor. One that took precedence over every other case. One usually the result of some grudge being held by an “important” asshole who decided to rat on a rival or a friend for a very personal reason. That’s what her life had become. Taking out the trash to settle petty scores. 

“So what the fuck *is this?*” The flap to the envelope was held closed by a string wrapped around a silver brad. Alex rolled her eyes as she untied the string and reached in. 

“I don’t know what the fuck it is, *Detective,* but they asked for you to handle it, so just get it done, yeah?” 

Alex’s boss walked away as she pulled the contents free. Instead of the standard single page report a stack of wallet sized snaps fell to the floor. As she reached down to pick them up she saw a familiar face. Hers. Alex paused and surveyed the photos. They were all of her. Each featured Alex and a different women engaged in illegal sex acts. The detective looked around as she gathered the photos, panicked that someone may have seen what they contained. Still holding the red envelope she shoved the incriminating photos back inside. Alex looked in to see what else the envelope held, and she saw a note. The paper was thick, white cotton, 6” x 9”, and folded in half. Words were scrawled in a dark black ink, and as Alex examined the note she saw tell tale splatters of a fountain pen. After looking the document over as if the paper itself and not the message would reveal its truth, she clutched the red envelope to her chest and read the carefully crafted words. 

*Twelve. Twelve photos and twelve women all sullied by you…*

****
****

Yeah, I know it’s stupidly long. Sorry ‘bout that. Sometimes I can’t get to where I need to be as quickly as I might like. So here’s my train of thought.. The note can continue after the line I’ve written, I just wanted to leave that sort of open. Each photo is of a different woman Alex has fucked illegally. Someone has this information and has decided to reveal that they know she’s just another degenerate. Who is it? Who are you? You could be the blackmailer, male or female. You could be the red head from Steno. She’s a tad crazy, obsessive, and she likes Alex way more than she should. Perhaps she’s pissed that Alex is a bit of a womanizer, and she wants to convince her wayward detective that she’s the only woman who should matter. Tell me who you are and why you sent Alex the photos. What do you intend for her to do? She’s gay, so maybe it’s just about sex. You want to fuck the hot detective who turned you down. You’re such a stud, and it’s obvious the only reason she likes girls is because she hasn’t taken a ride on your magnificent dick. Maybe your the husband of one of Alex’s conquests and you want to punish her for exposing your wife to such disgusting acts. Or maybe your one of the women in those photos, and you hate that you were lead to sin. Or maybe you’re another degenerate and you don’t like the hypocrisy of this detective arresting your friends when she’s participating in the same acts that have been declared immoral and illegal. Who are you?"

I am needing some assistance on filling out my supervision verification forms. I ended supervision with my former supervisor recently in hopes of finishing my last year of my program with a new and different supervision experience. Since I have ended supervision with this person I feel like I have received a condescending and bitter tone from them about questions I need help on. I've come here for help instead as I do not get clear feedback from them since leaving their supervision and cases. I still have about 500 hours of indirect left that I will complete under my new supervisor but I haven't started her supervision yet and I am lost on how to fill out the forms because my last supervisor didn't allow interns to fill them out (they filled them out for us). I am calculating my hours for the verification forms and am unsure of what some things mean.

For the experience verification forms (that i'll be sending in to the BACB):
-does the ""number of independent experience hours accumulated (excluding time spent with sup)"" mean the hours of all my direct PLUS indirect hours combined WITHOUT including the hours I was directly supervised?
-""number of supervision hours accumulated"" means the number of hours that I was directly supervised? (supervisor was present)
-""state the number spent in direct implementation of behavior analytic programs"" - is this just the number of direct hours I provided total? 

For the supervision forms:
-on many of the lines that say ""number of individual supervision hours accumulated"" they wrote for example: 3(included in direct) on many forms of mine so this makes things more confusing for me. I'm really not sure how to calculate my hours for these forms.
I really appreciate any feedback!"

I'm a 24 year old gay cis-male.  I came out this year publicly although I'd been out to my friends for a year or two prior to that.  It's been a long journey of just coming to terms with my sexuality due to the religious brainwashing I was subjected to growing up.  I'm still sort of questioning a lot of things to be honest.  And I realize that it's not something where I can just snap my fingers and have all my questions magically answered but perhaps you'll allow me a venting?  I identify as gay because I feel that it fits me best but it doesn't exactly explain the crushes I've had in the past on a few girls.  I think perhaps I could be like 80-90% gay... Anyways, my preference is for men.  Moving on to my next issue.  I don't really feel like my gender is in question.  Despite never being super masculine, I feel comfortable as being a guy.  I do however enjoy presenting as a bit more feminine and I don't actually know where I want to go with that.  Maybe by me writing down my thoughts, some of you who experience similar things could help explain it to me?  Growing up, I spent lots of time with girls as friends and women of the family.  I spent time with them shopping and such.  I don't know anything about makeup or fashion though.  Lol.  Like I start drawing blanks if someone asks me if something goes with something else.  But when I was a kid I remember getting my ass whipped because I snuck into my older sister's room and painted my nails with her stuff.  I remember being yelled at about how boys don't do that.  Granted, I had pretty fucked up parents but I won't go into that today.  Last summer I got to leave the region for a summer internship and while I was there, I kind of sheepishly asked some of the girls there to let me try on some of their makeup and stuff (eyeliner, eyeshadow) because I was out to everyone there and had always wanted to try it.  Something just clicked with me.  I felt good wearing it.  I loved having makeup on.  Now that I'm out and estranged from my parents, I get to do stuff that I want.  I paint my nails on a regular basis and I even wear lipstick occasionally.  Something about it is very freeing to me.  I don't know if it's because in a way it's me rebelling against the toxic things that I was taught and the hateful people formerly in my life, or if I truly am an effeminate guy and this is me physically expressing what's on the inside.  The irony is that I'm an extremely outdoorsy person and spend lots of time getting dirty out in the woods and stuff.  So you might see me with my nails painted and wearing purple lipstick and at the same time i'm looking through the mud for a snake or a plant I'm searching for, etc.  I'm kind of a walking oxymoron at times.  This weekend a new friend introduced me to Justin Sayre and his order of sodomites channel on youtube and I've been binge watching.  I find him hilarious and seeing this bearded, burly guy wearing jewelry, female clothes and heels kind of opens my mind to the possibilities.  I don't know that I'm wanting to go super femme, but I do want to explore makeup more and like I saw him wearing certain feminine articles of clothing and I was like I want that!  I want to own that and wear it.  It looks nice.  It looks like me.  But I just don't actually know what this all means.  I don't really know how to best explore it.  I don't know what it's going to mean for me socially as I'm in the Deep South where people point and make rude comments if I wear lipstick to the store.  I don't know what it means in terms of WHO and WHAT I am.  I guess I experience toxicity towards feminine gay men enough that I'm scared to go down that road.  I think that's about it.  For those of you who have kept reading this far, thanks dearies.  "

I'm down to 2 cuts left from said pig. My fellow farm hand and I broke down the hog ourselves (she got a half and I got a half). Having zero butchering experience, the cuts a bit... well, odd to say the least. I named one such cut the Bermuda Triangle, because, well I had no clue where it came from. 

The cut in question could be considered an Inside Round roast, having come from the ham / hind leg of the beast. The thought of leaving the leg whole and curing was discussed, but I was a bit transient at the end of last season and so the leg got cut up. 

The cut is rather flat, about 12"" x 9"" and has a good bit of fat throughout. 

I'm debating between smoking it as I would a butt or going the slow cooker route. 

Any thoughts? I'm most concerned about it drying out due to it being so flat. "

-----------------------

* Howard goes on a tirade blasting O&amp;A for 20 minutes, and Opie is very happy to know that O&amp;A are now living rent-free in Howard's head. Even Ant joins in on the excitement, although he adds that Artie Lange is pretty funny and he has no ill-will toward him. A caller adds that west coast show John &amp; Jeff is also bashing O&amp;A lately, causing Jim to go off on the two, who he considers completely irrelevant. Another caller encourages them to tune into J&amp;J and explains that they do a completely corny “we’re too guys” routine. 

* The show has begun using the word ‘dullard’ to describe a person who is dull, despite the fact that this is not what the word means.

* Jimmy turns on Gene Simmons after Gene turned down a photo request off-air. Jim says he’s tired of being nice to celebrities who don’t reciprocate, and he’s tired of being “a worm sometimes”

* [Ashley Simpson bombs at the Orange Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5YPiBx9MJs)

* [Jim first uses Pests to describe fans of show](https://youtu.be/qm1-SBX84TM?t=3h22m10s)

* Opie tries to do a bit where he quizzes Lady Di on trivia. She says she's great at Beatles trivia, so Opie asks her to ask a challenging trivia question to him. She asks, “What album is ‘In My Life’ on?” which immediately ruins Opie’s bit because Opie doesn’t know the album. When Lady Di reveals “Rubber Soul” Ant makes a funny joke about how those are the things that get worn out whenever she walks. A few moments later, Opie goes “Ok…watch this one guys: Lady Di, what’s your favorite Beatles movie?” And she replies “It’s a tie between *Help!* and *A Hard Day’s Night*.” Ant and Jim have to make jokes about the movies to keep the bit rolling, and Opie cuts to a break. 

* [Al Franken calls in](https://youtu.be/OIHbFK8M_50). It's interesting to hear political talk from this era - it seems to reasonable and tame. [During the call, Franken suggests Barack Obama could be a strong candidate](https://youtu.be/ZnGGY92lveo?t=2h55m25s)

* [Verne Troyer drunk on The Surreal Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDXdoRwXj_c&amp;t=1192s)

* Anthony and Jimmy talk in code by using Major Don West from Lost in Space as a metaphor for Opie dating a young blonde woman. At one point, they referenced that Major West (Opie) was hanging out at a skateboard stand. The full details of the story aren’t certain, but it sounds like the mother of the girl referenced is not happy at all with Opie and the major age difference. For a fleeting moment in the shows history, [Opie is mocked as the guy in the show who is chasing women who are way younger than he is.](https://youtu.be/dPl87E-TxFk?t=2h2m54s)

* Whenever Jim says a joke that’s a little too blue for the room, Opie - like clockwork - interjects with “Are you insane?”

* Opie is fascinated by the concept of indulging listeners into the inner workings of the show: “Tearing down the third wall” as he erroneously and idiotically calls it. 

* Joe Rogan's first time calling in is on the 1/13/2005 show. He's enthusiastic, lavishes praise on the boys, and tells them about how awesome DMT is.

* The boys make fun of Erik because he has very poor dental hygeine and his breath constantly smells, to which Erik throws down his headphones and storms away. Opie guiltily admits that Erik is one of the hardest workers on the team and often contributes 16 hours of work per day.

* New Intern Derek is very quick on the soundboard, is a hit with the boys, and becomes close friends with Intern Danny.

* Ant is annoyed at online message boards because they contributors are already starting to compare the XM era to WNEW. The boards complain that WNEW had better guests, but Ant reminds that at first they had to have guys like Kenny Wayne Shepherd on, and it takes a while to get better guests. Opie says he isn’t an angry person anymore and he is happy here, but before at NEW he was angry at how management never seemed to 'get' the show. Opie checked one of the message boards and he says he had to turn it off because he didn’t like how the board was loaded with threads criticizing him and complaining that he did nothing for the show. He insists that a lot of his merit comes from his off-air helping put the show together.

* The show is now opening with ‘enough of this palaver’

* [Jimmy Hates ""The Village""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ9X3H0zJfQ&amp;t=71s)

* CringeHumor.Net is doing a 2004 retrospective awards or something like that. I'll post a Wayback of what the site looked like in the comments below.

* Opie says he cant wait to get his life in order and move back to the suburbs. He says he is going to “figure it out soon”

* Many callers phone in and say they're bummed that there’s no lesbian couch, guess what’s in my pants, and wiffle ball bat challenge anymore.  

* [The Debut of Intern Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs_jnM2GFR8&amp;t=68s). Another new intern Ricky is not mentioned and doesn’t ever make much of a splash with the show 

* O&amp;A love American Idol and they evaluate new contestant [Carrie Underwood's debut](https://youtu.be/v3rGs2VZVcY?t=1h46m11s)

* Opie says that Anthony has a big hog and recounts how back at WAAF they were flirting with a bachelorette party and Anthony showed them his package and they all went “Wow!” Anthony sheepishly says that the circumstances were right for him to show well, and he just got lucky and happened to be plumped enough. Opie says that later on that evening, the girls came over to him to see his dick, so he tried and failed to work his dick into a semi ahead of time but ultimately declined to show them. He then adds that he's a grower, not a shower. 

* [Jimmy fights Canadian caller](https://youtu.be/TtjySFYI4SI)

* After only a few month, it’s not hard to see how Eric Logan has corralled Opie, Anthony, and Jim into liking him and eating out of the palm of his hand. He deftly acts like he’s on the boys’ side by appeasing Opie constantly, treating him like he’s the radio mastermind he sees himself as. Eric plays a joke on Jim by getting Opie in on the joke and pretending to Jim that he must attend 3 hours of sexual hartassment training. Opie is basically in love with E-lo because E-Lo strokes his ego, acts like his friend, and makes Opie think he’s working tirelessly behind the scenes, even though none of the marketing issues Opie's complained about have yet been resolved. 

* [The first major Greggshell of 2005](https://youtu.be/ip_VG3rsezs?t=11m30s). A few days later Opie pronounces colonoscopy as ""colonostopy"" and Jimmy doesn’t correct him. It's likely that this was around the time when Opie asked Jimmy to not mock his speech on air. 

* [One of their early ""You're phone is cutting out"" bits](https://youtu.be/ip_VG3rsezs?t=44m40s) 

* [Proto-Chip?](https://youtu.be/ip_VG3rsezs?t=1h7m36s)

* [Opie discusses ""chemishtree"" among the three, and how the message boards perceive each of them](https://youtu.be/ip_VG3rsezs?t=1h10m58s)

* Opie says that both he and Anthony each did their own ""Buttplug"" radio prank call but Anthony’s was “a little better” so his ended up on the Demented World CD.

* Intern Noah quickly demonstrates his barely closeted homosexuality as he begins putting on women’s clothes for money, claiming he only needs $10 to do it

* [USA for Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_for_Indonesia) results in the termination of Rick Del Gado and is one of the final nails in the coffin of terrestrial shock-jockery.

* They interrogate Intern Noah to determine if he is gay. Intern Danny in particular seems to hate Noah, although his animosity of him does seem to be a mixture of trying to impress O&amp;A combined with a sort of 2nd lowest section of the totem pole bullying.

* Johnny Carson dies and Opie and Anthony mock Jay Leno for how terrible he has been as a late night host.

* [Bob Kelly's ""Not You"" story](https://youtu.be/8oR3RovwCLg)

* Frank the Radio Critic from nyradio message board calls in saying he loves the show now and O&amp;A are the new voices in radio. Apparently he was one of their biggest critics at WNEW, and apparently his opinion meant something at one time.

* Outrage culture is incredibly strong in 2005, but the torchbearers of the era’s culture war are definitively the Christian Right - fighting in favor of censoring things they consider obscene. Various minority organizations are vocal and constantly in the news but their influence seems pretty minimal and don’t seem to represent America at large. This is a pretty stark contrast from the 2010s, in which the entire populous seems to be a scattershot mess of endless complaints and outrage and the Christian Right hasn't had any influence over broadcasting in any form in quite a while. 

* [This clip is played, not sure what the story is behind it](https://youtu.be/H6g9myG4OjQ)

* Opie, when [recounting a story about his trip](https://youtu.be/XKduqMeevKo?t=51m43s) to the Bahamas, refers to a “spliff” as a “spleef”. He later stammers nervously that the Bahamas is like “England or something, it’s like a province of Fr- what?” the cab drivers are “high on some kind of, you know, freaking ... rum or s-somethin."" It was one of the biggest and most concentrated bombardments of idiocy in radio history. 

* [Patrice thinks norton is gay](https://youtu.be/XKduqMeevKo?t=3h15m18s). Earlier in their discussion of relationships Patrice asks Opie if he’s in a relationship and Opie, who briefly admitted earlier in the show that he has been lonely lately, gets gregshelly and goes “thanks for bringing it up.”

* Ant says that most of the people on Wackbag are awesome but there’s a few on there who are awful. Opie adds that the people who nitpick are the worst. Ant admits that he posts under Wackbag as wifflebatlube.

* One of the callers complains that Opie still says “Holy S” despite being on satellite

* During a discussion of American Idol, Sex Bagel plays [“Straight Up” by Paula Abdul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El1kgCqD7Xk), which would come to be his ‘theme song’ later on

* NFL player Tyson Walter has become a friend of the show

* Opie [stutters and fucks up a phrase](https://youtu.be/xzIKoNUna1E?t=1h13m15s) and tries to play it off like he’s choking on food and completely fails because he’s a terrible actor. He also says he will literally pass out if he doesn’t eat on time in the morning.

7iz06i,16,2017-12-10,"Finding myself as a gay guy, exploring my identity",ShriketheSecond,gay,https://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/7iz06i/finding_myself_as_a_gay_guy_exploring_my_identity/,"Hi all.  I'm a 24 year old gay cis-male.  I came out this year publicly although I'd been out to my friends for a year or two prior to that.  It's been a long journey of just coming to terms with my sexuality due to the religious brainwashing I was subjected to growing up.  I'm still sort of questioning a lot of things to be honest.  And I realize that it's not something where I can just snap my fingers and have all my questions magically answered but perhaps you'll allow me a venting?  I identify as gay because I feel that it fits me best but it doesn't exactly explain the crushes I've had in the past on a few girls.  I think perhaps I could be like 80-90% gay... Anyways, my preference is for men.  Moving on to my next issue.  I don't really feel like my gender is in question.  Despite never being super masculine, I feel comfortable as being a guy.  I do however enjoy presenting as a bit more feminine and I don't actually know where I want to go with that.  Maybe by me writing down my thoughts, some of you who experience similar things could help explain it to me?  Growing up, I spent lots of time with girls as friends and women of the family.  I spent time with them shopping and such.  I don't know anything about makeup or fashion though.  Lol.  Like I start drawing blanks if someone asks me if something goes with something else.  But when I was a kid I remember getting my ass whipped because I snuck into my older sister's room and painted my nails with her stuff.  I remember being yelled at about how boys don't do that.  Granted, I had pretty fucked up parents but I won't go into that today.  Last summer I got to leave the region for a summer internship and while I was there, I kind of sheepishly asked some of the girls there to let me try on some of their makeup and stuff (eyeliner, eyeshadow) because I was out to everyone there and had always wanted to try it.  Something just clicked with me.  I felt good wearing it.  I loved having makeup on.  Now that I'm out and estranged from my parents, I get to do stuff that I want.  I paint my nails on a regular basis and I even wear lipstick occasionally.  Something about it is very freeing to me.  I don't know if it's because in a way it's me rebelling against the toxic things that I was taught and the hateful people formerly in my life, or if I truly am an effeminate guy and this is me physically expressing what's on the inside.  The irony is that I'm an extremely outdoorsy person and spend lots of time getting dirty out in the woods and stuff.  So you might see me with my nails painted and wearing purple lipstick and at the same time i'm looking through the mud for a snake or a plant I'm searching for, etc.  I'm kind of a walking oxymoron at times.  This weekend a new friend introduced me to Justin Sayre and his order of sodomites channel on youtube and I've been binge watching.  I find him hilarious and seeing this bearded, burly guy wearing jewelry, female clothes and heels kind of opens my mind to the possibilities.  I don't know that I'm wanting to go super femme, but I do want to explore makeup more and like I saw him wearing certain feminine articles of clothing and I was like I want that!  I want to own that and wear it.  It looks nice.  It looks like me.  But I just don't actually know what this all means.  I don't really know how to best explore it.  I don't know what it's going to mean for me socially as I'm in the Deep South where people point and make rude comments if I wear lipstick to the store.  I don't know what it means in terms of WHO and WHAT I am.  I guess I experience toxicity towards feminine gay men enough that I'm scared to go down that road.  I think that's about it.  For those of you who have kept reading this far, thanks dearies.  "
7izi8j,7,2017-12-10,Graduating college early with no debt! Help me plan my future?,distinguishablepen,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7izi8j/graduating_college_early_with_no_debt_help_me/,"Yeah, I have amazing wonderful parents who scrimped and saved so that this could happen. Plus, I had a big scholarship and worked by butt off to get out of there early to save my parents more. Because of this, my parents are going to continue to pay my rent and other expenses until June 1, 2018. I am one lucky duck. How do I make the most of the paid-for time until June, and what do I do after, to set myself on the best path?

I've applied to grad school for the fall. If I get in, it's fully-funded, and while I'll have to live frugally, I should be able to live off of just that funding for 3 years. I'll just need to finance the move to school and securing a place to live before I start to get paid.

If I don't get in (much more likely - I applied to difficult programs), I want to be able to afford to move to NYC. I know that's almost as expensive as it gets, but that's the goal.

My lease is up in August, which leaves me with 3 months of rent and expenses to pay for on my own until either grad school or hopefully-NYC.

Job situation: 
Paid internship in my field making $550/month
About to start additional part-time job in my field making about $1,200/month
Total monthly income: $1750/month

Bank account balance starting in January:
$3,200

Debts: nothing of any kind!

Expenses from January to June 1:
Only leisure/misc expenses, parents covering all else. I could definitely limit myself to a $600 budget for the 6 months and be more than fine. I could also splurge and spend $1,200 in the 6 months, but I would never spend more than that.

Expenses from June 1 to Aug 31:
Rent: $730/month
Utilities: usually $85/month
Transportation: $120/month
Total medical costs: $100/month (will still be on school insurance)
Gym membership: $45/month
Groceries: Here's one of my big questions. How much? Right now, with my parents reimbursing me, I spend about $200/month. That's with me not limiting myself in any way. I'm physically tiny and could eat just fine as low as $80/month, if I really planned and made some sacrifices.
Leisure/misc: could spend $100/month. Could also stop going out as much and really cut down here, maybe to $40/month?
(parents will be paying phone bill)
One time expense: In August, I'll need to buy another year of daily contact lenses. It's pricey but super worth it in my opinion. $300.

Total summer expenses, lowest and highest estimates: 
$3900 to $4440

I will be leaving both jobs at the end of August, having made something like $11,500 total after taxes. So, with my current bank balance, minus both the high and low ends of what I could spend between June and August, I will end August with around $10,000.

This is plenty to go to grad school with, but the idea of moving to NYC on this amount seems risky. Am I right on that? I would be splitting an apartment with a friend, and we've discussed trying to stick to a $1000-$1200/month budget for rent (yeah I know we're going to end up in an absolutely terrible apartment, but that's ok). I think I would get a job pretty quickly in New York, based on how easily I've gotten internships and work in college, and could do cashier type work if not. But is $10,000 enough to fall back on? (If something went horribly wrong, I would be able to move back in with my parents, which is another very lucky thing, I know.)

However, I might also be able to add to the $10,000 before I move out of my current city. I'm looking into some creative smaller income streams. Or maybe a weekend minimum wage job (although that might get exhausting and ultimately make me more stressed than it's worth, as I'm working 40 hours/week + 10 hours/week commuting, and have never done a full-time schedule before). 

So basically, my questions here: How much should I spend on food in the summer? On fun/misc stuff for the full 7 months? Is $10,000 an okay savings to move to NYC with, if I don't get into grad school, or should I be more aggressive in pursuing additional income? How much is ""enough"" for that move, with a roommate, but without a for-sure job waiting there? 

Should I look into investing? Should I start saving for retirement? Should I do a bit of both, and how much? 

What should my future be??? Thank you!!!"
7j016l,6,2017-12-11,"My [28F] Friend [28M] thinks I am inappropriate to him, and his girlfriend [20sF] thinks I am disrespecting her.",thethrowawayoak,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7j016l/my_28f_friend_28m_thinks_i_am_inappropriate_to/,"So I have known my friend, Neil, on and off for about 5 years. We met when he moved to my city for a 6 month internship and he was my roommate. We got along well, we liked similar things (video games, beer etc..) and my friend group included him. He moved back to his city after his internship ended and we sort of stayed in touch via facebook. He eventually moved back here, but by that time, I was living in a 1 bedroom apartment so we did not become roommates again. We hung out in similar circles though, we have a group chat with our friends and try to hang out as much as possible.

About a year or more ago, he started dating a immigrant girl named Sarah. She was shy and quiet due to a language barrier but otherwise very sweet. I was happy for Neil because they seemed to get along so well and I know he had had some bad luck in the dating world before. They moved in together after while so he could support her while she studied/worked for her citizenship. I didn't see him quite as much after that, but a lot of people tend to settle down after a serious relationship, so whatever.

Last night we went to a friend's Christmas party. My boyfriend of a year [33M] tagged along as he has become quite close with my friend group. I had drank a bit but I wasn't wasted by any means. At one point, I went to go talk to Neil and Sarah who were sitting on the couch. There was no room beside them so I went to sit on the floor in front of them. I had crossed my feet and was lowering myself to a crossed-leg seated position but lost my balance a bit and was falling backwards, I reached out and grabbed Neil's leg for support. I could sort of see he looked upset, so I apologized. I didn't really think anything more of it.

Today, I was hanging out with my best friend and I got a text that said we needed to chat. I kind of knew it could be about the leg thing, but brushed it off as best I could. I was extremely anxious though, because the text was so cryptic and out of the blue. My best friend also knows Neil and Sarah, but was not at the Christmas party, so was unsure what it could be.

We met for coffee, and he told me that he appreciated our friendship and everything I had done for him; but he and his girlfriend thought I was too touchy and inappropriate with him. That I act like he is still single, and his girlfriend doesn't like it. He said it's not a jealousy thing but she thinks I am blatantly disrespecting her. He went on to say that I am touchier with him then any of our other friends, and after Sarah had mentioned it to him, he realized that I have always been this way to him. He said I should be more aware of my actions. We like craft beer and used to play video games as roommates, so in the past, I had made suggestions that we hang out and do those things, but he said that was improper. He has a girlfriend, and we can't hang out one-on-one.

I was really shocked and hurt. I told him I appreciated his honesty, and that he was upfront with me instead of just cutting me out of the friendship. I told him I didn't think I acted any differently with him than my other friends, and I had not meant to hurt Sarah in anyway. I told him that I wasn't trying to offend him, but I have NEVER been attracted to him, and that I loved my boyfriend. I said I would review my actions and act differently, and then abruptly left because I was so embarrassed. 

Look, I get that people have boundaries and respect his wishes. But I have not (purposely, that I can think of?) pet him or touched him sexually. I don't even think I am a very affectionate person, I don't like giving hugs to people. The touching I can think of is more ""buddy-buddy"" style, like patting his back or swinging my arm around his shoulder and saying something stupid, or comically smacking a leg. And yes, if he is upset by that interaction than by all means I will refrain. But I act this way with all my good friends, people I truly trust, male or female. 

I told my boyfriend all this and he was so confused. He never saw any of this inappropriate touching and never thought anything flirtatious was happening between me and Neil. My best friend too was shocked.

Like I said, I will respect his wishes and appreciate his honestly.. but the part that hurts was almost like he insinuated that I couldn't be trusted. He didn't say it but that is how I feel. Like I wanted to break his relationship up given the chance, and would cheat on my boyfriend. None of that is true. And I feel a little insulted that my silly behavior is being seen as disrespectful. Most people describe me as goofy and ""one of the boys"". I have always been myself, and no one has every complained about this to me before.

My question is how do I get past this? I am kind of angry at Neil and Sarah right now and want to distance myself from them for a bit while I get over it. My boyfriend and Best friend know but we agreed to not tell anyone else in our friend group. I don't want anyone to feel awkward, but am I being petty by thinking that I really don't want to see them right now? How do I act around them in the future? I am now scared that anything I say or do will be seen as a slight to Sarah or flirtatious to Neil. I don't want to ruin the friendship, but I am really hurt. I don't think I can ever be as close with them as I was before. Am I being dramatic?

*Edit to Add* there was no sexual tension in the past, at least not on my part. I don't think we ever ""flirted"". I have never liked him romantically, and had always been with a boyfriend even when we lived together. He never mentioned that he, at any point, liked me or had feelings for me; so I don't think it has anything to do with that.
  
  ---

And yes I love parentheses) for expanded experience, and just a general change of culture. I always wanted to do so, in a way where i could help people. I considered peace corps, among other options. After a few years of reading reddit, several sites, expat forums, cost of living comparisons and articles about the economy, looking at the culture and even talking to a few people on skype, I decided to brush up on spanish and contribute my time to teach kids english in south America. And after further research, decided on Bariloche in Argentina, not only for its beauty, but I am not too much attracted to the city life in Buenos Aires.(Though I'd like to visit) I have no teaching experience, so I'd be hoping to pick up a fair few things through osmosis(Unless i can find some class internships around here)

To provide some background context(not sure if it matters) I'm twenty six years of age and currently located in U.S(Pacific Northwest). I've had quite a few entry level jobs, and have always had a side gig as a freelance graphic designer and various other forms of independent contract work. My primary employment background has been in tier one tech/customercare/office environments which has provided great experience for things like contracted data entry jobs. As you may of guessed from my job background i do not have an actual degree(Though, I worked a lot of those entry level jobs with folks who has BAs and 50k plus in student loans) though I find myself both net savvy and resourceful for the most part. I recently got a remote job offer that pays decent...Really not that decent actually, about 12 usd an hour. But as low a wage as that may seem to some people,

 I am indeed a true minimalist. And over the years of working customer care, fast food, office assistant and tech support jobs, whilst contracting on the side...I have accumulated a rather healthy amount of savings. I also just recent I only give you that seemingly irrelevant chunk of background to segway into a few questions, and I'll try to be as detailed and specific to information pertaining to my situation, as I have read through and am fully aware of how many threads there are in this forums that may answer my questions in a broader, less moulded manner.

Also...I'll be with a friend who already visits areas of south america for months at a time for vacations, and hes agreed to stay with me there part of the year, and split living costs.


Firstly, Online TEFL certifications. Now, eventually I will look into getting a CELTA, I have indeed read about the doors it opens, the quality of jobs pay etc. I want to emphasize that I am not too concerned with my quality of workplace. My soul and only motivation is to offer my time, to help. I do not want to dedicate that portion of my savings to that cert at this time. Even if just a portion, I have a full plan on what needs to be done, and can be done with my money, and I have not budgeted for that. My question with all of that in mind... 
In a place like Bariloche, that isn't by any means the ""main city"" will I be able to secure employment with just a TEFL cert??

If not? Am I better off Volunteering? 

Do I increase my chance of teaching if i volunteer? Considering I'll be going over with a part time and a savings its an option i'm willing to take.

Typically, is this work you can have a part time around? (I'm pretty good at managing several jobs, I'm just wondering if its even plausible for me to work 20 or 30 hours and still volunteer/teach

Basically, can I easily find opportunity to do what I want here, if I have rent, food, savings,and additional usd income? Or even WITH everything I've prepared considered, will this take a lot more effort. (I'd like to think being financially and mentally prepared will be enough but perhaps I'm overlooking some things?)

Should I even get an online TEFL? I've read probably close to a hundred threads about it now...And I mean talk about mixed emotions. Will this sheet of paper, regardless of whether or not distributed by an alma mater meet the minimum requirements of some places of employment? Are the opportunities that open up, distinguishably better or more available? Basically, is this certification what some, maybe even less reputable companies need as a write off? Or is even THAT just a ploy to get me to spend 40 dollars on groupon.

Any input, advice or additional resources is also helpful and welcomed. I'm not overly arrogant to feel I have everything worked out. I just want to give you a general idea of where I'm at. 

I really hope I was detailed enough, and that I didn't digress too much whilst trying to provide personal context. I figured, you'd get a better idea of my intentions, and how the information you have may help me if I gave a little summary. Or maybe I just have issues and generally tangent. Either way, thank you so much TEFL reddit community.

7j0qi5,4,2017-12-11,[21 M4F] New to town looking to find that special someone here,atxthrowaway808,atx4atx,https://www.reddit.com/r/atx4atx/comments/7j0qi5/21_m4f_new_to_town_looking_to_find_that_special/,"Hi there! I’m a recent college graduate who moved here from Arizona over the Summer for an internship and ended up getting a job and staying here. I’ve fallen in love with this city and all it offers but I’ve had a really tough time meeting people here, especially women, since I moved and really want to get back into dating again. I work a lot and strange hours sometimes, so along with me being sort of an introvert and not liking to go out by myself it’s been a struggle finding girls I vibe with. I’ve never been into online dating and didn’t like the tinder community for the most part as I’m looking for a relationship more than a fan or hookup and felt the app was based almost purely off physical attraction which I don’t agree with. But I have always loved the Reddit community and found this subreddit and am hoping this gives me a better chance of finding someone with the same interests as me. I’ll try to write as much as I can about myself without writing a full novel to find someone interested in getting together.

But first off what I’m looking for is a girl near my age 18-24, looking for a romantic relationship and interested in getting to know each other and go grab a drink or coffee sometime soon and see if we share the same interests and click well. I’m open to all sorts of girls and am not a stuck up guy. I’m more interested to find someone I can vibe with on a mental and romantic level more so than a physical level. I’m open to anyone who’s down to vibe together and see where things go, if we aren’t attracted to each other in that way I’m more than happy to find someone to be platonic friends with too and get to know more people here.

A little bit about me is that I’m 5’10, 145lb, sorta skinny, white, blonde, and have blue eyes. I consider myself an introverted-extrovert, I don’t enjoy going out by myself and can be shy around people I don’t know, but I do enjoy spending time and going out with people I care about and open up very easily when I’m with people I vibe with. I love to cuddle and talk and watch Netflix just as much as I like to go out to a show and catch a band. I’m a huge music fanatic and am an audio engineer and my goal right now is to work in the music industry as a live sound engineer one day, that being said my favorite genres of music to listen to are indie rock and a lot of different forms of EDM. I spend the majority of my free time producing music, primarily drum n bass and house and when I lived in Arizona I DJ’d raves on a regular basis and would love to get back to playing shows when I get established here. Some of my favorite artists to listen to include MGMT, Tame Impala, Starfucker, Walker and Royce, Camo &amp; Krooked, Etherwood, Fisher and way too many more to name and am always looking for new music to listen to. Outside of making music some of my hobbies include playing video games (Primarily Xbox), Football (Big AZ Cardinals and Note Dame Fan), walking the city and river, drinking nice craft beer or whiskey (Would love someone to hit Rainey Street with), wishing I could afford new audio gear, I’ve been getting back into working out for the first time in awhile, and binging TV shows on Netflix or Hulu (Huge fan of Lost, GoT, Shameless, Breaking Bad, and my favorite series of all time is Avatar: The Last Airbender). 

Some things that might turn someone off of me to warn you is that I do smoke cigarettes, it’s a horrible habit I picked up when I was in High School but I’ve been cutting down and have been making good progress in quitting, I do smoke weed occasionally, I used to smoke A LOT, like multiple times daily when I lived in Arizona but have cut down tremendously to once every week or so since I moved here, and also a few times a year, like 5 or 6 I like to have experiences with a few different substances almost solely LSD and mushrooms. I’m not a heavy drug user in any form and am a huge supporter of drug use safety, moderation, and using them in a positive way for both spiritual and mental exploration and growth, and I owe some very positive transformations in my life and beliefs to experimenting responsibly with primarily psychedelics in High School and College. You must be OK with me choosing what to do with my body occasionally but I do not ask for you to have to partake with me but I do think it’d be a plus to find someone with the same views on drugs and down to have beautiful experiences a few times a year.

I’m not a religious individual but I am very spiritual and open about my beliefs, I guess you could say I am agnostic and do believe that there is a spiritual level to this universe and many things us humans will never be able to understand. That being said I’m not someone who hates on organized religion or anything I think all religions when followed the way they were founded all preach damn similar ideas and when used correctly and positively does great things for people and am not against being with someone that considers themselves religious. I greatly prefer to have deep conversations over small talk, I want someone who wants to talk about and are interested in space, god, psychology, philosophy, and the nature of this universe we got stuck in. This is probably most important for me to find in someone. 

Anyways I feel like I’ve written way too much, the only other things I think are important to know is that I live downtown and work down here as an audio engineer and AV Technician, I do not have a car but am willing to uber if not insanely far, and I am an absolutely terrible dancer so don’t ask me to go dancing right away but I’d love to learn and get better haha. Send me a private message and a little about yourself and let’s talk if I sound like someone who you’d want to get to know, hope to hear from someone soon!"

Hola again! So if anyone was curious, those internship opportunities didn't work out for me sadly; I know y'all were tuning in to see how that went am I right? Haha, well more positive and exciting news has been happening with my aunt!

So between my last update and Thanksgiving, a couple more occasions occurred where I'd be sent a picture here and there of her naked body (some of her fingers rubbing her pussy or her tweaking her nipples). One that really stood out to me was a video that has been huge jackoff material for me; a video my uncle sent me of him sliding in and out of the familiar pussy I've been seeing and him cumming deep inside her. He pulled out and showed his cum leaking from her then my aunt scooped up some of it and tasted it. This is hot in general between anyone, but seeing my aunt and uncle doing this was just insane! 

They know I've been liking it with the texts I've been sending back just reacting like a kid on Christmas (emphasizing how hot, kinky, and awesome my aunt and uncle were). I knew Thanksgiving was coming so that was a definite time I'd be seeing them. I would've been going to their house to visit more, but I did have classes and work still to worry about and finals were coming up after Thanksgiving.

Thanksgiving rolls around and this time we had it at my aunt's house. Plans that day was to have Thanksgiving lunch around 1, go see the new Thor, and come back for board games and drinking. I offered to get there early to help set up and they gladly accepted. I get there for 11 and I'm welcomed to my aunt at the door. I asked where uncle was and he was out getting the drinks for tonight. We start hugging and all I was thinking about were the photos and videos I've been sent so I had a hard on. This was a tight hug so she definitely felt it pressed against her thigh. 

""Someone's excited to see me,"" my aunt said.

I could feel my face getting hotter from blushing.

""Yah all of this has been really hot for me.""

""Don't think you're the only one, I'm already soaking down there."" We were still holding each other and I could feel her push into me more. My first instinct was to grab her ass and pull her into me more which made her moan a little.

""Can I kiss you?"" I asked.

""Just do it, don't ask.""

I positioned my head to look at her and I planted my lips onto hers. I felt her tongue touching my lips and I instantly opened my mouth more to let her in. Our tongues ended up dancing and we were there making out at the front door almost grinding into each other. She took her hand that wax behind my head and started to feel my dick through my pants. 

""Mmmmm feels bigger than the pictures,"" she reacted to then went back for more kisses. 

That comment made me squeeze her ass a little more which made her moan. She slid her hand up a little and unbuttoned my pants like a pro. She didn't unzip my pants, instead she squeezed her hand through my pants and boxers and started to stroke all the way down my length. All of this was so hot I felt like I would explode. She got to my head, squeezed it a few times, and retreated her hand out of my pants. She stopped our kiss and took her precum covered fingers into her mouth to taste me and said how delicious I tasted. 

""I think you should go take care of that before you start helping with setting up lunch,"" my aunt said.

""Can I see what you taste like first?"" I asked almost begging.

She smirked, let go of our hug, and took off her panties from under her skirt. She handed them to me and pushed me in the direction of the guest room. 

""Be quick, the table needs to be set up and ready.""  

I started going towards the guest room and exclaimed that I loved her with which she replied with the same. I shut the door behind me and I went to town with the panties first being tasted, then wrapped around my cock. Near the end, I got a video from my aunt penetrating herself with a big pink dildo. It was going deep inside her and some white cream can be seen on the dildo.

""Can I please come see this in person?"" I asked.

""Yes you may.""

I left the guest room so close to coming, went upstairs, and opened the door to my aunt on the bed with her skirt hiked up, impaling herself with the dildo. Me entering the room didn't stop her at all, it only sped her up. 

""Where can I sit?""

""You can lay near me.""

I get on her bed and take my cock back out to finish myself. I can hear her pussy making so much noise which turned me on like crazy. When I looked up to her face, she was looking straight at my cock which I was stroking up and down; sometimes squeezing my head to stimulate more and get more juices. We made eye contact at one point and that set me off. She saw this, got up, and grabbed my cock to put inside her mouth. I started cumming so hard. She had her lips wrapped around the tip of my head and sucked out and cum I had left. At the end of my climax, she licked my head which made me moan. I looked down at her pussy and she was still riding and grinding on her dildo until I felt her shake and grind slower into her dildo. I could tell she was finishing as well and my first instinct was to kiss her. I went in and began to kiss her softly and our tongues danced again. I could taste my cum in her mouth which I though was really hot.

Her climax started to go away and we separated our lips to look at each other. 

""Sorry I wrapped my mouth around you without asking,"" my aunt said a little guilty.

""Don't be, I would have stopped it if I didn't want it.""

We looked into each other's eyes more and then she looked at the time. It read 11:40ish.

""Shit, I need to freshen up and prepare the apple pies. And you mister need to get going with the dishes and silverware."" 

She got up off the bed almost instantly while I was still recovering from that intense scene. I was on my stomach and after she changed she still saw me laying there on my stomach. 

""Get your butt moving,"" she playfully yelled and smacked my ass. I hauled out of there like a pony and began setting everything up. Not soon after, uncle makes it back from the liquor store and we have our standard greetings. Nothing else notable happens almost the whole day after that event with my aunt. All the plans we had came through and our whole family had a great day catching up and enjoying each other's company. Drinking together as a family was a blast while we played Taboo (such a fitting name for the situation, and one of my favorite games). Everyone had great laughs and when the night was coming to a close, I got the hint  that my uncle was clued into what happened that day with his wife and I when he thanked me for all the help I gave them today, emphasizing the word 'all'. 

Since Thanksgiving and now, I just finished up all my finals and have been getting more and more interesting photos and videos from them. I haven't been looking at porn since all of this began because this material can never be compared with normal porn. I've been keeping them updated with how I was doing in my finals and they would want me to take a break from all the stress. The day I was told I got declined my internship, the compensation for that was a video of my favorite position my aunt and uncle were doing (girl on her side while the guy was upright, fucking from behind. Almost like spooning. That finished with cum filling my aunt.)

Now that I'm done with finals and I'm on break, I see myself having a lot more time to see how this whole thing will develop. 

TLDR; Thanksgiving day, aunt and I masturbated together and she tasted my cum.

7j1o4e,1,2017-12-11,During the Play 'Death of A Salesman' I Was Sexually Harassed By Dustin Hoffman Night After Night - by Kathryn Rossetter (Hollywood Reporter) 8 Dec 2017,FinnagainsAwake,AnythingGoesUltimate,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesUltimate/comments/7j1o4e/during_the_play_death_of_a_salesman_i_was/,"In 1983, I was an aspiring actress in New York City. I did not have the privilege of going to Yale or Juilliard. I studied privately and pounded the pavement trying to get work. I had little-to-no real experience (other than one show) when I submitted my picture and resume in the hopes of securing an audition for a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman, starring Dustin Hoffman. I had played Maggie in After the Fall, also written by Arthur Miller. Miller had come to see it and was highly complimentary of my work, so I took a chance that he might take notice of my submission.

A miracle! I was being called in to read for Willy Loman’s mistress, ""the Woman In Boston."" I was much too young but felt the opportunity alone was the reward so I prepared and went. To my surprise, Dustin was reading with everyone. I was the last actress to read. He was silly and fun, and we did the scene and I laughed and he went crazy. “I love that laugh. I want her, I want her!” I couldn’t believe my ears. The director felt I was far too young and wanted another actress. Final callbacks were four days later. Dustin told me to get a wig and age makeup and to look older when I came back. The night before my final audition, he called me and said he and his makeup artist were coming to my apartment to get me ready. I was astounded. It was a little bizarre. She stuffed towels into a body stocking so I would look fatter, did my wig and aged me. Frankly, I looked like Tootsie. Thus, I went to the callback the next day.

After my turn, I was released. A half-hour later I got a call saying I needed to hurry back to the theater. I did, wig in hand. All the other actresses were gone. I had to read again. They openly argued about me in front of me. They made me take off my dress so the producer and director could see me stuffed with towels in my body stocking. Then there was another hushed meeting of the men and they offered me the job — if I would gain 12 pounds. I was dumbstruck. I was going to be on Broadway in one of the most iconic revivals of the time. Dustin took me to his home for dinner to meet his wife and called my mother to tell her I was going to be on Broadway. The whole experience was overwhelming. He was my hero.

Three days later, during the first week of rehearsals, he took me to lunch. Walking back to rehearsal, he said he had to stop by his hotel room to pick up something he forgot. I asked, ""Why a hotel room?"" He only lived a little over a mile away. He said so he could take naps at lunch, if needed, and when they were working on scenes he wasn’t in he could go there and relax and study his lines.

When we stepped into the room, he jumped on the bed and said, ""Give me a back rub."" He pulled off his shirt. I didn’t know what to do. I said we had to be back at rehearsal in 15 minutes. He said, ""Just a quickie."" I was a nervous wreck, but sat on the bed and gave a very lame rub. The maid walked in and I almost fainted. He laughed. As we prepared to leave, he looked at me and said, “Now we have our 'hotel room.'” Ah, I thought — Method Acting! I was his mistress and our scenes were set in a hotel room and Biff walks in. He told me to return to rehearsal a few minutes after he did and left me there.

That was the beginning of what was to become a horrific, demoralizing and abusive experience at the hands (literally) of one of my acting idols.

Since they loved my laugh, it was decided that I would stand in the wings on stage left at a mic and laugh on cue in a memory scene being played out on the stage. My laugh had to be choreographed and timed. That scene led directly into the scene in the second act with Dustin and me in the hotel room and Biff walking in on us. My costume was a vintage slip, no bra, garter belt and stockings. The wing space was limited, so directly behind me was a chair where Dustin would sit, with his dresser in attendance, to take water and a short rest before our final scene together.

One night in Chicago, I felt his hand up under my slip on the inside of my thighs. I was completely surprised and tried to bat him away while watching the stage for my cues. After the show he was busy with the producer and director so I had no access to him to address it. It then happened almost every show. Six to eight shows a week. I couldn’t speak to him in the moment because I was on a live mic. He kept it up and got more and more aggressive. One night he actually started to stick his fingers inside me. Night after night I went home and cried. I withdrew and got depressed and did not have any good interpersonal relationships with the cast. How could the same man who fought to get me the job, who complimented my work, who essentially launched my career, who gave me the benefit of his wisdom as an actor, how could he also be this sexual power abuser? Was I doing something? Was it my fault?

The groping continued. After the shows at parties, whenever he had a picture taken with me, he would put his arm around my rib cage and then grab my breast just before they snapped the picture and then remove it. He was very skilled at dropping his hand just as the picture snapped to avoid it being recorded. But it was pre-digital. You didn’t know what was there until they were developed. Only by luck do I have one such picture — where the camera caught him in the act. A picture I had taken with hopes of sending it to my family. A millisecond in time. There I am — big smile and my arm moving toward his with the intention to push it away. But caught as it is, it seems I’m complicit with the gesture. I was not. Not ever.

Everyone around always laughed when he did this. Does that make him just a jokester? Or is he extremely smart choosing when and how to pursue his actions? Everyone standing around laughing worked for him. He gave us gifts, paid for parties. Bait and switch.

I have a quick wit and my humor is my first line of defense. It’s how I survive. I tried everything to get him to stop. I tried to laugh it off, smack him and say witty, pointed things. I begged him nicely with tears in my eyes to please stop it. To no avail.

His dresser came to me during the show one night. Dustin wanted to see me in an offstage dressing room where he rested while the scene in the kitchen with mom and the boys took place. I thought he wanted to give me a note on our first scene. But he wanted me to rub his feet. Get on my knees and rub his feet. I froze. I gave a little foot rub and ran out. His dresser would then continue to come get me whenever Dustin felt like it. Whenever possible, I hid and tried not to be found. But the boss was relentless. Dustin would whisper, “higher, higher,” trying to get me to move up his pants legs toward his genitals. I didn’t do it. I would stop at his calves. I understand how women say they just go inside themselves to another place as a form of protection, to distance themselves from the abuse. I felt trapped. We were just a few feet from the stage and I couldn’t say anything for fear it would be heard on stage or in the audience. His dresser stood guard outside the door.

Then one night I was in my position at the mic preparing for my laughing scene. Dustin arrived and took his seat behind me. There was an unusual number of the crew backstage that night — men who were not needed until intermission or the end of the show. Dustin started his grope. I started my batting him away and laughing on cue. Suddenly he grabs the bottom of my slip and pulls it up over my head, exposing my breasts and body to the crew and covering my face. I missed one of my laugh cues. Dustin had spread the word to the crew to come backstage at that time for a surprise. What a jokester. Mr. Fun. It was sickening.

After the show, one of the actors in the stage scene screamed at me and accused me of being totally unprofessional because I missed my cue. I tried to tell him what happened and he said it was my fault and walked away.

When at last I found an opportunity, I pushed Dustin up against the wall screaming, ""Fuck you! How would you like it if someone did that to you before you walked out on stage every night, Mr. Method Actor? Leave me alone!"" He did... for three days. And then it was back to groping as usual.

By the time we got to the Kennedy Center, I considered reporting him to Actors Equity. But I was cautioned by some respected theatre professionals that if I did, I would probably lose my job and, because he was such a powerful star, any hope of a career. It was Dustin's playpen. He controlled the purse strings. I now knew I was alone and didn’t know what to do to survive.

I returned to acting by day and crying by night. I hardened. The play closed. We reunited to film the television movie a month later. My work shot out in three days so I had no knowledge of his treatment of interns or any other women. Nothing I hear surprises me. My experience filming was fine. I loved working with director Volker Schlondorff. (I was horrified and saddened when I saw his defense of Dustin. He uses his public forum to discredit a woman — a girl at the time — and discuss something without any of the facts. Disrespectful to everyone involved. Seems like Dustin is Teflon.)

In the fall of 1985, we screened the film. I was very proud of my work and secretly sighed with relief that I would never see anyone involved in this project again. As Dustin was leaving, a photographer stopped him and asked for a picture with me and another actress from the film. He stood between us and put his arms around our rib cages. On cue, he grabbed our breasts. Without thinking, a knee-jerk response built up over two years, I grabbed his crotch. How would he like some of his own medicine? In that moment I understood how women abused for many years by husbands or boyfriends will pick up a gun or a knife and suddenly attack back. I also knew I had snapped and what I had done was awful. I was terrified and humiliated. My pathetic attempt at fighting back could have horrible repercussions. After all, I was not a jokester, or famous or powerful. I went home and cried for hours.

The dust settled and I did another show with wonderful actors who were healthy and professional. Three months after the party I was in a restaurant with fellow actors when another friend came racing in with a Playboy magazine. There in the back was a picture of me and Dustin and the other actress and I am apparently, gleefully grabbing his genitals. Yes, the millisecond had caught the act. But it hadn’t captured the story. The caption was to indicate how fun-loving we serious theater people are. And it read, “Reviving a dead Salesman."" All my friends could say was, ""Oh my God, your career is over."" How ironic. Abused women who fight back usually go to jail.

The next day I got a call from my mother in Florida. “Kathy, what are you doing in Playboy?” “Mom, what are you doing reading it?” Someone in her bridge club had brought it to her. I had never said a word to my family about the abuse. My mother was a very, very reserved, proper woman. I felt sick. I told her a condensed version of the story. After what seemed like an interminable pause, she said, “Good for you. But don’t tell your father."" She died four years later. My father is 91 and neither he nor my three brothers know this story.

I wrote a one-woman show in the early 2000s looking at themes from my life and my relationship with my mother. I included the story about the Playboy picture because it was hugely relevant to my show and my life. I was presenting readings of my piece around New York as I developed it and it was getting a very good response.

Two days after a reading I got a call from my agent that Dustin’s office had heard of a reading of a film script I had written and were very interested in seeing it. My agent was excited. I paused. Then it dawned on me. Did he want to see the script so his lawyers could issue an injunction? Sue me? Who knows what. All those years later, was he still manipulating his power? I said, ""Tell them I have no film"" (as indeed I didn’t). I stopped working on my show. So he got what he wanted.

I’ve always wondered if he prevented other women from coming forward through similar intimidation. After all, I have no money and no power.

Now it’s 2017. Harvey has opened a floodgate. But as I write this, Dustin still seems immune.

It was a long time ago. This is not the red badge of courage I have worn for 32 years. I buried it deep. I am a tough dame... now. I continue to read the accolades pouring forth for him: Generous to a fault, kind, best man to work with. Women are overly sensitive to dirty jokes. Toughen up, ladies, etc. There is no denying I learned an enormous amount from him about acting. He was generous in the many presents he gave us and the many parties he threw. He can do all that and still be a man who manipulates, abuses his power and is a pig to women. They are not mutually exclusive.

My issue isn’t what he said, it’s what he did. Along with the nightly sexual harassment, he eroded my confidence, my dignity. He humiliated and demeaned me. He robbed me of my joy in the experience and he left dirty fingerprints on my soul.

I guess those were lessons, too.

7j1pmx,1,2017-12-11,During the Play 'Death of A Salesman' I Was Sexually Harassed By Dustin Hoffman Night After Night - by Kathryn Rossetter (Hollywood Reporter) 8 Dec 2017,FinnagainsAwake,Drudge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drudge/comments/7j1pmx/during_the_play_death_of_a_salesman_i_was/,"In 1983, I was an aspiring actress in New York City. I did not have the privilege of going to Yale or Juilliard. I studied privately and pounded the pavement trying to get work. I had little-to-no real experience (other than one show) when I submitted my picture and resume in the hopes of securing an audition for a Broadway revival of Death of a Salesman, starring Dustin Hoffman. I had played Maggie in After the Fall, also written by Arthur Miller. Miller had come to see it and was highly complimentary of my work, so I took a chance that he might take notice of my submission.

A miracle! I was being called in to read for Willy Loman’s mistress, ""the Woman In Boston."" I was much too young but felt the opportunity alone was the reward so I prepared and went. To my surprise, Dustin was reading with everyone. I was the last actress to read. He was silly and fun, and we did the scene and I laughed and he went crazy. “I love that laugh. I want her, I want her!” I couldn’t believe my ears. The director felt I was far too young and wanted another actress. Final callbacks were four days later. Dustin told me to get a wig and age makeup and to look older when I came back. The night before my final audition, he called me and said he and his makeup artist were coming to my apartment to get me ready. I was astounded. It was a little bizarre. She stuffed towels into a body stocking so I would look fatter, did my wig and aged me. Frankly, I looked like Tootsie. Thus, I went to the callback the next day.

After my turn, I was released. A half-hour later I got a call saying I needed to hurry back to the theater. I did, wig in hand. All the other actresses were gone. I had to read again. They openly argued about me in front of me. They made me take off my dress so the producer and director could see me stuffed with towels in my body stocking. Then there was another hushed meeting of the men and they offered me the job — if I would gain 12 pounds. I was dumbstruck. I was going to be on Broadway in one of the most iconic revivals of the time. Dustin took me to his home for dinner to meet his wife and called my mother to tell her I was going to be on Broadway. The whole experience was overwhelming. He was my hero.

Three days later, during the first week of rehearsals, he took me to lunch. Walking back to rehearsal, he said he had to stop by his hotel room to pick up something he forgot. I asked, ""Why a hotel room?"" He only lived a little over a mile away. He said so he could take naps at lunch, if needed, and when they were working on scenes he wasn’t in he could go there and relax and study his lines.

When we stepped into the room, he jumped on the bed and said, ""Give me a back rub."" He pulled off his shirt. I didn’t know what to do. I said we had to be back at rehearsal in 15 minutes. He said, ""Just a quickie."" I was a nervous wreck, but sat on the bed and gave a very lame rub. The maid walked in and I almost fainted. He laughed. As we prepared to leave, he looked at me and said, “Now we have our 'hotel room.'” Ah, I thought — Method Acting! I was his mistress and our scenes were set in a hotel room and Biff walks in. He told me to return to rehearsal a few minutes after he did and left me there.

That was the beginning of what was to become a horrific, demoralizing and abusive experience at the hands (literally) of one of my acting idols.

Since they loved my laugh, it was decided that I would stand in the wings on stage left at a mic and laugh on cue in a memory scene being played out on the stage. My laugh had to be choreographed and timed. That scene led directly into the scene in the second act with Dustin and me in the hotel room and Biff walking in on us. My costume was a vintage slip, no bra, garter belt and stockings. The wing space was limited, so directly behind me was a chair where Dustin would sit, with his dresser in attendance, to take water and a short rest before our final scene together.

One night in Chicago, I felt his hand up under my slip on the inside of my thighs. I was completely surprised and tried to bat him away while watching the stage for my cues. After the show he was busy with the producer and director so I had no access to him to address it. It then happened almost every show. Six to eight shows a week. I couldn’t speak to him in the moment because I was on a live mic. He kept it up and got more and more aggressive. One night he actually started to stick his fingers inside me. Night after night I went home and cried. I withdrew and got depressed and did not have any good interpersonal relationships with the cast. How could the same man who fought to get me the job, who complimented my work, who essentially launched my career, who gave me the benefit of his wisdom as an actor, how could he also be this sexual power abuser? Was I doing something? Was it my fault?

The groping continued. After the shows at parties, whenever he had a picture taken with me, he would put his arm around my rib cage and then grab my breast just before they snapped the picture and then remove it. He was very skilled at dropping his hand just as the picture snapped to avoid it being recorded. But it was pre-digital. You didn’t know what was there until they were developed. Only by luck do I have one such picture — where the camera caught him in the act. A picture I had taken with hopes of sending it to my family. A millisecond in time. There I am — big smile and my arm moving toward his with the intention to push it away. But caught as it is, it seems I’m complicit with the gesture. I was not. Not ever.

Everyone around always laughed when he did this. Does that make him just a jokester? Or is he extremely smart choosing when and how to pursue his actions? Everyone standing around laughing worked for him. He gave us gifts, paid for parties. Bait and switch.

I have a quick wit and my humor is my first line of defense. It’s how I survive. I tried everything to get him to stop. I tried to laugh it off, smack him and say witty, pointed things. I begged him nicely with tears in my eyes to please stop it. To no avail.

His dresser came to me during the show one night. Dustin wanted to see me in an offstage dressing room where he rested while the scene in the kitchen with mom and the boys took place. I thought he wanted to give me a note on our first scene. But he wanted me to rub his feet. Get on my knees and rub his feet. I froze. I gave a little foot rub and ran out. His dresser would then continue to come get me whenever Dustin felt like it. Whenever possible, I hid and tried not to be found. But the boss was relentless. Dustin would whisper, “higher, higher,” trying to get me to move up his pants legs toward his genitals. I didn’t do it. I would stop at his calves. I understand how women say they just go inside themselves to another place as a form of protection, to distance themselves from the abuse. I felt trapped. We were just a few feet from the stage and I couldn’t say anything for fear it would be heard on stage or in the audience. His dresser stood guard outside the door.

Then one night I was in my position at the mic preparing for my laughing scene. Dustin arrived and took his seat behind me. There was an unusual number of the crew backstage that night — men who were not needed until intermission or the end of the show. Dustin started his grope. I started my batting him away and laughing on cue. Suddenly he grabs the bottom of my slip and pulls it up over my head, exposing my breasts and body to the crew and covering my face. I missed one of my laugh cues. Dustin had spread the word to the crew to come backstage at that time for a surprise. What a jokester. Mr. Fun. It was sickening.

After the show, one of the actors in the stage scene screamed at me and accused me of being totally unprofessional because I missed my cue. I tried to tell him what happened and he said it was my fault and walked away.

When at last I found an opportunity, I pushed Dustin up against the wall screaming, ""Fuck you! How would you like it if someone did that to you before you walked out on stage every night, Mr. Method Actor? Leave me alone!"" He did... for three days. And then it was back to groping as usual.

By the time we got to the Kennedy Center, I considered reporting him to Actors Equity. But I was cautioned by some respected theatre professionals that if I did, I would probably lose my job and, because he was such a powerful star, any hope of a career. It was Dustin's playpen. He controlled the purse strings. I now knew I was alone and didn’t know what to do to survive.

I returned to acting by day and crying by night. I hardened. The play closed. We reunited to film the television movie a month later. My work shot out in three days so I had no knowledge of his treatment of interns or any other women. Nothing I hear surprises me. My experience filming was fine. I loved working with director Volker Schlondorff. (I was horrified and saddened when I saw his defense of Dustin. He uses his public forum to discredit a woman — a girl at the time — and discuss something without any of the facts. Disrespectful to everyone involved. Seems like Dustin is Teflon.)

In the fall of 1985, we screened the film. I was very proud of my work and secretly sighed with relief that I would never see anyone involved in this project again. As Dustin was leaving, a photographer stopped him and asked for a picture with me and another actress from the film. He stood between us and put his arms around our rib cages. On cue, he grabbed our breasts. Without thinking, a knee-jerk response built up over two years, I grabbed his crotch. How would he like some of his own medicine? In that moment I understood how women abused for many years by husbands or boyfriends will pick up a gun or a knife and suddenly attack back. I also knew I had snapped and what I had done was awful. I was terrified and humiliated. My pathetic attempt at fighting back could have horrible repercussions. After all, I was not a jokester, or famous or powerful. I went home and cried for hours.

The dust settled and I did another show with wonderful actors who were healthy and professional. Three months after the party I was in a restaurant with fellow actors when another friend came racing in with a Playboy magazine. There in the back was a picture of me and Dustin and the other actress and I am apparently, gleefully grabbing his genitals. Yes, the millisecond had caught the act. But it hadn’t captured the story. The caption was to indicate how fun-loving we serious theater people are. And it read, “Reviving a dead Salesman."" All my friends could say was, ""Oh my God, your career is over."" How ironic. Abused women who fight back usually go to jail.

The next day I got a call from my mother in Florida. “Kathy, what are you doing in Playboy?” “Mom, what are you doing reading it?” Someone in her bridge club had brought it to her. I had never said a word to my family about the abuse. My mother was a very, very reserved, proper woman. I felt sick. I told her a condensed version of the story.

Now it’s 2017. Harvey has opened a floodgate. But as I write this, Dustin still seems immune.

It was a long time ago. This is not the red badge of courage I have worn for 32 years. I buried it deep. I am a tough dame... now. I continue to read the accolades pouring forth for him: Generous to a fault, kind, best man to work with. Women are overly sensitive to dirty jokes. Toughen up, ladies, etc. There is no denying I learned an enormous amount from him about acting. He was generous in the many presents he gave us and the many parties he threw. He can do all that and still be a man who manipulates, abuses his power and is a pig to women. They are not mutually exclusive.

7j2bja,5,2017-12-11,Crypto Adventures,Alexcamill,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7j2bja/crypto_adventures/,"Bitcoin price was around 4$. It was already a few months since I was mining casually with old hardware and raspberry pi, but I wanted to step up.
At the time I just ended the Sixth month of my first internship, working 40h a week for 365€/month. I remember ordering my first ASIC miners, sweaty hands, shaking, what was I doing. If anyone discovered about my endeavors there were gonna question my sanity, I had to keep this under the radar.
I was gonna throw all my hard earned money into this technology I was so excited about. Silk road even offered EveOnline ISK, or steam CD Keys for bitcoin. I felt like this investment would provide me with entertainment, plus I was excited in the tech, running a mining op, playing with Linux.
I also liked this idea of a separate economy, where I can be free of taking risk and earning rewards.
To put it simply, this was an entrance portal to the wild west in a boring life.

#ButterflyLabs
ButterflyLabs was a wonderfull company. I remember the endless mails, the 6 months waiting for the actual devices. They restructured the site in between… What a mess.
Notice the international priority for a 6 months delayed shipment.I was so stressed about it being a scam (future proved me right), it was the first batch of product they were selling.
In the end, I received two miners instead of one. Out of stupidity I contacted them about it, and what they did was… refunding me the first one I paid for.

#The mining op
It wasn’t fun to have these machine running day and night in a small appartement, the noise was like having a bunch of hair driers running constantly.
That was the price for buying steam CDkey thought.
https://imgur.com/a/Xyi55

Bitcoin price was around 10$ at that time.
I was mining 0.1 per hours on slushpool If I remember correctly. What a time to be alive.
By the time, people started knowing what I was doing, and familly and friends started to worry. I received many pressure at that time to stop this madness and liquidate.

And when I saw the new rise of the bitcoin I did, looking for a way out, too weak to wistand everybody else.
At 35$ I sold 20BTC, and sold the miner too on a craiglist equivalent for 500$.
I was ecstatic, and people didn't believe me when I saw I had made 1200$.

Needless to say, I regret.
Not to waste 100' of BTC in stupid things, this was needed for BTC to live, but to stop this passion just because of peers pressure.

They all apologies recently, that's why I thought again of this, and I also read on reddit the story of a guy suiciding over lost BTC. 

When the cryptoworld will be a thing, we will put a name on this people who lost/wasted bitcoins in the early stages.

The G.O.P. hasn't learnt any lesson after sending a 'grabber of women' called Trump to the White House.,ihatejoemcCarthy,democrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/7j2c1g/trump_and_the_republicans_are_trying_to_send_a/,"Our illegitimate president Trump who got a B.S., read that as Bull Shit degree from Wharton, the college he got admitted because of his rich daddy's moneyed contribution and his influence, is now on his way to define the Republican party he inherited after dallying with the Democrats most of his life in New York.

Most of the Republicans, in congress and outside are so spineless and so clueless as to how their party should run, have lately embraced Trumpology as a theology.

The ideology which founded this party from the beginning with Abe Lincoln as the 'slave masters' slayers, is totally absent from the current Republicans.

No wonder the current masters of the G.O.P. are going all out to elect a thoroughly 'homophobic,Islamophobic,sexist,racist apologist and accused pedophile', as is written in today's NYT, with money and all out support. 

And their president Trump who has repeatedly confessed with total pride in his voice in private encounters and in video tapes that he's not only a pedophile, he's also the biggest grabber of women's body parts and ""Since I'm a celebrity. They (the women) don't object.""

So what we can see here in very clear terms that the Republican party as we knew then is not a party with any moral values anymore where even a centrist Senator called Susan Collins from Maine can be bought by their very vile and evil President called Trump with the money he made who knows how because he won't show his tax returns.

And if Roy Moore really goes to the Senate, our young female interns should run from the Capitol as their virginity will definitely be taken away by this pedophile from Alabama just like what all the virgin girls working in White House did it as soon as Trump moved in there."

You hear my voice through the intercom on your desk ""Emily, you are 1 minute late you better hurry up"". You know what it means...

You put the gag you received when your internship begun, you check that the clamps on your nipples are still in position -you don't feel them very well after wearing them all day- and you don't have to check, you already know that your plug makes a bulge on the back of your short skirt.

While walking to my desktop you see yourself in the glass of a big open space: you look tired it's just the middle of the week and you already can't wait for the weekend to come. Your white shirt has a weird stain from your last meeting this afternoon, has usual your skirt is way too short to be ""professionnal"" and your high hells just hurt your feet. You wipe a bit of saliva which runs out of your gag.

When you arrive in my office, I am with 2 other business man in black tie. You already saw one the week before but you never met the second one, you see in his eyes that the night will be long...

Hey there!
So I think you get the idea of this prompt, feel free to continue the scene with what you would do and what you would expect to happen.

Before we start we can also discuss our characters more in details and your limits if you want to. Mine are pretty simple: no scat, no blood, no snuff."
7j2x7s,2,2017-12-11,M4A - TV Comedies (and Other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7j2x7s/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7j324s,3,2017-12-11,"I am leaving soon, but now a bunch of guys asked me out and I am unsure of next step and super confused",SuperAZN,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/7j324s/i_am_leaving_soon_but_now_a_bunch_of_guys_asked/,"Hi I know this sounds like I'm bragging but this is literally the situation and I think other people's perspectives can really help me because I dont want to ruin anything.

I am from the east coast and I recently went west coast for an internship. I am expected to finish up my degree in a few months and come back to the area. Everyone who I have met knows this. They all say I'll be back here in no time. I know that I'll be back but I don't know how soon. That being said, I hung out with my different groups during this last weekend to say my goodbyes for now. 

Then throughout different nights, some of the guys came up to me individually to talk. I am not joking all of them who came up to me confessed they wanted to date or start a relationship with me when I come back or try to take me to dinner with me the weekdays before I leave. I don't understand why they did this, and I don't even know if I could even try dating any of them because of timing. 

So my questions are:

Should I try to get to know any of them more romantically even though I'm leaving?

Why did they pick the time before I leave to ask me out? 

Also I am not interested in dating some of them so how can I say no to them without messing up the dynamic of the group? 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read!"

After a string of murders, it becomes apparent that the laugh track signals when the killer is near.**

Liza Jordan looked straight into the camera, her eyes wide. “Oh god, please.”

Like a pendulum, a machete swung down, severing her neck. The camera zoomed in on Liza’s empty eyes. The sound of fading laughter and footsteps was the last thing Detective Lawrence heard before he turned off the video.

“Where do you think this is?” he grumbled, his face a dark tone of red.

During the last week, the Sitcom Murderer had been on the front page of every newspaper, and a massive topic of online discussion. His brash and confident ways attracted all sorts of admirers and people with morbid fascinations. The man somehow lured actresses to empty sets and killed them in front of the camera and then sent the recording to the police along with a letter. Today’s one said:

&gt;I will continue murdering people until you help me out.

&gt;I don’t care how you do it. My name is Mark Johnson. I used to live in Philadelphia. Help me out.

“Netflix, Set 8B. Liza Jordan was the protagonist of a Dark Mirror episode scheduled to air next year.” The petite intern, Mina Orion, bit her lip. 

“But Dark Mirror isn’t a sitcom, is it?” Lawrence said. “That’s a change in M.O.”

“True. Although, the recorded laughter is still present in that video.”

The girl was right. Perhaps he had been looking at it the wrong way. The three murders of sitcom actresses, ending with Kaley Cuoco from The Big Bang Theory the other day, perhaps hadn’t been as much of a pattern as Lawrence had thought.

“Listen, why don’t you go home and get some sleep and we’ll start fresh in the morning,” the detective said, turning to Mina. “I know you’re tired and I need to do some research anyway.”

Mina’s shoulders slumped a bit. She was excited to follow him around and help out – a bit too excited, perhaps – but Lawrence saw that her hazels were bloodshot and that her black hair had partially fallen out of her ponytail. She had been a massive help so far and was definitely going places, but he needed her to be sharp for this one. The entirety of Hollywood relied on them to catch this lunatic.

“Fine,” she said after a reluctant pause. “I’ll be back in a few hours.”

Lawrence nodded and turned to his computer. He heard the sound of her heels fading into silence outside his office. There was a trail he wanted to follow, and he didn’t want her to know that. He had to be a role model for her, and this type of digging wouldn’t set a good example.

The file of the murderer opened with a few clicks of his mouse. Mark Johnson from Philly – a pretty common name – hadn’t been in the register for missing people. And as far as the state police over there were concerned, all the Mark Johnsons there had been verified. That’s what struck him as weird because all the letters signed by the killer asked for help, and this wasn’t the first time he had given the police his name. Maybe it was a fake name, but Lawrence had one of those hunches.

He opened the browser and took a route that he didn’t want Mina to see. The trail took him to strange places. The cemetery of canned sitcoms – those that didn’t make it past the pilot episode. He started going through the list.

Six cups of coffee later, the sun rose outside the precinct, making the white Hollywood sign sparkle in the distant hills. Detective Lawrence sighed. His head pounded, but he had found *something*. The lead character on a show called Neon Lilies was named Mark Johnson and was from Philadelphia. The only problem was that the actor who had been cast for the role had died in a DUI accident.

Detective Lawrence shook his head and stood up. His back ached from the night in the chair. He needed some fresh air. The precinct lay quiet as he made it outside into the crisp morning air. He took a few drags on his cigarette. He had seen a lot of weird cases in his time, but this one felt extra strange. The fact that there were no bodies found on any of the sets in the videos had first made him think it was all an elaborate joke. That was until the missing person reports started coming in. 

“Are you okay?” 

Mina had come up behind him without him noticing. Perhaps he was getting too old for this.

“Uh, yeah,” he said, putting the cigarette out under the tip of his shoe. “What’s up?”

“We got another one already,” she said. “He just killed Emilia Clarke.”

“W-what?” 

Lawrence felt the anger suddenly pushing up the veins of his throat, making him dizzy. Game of Thrones was the only show he really enjoyed watching. His eyes turned into black slits.

“No way...” he mumbled.

This had just become personal.

7j3s6o,2,2017-12-11,I can't convince any of the women in my life to buy bitcoin,barbellgirl90,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7j3s6o/i_cant_convince_any_of_the_women_in_my_life_to/,"This summer I took an internship working for a hedge fund here in New York City. I'm not especially interested in banking, but I need to work in the summers, and this bank has a special internship program for military veterans attending college. Incidentally it was also the only internship that I was offered. Now I realize that it was probably because no-one wants a military veteran working in an internship position meant for an 18 year old. I was, and still am, really thankful to this company for giving me and others in my position a chance within their corporation. The internship was REALLY eye opening for me, and it was the reason that I started investing in bitcoin. 

I will start by saying that I think I expected my coworkers to be normal people. Almost everyone though, including the people in my department came from extremely wealthy backgrounds. I found that I, a lower middle class veteran from the deep south, had no idea how to navigate the social environment, so I spent a lot of my free time researching investment banking. It was during this time that I first read about bitcoin. I think the reason I was so interested in bitcoin was because I felt so disenfranchised by this world of investment banking where this massive wealth seemed consolidated to a certain group of people. I’m really excited to say that I now own 1 whole bitcoin! When I finish school, and my son is out of daycare, I fully plan to buy more because I truly believe in blockchain technology and the potential it has to work for people around the world and not just for the banking industry.

Since investing in bitcoin, Ive tried to convince my girlfriends to do the same. This has been the most disheartening part of this journey. Yesterday my friend called it fake money, and none of them have any interest in investing. My husband, brother in law, and a few guy friends have since invested, but the girls just don't seem to want anything to do with it. Its been really disappointing too see such smart women be so indifferent towards something that could really impact our financial independency.  "
7j4e5y,3,2017-12-11,"Me [26FtM] with my GF [23F] of 3.5yrs, moved in together then she left and stopped paying rent",skiba_rives,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7j4e5y/me_26ftm_with_my_gf_23f_of_35yrs_moved_in/,"Hello, Reddit. I hate to have had to resort to this but I’m at the end of my rope and I don’t know what else to do.

I started dating who I’ll call Erica about 3 1/2 years ago. We met online and turned out to live in the same state but 3 hours away. Several train trips back and forth, two anime conventions, and a plane trip to my home state for Christmas and I thought things were going exceptionally well. She was there for me when I was recovering from surgery, she helped me come out as trans and defended me from my dad and stepmom, she’d done a whole bunch of wonderful emotional things for me. I was close to deciding to marry her before we moved in together.

I knew her to be responsible – she had a management position at a popular craft store and was student activities director at her school. Back in March/April of this year, she came to visit me at school and told me she had quit her job (it was understandably stressing her out to the point of suicide, and they were paying her peanuts). I was supportive but concerned, asking her what her plans were.

She had zero. She had about $120 left to her name, and didn’t want to live with her mother and hoarder of a sister anymore. At the time, I was a few quarters away from graduating. The schools provided full 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartments and a shuttle. My dad paid the rent for the school, and in the meantime I worked for a chain grocery store where I made decent money. I figured I could pack away money while she searched for a new job.

She then said to me: “Since you’re going to be doing school, your job, and an internship, I’ll have two jobs to help support us.” I said it sounded great. She found a part-time job within a week of visiting right next to where I work, and then found a second job a week after that. We searched for apartments and found a very affordable studio not too far from our workplaces and my school.

And then things went painfully, painfully wrong.

A few months into living together and she tells me that she’s quit one of the jobs and isn’t getting scheduled anything for the other. I’m flabbergasted—I ask her what she’s planning on doing if she isn’t going to have a job at all, since I’m pulling full-time weeks (internship MWRF, honors design classes on Tues, portfolio Thurs nights, and my part-time job on the weekend) and am definitely, even with a paid internship, not making enough to support us both.

What she wanted to do was get further into a new hobby turned lifestyle: being a professional witch. No, I’m really not joking. She got into tarot as a means to help her out of despair, and while I’m accepting of pretty much any religion, she went from 0 to 60 and this stuff consumed her life. Every day she was coming home with new rocks, candles, incense, and decks of cards. She’d go out and offer readings, hit up every psychic shop in the area, and even commissioned me for a class I was doing to set up her website and make her business cards.

The apartment suddenly became drenched in shrines, altars, and other witchy paraphernalia. I’m wondering where the money for all this noise is coming from, but she’s somehow paying rent, so I let it slide. But now that she doesn’t have a job she has to be at, she’s spending a lot of time at home. There would be days I’d leave at 8 AM to go to my internship, taking her car, and returning at 6 PM to find her still lying in bed, with plates of food stacked up on the nightstand. Clutter from her various witch experiments would be everywhere, her cockatiel’s cage would be caked with poop and shed feathers, and she’d be wearing the same pajamas from the past three days reeking to high heaven.

I’d ask her to do things gently: clean the bird cage please, it smells bad. Please take out the trash, it’s starting to overflow. I’m going to work, would you please take care of the dishes?

“Ah, well, I’ll take care of it in a little bit. Later. Tomorrow.”

Lather, rinse, repeat for weeks. I wound up just biting the bullet and doing all the chores, minus the cockatiel who hissed and bit if I got too close.

I brought it up when I was having a particularly stressful day, about as carefully and nonconfrontational as I could. I explained that I would really appreciate if she contributed, even a little, given how much I was working. I was met with excuses and things I was doing wrong. I told her I’d try to be mindful of the things I was doing that made it hard for her to keep up with things at home, like more thoroughly rinsing out my bowls, delicately not mentioning how many times I’d cleaned off moldy discs of ketchup from her plates.

Eventually she decided to rehome her cockatiel because she “didn’t have the mental energy” to keep up with cleaning his cage. After the talk, she did do a few chores in isolated incidents, which I thanked her for.

Between all this, her best friend would occasionally come down to pick her up and they’d go back to the central area of the state to go to psychic fairs and metaphysical shops. One weekend she goes off with her and doesn’t return on the day she said she’d be back. Four days after that, she messages me to tell me she found a job opportunity back up there in a psychic shop.

I’m legitimately happy for her; we talk about it and she promised to continue contributing to rent, now that it’ll be easier with a full-time job. I’ve graduated, so things are a little less stressful. I even get a massive refund check from my school and use it to take care of things I had to put off because of working nonstop.

She pays her half of the rent for August, then September rolls around. Nothing. Didn’t get enough work. I’m surprised, but quietly pay the full amount of rent from my refund check. She pays for October, then November comes. I ask her for rent. I wait a day. I ask her for rent three more times; it’s coming up on the deadline before late fees and she sends me this, typed verbatim:

“Oh shit, that’s right! I thought you were going to get a roommate to help with that? I won’t be able to, Joe [friend] lost his job so I’ve been paying him back and filling out apps for places and dealing [with] my dad and step mom who have been crawling up my ass about everything demanding that I pay them back for it. I’m just barely in the green on my account by a dollar right now and I don’t get paid until next week.”

One, the getting a roommate thing was in response to her saying she and two friends were looking for apartments. I told her if she did get a place, it would be easier on her if I got someone to replace her so she’s not paying two rents, and to let me know when that happens. As far as I know, she’s still living with her parents, so obviously I did not get a roommate to replace her. And two, I turn out to be not terribly surprised that the only thing letting her make rent was Joe’s incredibly well-paying job.

(TL;DR about Joe: He worked for a high-paying company, lived at home with no bills, and was basically the friend group’s generous benefactor. Even I borrowed money from him once.)

I’m furious, but quietly pay the full rent again. I start picking up as many shifts at work as possible, working as close to 40 hours as a part-timer can. The money from my refund check eventually dwindles down to nothing, as I’m Ubering back and forth to work, paying the electric bill, and paying my cellphone bill.

December crops up, and I am short on rent. I manage, somehow, to squeeze $100 out of Erica, pointedly not mentioning seeing her posts about all her latest witch-related purchases, but it’s not enough.

Slight panic. I talk to the office, and the lady who manages rent tells me she noticed my girlfriend vanished, and gives me until the end of the month to pay the other half of my rent. If I don’t have enough by then, she said “we’ll see what we can do.”

Now I’ve exhausted all my options short of taking out a loan. What do I do? People aware of my situation have told me all kinds of things: call her parent(s), sell her things (!), sue her. I’ll go to /r/LegalAdvice if need be, but I don’t want to do anything that would be illegal in the meantime. I’m just deeply upset because the person she became after she moved in is not the person I fell in love with, and I’m so worried about eviction that I don’t know what to do.

Please help me, Reddit.

**TL;DR, since this is long: Moved in with GF of 3.5 years, turns out to be incredible slob; she quits jobs to become full time witch then moves back home and stops paying rent. What do?**

""Well, we have another Taylor sweep this week as reputation is now available for streaming! 'Delicate' continues to stay put at the top spot, while former #1s 'I Did Something Bad', '...Ready For It?', 'Call It What You Want' and 'Look What You Made Me Do' chart at #2, #6, #8 and #10. The potential next single for the album 'End Game' peaks at #4 as well. Other fan favorites like 'Don't Blame Me', 'Dancing with Our Hands Tied and 'King of My Heart' chart at #5, #6 and #9. The not so subtle diss track 'This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things' jumps at 26 spots to #15, making the song the biggest gain this week. Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran and Beyonce with the é earns this week's biggest debut as their duet version of 'Perfect' debuts at #13. This debuted on Taylor's lucky number, a coincidence? St. Vincent takes this week's biggest re-entry as 'Los Ageless' re-enters at #33. Poor Tove… she takes the largest song decline two weeks in a row, as ‘Disco Tits’ plummets. 

* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #13. Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé - Perfect Duet
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #33. St. Vincent - Los Ageless 
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #15. Taylor Swift - This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things (+26) 
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #32. Tove Lo - Disco Tits (-28)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs:

In an effort to make the post less top ten centric, I will be writing about some of the songs that are charting this week that are noteworthy! It's Christmas time, so we see two Christmas songs have charted in our Hot 50. Mariah's 'Santa Tell Me' debuts at #35 while Ariana's 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' charts at #18 on its second week. Obviously, Ariana has more longevity than Mariah so will we see Ariana getting her first #1 by the time it's Christmas? 

**(Obvious Ariana = Mariah joke there btw)**

With the release of Miguel's new album War &amp; Leisure, four of his songs are in the Hot 50. 'Banana Clip', 'Sky Walker', 'Told You So' and 'Pineapple Skies' chart at #29, #34, #38 and #43 respectively. I am surprised at how this song managed to have some longevity in the Hot 50, Offest and Metro Boomin's 'Ric Flair Drip' charts at #44 in its sixth week. Are we going to see this song gain, decrease or go away from the Hot 50 next week? Only time will tell. And of course, our national anthem, 'Run Away With Me' re-enters the chart at #46. Can this never die please? Thanks.

7j52li,2,2017-12-11,22F4M - Sexual office roleplay.,ella_curran95,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7j52li/22f4m_sexual_office_roleplay/,"Hello, I'm Ella, I'm 22 and today I'm looking for a roleplay partner to join me in a sexual scenario based around and office/office work.

Now for this idea, there are many different opportunities, of course there's the boss, coworker, intern, secretary ideas. But maybe give some love to the other guys, the janitors, warehouse employees, and whatever other jobs you could think of? I would be willing to take on more dominant roles like boss/manager, but I definitely play better when I'm sub. But, each to their own.

I would definitely call myself a sub, but, for the correct scene I would be more than willing to attempt a dominant role, although don't expect too much dominance from me haha. 

My kinks would be rough sex, anal, dirty talking, spanking, hair pulling, light biting, light slapping, risky sex/hold the moan, cheating, rimjobs, footplay, clothed sex, ageplay, interracial, larger men, cream pies, facials, being man handled and being bent over.

My limits being animals, rape, bondage (the whips and chains stuff doesn't do it for me), toiletplay, vomit, snuff, hard violence (slapping is as far as I'll go), slavery and gore. If it's not mentioned in this paragraph, feel free to suggest it, I'll more than likely be on board.

If I'm taking on the role of myself,I will happily give you a relatively detailed description of jolly old me if you'd like one? But I wouldn't mind one in return too?

Now for this idea, I'm totally up for it being a quick one and done, I understand that some people want to have a quick roleplay to blow their load before bed. But, I'm also more than willing for a slower paced, longer term roleplay. I like to think I can handle both of them pretty well with the correct partner.

As for characters, I'd love to have some of your pretences, and eventually come up with a character that is perfect for you.

So yeah, if you're interested in this kinda thing, please message me with either; a character description of who you'd like to play, a scene idea, some kinks, or just a general addition to the roleplay that we could incorporate? Thanks.

Ella."
7j543d,1,2017-12-11,M4f - Roll Tide,Medium__Arousal,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7j543d/m4f_roll_tide/,"*A great convergence of ignorance, poverty, and depravity -- or, 'how I had the time of my life in Alabama.'*

I dreaded my arrival from the moment of its conception, a little over 37 weeks ago.  I knew next to nothing about the place, somewhere south of Birmingham, of which I also had next to no knowledge.  I was aware only of the stereotypes.  The moronic drawl that is the sonic equivalent of drooling, the tendency towards obesity, and the dual love of God and sinning.

Those views blanketed the entirety of the south, with slight variations and additions.  For some reason I believed Georgia had less incest than Mississippi, that a Louisiana native was likelier more stupid than a Texan.  Of course no one was more inbred and less learned than my second cousin Sheila.  And why I had to spend six weeks visiting her and the lost (and best forgotten) branch of my mothers family down in good ol' 'Bama was beyond me.

Sheila was 22, a victim of rape (part of God's plan) -- one that went unreported (wrong to ruin a young mans life for one mistake) -- and a single mother.  These were the things that defined her for the past seven years.  I'd done my best to ignore her vague appeals for interaction in the form of Facebook status updates.  But then the private messages came.

Her words made my skin crawl.  They were cloying and I could hear her accent in them.  She was still 10 years old in my head, despite the pictures I'd seen, the hateful thoughts I'd seen her share so easily.  She was family still, no matter how distant, and I gave her my number and delayed every single proposal she made to catch up in person.

To my utter and complete astonishment, it was me who ended up making arrangements to visit her.  I was scrambling to find a job at the end of school and managed to snag an internship with a meagre stipend.  Six months of work in the deep south, in a small trailer where all work orders and billing were processed from branches across the country.  

I told her I'd be in Alabama, working only a dozen miles from her home, and that we would finally get to visit like she'd been begging for.  

I booked my flight and dreaded the dwindling moments until I would be stuck in a sweaty, bigoted, Jesus-praising pool of tepid shit.

*You can play Sheila, her daughter (under 10 years old), any other white trash woman or girl, or a character of your own devising.  Just be prepared to delve into the filth.*"
7j543q,0,2017-12-11,How do I [20F] stop being so jealous of my long-distance boyfriend's [20M] social life?,wowrealoriginal,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7j543q/how_do_i_20f_stop_being_so_jealous_of_my/,"So last year my friend from high school set me up with a guy she goes to school with, and we've been together since then (about 8 months). I've always had social anxiety, and it's been present in my relationship this whole time, but just recently it's been getting a lot worse.

I graduated high school in 2015 and went to a small liberal arts school for 2 months before I left (that's a whole other story). I went to community college for the next couple semesters and then transferred to my current state school in the spring semester of 2017. At the same time I transferred, I began talking to my current boyfriend.

During that semester I definitely felt lonely, but I kept myself busy and had my roommate, who was also a transfer student, with me a lot of the time. She and I never really became close, but it was nice to have someone there to show that you weren't the only one without anyone to hang out with.

Over the summer was hard too since my boyfriend had more school responsibilities over the summer than I did, but I was at least back home working at my hometown job, where I had friends I worked with, and I was also taking summer classes which gave me enough work to distract me from missing him.

This past semester has been way harder than the last one. I've been looking for internships with no luck, trying out for organizations on campus that I haven't gotten into, and I haven't made any new friends. Now that it's finals week and everyone is studying together and hanging out with their friends before break, I find myself sitting in my room watching the same YouTube videos over and over, like I've been doing this entire semester.

I know that was a lot about just me, but especially these past few weeks it's really been taking a toll on my relationship. I find myself getting so jealous since he and my best friend go to school together, and have their own group of friends that hang out and rent out places to all stay over the weekend and whatnot, while I'm 500 miles away and have no one to hang out with. He's told me he's afraid to tell me about when he hangs out with his friends because he doesn't want to upset me, and that makes me feel horrible. I want him to tell me about the good times he's having, but I also want it to not make me feel like shit.

Idk, this post is probably very mixed up and all out of sequence. Sorry. I just want to figure out how to get past this and be happy for him while also having my own life. And I know a lot of people will probably say to get involved and join clubs, I just haven't had much luck with that. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend goes to school 500 miles away from me and he has a tight friend group that he goes out with a lot and I do not have any friends at school, which makes me extremely jealous and depressed. How do I fix this?"

7j5uuw,11,2017-12-11,Coping with abruptly leaving therapy position,Gimmeyourtwocents,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/7j5uuw/coping_with_abruptly_leaving_therapy_position/,"Attempts to make this concise: I had been struggling at work for a while with remaining organized. Forgetting paperwork and such. I felt I had too much on my plate (34 patients, group therapy, evals, an intern) and tried to outreach my supervisors for help. When I felt they were not realizing the gravity of it, I eventually let them know what else was happening. I was starting to think the stress of my trauma history somehow coming at me now was creating trouble with being organized at work (I have been in therapy for a while). My boss was clear that her concerns were with my late or forgotten paperwork. Yes, that is important and concerning. But she flat out told me today that my patients still appeared well attended to and, whenever she would run a group in my absence, it seemed like they were receiving excellent therapeutic care. I realize this doesn't mean it could not have affected my patients in the future, though.

They offered me less intense positions. I declined, saying I decided I wanted to seek part time work instead, to give me time to take care of myself. I said I would stay on for two weeks to help my patients transition and grant proper termination with them.

They told me no and if I didn't accept the other less intense positions, my resignation was effective immediately. I am trying to not regret my honesty with them (as opposed to continuing to limp along and get worse and maybe impact patient care) and decision to seek part time work to take care of myself. But I am struggling that I don't have the chance to properly close with my patients. 

I really feel like some of them will attempt to reach out to me. All my social media is private but I feel some may attempt to message me--even on something less personal like Linkedin.  I know I will be temped to respond to at least grant closure. 

Has anyone else had to abruptly leave a position without opportunity to terminate? How did you cope and minimize feelings of guilt or failure?"
7j5ybi,0,2017-12-11,How good of an idea is it to spend my first year out of college with my parents.,Axuuly,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7j5ybi/how_good_of_an_idea_is_it_to_spend_my_first_year/,"I'm about to be a senior in college and graduating a semester late (Dec 2018) with a degree in finance. I'm at the point where I am sick and tired of school and just want to get started in a career. I plan on doing an internship this summer. My goal is to apply to one internship every day this winter break. I'm currently about 23k in debt total after my spring semester. Yearly tuition is about 38k for commuters. If financial aid won't help me pay off that extra semester i'll have to add another 10k to that. So lets say I graduate about 33k in debt. If I make a conservative estimate of what I would earn for a 3 month internship lets say 10k that reduces my debt back to 23k. Graduates from my school average a 48k salary out of college so in all likelihood if I get an internship this summer, some experience on my resume I could make that and pay off principal within a year and save some after tax. The trade off is I am tired of living with my parents. I've commuted for college and have lived here for 22 years. I love em and they are nice its just that I want my own space. 

As one might be able to tell, a finance degree can make you pretty self-aware of financial situations and I understand the importance of compounding and the time value of money. So the quicker I pay off my loans and start investing the better. I just don't know if I can tough through a year of living in my parents house when I have a career."

If not then how do I encourage him to do make a step?!🙈 God knows I would probably pee in my pants if I were to go and talk to him in person.

7j6dc5,1,2017-12-11,21M BF cannot manage his money and has unrealistic goals,lexbot6,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7j6dc5/21m_bf_cannot_manage_his_money_and_has/,"So I (20F) have been dating this great guy (21M) for a few months now. Everything is great, we get along perfectly well, never big fights (yet) and if we do have an argument we sort is out fairly quickly. We talked about our future together, moving in, family etc. I know it may seem soon, which it kinda is, but out of all me previous relationships, he has been the only one I could ever imagine a future with. 

Here is the problem. He is currently working a minimum wage job, which is fine, at least he is working. He works full time and makes more than enough to supply for him since he lives rent free at home and doesn't pay bills. As for me, I am currently working full time doing a paid internship. I'm moving out of the parents in a month and living with my friends and our new apartment we are splitting rent for. I also have other bills to pay for like phone, car insurance etc. So money has been tight with me.

The problem is he never pays for anything. And Im not saying men are obliged to pay for dates,food, etc. but should at least do it every now and then. Every time we go out to a non fast food place, I paid for both of us every single time. When we go to fast food, we pay separately. Never offers besides a handful of times. He comes over my place a few times a week and eats my food and drinks all my soda and doesn't offer to replace it or anything. 

I mentioned to him I was getting a bit annoyed with it and he always just tells me how he has no money and no food at home. But the thing he can have money. Every time he gets his paycheck he spends on it a video game and just fast food for himself. Doesn't ever offer to take me out or anything. 

When I move to CO in a month, he is moving up there too in 3 months. (not planned together just pure coincidence that we both planned to move up there years ago). He makes music and wants that to be his full time job. I support his music, I do, just not at a full time job. He has been in the ""music business"" for 5 years now and has not made money or anything come out of it. Once he moves, he does not plan on getting a job, but just to put everything in music. He talks about going on tour and then getting a house in a couple of years yet he doesn't strive to reach those goals. He doesn't want to try to get a better job, he doesn't spend enough time with music if he wants it to be his career. 

When talking about moving in, I do not want to be the one carrying all the weight. I'm currently not in school but once I move I will be taking online classes again to finish up college and I too will be paying for that. We planned on moving in together in about a year and a half once both our of leases are up while living with our friends. 

How should I approach this situation? I don't want to be to harsh and just bash on his music because to him it is very important which I understand. We both should be saving up money for the move (our separate moves not us living together just yet) but he can not manage his money at all. I tried to help him and give him advice to put 70% of his paycheck into savings and the rest is for yourself but he still doesn't.

I hated it originally and everything just seemed worse when I started, but now I'm here a year later and I'm so happy I kept going with it. 

I'm a huge fan of bullet journaling so I decided to rate every day out of 10. A 1/10 is the worst of days, and that's how I started out at the beginning of 2017, but one day when I was smoking with my friends (i'm sorry, pls don't hate me) it just kinda hit me that I felt different, that I felt a tiny bit more okay. I really pushed myself this year to go out of my comfort zone and not let my social anxiety dictate my life. I rushed and pledged a professional business fraternity here and I've made so many new friends and really happy memories. I had an internship for this Fall semester and I was able to get another one for the Spring semester. I'm so happy and proud that I didn't let my anxiety prevent me from doing things and trying to live my life. I got to watch my #/10 rise higher and higher throughout the year. I've even had 10/10 days. I mean, I still have bad days, I'm sure I'll always have some bad days, but having good ones mean so much. 


I'm not really sure what the point of this is now. I guess I just wanted to put an update out here. I love coming to this sub and just knowing that our anxiety doesn't have to be a weakness. Thank you. "
7j77t1,17,2017-12-11,"Well, I guess it's time to try again",MetalIsLaw,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7j77t1/well_i_guess_its_time_to_try_again/,"So for the umpteenth time in my life, it has come to my attention that I need to stop drinking.  I've been sober for 4 days now and I just want to ramble for a bit.  I hope that's OK with y'all.

When I was 22 I had a wake-up call.  Mom and Pop Montana entered my life and told me in no uncertain terms that I had a problem.  If I did not do something about that problem, I would be incarcerated.  So I quit drinking and doing dope.  I stayed sober through probation.  I met a girl and she liked to go downtown.  About a year into our relationship, about 6 months after I got off paper, I took my will back.  I decided a drink couldn't hurt.  And for a long time it didn't.

I'm 30 now.  My life has been ugly for a minute now.  That girl I mentioned earlier, she broke up with me, largely because of who I become when there is alcohol in my life.  I just spent a week in the ICU--unrelated to drinking--I had become septic with cavitary pneumonia.  But I think the hospital reminded me of those many times I was institutionalized when I was younger.  Tied to a bed for a week by IVs gave me some time to look at my life.  I was in an ugly place; the pain of a 4 year relationship ending, mountains of self-loathing, and just good ol' depression.  

See, while my alcohol played a role in the end of my relationship, my drinking didn't get that bad.  Not compared to the old days.  I'm not withdrawing.  The authorities never had to be called.  But the ""disease of alcoholism"" has taken hold of me.  No two ways about it.  I am hateful, resentful, depressed, and alone.  I am restless, irritable, and discontent.

My life still has promise too.  I re-enrolled in school a few years back.  I'm a straight-A non-traditional junior in Mathematics and Computer Science (though, I may lose my 4 point after this semester... it's been a rough one).  I had an internship with a good software company last summer, and I'm going back to them this summer.  And despite all that I am so utterly depressed right now.  I am struggling to get out of bed, to shower and perform basic hygiene.  It's finals week and I really haven't looked at school stuff since I went to the hospital.  But I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.  

Anyway, I've been going to AA.  I've always been an atheist, but I really don't care anymore.  I just need some peace, some grace.  I'm willing to say I have a higher power, and that power wants what is right for me.  I'm trying to turn over my drinking to that power, because I certainly am incapable of managing it.  

Thanks for letting me talk.  I've really needed to share this word salad with people who might get it.  I'm really struggling right now, but I'm trying to be better.  I'm sure some of you struggled with depression early in your sobriety, and I'd love to hear from y'all about that.  What you did.  I'm trying to power through it, and get things done that need doing, but some days it's too much.  And it's exhausting.

Ok, I'm done.  Sorry for the wall of text.  Appreciate you folks. "

Alright, to keep this short on the backstory: Parents are abusive, do a lot of crazy shit, during my high school years especially, and because of this, to this day I have constant anxiety/depression feelings, and I used to self-harm (and still want to sometimes, TBH, if I'm feeling especially bad) Eventually, after turn 18 and I lose my job, kick me out ""for a few days to learn to appreciate what you're given."" I end up moving out and living with my best friend and his family, and my family finds my main and gets pissed with what they find (i.e. the truth about what they did to me and me venting/asking for help and advice). 

As for my GF, we started dating when I was 17 and she was 15, I turned 18 a month or so in but keep doing the same stuff, and her mom walked in on us fucking after my GF invited me over and she had come home early. She threatens to call the cops and shit, as she didn't know we were dating at the time, and everything basically goes to hell in a handbasket. Now her mom is acting like a total psycho.

Now, onto the current issues!

All of this backstory happened a few months ago, and the repercussions are still rocking the boat of my life. To this day, on almost every post I make on my main (but not comments on other's posts), there's always a nasty and toxic comment from one of my parents, from a freshly made account, or a comment making direct comments towards me and what happened from a freshly made account, depending on the context of the post. I've basically cut all contact with them aside from these comments and me sending the accounts direct messages asking them/telling them to please just leave me alone, that they're being toxic and immature, and that if they want their son to ever consider talking to them and involving them in my life, they need to back off and respect my boundaries. Of course, they never listen. I'm just at wits end what to do about this except for just make a fresh Reddit account, which I personally don't want to do, but if I need to, I will.

As for my GF, ever since her mom found out about us, things have apparently been hell for her. Most of her stuff like her gaming consoles, phone, etc were sold as punishment, and she was basically locked in her room for months except for school, school events she had to go to, and her internship. Luckily, she was able to get a friend's old phone to talk to me. But lately, I've just been sick of the relationship. I want to stay because I know she needs someone to comfort her and give her hope and all that, but I just can't take it! She refuses to stand up for herself in any capacity, and she just let's her abusive ""friends"", including one who is my ex friend who was just using her to try to lose his virginity, shit on our relationship and bully her. And instead of standing up to them and finding new friends, she just vents to me about it instead of actually solving her problems. I've gotten to the point where I nearly had to force the issue, and she still hasn't done anything. I don't want to stay because she is like this, but I don't want to leave because I know that if I do, she's going to get even more depressed than she already is and she might do something stupid...

So, what do I do about all of this? I'm so lost and confused and hurt and I feel like I have no one to really talk to about this...

Tl;Dr: Psycho and abusive parents keep stalking my accounts and making abusive and intentionally hurtful comments no matter how much I ask/tell them not to. GF is unable to stand up for herself, is constantly venting to me about being depressed, and I want out of the relationship, but feel guilted into staying into the relationship because of her depression. I'm lost and confused and feeling like crap.

EDIT/UPDATE: Guess what, guys, things are turning out EXACTLY as I thought they would, only far worse. Who'da thunk? :^ ) I finally decided (thanks to u/Lornesto and u/Tiger-Billionare for the comments that finally moved me to action about this, btw!) to end things with my gf and tell her the truth. 

And guess what?

She had a major depression/anxiety flare, only worse! At first, things were fine-ish. It went about as well as it could've been. Then the floodgates opened and she went on this massive self-depreciating rant, then made some comments about me (that were more true than I'd like to admit, and that I need to work on in my next relationship, but also laced with breakup anger), and then we had an argument over her self-depreciating behavior and her refusal to stand up for herself and all of that. She also kinda completely tore town the 4+ months since her mom went full psycho-mode that I've been trying to show her that the behavior her mom has is completely abusive and wrong, basically saying that she thought ""My mom is fine, I'm just being a shit child and we're having a disagreement. You (V0id) overreact and think that every small thing is a sign of abuse when it isn't."" 

But here's the 2 parts that really get me. The ones that make me just want to cry and go on my own depressive spree.

She said ""...please get a job"" ""Lol"". Completely condescendingly. As if I don't spend at least an hour most days every  day looking for work, while going to technical college do get my associates degree , while (before we broke up) trying to play therapist and keep her in one piece. That really pissed me off and made me a bit depressed that she would say that.

 Then, she had one more rant and said this: ""Ha. Mom was right, older boys would just take advantage of me, lol..."" Again, as if I hadn't spent *THE ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP* encouraging her to be her own person, and taking care of her, and trying to help her with her own issues, and all of that... I... I tried to be as best of a boyfriend to her as I could, and for her to say that just... It hurts. It hurts in a way that I can't describe.

As if the breakup alone didn't make me want to cry in a corner. Now I just want to get intoxicated in some fashion and/or forget that life is a thing and/or drown my sorrows and/or stop existing. 

... I hate this. I hate myself. I hate existing. But, life carries on, and so must I."

#**BRIEFING:**

&amp;nbsp;

**In 2035, time travel was invented.  It was probably a bad move.**

&amp;nbsp;

Recent advances in scientific understanding unveiled a new kind of particle, linked to its past by a quantum event.  These links can last for decades, but eventually they break down and the particle snaps back to its original time - completely irretrievable from the present time.

This discovery would be useless if not for another simple fact: huge quantities of energy can be applied to the particle, which then discharges, entangling itself with with any nearby metallic objects and anything touching those.  The key to time travel was laid bare.

&amp;nbsp;

Under the strictest secrecy, this knowledge was used to develop the first time machines, but these stood unused as the extremely rare particles evaded capture.

Two weeks later, scientists struck gold.  Two particles were captured, and their links were traced.  The first would return to the 7th of May, 1940.  The next, the 12th of August.  And they would do so in two weeks time.
This discovery was reported to their superiors, and then again up the chain.  Before the end of the day, news had reached NATO and the decision was almost instantly made.

&amp;nbsp;

We're going to kill Hitler.

&amp;nbsp;

Movement was made remarkably fast.  The plan was drawn out within three days, and by the end of the first week the plan was ready to execute.  All that remained was the announcement of the endeavour to the world.  It was the polite thing to do.

The reaction was mixed.  The worlds' historians simultaneously went on strike.  Holocaust survivors rejoiced.  Israel grew nervous, the history of its very formation potentially imperilled.  Neo-Nazis took to the streets in a way never seen before - ironically, chanting ""never forget"".

&amp;nbsp;

None of this stopped the plan, now well in motion and guarded by an entire eighth of NATO's military might - and part one went exactly as planned.

In the morning of July 5th, 2035 an agent was transported to the 7th of May, 1940 - sitting in a Tesla.  He was a French national, equipped with proof he came from the future and proof of the future of the world if history was left to run its course.  His mission was summed in a single line:  Convince France to hold fast, and contain the German invasion within itself until mid-August.

&amp;nbsp;

It was not known at first how his success would be measured, back in the present day.  This was quickly resolved when a NATO official picked up a scotch and a history book after a day of work - two minutes later, both were spilled upon the floor.  It was clear - the agent had succeeded.  The Germans had taken the bait and Hitler, sure of his victory, had followed closely behind the front - desiring to see this French courage ruined before his eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

What still wasn't clear was if the second part of the plan would succeed.  When further pages were examined back at NATO command, an intern was hospitalized after peering upon pages containing every possible history at once.  An advisory statement was quickly made to the world, which was probably the wrong move.  

A wave of muggings occurred the following day - WW2 anthologies were used to confound the victims and their possessions then easily taken.  The same evening, history books were banned.  The historians' strike ended as quickly as it had began - they were all out of jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

The world is slipping into chaos - it's important to wrap the operation up and return the world's past to certainty.  

**Part two of the plan can't come sooner, but it's still to come.  You're about to make history - and make it yours.**

**SITUATION**

According to current history, French forces have been containing the German invasion, but have been steadily pushed back through their own lands.  They now fight from the shores of historical Omaha Beach, being evacuated by their navy with British assistance to the UK.  The bulk of the force is sailing to safety, but some remain to delay the invaders - they must be kept from the beach before your arrival.

Ready to make the jump, Company TIMELORD is mounted in Mk10 LCUs arrayed in front of the USS Zemeckis.  The Zemeckis' nuclear reactor, being the only power source in the region capable of powering the time pylons, has been brought close to the shores of historical Omaha Beach.

**MISSION**

* Move the landing craft between the pylons, facing the beach, before 21:23 PM.

* Travel to 1940 and assault the beach, securing the beachheads and moving to Phase Line 1.

* A radio jammer was transported previously to deny German command of accurate battle reports.  If Hitler hears of our arrival, he may flee.  Visit the jammer and ensure it is not destroyed by German forces.

* Proceed past Phase Line 1, capturing Le Bray and its neighbouring villages.

* German forces are still pouring into the area.  Defend against any forces and move past Phase Line 2 when clear to proceed.

* Hitler's location at this time is known from history.  Move to the farmhouses and REMOVE FUHRER.

Terrain: I44 Omaha Beach

ToD/Weather: 2035: Late evening, rainy.  1940: early afternoon, clear.

Medical: Basic Medical System

7j7m30,8,2017-12-11,"Fixing the DC, but its actually a complete rewrite. (Part 1)",EP13,fixingmovies,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/7j7m30/fixing_the_dc_but_its_actually_a_complete_rewrite/,"Hello! My name is EP13, and I do not like the DC Cinematic universe.
That is not really a hot take right now. Most audiences were turned off by Justice League, and Wonder Woman seems to be the only one we can have a consensus on its goodness (ending aside). Now many...many... different people have made their tweaks to DC in this subreddit alone, but what I'm doing is slightly different. I'm not using the source movies for this. In this scenario I'm an exec at Warner Bros calling all the shot. I sure hope you like it!

First Film: Superman: The Man of Steel
Style: Rami Spidermans

Now the first movie to kick off the cinematic universe is, as in the first one, a Superman film. Now Superman is a bit of a tricky character, his devotion to good can come off a bit cheesy to some. However, going in the exact opposite direction to try to appeal to The Dark Knight crowd seems like overkill. The movie feels very alien as well, with good reason, as the script seems to treat Superman as an alien superhuman. But they are missing the point. Superman is just a kid from Kansas trying to do the right thing, not some sort of troubled god who doesn't see the value in human life. Thus, the script should treat him as such.

Act 1:
Clark Kent is a 20-year old living in Kansas. He's a charming bright individual, and he lives with his parents in Smallville. Clark is outwardly happy, but he's a bit sad at the moment, because he doesn't know what to do with his life. We are introduced to his best friend, Jimmy Olsen, who he laments to about his troubles. Jimmy listens for awhile, then tells Clark he's moving to Metropolis to become a photographer. Clark is stunned, then even more so when Jimmy says he gave the Daily Planet (the paper Jimmy was hired to) Clark's resume as well, included with some writing Clark did for the high school paper. He also announces to him that Clark got the job. Clark goes and tells his parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent, about this exciting opportunity. His parents are less then thrilled. A bit dejected, Clark goes up to his room, and takes out a special charm that his grandfather had given to him. Jonathan comes up to talk to him. Jonathan then tells Clark the truth, about why he's so protective of him, (I didn't make that clear earlier, but his parents don't let him do very much,) that he was adopted and they aren't sure where he comes from, and that the charm from his 'grandfather' was actually the only thing they found him with. Shell-shocked, Clark drives out to a parking lot for what amounts to his Footloose moment. Memories come flooding back, and we see via flashback his parents putting him in a rocket to be sent off to a random planet they have never heard of. Clark has a good cry for the family he never knew, then calls Perry White, the editor of The Daily Planet whose number Jimmy had given him, to accept the job. Clark goes back to his parents and tells them he's leaving. The next morning, after a tearful and loving goodbye with his parents (Clark did not tell them about his newfound memories)  he and Jimmy pack into a car, and drive off to Metropolis.

Act 2:
Clark and Jimmy arrive at their newfound work place, and meet in person Perry White. On their way up, Clark bumps into Lois Lane, one of the reporters, causing her to drop her things. An angry Lois tells who she perceives to be a lowly intern that she will see he never gets a job in any paper. Clark, a bit shaken now, meets his editor, who introduces himself and then immediately tells them their first assignments. Clark is told to interview renowned toy maker Winslow Schott, who's wife had just died in a car accident, to get some details for the obituary. Jimmy is told to work with Lois Lane, who Jimmy flirts with (rather unsuccessfully). Lois then goes to Clark and asks for an apology, saying she had no idea he was a reporter. Clark takes it in stride, and then goes to visit Winslow Schott. Clark arrives, and is greeted by a neurotic, disheveled man. His house is littered with toys, with big shiny mobiles hanging from the city. Winslow invites him to sit down, then rambles some nonsense about his wife having been born in South Dakota and having no parents or relations. He then tells Clark that he believes his wife was killed by his rival, billionaire toy maker Walter Dunhill, who was jealous of Winslow's fine craftsmanship. Clark, now anxious to leave the home of this crazy man, moves to the door, only to be yanked to his seat by Winslow. Winslow tells him that he has a friend who is helping him plot his next move, and that he will make Walter pay. Superman, having the basics he needs for the obituary, shakes off Winslow's grasp and drives off. Back at his apartment with Jimmy, he sits quietly at dinner, with Jimmy eagerly telling him about taking pictures of Gorillas with the hot reporter. Noticing Clark's dejected state, Jimmy stops his story and eggs him on to open up. Clark denies anything being wrong, and then says he has to go up to the roof for some fresh air. Clark gets up there, and promptly then slips in a puddle. Clark is sent tumbling off the roof, and then thrashes about in panic, eventually closing his eyes to avoid seeing his grisly death. However, Clark opens his eyes not to the pearly gates of heaven, but rather to the brick and mortar of a back alleyway. Clark looks down to see his feet hovering a few inches from ground. Clark tries to take a step, and immediately falls flat on his face. Clark gets up and jumps as high as he can. He gets about six inches, then lands. He tries again, with the same result. He tries about five more times. On the sixth time, he puts his hand up in the air, and instantly shoots several feet into the sky. Laughing, Clark points his fist towards his roof, and then thrusts his legs forward. He instantly slams into the roof, cutting open his cheek while he's at it. Jimmy walks onto the roof to find a dazed and bruised Clark and helps him back down to the apartment. Clark slurs something to him about flying. Jimmy responds by calling a hospital to have his stomach pumped. Clark sits in his hospital bed, feeling sickened by the stomach pumping, with Jimmy there beside him, telling him that they didn't find any drugs in his system. In walks in Clark's doctor, Doctor Manchester Black, who tells Clark that he must have taken a nasty fall which gave him hallucinations and a mild concussion. Black tells him to be more careful when he's 'in flight' or else he'll wind up 'somewhere he shouldn't be'. Clark glances at him sharply, while Jimmy chuckles. Jimmy and Clark go back home, with Clark pondering the extent of his newfound powers. The next morning, Clark arrives early at a gym, and then proceeds to lift three times his body weight. In addition to that, Clark attempts to fly his way to work, and after some stumbling, manages to fly all the way there. Clark bustles into work with a confident smile on his face, and begins to chat up Lois Lane, much to Jimmy Olsen's annoyance. Perry White then gives Superman his next assignment, a trip to Dunhill Toys skyscraper to interview Dunhill himself, much to Lois's anger at giving such an important story to a newcomer. Clark tentatively arrives there, the story told to him by Winslow Schott still fresh in his mind. Dunhill, an arrogant man, gives a self-obsessed interview, which finds Clark getting more and more annoyed at his infuriating interviewee. Midway through, they is interrupted by a package being sent to him. Apparently a model of a new Teddy Bear the 'team' has developed. Hoping to appear more in charge, Dunhill opens up the package and fumbles around with the bear. The bear then erupts with a foul smelling gas. Dunhill is knocked unconscious, with a coughing Clark doubling over. In walks in none other than Manchester Black, who grabs Clark by the hand and then teleports him to his apartment, and then knocks him out by rubbing his temple, which causes a sharp pain in his brain which lulls him out of consciousness. 

Act III: 
An angry Jimmy shakes Clark out of his sleep, him awakening with a liquor bottle in hand. Jimmy questions why he decided to skip his meeting with Dunhill. Clark then tells him that Manchester Black has kidnapped Dunhill, to which Jimmy angrily turns on the TV to show Dunhill announcing the merger of Dunhill and Winslow toys, with Winslow getting a 50% stake in the new company. Dunhill also announced he was resigning immediately. Jimmy yells at Clark for not focusing on his new job. Clark yells back, telling him he didn't even want this new job. Clark gets up and storms out of the building. Clark goes to the roof and begins a pile of bricks. He begins to do it wildly, eventually having heated lasers shooting out of his eyes. Clark panics and his head darts around erratically, almost frying Jimmy, who had walked out on the roof to talk to him. Jimmy, horrified, runs back to the apartment, with Clark following after him. Clark then explains the whole story to Jimmy, and shows him the powers he's discovered. Jimmy then tells him he has to go after Manchester Black, which Clark says isn't his battle. Jimmy then explains it doesn't matter how involved you are, it's about doing the right thing. Clark then goes to the roof, and flies to Black's office. Clark and Manchester then have a confrontation. Manchester then explains that he gets half of his accomplice, Winslow's stake. They fight. Winslow arrives as well, and the two fight, Black using telepathy and telekinesis, with Winslow firing weapons at Clark designed as toys. Clark defeats them. Winslow, as his last gasp, straps a toy plane to his vest, and detonates it inside a building. Clark saves the people, but Winslow, Manchester and Dunhill die in the explosion. A devastated Clark returns to his apartment. The next day he resigns from the Daily Planet. Jimmy turns in some pictures to the office, and we end on a shot of a news article written by Lois Lane, being read by a smiling Clark. It reads, Superman Saves Metropolis!

7j8a7i,3,2017-12-11,A letter on my depression,Iwontchoose,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7j8a7i/a_letter_on_my_depression/,"Dear Friend, 

Forgive me if this doesn’t make much sense… and for the awful grammar. Since no one will be seeing this anyways I can’t say that it matters much. 
It has certainly been an interesting time since I have gotten to university. I’ve met a ton of new people and have had a variety of new experience. It is simultaneously exactly what I expected and nothing like what I had hoped for. I keep changing things in my life expecting to feel fundamentally different, better, after the changes; and the more I get what I want the more I realise that I can’t have the one thing I want the most. Within a month of moving I met a lot of new people, while keeping in touch with old friends, I’ve hooked up with boys, gotten drunken and gone partying, I got a paying job which I quit in order to have more time for an internship that puts me in the center of Canadian politics. I am away from many of the things that hurt me and I don’t miss home, I have plenty of freedom and endless opportunities here. The only thing I don’t have is happiness. I’ve spent years chasing happiness. I’ve changed schools, made new acquaintances, even left the country and still I can not find the satisfaction that I am looking for. 
In reality what I am is lonely. I do have friends but I don’t feel close to them, I meet new people but I can’t create or maintain a connection. What I’m really searching for is some sort of closeness, for someone to recognise and acknowledge my pain. Someone who I can call at 12 am when the thoughts of suicide are keeping me awake. 
It’s quite strange really. In one sense I know that I am loved, its what keeps me going. I can’t die because it would hurt too many people, but instead of this making me happy, it makes me frustrated that I’m ties to this life of misery. These people are keeping me alive, but yet for me to live is to suffer. These ‘people’ that I keep referring to are my family: my mother, my brother, my sister, and of course my grandmother (who I must admit do actually bring a little joy, it must be said that no love can compare to the love that she has for me). However, they are not enough for me, I want friends or even just one friend. A best friend really a confidant. It’s funny because I did have that once and I abused their love to the point where they were exhausted, let’s be honest I am not an easy person to care for. I have grown since that and now instead of putting too much on people, I take on too much. I hear of so many people’s problems and think to myself ‘I wish I was dead, and I wish they would notice the thoughts going through my head. 
I feel as though I have become very self-aware over the past few months. With the help of a therapist my anxiety has lessened and I am starting to recognise and control the over-bearing and irrational though processes that cause me so much stress. I have done little to actually improve my depression on the other hand. I am well aware that I am depressed and that this is likely a genetic problem since my depression has been on and off since I was 9 and my family has a history of mental-illness. I understand that medication would probably help but I just can’t go about trying to get it. 
In the end I end up spending hours on end in my bed hoping someone will notice that its not just laziness but rather a retched sadness that could potentially be cured by affection. I do recognise that my lack of friends may be caused by my depression but in that case, it really is just a vicious cycle isn’t it? I’ll just keep obsessively checking social media waiting for a new message and writing letters like this wishing that I actually had someone to share them with. 

Until the day I can share this with someone real,

7j8btq,1,2017-12-11,[M4F] Cougar &amp; MILF LLP is Hiring Whores!! [Cum-starved women/Freeuse Vibe],Madvillaner,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7j8btq/m4f_cougar_milf_llp_is_hiring_whores_cumstarved/,"Hey, I’m looking for a roleplay partner to act out multiple a scenario with me in which I’m a young kid, around 18-20 who has just recently got his first internship as an assistant at a real law firm through a family friend. But on my first day I realize that the entire office is filled exclusively with sexy, older women, all of which have a weakness for young men.

Here’s where I think we can take this in different directions. Option 1 is my preference but I’m open to either.

* The whole reason I was hired at this place was because their hiring manager saw my picture and thought I was adorable, she had to have a taste. The day I came in for my interview all of the other women saw me and agreed, blatantly looking for a bulge under my dress pants and getting touchy with me. The added bonus is that I have a long-term, extremely Christian girlfriend who’s waiting for marriage before any kind of sex or even kissing. You’d have to be convincing..but it probably wouldn't take much, you can touch and flirt all you like because I really need this job for my resume. 

* I’m hired primarily for my talent and my resume, and in this scenario, I’m the sexual aggressor. Through regular office gossip I learn that some of the women aren’t happy in their marriages. Maybe I flirt and throw out enough signals and manage to convince you that I can provide you with what you need, and you maybe you let me touch, flirt and grab because it actually makes you feel desired for once. Besides, it's not like your fat, balding, 53 year old husband can even get it up anymore. 

I tried to leave this open because I would really like to hear any ideas that you might have even if they’re completely different from mine. You can play just one character in the office, or you can rotate between different ones as you please.

Ideally, I’m looking for someone who’s down for detailed writing, and with plenty of focus on the flirting, coercion, and buildup to the sex scenes.

I have a lot of kinks we can discuss but for this one I’d like to focus on cheating, coercion, public (office) and a freeuse-ish vibe (I really like casual touching and groping).

My limits are: incest (step-relationships are okay), scat/watersports, non-human creatures and non-descriptive writers: P

BW: Baby Mother Post 

I don't honestly see myself as these titles but as a black woman, I'm sure its how my ex and some other people view me. I dont know if I am ranting or posting but here goes: My ex is the most self absorbed SOB I have ever met. Ever since we started dating, to justify his wrongdoings he labeled me as ""crazy"" to his friends and family. Mind you this is the same person who cheated on me and lied about then when I find concrete evidence he either cries and says he's sorry, tell me that was too long ago for me to be still upset or when neither of those work, guilt trips me for going through his things. I've ruined my previous career over this guy, missed opportunities to work overseas, lost money from dealing with him through divorce and custody. When I finally realized that ""We"" were not working out; I wanted a divorce and only half of our sons Daycare bills. This guy decides to file for divorce and drag me to court over custody of our son. Mind you, He does not have a job that affords him the opportunity to provide adequate care for our child so even if he had won FULL/PRIMARY custody which he was seeking at one time or another; I would still be the main caregiver. I don't have the best relationship with my family, I have accepted that. This guy ( and his parents) always thought that they (because of their two parent household) were better than my family. Every argument was ""because I didn't have a mother"".. ""My father never loved me"" .. ""Men used me"".. We have been divorced for 5 years and to this day I never look at men the same because of him. I was brought up to provide and care for a man and I thought if I did those things .. u know ""wifely duties"" that I would be provided and cared for. That is not love society does not teach girls how to love and what love looks like. Instead they tell girls/young women/women to take care of their men, be a wife, cook, clean, ride or die, stand by your man, etc, etc.. its disgusting especially when we teach girls how they should treat their men but we don't teach boys these things. 




Anyways, This week I had a discussion with this guy who is the father of my child, same self absorbed guy. He voluntary chose to work over seas for 3 years leaving me to raise child by myself while I go to school to find a job for a new career since my previous career did not work out. After taking care of our child by myself for the past 3 years (but really most of the childs life but not in the eyes of the court since we were married) I get the ""I provide for my child"" speech. The record stopped. Provide? This guy drags me to court to skip out on paying $150 a month only to be told he has to pay $500 a month per the law and he tells me he is providing for his son. I know what you are thinking, he pays his child support so that is providing for his son... NO IT IS NOT. The State and the Court Systems provide for my child by making sure his father fulfills his court ordered obligation. I provide for my son financially, academically and socially. I with the help of the state and the states court provide for that child. You do no drag a woman to court, demean her by calling her golden vagina or whatever, leave so she is the only one caring for a child that you had a part in making and said you wanted and still maintain the title of ""Provider"". I was pissed; I am the one who goes to this childs functions,help him with his HW, feeds him, clothes him, provides him shelter for 90% of the year, yet this guy thinks he PROVIDES for my son. He bitches all the time about how much child support he has to pay lie his $500 makes ME and BREAKS him. 




I have done nothing but sacrifice things that I have wanted and worked for for the past 10 years because of That relationship, our child and now I am sacrificing opportunities because someone needs to raise our son. He gets to do what ever the hell he wants, no limitations with his career, no worries about childcare, travel.. what ever and yet he still bitches like I take from him. ME. The single parent who would love an opportunity to work overseas, love an opportunity to go off for a summer or spring to intern in another state but can't because I have child who has school or to maintain a place of residence for me and our child. So I have to work with the cards I have been dealt with but with thats fine because yes I have been given some lemons in life and with them I made some damn good lemonade. Over the past couple years I have been able to complete 2 degrees and am working on my last one and I got an offer amazing job offer. 






I don't know where this post/rant is going. It is very hard raising a child alone. I am a very ambitious women, the next chapter in my life is conquering the corporate world and single parenthood. Up until a couple of weeks ago, I didn't think that I could have a new career and parent by myself but the conversation with my ex made me realize that I have been doing it on my own for a while, it won't be easy but I have always provided and will continue to provide for my child. Dare I say it..... I can have it all."
7j8hek,1,2017-12-12,I survived the semester when I didn’t think I could,msb132,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7j8hek/i_survived_the_semester_when_i_didnt_think_i_could/,"Four days before the semester started I had a violent seizure (I have epilepsy), and along with issues I was having with medication adjustments and depression, the decision to go back to school 3000 miles from home where I have no family was extremely difficult. My parents, friends, and mentors all encouraged me to take some time off so I didn’t burn out, but I felt trapped at home, so I came back to school and hoped for the best.

This semester has been a rollercoaster, and my depression worsened to the point where I was having thoughts of hurting myself. Things have gotten a little better recently after a medication switch, but the other day I was walking and suddenly thought about the fact that I could have a seizure right there, and hit my head on the pavement, and be dead before I even knew what was happening. I nearly had a panic attack, and went and cried in a nearby building (I go there to cry pretty often, lol).

But today, I was walking at almost the same spot when it hit me that I actually did it. I managed to survive the entire semester without any seizures, without anything majorly bad happening, without needing help from others, without my mental health worsening, and without my grades slipping too far.

I don’t think anyone thought I could do it, since the odds stacked against me were pretty high. And I seriously didn’t think I could do it either. Every day I’ve just been hanging on until the next project, or next exam, or next unit, and I ended up hanging on through the semester. But somehow along the way, I managed to flourish, and I didn’t even realize it; I’ve:
-maintained an almost all A average
-traveled to Florida for a conference
-interviewed with dozens of companies for summer internships
-committed to an internship at a company I love on a team that I think I’ll learn a lot from
-learned so much more about my condition and what I can do to treat it
-improved my communication skills

I know everyone else is proud of me, but I’m so astounded and proud of myself. I’m ready to kick ass next semester, and this time I know I’m going to do it."

7j9k1y,3,2017-12-12,"Been tracking for over a year, feeling burned out. Perfectionist attitude catching up with me. Big life changes coming up adding to urge to binge. Rant filled with some vanity and shallowness",cep1234,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/7j9k1y/been_tracking_for_over_a_year_feeling_burned_out/,"I’m 21 and 5’2” and I went from 140 to 120 pounds in Jan-August 2016 and maintained succesfully for one year with some slight fluctuations. I was always able to get back on track though if my weight crept up. I’m currently struggling with that now. 

I am about to graduate college and have an exciting path ahead of me. I’m moving to a new city, have a great job and salary for a 21 year old...really my life is awesome and I’m blessed. BUT change makes me feel very anxious. I’ve been binging a lot and just generally feel like shit. I have binged 4 to 5 times in the past week eating over 1000 cal at a time. With almost weekly binges since the semester started.

Here’s the thing:
Since turning 21 in September, I’ve gained about 5 pounds(maybe a little less, hopefully not much more). I know that sounds minor and it truly really is but in my mind it feels massive. I haven’t actually gone on the scale but know my maintenance calories and can do math and I’ve been consistently over since my birthday. I’ve been tracking my calories this whole time. I can see differences in pictures and in the way my clothes feel. Obviously I have been drinking a lot which is definitely part of the culprit, but I drank before turning 21 also and was always able to stay on track.

I think my problem is I try too hard to be perfect. I want to be the smartest, the prettiest, the hottest, the skinniest, the fastest runner, the most successful whatever it is, I want it. Pair this quest for perfection with brutally low self-esteem and you have a recipe for disaster. Despite not feeling overly stressed right now just kind of anxious about life changes soon to come, one of my professors commented to me that maybe I’m just burnt out? I pushed myself really hard in college and I am graduating in 3 1/2 years with an awesome job lined up, 2 internships and other meaningful experiences on my resume. Regular runner. Half marathon under my belt.  I’m not trying to brag I’m just trying to paint a picture of who I am. Despite all of this I’m still very dissatisfied with myself and turn to food to numb emotions of “not feeling good enough.” I track my calories and know I’m gaining weight which adds to the “I’m not good enough” feeling.


I feel like myfitnesspal and seeing how over I am on my calories is really messing with my head. I don’t want to lose my streak but I want to take a break from tracking on the app. I think it’s adding to my anxious feelings tremendously. Has anyone tracked their calories on pen and paper and then later put it in my fitness pal? Does this sound stupid? Can anyone relate to this?


 I would like to stick to 1200 cal for a few weeks to get these 5 pounds off. Does anyone have tips on how to do this without beating myself up and feeling bad? College graduation and Christmas time probably aren’t the best times in the world to try to lose weight but I can probably do it if I really want to. Alternatively I just want the weight off before I start my job in mid January. So basically does anyone have tips for losing 5 pounds? It sounds so trivial that I feel stupid asking. I run regularly so my TDEE is about 1850 calories.

Also if anyone has tips on how to cultivate self-esteem please help me LOL"

7jb7hx,0,2017-12-12,M4f - Roll Tide,Medium__Arousal,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7jb7hx/m4f_roll_tide/,"*A great convergence of ignorance, poverty, and depravity -- or, 'how I had the time of my life in Alabama.'*

I dreaded my arrival from the moment of its conception, a little over 37 weeks ago.  I knew next to nothing about the place, somewhere south of Birmingham, of which I also had next to no knowledge.  I was aware only of the stereotypes.  The moronic drawl that is the sonic equivalent of drooling, the tendency towards obesity, and the dual love of God and sinning.

Those views blanketed the entirety of the south, with slight variations and additions.  For some reason I believed Georgia had less incest than Mississippi, that a Louisiana native was likelier more stupid than a Texan.  Of course no one was more inbred and less learned than my second cousin Sheila.  And why I had to spend six weeks visiting her and the lost (and best forgotten) branch of my mothers family down in good ol' 'Bama was beyond me.

Sheila was 22, a victim of rape (part of God's plan) -- one that went unreported (wrong to ruin a young mans life for one mistake) -- and a single mother.  These were the things that defined her for the past seven years.  I'd done my best to ignore her vague appeals for interaction in the form of Facebook status updates.  But then the private messages came.

Her words made my skin crawl.  They were cloying and I could hear her accent in them.  She was still 10 years old in my head, despite the pictures I'd seen, the hateful thoughts I'd seen her share so easily.  She was family still, no matter how distant, and I gave her my number and delayed every single proposal she made to catch up in person.

To my utter and complete astonishment, it was me who ended up making arrangements to visit her.  I was scrambling to find a job at the end of school and managed to snag an internship with a meagre stipend.  Six months of work in the deep south, in a small trailer where all work orders and billing were processed from branches across the country.  

I told her I'd be in Alabama, working only a dozen miles from her home, and that we would finally get to visit like she'd been begging for.  

I booked my flight and dreaded the dwindling moments until I would be stuck in a sweaty, bigoted, Jesus-praising pool of tepid shit.

*You can play Sheila, her daughter (under 10 years old), any other white trash woman or girl, or a character of your own devising.  Just be prepared to delve into the filth.*"
7jbmts,2,2017-12-12,Safe to say I'm experiencing mania if my libido changes with an antidepressant dose,patriotlawyer00,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7jbmts/safe_to_say_im_experiencing_mania_if_my_libido/,"My PCP didn't think it was mania at first when prescribing me lexapro 10 mg, but I wen't from living in terror or panic most of the time on stimulants to complete relief to the point where I never felt anxiety when most people would. It was like unreal confidence although my eyes looked drugged up, people thought it was drugs but it was an antidepressant. My libido rose so high, i was having real healthy sex life with my ex-gf and always in a good mood spending money I shouldn't have like crazy because my self-image was impeccable. 

I had trouble maintaining a job during grad school but worked a huge internship over one summer where I definitely felt like something was off on lexapro, like my ex-gf made me feel better than I should have and now i'm having so much trouble catching up as a person and restoring relationships, but at a cost.

Seeing a psych now that didn't definitively diagnose me with Bipolar 2, but I'm on Dexedrine Spansules 15 mg and Adderall 10 mg IR as needed for my bar exam studies and for depression, rexulti 1 mg, wellbutrin xl 300 mg, and Effexor 37.5 mg twice a daily. If i raise my effexor to 75 mg, I get more relief but also look more sedated and people look at me like im crazy including my own family when I bring home new girls (assuming I look out of it and they have to be nuts to come home with me). Now I take partial dose and split it up and things seem clearer but i have more anxiety. Why is my libido fluctuating with my sense of reality on a slight dose change? I've been put on lithium and lamictal in the past and neither helped me, couldn't leave bed just cried all day. could be dealing with a situation at home that they want control over my life and lexapro shattered that in ways, but also made me look medicated and now on a lower dose i wouldn't be prone to such control yet suffer more. its tempting to raise my dose again because of how good I physically look but mentally confused. thank you"
7jc8xf,68,2017-12-12,In 2012 I went to a rave with a couple of Mormons I had just met,corporat,PointlessStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/7jc8xf/in_2012_i_went_to_a_rave_with_a_couple_of_mormons/,"Summer 2012

I was on an internship in Austin, which is pretty far from home for me. I didn't have a car, and I wasn't 21 yet (and no, no fake ID). I wanted to go out and see some live music but those two things limited my options. I resorted to a desperate post in our intern Facebook group asking if anyone with transportation wanted to see a few shows.

Someone saved me from the embarrassment of going without a reply, an intern I hadn't met yet. He offered to have me tag along at a Kaskade concert. It wasn't my scene, but I figured it was better than nothing. We exchanged some info and he said ""see you Friday!""

-----

Friday

I meet him after work at his car and we take off. He introduces me to his college friend, Bryce. Co-intern asks me if I'm a Kaskade fan. I say I hadn't heard of him before his message. He nods, ""I hadn't heard of him either until I saw an article with the headline ""Mormon Becomes $200,000-a-night DJ.'"" Now he considers himself a fan.

It's no secret that this company recruits from BYU regularly, so I ask if he's Mormon. ""Yup, both of us.""

But there was no turning back.

Bryce is a character. What's most remarkable from my first impression of him is that he has ""stoner voice."" But neither he nor the co-intern have any drug-related vocabulary, ""stoner"" is a new one for them. My incredulous smirk isn't new, however; *that* he gets all the time. Bryce leads the discussion on our 90-minute car ride with stories of the 3 or 4 times he has has gotten in trouble with BYU administration on suspicion of ""doing drugs.""

I ask which drugs. ""I don't know!"" He recounts an interrogation by the BYU president where he had nothing to accuse Bryce of, so he just asked leading questions for 15 minutes or so and dismissed him with just a warning. ""Maybe he had hoped to smell drugs on me.""

Bryce's stories of getting in trouble at home are similar. His parents staged an unsuccessful intervention, unsuccessful because *he doesn't do drugs,* but I assume it never lead to any meaningful discussion on drugs either. This summer he's living with his grandma so he can hang out with co-intern on the weekends, and he's enjoying it because she doesn't ask those uncomfortable questions. He reminds me of my stoner friends in more ways than one.

I ask about girls while we stop at Whattaburger. One of the other BYU interns I've met, younger than me and still a student, was already married. ""BYU girls are pretty annoying,"" co-intern says, ""They say 'I don't want to talk to you unless I'm dating you, and I'm not dating you.'"" They both have some personal grievances, and reaffirm their shared suspicions that the MRS degree is the only degree that matters to BYU women. Of course, they care about marriage too (needless to say really, they're virgins) but Mormon girls are told to get married before a certain age, and the pressure makes them impossible sometimes.

In particular, they hate girls who go to energy drink parties(!) and pretend to be hyper. I was really interested to hear more about these parties, but there was nothing to say really. ""Someone buys a bunch of energy drinks and people come over and they drink it.""

-----

San Antonio

At Cowboys Dancehall, finally, we realize we've gotten there way too early. It's empty. Some DJ with Guido in his name is playing. I curse out something and Bryce thinks it's *so* funny. He repeats it without cussing, and I realize the last two hours I've been saying ""shit"" and ""fucking"" incessantly, and maybe I've been disrespectful in some way. They haven't shown any discomfort over it, but I try to dial it back.

It's another few hours of standing around and talking before Kaskade happens, and another couple hours still before it's all over. I don't have anything remarkable to say about the music, just that it isn't my scene. I'm surrounded by hundreds, most of them in full rave gear. We're still in our business casual polos and jeans, taking it all in. At some point I use the restroom, and when I come back Bryce is staring face-to-face with a girl giving him a personal finger-light-glove show. He's clearly impressed.

At some point my company ducks back, away from the crowd. It's another 20 mins before I've had enough too, and join them way in the back where there's still a semi-decent view. Co-intern tells me I just missed the girl with big breasts that was standing next to them. I'm scandalized. I thought they weren't allowed that kind of behavior? ""We still have eyes, we're allowed to look."" We shrug.

We hang back through the grand finale, including that one song I think I heard on the radio once. The light show is very impressive, as is the crowd's energy during what I guessed was Kaskade's big hit single. We start to leave just as we hear Kaskade thanking San Antonio.

Co-intern is disappointed. ""It was the same set as the one I listened to on SoundCloud. If I had known that I probably wouldn't have come."" I told him that I thought it was fun, but I had no expectations. ""I get that, I'm glad you had fun, it's just kind of *shitty,* you know?"" I freeze, I feel like a gradeschooler or maybe like a terrified parent. I turn away and keep walking back to the car.

-----

The way back is much more silent than before. I ask them about their mission trips. They each went to South America, and they really enjoyed themselves. South America is already very Christian, and strangers will readily welcome missionaries into their homes for a conversation about God.

We talk more about the unique aspects of Mormonism, and we all agree that they're not going to convert me. After a few laughs, they invite me to their pool party at Bryce's grandma's house right before dropping me off at my apartment. I never follow up on that invite, and I didn't see or speak with either of them since. It's still a night I think about every so often."

They don't feel anger towards me, they just feel sorry that I made the 'wrong' decision.

I'm frustrated.  My younger sibling became hyper-christian after a serious head injury/concussion.  He is doing an internship at the church.  I casually mentioned that there is a strong positive correlation between people becoming more religious after head injuries, but it turns out I am wrong, and it was God steering him towards love.

I had bought the book ""about christianity"" before my complete deconversion, and he saw it on my table the other day.  I told him he could have it, that I didn't want it anymore.  He says with this patronizing voice... ""no, I think I'll leave it, in hopes that one day you pick it up and read it"" as if he is some sort of fucking philosopher now.

I'm sad.  This is hard.  I'm alone.  My ENTIRE family and extended family are christian (pastors, church-goers, rabid).  I was there too... even broke up with a girl in highschool after a god retreat because she wasn't christian.

This is tough.  They dismiss my ""I'm no longer a christian"" as ""oh good for you for challenging your faith, you'll get there.  Here are some book recommendations"".  They don't take me seriously.

If I could choose to go back and be ignorant, I almost think I would.

I got an internship last year. Applied at like 10 places. Only received one interview which I got the job for.

This year, I applied at like 4 places. Got two interviews. Didn't receive a second interview from both.

I figured I was going to have a lot better shot of getting an internship this year than last. GPA went up from 3.2 to 3.3. Status is a senior instead of a junior. Had 4 months of tax experience. Interviews (I felt) were 10x better than the one I had last year.

And then I have friends who have 3.0's and 3.2 who got internships in CS that pay $20/hr who are sophomore status, meaning they've taken only the most entry level of CS classes.

I also have a friend with a 3.1 who received multiple offers for finance internships who is a junior.

I'm so confused. Is accounting just a lot more competitive for internships or do I just suck?"

I’m headed out to Denver next month for a five month internship (part time, in the career field I was pursuing before taking time off to bartend). I really don’t want to fully give up the lifestyle I’ve had for the past year and a half, so I would like to bartend part time as well.

I currently work at a craft cocktail place in a much smaller market (Vermont). Creative drinks, great atmosphere, high price points, low covers. I’m encouraged to play around and refine drinks for the menu, and I’ve been extremely lucky with the spirits/amari/beer/wine education I have received.

There was a thread from two years ago that broke down the neighborhoods, and based on that, I think I should be looking in RiNo and Capitol Hill? I’m essentially looking to get my foot in the door somewhere with thoughtful drinks where I can make some good money and connections (haha story of everyone’s life, right?)

I could use some productivity advice. My issue is that I need the internet to run my business yet I get distracted by it at the same time. Here's is what will happen: 

I keep a running tab of all my to-dos (using Asana and my notebook) and decide I'm going to get X, Y, Z done today. I try to keep it to 3 main tasks plus my daily tasks.

But then I'll get an idea or have a question that I need an answer on so I'll Google it. This takes me down a rabbit hole of information where I'm reading various websites, blogs and clicking on more links as I go thus taking me deeper in cyberspace. At some point I'll look up and that one thing I wanted to quickly search has turned into 1hr of time or more. I'll have dozens of tabs open and nothing on my to do list that is actually getting done. Sometimes it several hours have passed or on my worst days I barely get started with ""work"" and spend the whole day trying to work and googling stuff Ive been thinking about or doing personal things instead of running my own business. I'm not super active on social media so blocking those sites don't help. It's the world wide web thats distracting. 

I sell things online so I need access to google and various sites everyday to do my job. Having access to social media is important when I look up other companies or check my own business' social media accounts. Like most Entrepreneurs I don't have all the answers so I often need to google how to do something e-commerce related for my business like FB ads or email marketing. However, I spending more time absorbing information that actually doing work. Is my business suffering? Yes and no. I don't have to do much to get sales daily as I've spent the last two years building my company up to this point. I don't have an employee or an intern so no accountability there. It's just me in my own office. The truth is I have a ton of things to do. There is always something that can be done and of course more money to be made however, for the last few weeks, I have spent the whole work day googling about various things. 

I feel mentally burned out and guilty everyday. I know there are people that would love to be in my position (own business, own office, own boss, steady income) so I feel like I am not doing the right things when the opportunity I have in front of me. My ""addiction"" to searching the internet for information is getting out of hand.

I looked at some apps but most just block the websites you specify. Since I don't have a specific website to block and I need the to internet to do the work on my to-do lists I find myself in a disempowered loop. 

Any advice on how to get more productive? Can anyone at least relate? 

I'm grateful for any feedback and happy to answer questions. Thank you!

PS. This is my first reddit post. Yay! Be Gentle.

22M

- I used to be a very empathetic person, who forgave anyone. Right now it's messed up. I'm only empathetic to animals and those who i feel deserve it. sometimes it's twisted, e.g. when someone passes away I find it funny but regret it the very next day, but i find it really hard to mourn a loss. 
- Higher pain threshold, 16 years of physical abuse and i feel like a rock
- Either mentally 15 years old or 40 years old, can't relate to people my age or within a few years difference. 
- I expect to be shouted at for anything, when it's a woman who shouts at me it turns me on, I know this isn't ideal for a long term relationship just my mind playing tricks on me.
- Zero Self Esteem, I can't look in the mirror without feeling like an  alien, I didn't use a mirror till about 18. Keep seeing different versions of me and I see differences in my image everyday but they eventually stay as one final one and the cycle repeats when i wake up.
- Hypervigilance in social situations, walking alone or when i walk past NParents.
- Socially isolated, Learning how to walk without consciously thinking about it, trying to make eye contact with strangers and keeping my head up.
- A warped view of the world, it's really hard to smile unless someone trips/falls and it's really hard to be optimistic about the future.
- NParents forced me to study 24/7, I hate studying now; still trying to study because I need to make money to move out.
- Trust Issues, Everybody ends up disappointing somehow, e.g. When i phone or send an email, I expect an instant reply or I feel neglected or feel like someone is plotting something.
- Feel like a robot which follows it's programming, don't have hobbies, interests, likes or dislikes. I eat what i'm given, study, daydream and sleep.
- Got in touch with my emotions and repressed feelings at about 21 and went scuba diving without an oxygen tank into depression, was depressed, stressed, sad and angry for about 1 year and eventually led to an autoimmune disorder.
- Severe Anxiety on top of Asthma, literally like being choked by two people. Social anxiety is the worst.
- Fear of intimacy, never been hugged. got my first hug two weeks ago and my body went cold and i pulled back.
- No motivation, I gave into helplessness, stopped applying for jobs, internships because i didn't feel worthy of it or never had a chance.
- Memory is terrible, there are huge blanks
- Dislike of Authority figures (small desire to overthrow) 

I don't think therapy is for me so i'll just find my own way. If you have your own changes feel free to post.

It's funny, I'm sitting here unable to articulate what it is that I want to say to you right now. I've never been good at telling people I'm hurting, especially you, for some reason, but I attribute that to the fact that you could always read me like a book. It wouldn't take much else than a slight bog in my gait or an almost imperceptibly hunched shoulder for you to know something wasn't quite right. Most importantly, though, I knew I could fall apart in front of you and not be judged for it. That was probably one of the most special things about you, Dad. I miss it.

School's going O.K., and I've landed a scholarship, an internship, and a job in a residency program all in three months. You'd be proud as hell - I remember when you called in to the local newspaper when we got the news I was accepted to a prestigious school with a full tuition scholarship. I had to try not to be outright embarrassed when every teacher at my high school was congratulating me the next day. 

You always knew how to make me feel human and loved. 

The thing that scares me, though, is that I don't really feel anything positive about landing these opportunities. I just feel empty. My mom is proud of me, and the rest of my family is really excited that I'm going to be graduating soon, and all I can think about sometimes is going up in the mountains in the snow to run away from everybody. I don't know what's wrong with me. You always made me feel safe in your great big bear hugs, and you always listened when I was hurting. Nobody else has done that.

I'm still trying to heal after my girlfriend started getting abusive. I know you liked her - I did too. She was turning into a good person and growing a lot when you were still around and it was the three of us. Ever since, I broke, and she was diagnosed with a serious mental illness. I don't know why but she started becoming really emotionally and verbally abusive. She cheated on me, blamed me for all our problems, and was arrested for domestic violence. 

I never thought things were going to get that bad.

I left her after that, and have realized that the family I've always wanted - you, me, and her - is gone now. There's nothing left. I got away from a bad family situation back East and was finally happy here, and now I'm just as miserable as I used to be. 

Dad, I really miss you. Despite everything else that's good in my life, I'm not happy: I feel alone, scared, and utterly unprepared. I've started really opening up to my therapist, and I'm terrified that he's not going to be able to help me. I want my family back. I want my home back. I want to feel human again.

Please come back, Dad. I don't know how I'm going to do this without you.

7jgk6v,3,2017-12-12,"Did I Miss My Chance? (Another ""Straight"" Friend Saga)",BiFrattyGuy,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7jgk6v/did_i_miss_my_chance_another_straight_friend_saga/,"Bros, is he a closet case or a raging homophobe (or both)?

This is super long, but one needs all the details to provide legitimate feedback.

I submitted a similar albeit less detailed question in r/askgaybros with a throwaway account about this exact situation last year (wasn't helpful). I know there is a caucus of r/askgaybros that hate this type of thread, and it's their freedom to move on from it if that's the case. I'm looking for advice...

My ""straight"" college buddy/former roommate is coming to visit in a few weeks and I need to know:

(1)-Was he into me and I simply didn't make the right moves, or is he too uncomfortable with his sexuality?
(2)-When he visits, how do I address this issue if at all?

Background on the two of us:

Me (now M23) met him (now M22) in a lecture class my junior (his sophomore) year of college. We quickly became close bros from different fraternities and he rapidly suggested we room together the next year. We did and things were so homoerotic that I got caught up in fantasy land (those details outlined below). Being a year older than him, I graduated and moved to work in a new city 3-4 hours away. He's now graduated and in law school (same college) and is visiting me for the first time when his exams end (as opposed to me having always gone up to college).

I'd like to casually bring up my past feelings for him and the homoerotic behavior that took place. As a frequent r/askgaybros reader, I've seen all the similar stories. It's helped me to ""move on"" from my ""straight friend"" crush, but I've never had the conversation with him in person – a final step in moving on I find necessary. To be clear: I'm like 98% over everything that happened, and value his friendship. So getting y'alls thoughts will just narrow down the scope of questions/statements I wish to exchange with him.

Homoerotic background (we will call my buddy ""P"" - also note fetishes are discussed in this thread so hold your judgement bitch boys):

-We both had the same large lecture together (and subsequently a lot of classes due to sharing a major) and P frequently would use the restroom during this 80 minute lecture. This is before we knew each other. While walking to and from the bathroom, he'd stare at me the entire walk - making eye contact that I took suggestively. Eventually, P did this so much I had to make a move. I started doing the same thing and eventually he met in the bathroom during the lecture and he introduces himself. By the end of it, we exchange numbers and the next week attend parties with one another.
 
-We started hanging out frequently, with P giving me rides to classes we shared, drinking together and the normal bro shit. We became best friends QUICK. So quick that he asked me to live with him in a 2 bedroom apartment the next year. We both couldn't live in shit hole frat houses anymore. So we moved in together.

-It's important to note here that P wrestled his entire life. Those dudes do have their own brand of homoerotic so I try to ground myself with that. He was mid-weight, built well and still lean, with very nice legs and a super cute face. Great ass, great feet. All-American type who also dressed ""too well."" For other LGBTQ folks or frat bros who think everything is gay, P may be someone you suspect due to his fashion. However, he's masculine, smart, super athletic, conservative, and pulled a lot of women. He had a couple very questionable items that although he didn't always wear them he did on occasion (LV leather backpack, gucci scarf, true religion jeans. etc.)

-So we get back from summer break and fall semester of my senior/his junior year begins. We were very excited about living together, and began the sylly week partying immediately.

-He was not 21 until after the new year, so I did a lot of pregamming and occasional house parties with him and then would jump off to the bars. But we grew very close regardless, spending a lot of our downtime in the apartment building, eating together, studying together, cleaning together, etc. During that time is when things started to get weird...

-We would both bring women home, but it became a bit of a jealousy thing. Always comparing each other's hookups and our types, and eventually both suggesting three ways with us and another chick (never happened)

-But anything surrounding the gym or bedtime is where it got homoerotic (versus just ""dudes being dudes"")... P would come home from the gym or get ready for bed and strip out of his clothes with only his calvin kleins or gay-ish undies on. Bright colors, tight fit, and a bulge - always. Right in front of me, as I'm clearly gazing at him. This often turned into us wrestling just in our underwear. Oftentimes, I'd have at least a semi-hard cock. On several occasions his limbs would brush or even pin down by cock. I enjoyed the wrestling, and he often did too - but sometimes he'd get annoyed and frustrated with too much rolling around. In a competitive way.

-But as that became more frequent, so did other kinky behavior... I'd give him some foot massages since he had beautiful feet. A couple of times, that lead to tickling and even low key sucking his toes. He'd pull away like he was weirded out sometimes, but the foot/sock/shoe kink became a big part of our relationship. It's my biggest fetish as I suspected it might be his. Our texts and Instagram DMs, etc. after I graduated were often about socks and feet in some way, although not always directly sexual.

-He then wore the same socks to the gym for a very long period of time. He knew I liked that, and would take them off and assert dominance when we would get back from the gym by shoving them in my face. The teasing became unreal.

-Come fraternity crush/formal time, we'd often get ready together and then go our separate ways. This dude is was cute and spoiled that he didn't know how to tie a tie, so I had to for him. As we're dressed looking like we are each other's dates in the mirror, I'm tying his tie with my arms around his shoulders. He makes a subtle, relaxed comment about how ""gay we would look if someone walked in."" I said ""yeah, I don't mind it"" and kissed him on the cheek. He smiled and that was that.

-As these types of interactions became more frequent and the second semester went full speed ahead, I became more upfront about things. Eventually, I told him I was bi and that I've ""at least"" kissed a man before to which he said ""he always knew it."" Unfortunately, he really became homophobic at this point yet the homoerotic behavior didn't end...

-He would go on these rants just to me about how he would ""never want a gay son"" and how ""life's purpose is to have a wife that pops at babies while I work all day."" Just very 1950s BS that I always countered. To me, it was him suppressing his sexuality and wanted to pick my brain on questions he had about life as a gay/bi man. I think he knew I might have some answers to those questions, but he would continually use derogatory language about the LGBTQ community. I'm no SJW, but his comments were obviously targeted at me.

-But the fuckery continued... spying on each other in the shower, wrestling in underwear, him showing off his toes until I would touch them, watching movies and falling asleep next to each other, discussing three-sums, etc. 

-P had a thing for ""man musk"" at one of the gyms on campus, and he'd mention it here and there. Saying that it was grungy and for alpha men and that's why he liked it.

-P also said this rapey statement a few times, and eventually after I graduated claimed that he was ""just fucking with me."" But he would say: ""I could rape you. You know you'd like it. We both know it'd be consensual."" I said, ""what? what does that mean? Like you just tie me up in your bed and fuck me until your done and then leave me there?"" He said, ""Sure..."" to which I replied ""whatever your fantasy is..."" -- exchanges like that were almost weekly at that point, if not more. On such days, we'd still pregame together, meet up later in the night, undress together after home drunk from the bars, and I'd try to make a move or two but he always got cold feet or just wasn't interested (or I was too drunk... cuz senior year).

-As the semester came to an end, we both realized that this chapter and the little fantasy we lived in was quickly coming to an end. I had mentioned that I met another bro at my summer internship I had before we moved in together in fall. The bro I met was another masc wrestler similar to P but the other guys (let's call him G) was more built and smarter than P, at an Ivy League not too far away. So G came to visit toward the end of my senior year and it was the first time G and myself saw each other since we left our internship. I told P that he was visiting literally hours before he was going to arrive. P became visibly anxious, and immediately went into full homoerotic teasing mode. P changed and put on *only* the sweatpants I thought were cute, and was shirtless and sockless in our tiny apartment as I wrapped up a class paper that P knew I couldn't be distracted from. P began vacuuming every corner of the apartment (even though it didn't need it) and looked me in the eye the entire time he did it – smirking and biting his lips. I eventually got him to stop by grabbing his tea jug and running into my room, and P immediately runs after me and tackles me onto my bed. Having previously joked with P weeks before by saying ""hey dude sit on my face with that bubble butt,"" when I said ""sit on my face"" at this exact moment P knew exactly what to do. We sat there for a few minutes as I tried to wrestle away the tea while enjoying him riding my face while he free-balled in sweatpants. I was fully erect, with my back laying on the bed. But again something happened in P's mind, and P just got up and walked away - P began getting changed for happy hour. 

-The night my friends G came, G stayed in my bed with me and we had a little action. While we were at the bars, P stayed right up my ass and tried to get in pictures and get G's number and was acting out of character. P would typically go hang with his fraternity brothers instead of following me around the bar with my fraternity brothers. This night was different. He wanted me attention, or to watch us interact, or to try and scoop G up himself.

-Additionally, P caught me jerking off on multiple occasions throughout that year. With roughly three times him seeing my fully hard cock and one time saying ""cute"" as he stopped and glanced at me in my room.

-P then went back home for his last summer before senior year, and I graduated and immediately moved to a new city, where I am now.
 
-During P's senior year, he was busy with tough classes and I was busy with my new career. We didn't talk that much but would on occasion just to touch base. I was really upset that nothing ever happened between us, and therefore tried my best to forget about him - to not text him frequently, to find other people I was romantically interested in, and to move on. It was a new chapter.

-But it was hard and it took a lot of conversations with close friends I'm out to and searching r/askgaybros and other threads to find answers to my questions. It got better, and the two times we did visit one another nothing happened. I frequently travel for work and he's in law school.

-I'm out to a handful of family, friends, and co-workers at this point. I've considered myself much more sexually experienced than him even before him and I met. Right when him and I signed that lease in college together, he was breaking up with a girlfriend who cheater on him and he hasn't been in a relationship since. I have.

-This past summer a mutual friend of P and me who is a female college hookup of mine moved to my city (let's call her N). We immediately picked up where we left off. N and P were in the same graduating class. I recently started seeing N a lot now that she's here, and a month or so ago we did some fancy stuff together and posted it on Instagram. P didn't like that, and immediately messaged me ""joking around"" about how the girls in law school sucks, how he hasn't been laid, how he didn't realize I was ""in some actual relationship thing,"" and all sorts of questions about each other's sex lives, etc... 
The key part? He began that conversation by sending a picture of his socks and shoes at the gym. Talking about them, etc. until he bridged into that deeper relationship items he wanted to discuss.

He said ""it's crazy how much you love me... you must be so happy that I'm coming by myself to visit you.. blah blah blah"" It was at this point we made plans for him to visit in three week. 

Now, that date is coming up soon. I need to focus in on one of the following:
 
(1) Securing our friendship by not mentioning anything, OR
(2) Making a calculated move that will hopefully at least yield a solid hot weekend of romance, OR
(3) Tell him how I felt about everything and continue to move on.

I've managed to visit the Abbotsford House, Melrose Abbey and Dryburgh Alley! It's a shame I missed your festival, as I'm sure I would of loved to participate in it. But we have more serious topics to talk about. I'd hate to down the mood, but it's a problem that we South Scottish face. Youth unemployment, strain on local economies, lack of money being allocated to businesses across the constituency, crime rates increasing, and it's time to challenge this.

I have had the honour and privilege to visit this great town. However, I believe we can make it greater. By allocating more funding towards businesses, which in return promotes economic growth and allows more employment, gives our youth the chance to have a job, or a internship, or even employment within the trades sector. It's important that more jobs are flowing into this constituency, or we will face the consequences, of higher unemployment and more economic strain.

I've also had the privilege to meet some amazing people in this town. Mary-Sue, a local, has told me about her farmer, Jean, who is a Belgian immigrant, and they have a son, Adam, who is finding it hard to find employment at the moment while he's on break with his family from university. Jean, Mary-Sue, Adam, I can promise you this. I can promise you that Adam will find a job, with better allocation of funding towards businesses, the beating heart of economic growth, which will provide more jobs. 

I met a young girl, Aoife, who goes to school every morning however she recently moved away from Edinburgh, where public transport is more common. She wants to know if there will ever be a line going to Edinburgh so she can see her friends. I promised her this, that I would create a new line from Dumfries to Edinburgh, that would cut through small towns, like Melrose, which would increase tourism here, and encouraging better economic growth, and also better access to cities, like Edinburgh, like Ayr (large town infact)

The Scottish National Party stand for the same values and interests that all Scottish share. We are the party that represents the true values of what makes a Scot, well a Scot. Voters, supporters of Melrose, elect a party based on representation, because that party is sure to carry this constituency far. As your MSP I will faithfully serve you and carry out my duties to the full capacity. I am a proud Southerner, and I stand for the values we all share.

People of Melrose, thank you for letting me campaign here today. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here, and I look forward to campaigning back here. I will be heading north later today to promote my campaign and welcome supporters on my Battle Bus. You are also all welcome to the tea party afterwards which is down the hall. Melrose, vote for a party that represents the Scots, vote for a party that will strengthen the Scottish economy, vote for a party that makes people satisfied with, finally, vote for a party that knows Scotland.

Vote Stalinomics. Vote SNP.

*Stalinomics walks off stage. He is greeted by a large fanbase as he discusses and talks with them over various issues, from fishing, to rugby, to the latest football news.

The rent is about 470 a month and is per person with my roommate I have now paying the same amount, that is including heat, water, and internet. The apartment is right behind White Hall so its pretty much the best apartment location in Boone. My roommate is a computer science major, who you would be living with and if you are interested send me a message so you could see the apartment."

7jhb89,11,2017-12-13,Should I buy a car at all?,ABgraphics,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/7jhb89/should_i_buy_a_car_at_all/,"I've been looking at a 2004 golf gl for a while, that has under 100,000 miles, and is $3495 upfront.  The cost of insurance/liability is around $300/mo or $180/mo without vehicle coverage. That plus $750 for gas a year (rough estimate). 

I've been told that's pretty good, but it's still an increase to what I pay right now for transportation. I live about 1.5 miles away from my work, which is fantastic in the summer, I can easily walk/bike. Winter is slightly less convenient, I spend around $100-150 on bus fare a month, and spend a significant amount of time just waiting for the bus in negative temperatures.

I rarely go out/hangout with friends because if it's not the bus line that goes past my apartment, it will take me more than an hour just to get there, not to mention getting back. Avoiding spending $20-30 for Uber would be great too.

I also depend on my roommate for rides to get groceries. For everything else I have to walk or just not go. I live within a 4-5 hour range of visiting my hometown family &amp; friends, but I don't I don't have the time to see them as it's 8-9 hours by bus (and $75-100 per trip) which makes it not worth going down for a weekend, which I'd like to do more often.

I'm also (maybe) coming to the end of an $17/hr internship, and I'm worried about transportation in possible job search process.

At this point can justify the cost of a car for the flexibility, mobility and time savings, or should I just tough it out, stay in and keep saving? 

**TLDR:** Would like more flexibility/mobility of a car, but is it worth paying an extra $1,900-2,000 a year on $17/hr?

I'm currently setting up a samba4 server acting as an AD domain controller and have encountered an issue when trying to connect it to other servers.

I installed Samba version 4.7.1 via a tar.gz, created new ca.pem, cert.pem and key.pem, and put TLS_REQCERT to ‘allow’ so as to at least see if an ldapsearch from another server could contact the samba4. Also, the domain is auth.tripase.local.

7ji5xo,11,2017-12-13,Almost been a year,bearus_,ChildrenofDeadParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildrenofDeadParents/comments/7ji5xo/almost_been_a_year/,"My mom passed away suddenly February 3, 2017 due to a heart attack. She was 55. It was raining, and my dad didn't want to pay for a ambulance so he was going to drive her to the hospital himself. I thought everything would turn out okay, so I stayed home because I didn't want to miss school that day. My brother came to get me and all I remeber next is the ambulance taking forever to get there and a police officer telling us it was too late.  I was 16 at the time (17 now) and her death has hit my family hard,well at least broke our family up. My dad isn't home most of the time, he now has a girlfriend. They were married for 23 years and he got rid of all of her things, including pictures. My brother, who is now a major stoner, always invites over his friends to party. They leave their garbage everywhere and take the little food I manage to get for the school week. It's now up to me to do everything, feed the animals, clean, groceries etc. I can't do it anymore. I'm in my senior year of highschool, I had to get a part time job and I have a non-paid internship at a vet for a class. I miss her so much, and I would do anything just to have one last day with her. Mom was my best friend, and I never got to say goodbye. All I have left of her is a video from christmas last year and I'm scared to death that it might disappear one day. The last thing I can remember is her face full of pain.
I feel so empty inside, nothing matters anymore. She wont ever see me graduate highschool or college, see me on my wedding day or hold her grandchildren. I can't remember her laugh anymore, her cooking or even the smell of her. I miss her cold hands that she would put on my neck to scare me or when we would go out on Sundays for errands. Saturday's she would always cook us a breakfast dish and we would watch the news and drink coffee.
She loved Christmas music so much, and every time I hear a song I break down. I know now god isn't real.
I can't go to anyone with my thoughts, I don't want to talk about it to anyone. I just pretend everything is okay, and that it never happened. I've even mastered the ""I'm fine"" with a smile response.  I feel so 'dead' inside almost as if the day she died I did too. I'm so scared to grow up without her. I can't continue without my mom, I don't know how I'm going to go with the rest of my life like this. Sometimes I wish it was me instead of her.
Sorry for being so edgy, it's super late and I can't deal with my thoughts anymore. Thanks for reading, if you did."
7jibf5,4,2017-12-13,Finally had some pride today,WeSingLoveSongs,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7jibf5/finally_had_some_pride_today/,"So, after three weeks post BU I feel as if everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong. I just learned that I have to redo an assignment and if I do not pass it this time, I will have to postpone my internship with 6 months. I don't even want to get started on all the small things that are going wrong. 

But despite feeling as negative as I have ever felt, at least in the last 5 years or so, I finally had some pride today. I realized that I have been going to the gym, did some uni work (despite it being way less than I usually would have done), and have been talking a lot to friends. I feel as if I am achieving literally nothing at this point in life, and feel like I have just fallen back in life tremendously. But, I just finally realized I was proud that I still stand on my feet, and still walk around. If I would have told myself what would happen this month about 4 weeks back, I would have never believed it and would have never believed to still be able to breathe. 

May I ask you in this subreddit that are going through the same depressive stages right now what gives you hope? And may I ask those who are further in their process what has been the thing that saved you, or made you feel more whole again?

Kind regards"
7jim0d,1,2017-12-13,Should I accept my grad offer or just keep looking for work?,Dzartovian94,GradSchoolAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchoolAdvice/comments/7jim0d/should_i_accept_my_grad_offer_or_just_keep/,"So I graduated with a bachelor of business in August of this year and have been looking for my first full time job since then. My GPA is really bad due to my outpatient treatment in my first year but I maintained a B average for the rest of my course. I feel that any employer that has looked at my transcript has probably thrown it in the bin.

I have about 1.5 years of work experience but I definitely am having significant difficulty in finding full time employment.

So I recently applied for a Grad Diploma in IT since my average mark in the few IT units I completed was around 90. My offer lapses on the 21st of December and I'm currently waiting to hear from two graduate programs, in regards to job offers. My current plan is to wait until the 20th and I haven't heard anything, I will accept the Grad Diploma offer and just study to the best of my ability and potentially move into Masters if I survive.

The university doesn't offer me the ability to defer this offer and I'm in a tough situation regarding what I should do. Do I continue on my job search and try to leverage what I have or do I take up the opportunity to study again and grab some internships along the way?"

As I indicated before, the plan is to do these state-by-state, highlighting upcoming elections, progressive candidates in those states and major issues being fought (with an emphasis on Democratic, Independent and third party candidates). State residents can let me know if I’ve missed anything important or mistakenly described some of these issues.

---

**Reminder:** The deadline to file as a candidate for the 2018 races in Indiana is **February 9, 2018** (if running as a member of an established party). Here are the filing requirements – [link](http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/files/2018%20Candidate%20Guide.%20Revised%2012.5.17.%20Final.pdf). The date of the primary election in Indiana is **May 8, 2018**.

---

Here’s what I’ve found about the various races:

**United States Senators:**. The Senators from Indiana are Todd Young (R) and Joe Donnelly (D). Donnelly is up for re-election in 2018. He is quite conservative for a Democrat (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score =65%). He was one of the Democrats to vote ‘yes’ on confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He opposes abortion. He is also a co-sponsor of Senator Mike Crapo’s legislation to roll back regulations on Wall Street – [link](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/05/help-these-9-democrats-gop-pushing-deliver-insane-gifts-wall-street). He has **not** co-sponsored Bernie’s Medicare-for-All bill in the Senate. However, he does support the ACA and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program). He’s facing a primary challenge by Bill Bowser and Martin Del Rio. There are also seven Republicans competing in the primary to challenge Donnelly – State Representative Mike Braun, Terry Henderson, Mark Hurt, U.S Representative Luke Messer, U.S. Representative Todd Rokita, Kiel Stone and Andrew Takami. There is also a candidate for the Disability Party, Andrew Straw, and one Independent, John Piper. *Bill Bowser* does not seem to have a formal campaign website. [Here](https://www.facebook.com/Bill-Bowser-for-Senate-201613766670674/) is his Facebook page and [here](https://twitter.com/billbowser2018) is his Twitter account. Neither page is super active. But he has retweeted some of Bernie’s tweets and describes himself as a progressive on his Facebook page. He supports marijuana legalization. *Martin Del Rio* is a veteran, an Army Wounded Warrior Advocate and was formerly homeless and destitute (so he knows what it’s like to be poor). There is not a lot of detail on his [website](http://www.martindelrio.com/) about his policies, but he supports job creation in Indiana, labor unions, education, racial justice, LGBT rights and protecting the environment. On healthcare, he says “Comprehensive, universal healthcare is a human right and as Hoosiers, we can all agree that no man, woman or child should ever have to suffer or die due to the lack of better options. Whether it be a Single-Payer system or something better, this is an issue that we have to approach with facts and common sense if we are really going to promote the general welfare of this great nation”. I’m not sure what he’d consider ‘better’ than single-payer healthcare. *Andrew Straw* is a candidate for the Disability Party, a small political party that advocates for civil rights and protecting the interests of mentally and physically disabled people. [This](http://www.andrewstraw.com/Senate.html) appears to be his campaign website, but it does not have much detail on his policies. *John Piper* is an independent candidate, who is a business man who owns both restaurants and veterinary hospitals. He seems to be a Trump supporter.  [His website](https://piperforsenate.com/) does not have much detail on his policies, except stating support for Trump.

---

**United States House of Representatives:** Indiana has nine US House Representatives.

---

**IN-01:** The incumbent is *Peter Visclosky*, a fairly conservative Democrat (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score – 76%). He is a co-sponsor of HR 676 (Medicare-for-All). He has no challengers yet. 

---

**IN-02:** The incumbent is *Jackie Walorski*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. She is facing a primary challenge by Mark Summe. There are also five Democrats competing to challenge her - Aaron Bush, Douglas Carpenter, Pat Hackett, Mel Hall and Yatish Joshi. I could not find a campaign website for *Aaron Bush*. *Douglas Carpenter* seems to be a candidate who ran for the same seat in 2014 and 2016. Despite that, there is virtually no information about him available online and he does not seem to have a campaign website. *Pat Hackett* is an attorney who has served as council for the not-for-profit Catholic Holy Cross Health system. She is also an adjunct Professor at Notre Dame law school. She is worried about income inequality and states “We must change this trajectory by advocating for a higher minimum wage, writing laws that empower workers, and recognizing the dignity and importance of work.” She supports the ACA and wants to extend it to better cover people. She also says that we should be “moving towards universal coverage, even a single payer system”. She supports abortion rights, but notes that “true pro-life legislation would wage a cultural war on poverty”. She also supports racial justice, public education, immigrant rights and fighting climate change. She seems like a good candidate. [Here](https://pathackettforcongress.com/) is her website. *Mel Hall* is the Chairman of [SpecialtyCare](http://www.specialtycare.net/about-us/), a company that supports “surgeons and medical centers with highly skilled people, equipment, and data that increase consistency and reliability, driving improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs”. [Here](https://www.melforcongress.com/) is his website, but it has no details on the policies he supports. *Yatish Joshi* is the founder and owner of [GTA Containers](http://www.gtacontainers.com/), a company that makes a series of tanks, drums and other containers for transporting cargo by truck.  [Here](http://joshiforindiana.com/) is his website, but it also has no detail on the policies he supports. To me, Pat Hackett is the strongest progressive candidate in this race.

---

**IN-03:** The incumbent is *Jim Banks*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is facing one opponent, Democrat Courtney Tritch. *Courtney Tritch* is a marketing consultant. [Here](https://www.tritchforcongress.com/) is her website, but her Issues page seems to be a work in progress, since there are topics listed, but no details under the topics.

---

**IN-04:** The incumbent is *Todd Rokita*, a very conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is not running again, because he’s running for Senate against Joe Donnelly. There are 3 Democrats - Tobi Beck, Joe Mackey and Sherry Shipley – and five Republicans – State Representative Jim Baird, Steve Braun, Kevin Grant, Diego Morales and Jared Thomas – running for his seat. *Tobi Beck* is an Army veteran and an IT security consultant. She supports campaign finance reform, infrastructure spending, immigration reform, legalizing medical marijuana, fighting climate change, LGBT rights, raising the minimum wage to $15/hr, raising taxes on the wealthiest individuals, reducing the national debt and strengthening and supporting the ACA (no mention of Medicare-for-All).  [Here](http://www.beck4indiana.org/)  is her website. *Joe Mackey* is a retired machinist. When he was younger, his family was struck by tragedy when in the span of only 30 months, they lost 2 of their children to leukemia (that sucks!!). He and his wife founded an organization dedicated to fighting childhood cancer. As you might suspect, his major issue is healthcare and he strongly supports Medicare-for-All. The other issue he talks about is education and he supports 2 years of free college and reducing student loan interest rates. He also supports strengthening the school lunch program. He seems like a very promising candidate. [Here](https://www.joe4hoosiers.com/) is his website. *Sherry Shipley* is s Dean at Ivy Tech Community College Lafayette. She supports fighting climate change, strengthening public schools, universal pre-K education, Medicare-for-All and a $15/hr minimum wage. [Here](https://www.shipley4indiana.com/) is her website. Both Mackey and Shipley seem very good candidates.

---

**IN-05:** The incumbent is *Susan Brooks*, a very conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. She has one Democratic challenger - Sean Dugdale - and one Independent challenger - Jeremy Lee Edom. [This](http://politics1.com/in.htm) page was the only information I could find online about *Sean Dugdale* and it only states that he is a “research assistant and Chinese translator”. He doesn’t seem to have a campaign website. There is also virtually nothing online for *Jeremy Lee Edom*. He is apparently an independent candidate and according to the same website above that listed Sean Dugdale’s profession, Edom ran in 2016 for the US Presidency. This race could really use s strong committed progressive candidate.

---

**IN-06:** The incumbent is *Luke Messer*, who is another very conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is not running for re-election, because he is competing for Donnelly’s Senate seat. There are four Democrats - Arturas Kerelis, Jeannine Lee Lake, Jim Pruett and Lane Siekman – and four Republicans – State Senator Michael Crider, Jonathan Lamb, Stephen MacKenzie and Greg Pence – competing for his seat. I won’t describe the Republicans in detail, except to note that Greg Pence is the oldest brother of our current Vice President, Mike Pence. [Here](http://ak2020.gq/) is a webpage for *Arturas Kerelis*. But it mainly just has links to his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts. He seems to be this [Arturas Kerelis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm9201675/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm), who is listed as the 2nd Assistant Director and Unit Production Manager for a filming company. Looking at his Instagram, he posted about Net Neutrality and his personal Twitter account mentions Bernie. But there is no information in his political positions.  *Jeannine Lee Lake* is another candidate with virtually no online presence. [This](http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2017/09/26/democrats_gather_to_build_momentum_before_election/) page says she was involved in feeding the poor on Thanksgiving, so perhaps she is worried about poor people. [Here](https://www.pruett4indiana.com/) is *Jim Pruett’s*website, which still seems to be a work in progress, and [here](https://www.facebook.com/PruettforIndiana/) is his Facebook page. I didn’t look at it in detail, but it does indicate that he opposes the recent Republican tax bill. *Lane Siekman* is a lawyer, who has served as City Attorney and City Council Attorney in the past. [His website](https://sites.google.com/siekmanlaw.com/laneforcongress/meet-lane) is pretty detailed about his policy positions, unlike the other candidates. You can read it for more details, but in brief Siekman supports Medicare-for-All, fair trade deals, fighting climate change, policies that promote family farms over factory farms, net neutrality, free or reduced college tuition, getting big money out of politics, raising the minimum wage and ending tax breaks for the wealthy and special interests. He seems like a super candidate that we should support. You can donate to his campaign [here](https://sites.google.com/siekmanlaw.com/laneforcongress/donate).

---

**IN-07:** The incumbent is André Carson, who has a fairly progressive voting record (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score = 85%). He is a member of the House Progressive Caucus and has co-sponsored HR 676 (Medicare-for-All). However, he is **also** am member of the New Democrat Coalition, which is a coalition of conservative, neoliberal Democrats. He also has an association with Imran Awan. He has a Democratic primary challenger - Sue Spicer. There are also two Republicans running against him - Wayne Harmon and Tony Van Pelt. *Sue Spicer* is an activist and a Berniecrat. [Here](https://sueforyou2018.com/) is her website, which says she supports Bernie’s policies, but does not really give details.

---

**IN-08:** The incumbent is *Larry Bucshon*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. There were two Democrats competing to challenge him - Glen Miller and William Tanoos. However, *Glen Miller* recently withdrew and endorsed Tanoos. *William Tanoos* is a lawyer whose law practice works exclusively to fight for access to healthcare and financial security for disabled clients. He supports cutting taxes on middle class and small business, but not on the wealthy or large profitable corporations. He supports the ACA, but wants to bring down the high costs of premiums, deductibles, and out of pocket expenses (he does not mention Medicare-for-All). He also wants to get big money out of politics and reverse Citizens United. [Here](http://williamtanoos.com/) is his website.

---

**IN-09:** The incumbent is *Trey Hollingsworth*, another extremely conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. There are five Democrats competing to challenge him - Daniel Canon, Rob Chatlos, Jason Leineweber, Tom Pappas and Liz Watson. There are a lot of quite progressive candidates running in this race, so voters will need to decide which one to support. *Daniel Canon* is a civil rights lawyer. He was involved in [filing a suit against Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/trump-incitement-violence-lawsuit-236802) when he encouraged his fans to get protestors “out of here” during a campaign rally.  He was also involved in fighting for same sex marriage before the Supreme Court. He supports universal, single-payer healthcare, paid parental and family sick leave, an immediate and substantial increase to the minimum wage, campaign finance reform, legalizing marijuana, abolition of private prisons, abolition of the death penalty, free college tuition, strengthening anti-trust legislation, and many other progressive policies. [Here](https://canonforindiana.com/) is his website for further details. *Rob Chatlos* is a co-owner of a small trucking company. He supports free and fair elections, ending Citizens United, moving to 100% renewable energy in the US by 2030, universal single payer healthcare, a minimum wage increase (but no exact target number here), free college tuition, tax increases on wealthy (including capital gains taxes), net neutrality, decriminalizing marijuana and criminal justice reform. He seems like a pretty strong progressive candidate as well. [Here](https://chatlosforcongress.com/) is his website. It’s not clear what *Jason Leineweber* does for a living, since that is not detailed on his [website](https://jasonforindiana.com/). One of his major issues is education, although he seems to feel that we have to solve various problems in the K-12 years, before we can do anything about high college tuition (I think we can address both at the same time). He also supports raising the minimum wage to $10/hr, reducing the work week to 35 hr/week, improving access to clean drinking water, reducing credit card interest rates, LGBT and women’s rights, etc. On healthcare, he is a bit vague saying it’s time for “one plan, one price”, but doesn’t say what that plan is. Is he talking about Medicare-for-All or some other type of plan? I feel that quite a few positions he’s talking about on his website are local issues. Though important, they might be better addressed by a mayor, state Senator or State Representative, while a US Representative should take on bigger questions that affect the whole country. Therefore, it seems to me he should be running for a city-wide or state-wide office. *Tom Pappas* is a former intern for Joe Donnelly and a professor at Indiana University. He supports campaign finance reform to get dark money out of politics, increasing the minimum wage to $15/hr, taxing Wall Street transactions, raising the cap on Social Security contributions, ensuring wealthy corporations pay more taxes, enforcing anti-trust laws, funding an infrastructure bank, providing paid family leave, etc. [Here](http://www.tomkpappas.com/) is his website. *Liz Watson* is a lawyer and has held a number of political positions in the past from interning with former US Rep Frank McCloskey to serving as Director of Workplace Justice at the National Women’s Law Center, as the executive director of the Georgetown Poverty Center, and as the Labor Policy Director for Democrats in the United States Congress. On her website, she notes that “I led the development of the $15 minimum wage bill in the House, and I worked with Senator Sanders staff when he introduced the companion bill in the Senate. I drafted first-of-its kind legislation to end the practice of calling people into work on a couple of hours’ notice and telling them if they don’t report, they’re fired”. She is strong on labor and jobs and she supports unions, raising the minimum wage to $15/hr by 2024, making more people eligible for overtime pay, ending abusive unpredictable job scheduling, providing paid sick and family leave and ending bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas. She also supports Medicare-for-All, strengthening public schools, helping bring down college costs (but does not mention free college tuition, but rather lowering student loan interest and providing more Pell grants, etc.), investing in green energy technology and providing more support to the Black Lung Benefits for coal mines.  [Here](https://lizforindiana.com/) is her website. The field of candidates in IN-09 is exceptionally strong, with numerous strong and committed progressives. Voters in that district will have a hard time choosing, I think. 

---

**Governor:** The governor of Indiana is  Eric Holcomb (R). He was just elected, so won’t be up for re-election for quite some time.

7jiym1,5,2017-12-13,Better Know a State: Indiana – discuss Indiana politics and candidates,Scientist34again,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/7jiym1/better_know_a_state_indiana_discuss_indiana/,"Welcome to our 39th **Better Know a State (BKAS)**, which will focus on **INDIANA**. As I indicated before, the plan is to do these state-by-state, highlighting upcoming elections, progressive candidates in those states and major issues being fought (with an emphasis on Democratic, Independent and third party candidates). State residents can let me know if I’ve missed anything important or mistakenly described some of these issues.

---

**Reminder:** The deadline to file as a candidate for the 2018 races in Indiana is **February 9, 2018** (if running as a member of an established party). Here are the filing requirements – [link](http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/files/2018%20Candidate%20Guide.%20Revised%2012.5.17.%20Final.pdf). The date of the primary election in Indiana is **May 8, 2018**.

---

Here’s what I’ve found about the various races:

**United States Senators:**. The Senators from Indiana are Todd Young (R) and Joe Donnelly (D). Donnelly is up for re-election in 2018. He is quite conservative for a Democrat (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score =65%). He was one of the Democrats to vote ‘yes’ on confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He opposes abortion. He is also a co-sponsor of Senator Mike Crapo’s legislation to roll back regulations on Wall Street – [link](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/05/help-these-9-democrats-gop-pushing-deliver-insane-gifts-wall-street). He has **not** co-sponsored Bernie’s Medicare-for-All bill in the Senate. However, he does support the ACA and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program). He’s facing a primary challenge by Bill Bowser and Martin Del Rio. There are also seven Republicans competing in the primary to challenge Donnelly – State Representative Mike Braun, Terry Henderson, Mark Hurt, U.S Representative Luke Messer, U.S. Representative Todd Rokita, Kiel Stone and Andrew Takami. There is also a candidate for the Disability Party, Andrew Straw, and one Independent, John Piper. *Bill Bowser* does not seem to have a formal campaign website. [Here](https://www.facebook.com/Bill-Bowser-for-Senate-201613766670674/) is his Facebook page and [here](https://twitter.com/billbowser2018) is his Twitter account. Neither page is super active. But he has retweeted some of Bernie’s tweets and describes himself as a progressive on his Facebook page. He supports marijuana legalization. *Martin Del Rio* is a veteran, an Army Wounded Warrior Advocate and was formerly homeless and destitute (so he knows what it’s like to be poor). There is not a lot of detail on his [website](http://www.martindelrio.com/) about his policies, but he supports job creation in Indiana, labor unions, education, racial justice, LGBT rights and protecting the environment. On healthcare, he says “Comprehensive, universal healthcare is a human right and as Hoosiers, we can all agree that no man, woman or child should ever have to suffer or die due to the lack of better options. Whether it be a Single-Payer system or something better, this is an issue that we have to approach with facts and common sense if we are really going to promote the general welfare of this great nation”. I’m not sure what he’d consider ‘better’ than single-payer healthcare. *Andrew Straw* is a candidate for the Disability Party, a small political party that advocates for civil rights and protecting the interests of mentally and physically disabled people. [This](http://www.andrewstraw.com/Senate.html) appears to be his campaign website, but it does not have much detail on his policies. *John Piper* is an independent candidate, who is a business man who owns both restaurants and veterinary hospitals. He seems to be a Trump supporter.  [His website](https://piperforsenate.com/) does not have much detail on his policies, except stating support for Trump.

---

**United States House of Representatives:** Indiana has nine US House Representatives.

---

**IN-01:** The incumbent is *Peter Visclosky*, a fairly conservative Democrat (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score – 76%). He is a co-sponsor of HR 676 (Medicare-for-All). He has no challengers yet. 

---

**IN-02:** The incumbent is *Jackie Walorski*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. She is facing a primary challenge by Mark Summe. There are also five Democrats competing to challenge her - Aaron Bush, Douglas Carpenter, Pat Hackett, Mel Hall and Yatish Joshi. I could not find a campaign website for *Aaron Bush*. *Douglas Carpenter* seems to be a candidate who ran for the same seat in 2014 and 2016. Despite that, there is virtually no information about him available online and he does not seem to have a campaign website. *Pat Hackett* is an attorney who has served as council for the not-for-profit Catholic Holy Cross Health system. She is also an adjunct Professor at Notre Dame law school. She is worried about income inequality and states “We must change this trajectory by advocating for a higher minimum wage, writing laws that empower workers, and recognizing the dignity and importance of work.” She supports the ACA and wants to extend it to better cover people. She also says that we should be “moving towards universal coverage, even a single payer system”. She supports abortion rights, but notes that “true pro-life legislation would wage a cultural war on poverty”. She also supports racial justice, public education, immigrant rights and fighting climate change. She seems like a good candidate. [Here](https://pathackettforcongress.com/) is her website. *Mel Hall* is the Chairman of [SpecialtyCare](http://www.specialtycare.net/about-us/), a company that supports “surgeons and medical centers with highly skilled people, equipment, and data that increase consistency and reliability, driving improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs”. [Here](https://www.melforcongress.com/) is his website, but it has no details on the policies he supports. *Yatish Joshi* is the founder and owner of [GTA Containers](http://www.gtacontainers.com/), a company that makes a series of tanks, drums and other containers for transporting cargo by truck.  [Here](http://joshiforindiana.com/) is his website, but it also has no detail on the policies he supports. To me, Pat Hackett is the strongest progressive candidate in this race.

---

**IN-03:** The incumbent is *Jim Banks*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is facing one opponent, Democrat Courtney Tritch. *Courtney Tritch* is a marketing consultant. [Here](https://www.tritchforcongress.com/) is her website, but her Issues page seems to be a work in progress, since there are topics listed, but no details under the topics.

---

**IN-04:** The incumbent is *Todd Rokita*, a very conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is not running again, because he’s running for Senate against Joe Donnelly. There are 3 Democrats - Tobi Beck, Joe Mackey and Sherry Shipley – and five Republicans – State Representative Jim Baird, Steve Braun, Kevin Grant, Diego Morales and Jared Thomas – running for his seat. *Tobi Beck* is an Army veteran and an IT security consultant. She supports campaign finance reform, infrastructure spending, immigration reform, legalizing medical marijuana, fighting climate change, LGBT rights, raising the minimum wage to $15/hr, raising taxes on the wealthiest individuals, reducing the national debt and strengthening and supporting the ACA (no mention of Medicare-for-All).  [Here](http://www.beck4indiana.org/)  is her website. *Joe Mackey* is a retired machinist. When he was younger, his family was struck by tragedy when in the span of only 30 months, they lost 2 of their children to leukemia (that sucks!!). He and his wife founded an organization dedicated to fighting childhood cancer. As you might suspect, his major issue is healthcare and he strongly supports Medicare-for-All. The other issue he talks about is education and he supports 2 years of free college and reducing student loan interest rates. He also supports strengthening the school lunch program. He seems like a very promising candidate. [Here](https://www.joe4hoosiers.com/) is his website. *Sherry Shipley* is s Dean at Ivy Tech Community College Lafayette. She supports fighting climate change, strengthening public schools, universal pre-K education, Medicare-for-All and a $15/hr minimum wage. [Here](https://www.shipley4indiana.com/) is her website. Both Mackey and Shipley seem very good candidates.

---

**IN-05:** The incumbent is *Susan Brooks*, a very conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. She has one Democratic challenger - Sean Dugdale - and one Independent challenger - Jeremy Lee Edom. [This](http://politics1.com/in.htm) page was the only information I could find online about *Sean Dugdale* and it only states that he is a “research assistant and Chinese translator”. He doesn’t seem to have a campaign website. There is also virtually nothing online for *Jeremy Lee Edom*. He is apparently an independent candidate and according to the same website above that listed Sean Dugdale’s profession, Edom ran in 2016 for the US Presidency. This race could really use s strong committed progressive candidate.

---

**IN-06:** The incumbent is *Luke Messer*, who is another very conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is not running for re-election, because he is competing for Donnelly’s Senate seat. There are four Democrats - Arturas Kerelis, Jeannine Lee Lake, Jim Pruett and Lane Siekman – and four Republicans – State Senator Michael Crider, Jonathan Lamb, Stephen MacKenzie and Greg Pence – competing for his seat. I won’t describe the Republicans in detail, except to note that Greg Pence is the oldest brother of our current Vice President, Mike Pence. [Here](http://ak2020.gq/) is a webpage for *Arturas Kerelis*. But it mainly just has links to his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts. He seems to be this [Arturas Kerelis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm9201675/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm), who is listed as the 2nd Assistant Director and Unit Production Manager for a filming company. Looking at his Instagram, he posted about Net Neutrality and his personal Twitter account mentions Bernie. But there is no information in his political positions.  *Jeannine Lee Lake* is another candidate with virtually no online presence. [This](http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2017/09/26/democrats_gather_to_build_momentum_before_election/) page says she was involved in feeding the poor on Thanksgiving, so perhaps she is worried about poor people. [Here](https://www.pruett4indiana.com/) is *Jim Pruett’s*website, which still seems to be a work in progress, and [here](https://www.facebook.com/PruettforIndiana/) is his Facebook page. I didn’t look at it in detail, but it does indicate that he opposes the recent Republican tax bill. *Lane Siekman* is a lawyer, who has served as City Attorney and City Council Attorney in the past. [His website](https://sites.google.com/siekmanlaw.com/laneforcongress/meet-lane) is pretty detailed about his policy positions, unlike the other candidates. You can read it for more details, but in brief Siekman supports Medicare-for-All, fair trade deals, fighting climate change, policies that promote family farms over factory farms, net neutrality, free or reduced college tuition, getting big money out of politics, raising the minimum wage and ending tax breaks for the wealthy and special interests. He seems like a super candidate that we should support. You can donate to his campaign [here](https://sites.google.com/siekmanlaw.com/laneforcongress/donate).

---

**IN-07:** The incumbent is André Carson, who has a fairly progressive voting record (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score = 85%). He is a member of the House Progressive Caucus and has co-sponsored HR 676 (Medicare-for-All). However, he is **also** am member of the New Democrat Coalition, which is a coalition of conservative, neoliberal Democrats. He also has an association with Imran Awan. He has a Democratic primary challenger - Sue Spicer. There are also two Republicans running against him - Wayne Harmon and Tony Van Pelt. *Sue Spicer* is an activist and a Berniecrat. [Here](https://sueforyou2018.com/) is her website (it loads slowly), which says she supports Bernie’s policies, but does not really give details.

---

**IN-08:** The incumbent is *Larry Bucshon*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. There were two Democrats competing to challenge him - Glen Miller and William Tanoos. However, *Glen Miller* recently withdrew and endorsed Tanoos. *William Tanoos* is a lawyer whose law practice works exclusively to fight for access to healthcare and financial security for disabled clients. He supports cutting taxes on middle class and small business, but not on the wealthy or large profitable corporations. He supports the ACA, but wants to bring down the high costs of premiums, deductibles, and out of pocket expenses (he does not mention Medicare-for-All). He also wants to get big money out of politics and reverse Citizens United. [Here](http://williamtanoos.com/) is his website.

---

**IN-09:** The incumbent is *Trey Hollingsworth*, another extremely conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. There are five Democrats competing to challenge him - Daniel Canon, Rob Chatlos, Jason Leineweber, Tom Pappas and Liz Watson. There are a lot of quite progressive candidates running in this race, so voters will need to decide which one to support. *Daniel Canon* is a civil rights lawyer. He was involved in [filing a suit against Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/trump-incitement-violence-lawsuit-236802) when he encouraged his fans to get protestors “out of here” during a campaign rally.  He was also involved in fighting for same sex marriage before the Supreme Court. He supports universal, single-payer healthcare, paid parental and family sick leave, an immediate and substantial increase to the minimum wage, campaign finance reform, legalizing marijuana, abolition of private prisons, abolition of the death penalty, free college tuition, strengthening anti-trust legislation, and many other progressive policies. [Here](https://canonforindiana.com/) is his website for further details. *Rob Chatlos* is a co-owner of a small trucking company. He supports free and fair elections, ending Citizens United, moving to 100% renewable energy in the US by 2030, universal single payer healthcare, a minimum wage increase (but no exact target number here), free college tuition, tax increases on wealthy (including capital gains taxes), net neutrality, decriminalizing marijuana and criminal justice reform. He seems like a pretty strong progressive candidate as well. [Here](https://chatlosforcongress.com/) is his website. It’s not clear what *Jason Leineweber* does for a living, since that is not detailed on his [website](https://jasonforindiana.com/). One of his major issues is education, although he seems to feel that we have to solve various problems in the K-12 years, before we can do anything about high college tuition (I think we can address both at the same time). He also supports raising the minimum wage to $10/hr, reducing the work week to 35 hr/week, improving access to clean drinking water, reducing credit card interest rates, LGBT and women’s rights, etc. On healthcare, he is a bit vague saying it’s time for “one plan, one price”, but doesn’t say what that plan is. Is he talking about Medicare-for-All or some other type of plan? I feel that quite a few positions he’s talking about on his website are local issues. Though important, they might be better addressed by a mayor, state Senator or State Representative, while a US Representative should take on bigger questions that affect the whole country. Therefore, it seems to me he should be running for a city-wide or state-wide office. *Tom Pappas* is a former intern for Joe Donnelly and a professor at Indiana University. He supports campaign finance reform to get dark money out of politics, increasing the minimum wage to $15/hr, taxing Wall Street transactions, raising the cap on Social Security contributions, ensuring wealthy corporations pay more taxes, enforcing anti-trust laws, funding an infrastructure bank, providing paid family leave, etc. [Here](http://www.tomkpappas.com/) is his website. *Liz Watson* is a lawyer and has held a number of political positions in the past from interning with former US Rep Frank McCloskey to serving as Director of Workplace Justice at the National Women’s Law Center, as the executive director of the Georgetown Poverty Center, and as the Labor Policy Director for Democrats in the United States Congress. On her website, she notes that “I led the development of the $15 minimum wage bill in the House, and I worked with Senator Sanders staff when he introduced the companion bill in the Senate. I drafted first-of-its kind legislation to end the practice of calling people into work on a couple of hours’ notice and telling them if they don’t report, they’re fired”. She is strong on labor and jobs and she supports unions, raising the minimum wage to $15/hr by 2024, making more people eligible for overtime pay, ending abusive unpredictable job scheduling, providing paid sick and family leave and ending bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas. She also supports Medicare-for-All, strengthening public schools, helping bring down college costs (but does not mention free college tuition, but rather lowering student loan interest and providing more Pell grants, etc.), investing in green energy technology and providing more support to the Black Lung Benefits for coal mines.  [Here](https://lizforindiana.com/) is her website. The field of candidates in IN-09 is exceptionally strong, with numerous strong and committed progressives. Voters in that district will have a hard time choosing, I think. 

---

**Governor:** The governor of Indiana is  Eric Holcomb (R). He was just elected, so won’t be up for re-election for quite some time.

He seems like a super candidate that we should support. You can donate to his campaign [here](https://sites.google.com/siekmanlaw.com/laneforcongress/donate).

---

**IN-07:** The incumbent is André Carson, who has a fairly progressive voting record (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score = 85%). He is a member of the House Progressive Caucus and has co-sponsored HR 676 (Medicare-for-All). However, he is **also** am member of the New Democrat Coalition, which is a coalition of conservative, neoliberal Democrats. He also has an association with Imran Awan. He has a Democratic primary challenger - Sue Spicer. There are also two Republicans running against him - Wayne Harmon and Tony Van Pelt. *Sue Spicer* is an activist and a Berniecrat. [Here](https://sueforyou2018.com/) is her website, which says she supports Bernie’s policies, but does not really give details.

---

**IN-08:** The incumbent is *Larry Bucshon*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. There were two Democrats competing to challenge him - Glen Miller and William Tanoos. However, *Glen Miller* recently withdrew and endorsed Tanoos. *William Tanoos* is a lawyer whose law practice works exclusively to fight for access to healthcare and financial security for disabled clients. He supports cutting taxes on middle class and small business, but not on the wealthy or large profitable corporations. He supports the ACA, but wants to bring down the high costs of premiums, deductibles, and out of pocket expenses (he does not mention Medicare-for-All). He also wants to get big money out of politics and reverse Citizens United. [Here](http://williamtanoos.com/) is his website.

---

**IN-09:** The incumbent is *Trey Hollingsworth*, another extremely conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. There are five Democrats competing to challenge him - Daniel Canon, Rob Chatlos, Jason Leineweber, Tom Pappas and Liz Watson. There are a lot of quite progressive candidates running in this race, so voters will need to decide which one to support. *Daniel Canon* is a civil rights lawyer. He was involved in [filing a suit against Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/trump-incitement-violence-lawsuit-236802) when he encouraged his fans to get protestors “out of here” during a campaign rally.  He was also involved in fighting for same sex marriage before the Supreme Court. He supports universal, single-payer healthcare, paid parental and family sick leave, an immediate and substantial increase to the minimum wage, campaign finance reform, legalizing marijuana, abolition of private prisons, abolition of the death penalty, free college tuition, strengthening anti-trust legislation, and many other progressive policies. [Here](https://canonforindiana.com/) is his website for further details. *Rob Chatlos* is a co-owner of a small trucking company. He supports free and fair elections, ending Citizens United, moving to 100% renewable energy in the US by 2030, universal single payer healthcare, a minimum wage increase (but no exact target number here), free college tuition, tax increases on wealthy (including capital gains taxes), net neutrality, decriminalizing marijuana and criminal justice reform. He seems like a pretty strong progressive candidate as well. [Here](https://chatlosforcongress.com/) is his website. It’s not clear what *Jason Leineweber* does for a living, since that is not detailed on his [website](https://jasonforindiana.com/). One of his major issues is education, although he seems to feel that we have to solve various problems in the K-12 years, before we can do anything about high college tuition (I think we can address both at the same time). He also supports raising the minimum wage to $10/hr, reducing the work week to 35 hr/week, improving access to clean drinking water, reducing credit card interest rates, LGBT and women’s rights, etc. On healthcare, he is a bit vague saying it’s time for “one plan, one price”, but doesn’t say what that plan is. Is he talking about Medicare-for-All or some other type of plan? I feel that quite a few positions he’s talking about on his website are local issues. Though important, they might be better addressed by a mayor, state Senator or State Representative, while a US Representative should take on bigger questions that affect the whole country. Therefore, it seems to me he should be running for a city-wide or state-wide office. *Tom Pappas* is a former intern for Joe Donnelly and a professor at Indiana University. He supports campaign finance reform to get dark money out of politics, increasing the minimum wage to $15/hr, taxing Wall Street transactions, raising the cap on Social Security contributions, ensuring wealthy corporations pay more taxes, enforcing anti-trust laws, funding an infrastructure bank, providing paid family leave, etc. [Here](http://www.tomkpappas.com/) is his website. *Liz Watson* is a lawyer and has held a number of political positions in the past from interning with former US Rep Frank McCloskey to serving as Director of Workplace Justice at the National Women’s Law Center, as the executive director of the Georgetown Poverty Center, and as the Labor Policy Director for Democrats in the United States Congress. On her website, she notes that “I led the development of the $15 minimum wage bill in the House, and I worked with Senator Sanders staff when he introduced the companion bill in the Senate. I drafted first-of-its kind legislation to end the practice of calling people into work on a couple of hours’ notice and telling them if they don’t report, they’re fired”. She is strong on labor and jobs and she supports unions, raising the minimum wage to $15/hr by 2024, making more people eligible for overtime pay, ending abusive unpredictable job scheduling, providing paid sick and family leave and ending bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas. She also supports Medicare-for-All, strengthening public schools, helping bring down college costs (but does not mention free college tuition, but rather lowering student loan interest and providing more Pell grants, etc.), investing in green energy technology and providing more support to the Black Lung Benefits for coal mines.  [Here](https://lizforindiana.com/) is her website. The field of candidates in IN-09 is exceptionally strong, with numerous strong and committed progressives. Voters in that district will have a hard time choosing, I think.

**Governor:** The governor of Indiana is  Eric Holcomb (R). He was just elected, so won’t be up for re-election for quite some time.

7jjbby,44,2017-12-13,Better Know a State: Indiana – discuss Indiana politics and candidates,Scientist34again,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/7jjbby/better_know_a_state_indiana_discuss_indiana/,"Welcome to our 39th **Better Know a State (BKAS)**, which will focus on **INDIANA**. As I indicated before, the plan is to do these state-by-state, highlighting upcoming elections, progressive candidates in those states and major issues being fought (with an emphasis on Democratic, Independent and third party candidates). State residents can let me know if I’ve missed anything important or mistakenly described some of these issues.

---

**Reminder:** The deadline to file as a candidate for the 2018 races in Indiana is **February 9, 2018** (if running as a member of an established party). Here are the filing requirements – [link](http://www.in.gov/sos/elections/files/2018%20Candidate%20Guide.%20Revised%2012.5.17.%20Final.pdf). The date of the primary election in Indiana is **May 8, 2018**.

---

Here’s what I’ve found about the various races:

**United States Senators:**. The Senators from Indiana are Todd Young (R) and Joe Donnelly (D). Donnelly is up for re-election in 2018. He is quite conservative for a Democrat (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score =65%). He was one of the Democrats to vote ‘yes’ on confirming Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. He opposes abortion. He is also a co-sponsor of Senator Mike Crapo’s legislation to roll back regulations on Wall Street – [link](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/12/05/help-these-9-democrats-gop-pushing-deliver-insane-gifts-wall-street). He has **not** co-sponsored Bernie’s Medicare-for-All bill in the Senate. However, he does support the ACA and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program). He’s facing a primary challenge by Bill Bowser and Martin Del Rio. There are also seven Republicans competing in the primary to challenge Donnelly – State Representative Mike Braun, Terry Henderson, Mark Hurt, U.S Representative Luke Messer, U.S. Representative Todd Rokita, Kiel Stone and Andrew Takami. There is also a candidate for the Disability Party, Andrew Straw, and one Independent, John Piper. *Bill Bowser* does not seem to have a formal campaign website. [Here](https://www.facebook.com/Bill-Bowser-for-Senate-201613766670674/) is his Facebook page and [here](https://twitter.com/billbowser2018) is his Twitter account. Neither page is super active. But he has retweeted some of Bernie’s tweets and describes himself as a progressive on his Facebook page. He supports marijuana legalization. *Martin Del Rio* is a veteran, an Army Wounded Warrior Advocate and was formerly homeless and destitute (so he knows what it’s like to be poor). There is not a lot of detail on his [website](http://www.martindelrio.com/) about his policies, but he supports job creation in Indiana, labor unions, education, racial justice, LGBT rights and protecting the environment. On healthcare, he says “Comprehensive, universal healthcare is a human right and as Hoosiers, we can all agree that no man, woman or child should ever have to suffer or die due to the lack of better options. Whether it be a Single-Payer system or something better, this is an issue that we have to approach with facts and common sense if we are really going to promote the general welfare of this great nation”. I’m not sure what he’d consider ‘better’ than single-payer healthcare. *Andrew Straw* is a candidate for the Disability Party, a small political party that advocates for civil rights and protecting the interests of mentally and physically disabled people. [This](http://www.andrewstraw.com/Senate.html) appears to be his campaign website, but it does not have much detail on his policies. *John Piper* is an independent candidate, who is a business man who owns both restaurants and veterinary hospitals. He seems to be a Trump supporter.  [His website](https://piperforsenate.com/) does not have much detail on his policies, except stating support for Trump.

---

**United States House of Representatives:** Indiana has nine US House Representatives.

---

**IN-01:** The incumbent is *Peter Visclosky*, a fairly conservative Democrat (Progressive Punch Crucial Lifetime Progressive Score – 76%). He is a co-sponsor of HR 676 (Medicare-for-All). He has no challengers yet. 

---

**IN-02:** The incumbent is *Jackie Walorski*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. She is facing a primary challenge by Mark Summe. There are also five Democrats competing to challenge her - Aaron Bush, Douglas Carpenter, Pat Hackett, Mel Hall and Yatish Joshi. I could not find a campaign website for *Aaron Bush*. *Douglas Carpenter* seems to be a candidate who ran for the same seat in 2014 and 2016. Despite that, there is virtually no information about him available online and he does not seem to have a campaign website. *Pat Hackett* is an attorney who has served as council for the not-for-profit Catholic Holy Cross Health system. She is also an adjunct Professor at Notre Dame law school. She is worried about income inequality and states “We must change this trajectory by advocating for a higher minimum wage, writing laws that empower workers, and recognizing the dignity and importance of work.” She supports the ACA and wants to extend it to better cover people. She also says that we should be “moving towards universal coverage, even a single payer system”. She supports abortion rights, but notes that “true pro-life legislation would wage a cultural war on poverty”. She also supports racial justice, public education, immigrant rights and fighting climate change. She seems like a good candidate. [Here](https://pathackettforcongress.com/) is her website. *Mel Hall* is the Chairman of [SpecialtyCare](http://www.specialtycare.net/about-us/), a company that supports “surgeons and medical centers with highly skilled people, equipment, and data that increase consistency and reliability, driving improved clinical outcomes and reduced costs”. [Here](https://www.melforcongress.com/) is his website, but it has no details on the policies he supports. *Yatish Joshi* is the founder and owner of [GTA Containers](http://www.gtacontainers.com/), a company that makes a series of tanks, drums and other containers for transporting cargo by truck.  [Here](http://joshiforindiana.com/) is his website, but it also has no detail on the policies he supports. To me, Pat Hackett is the strongest progressive candidate in this race.

---

**IN-03:** The incumbent is *Jim Banks*, an extremely conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is facing one opponent, Democrat Courtney Tritch. *Courtney Tritch* is a marketing consultant. [Here](https://www.tritchforcongress.com/) is her website, but her Issues page seems to be a work in progress, since there are topics listed, but no details under the topics.

---

**IN-04:** The incumbent is *Todd Rokita*, a very conservative Republican, who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is not running again, because he’s running for Senate against Joe Donnelly. There are 3 Democrats - Tobi Beck, Joe Mackey and Sherry Shipley – and five Republicans – State Representative Jim Baird, Steve Braun, Kevin Grant, Diego Morales and Jared Thomas – running for his seat. *Tobi Beck* is an Army veteran and an IT security consultant. She supports campaign finance reform, infrastructure spending, immigration reform, legalizing medical marijuana, fighting climate change, LGBT rights, raising the minimum wage to $15/hr, raising taxes on the wealthiest individuals, reducing the national debt and strengthening and supporting the ACA (no mention of Medicare-for-All).  [Here](http://www.beck4indiana.org/)  is her website. *Joe Mackey* is a retired machinist. When he was younger, his family was struck by tragedy when in the span of only 30 months, they lost 2 of their children to leukemia (that sucks!!). He and his wife founded an organization dedicated to fighting childhood cancer. As you might suspect, his major issue is healthcare and he strongly supports Medicare-for-All. The other issue he talks about is education and he supports 2 years of free college and reducing student loan interest rates. He also supports strengthening the school lunch program. He seems like a very promising candidate. [Here](https://www.joe4hoosiers.com/) is his website. *Sherry Shipley* is s Dean at Ivy Tech Community College Lafayette. She supports fighting climate change, strengthening public schools, universal pre-K education, Medicare-for-All and a $15/hr minimum wage. [Here](https://www.shipley4indiana.com/) is her website. Both Mackey and Shipley seem very good candidates.

---

**IN-05:** The incumbent is *Susan Brooks*, a very conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. She has one Democratic challenger - Sean Dugdale - and one Independent challenger - Jeremy Lee Edom. [This](http://politics1.com/in.htm) page was the only information I could find online about *Sean Dugdale* and it only states that he is a “research assistant and Chinese translator”. He doesn’t seem to have a campaign website. There is also virtually nothing online for *Jeremy Lee Edom*. He is apparently an independent candidate and according to the same website above that listed Sean Dugdale’s profession, Edom ran in 2016 for the US Presidency. This race could really use a strong committed progressive candidate.

---

**IN-06:** The incumbent is *Luke Messer*, who is another very conservative Republican who voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. He is not running for re-election, because he is competing for Donnelly’s Senate seat. There are four Democrats - Arturas Kerelis, Jeannine Lee Lake, Jim Pruett and Lane Siekman – and four Republicans – State Senator Michael Crider, Jonathan Lamb, Stephen MacKenzie and Greg Pence – competing for his seat. I won’t describe the Republicans in detail, except to note that Greg Pence is the oldest brother of our current Vice President, Mike Pence. [Here](http://ak2020.gq/) is a webpage for *Arturas Kerelis*. But it mainly just has links to his Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts. He seems to be this [Arturas Kerelis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm9201675/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm), who is listed as the 2nd Assistant Director and Unit Production Manager for a filming company. Looking at his Instagram, he posted about Net Neutrality and his personal Twitter account mentions Bernie. But there is no information in his political positions.  *Jeannine Lee Lake* is another candidate with virtually no online presence. [This](http://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2017/09/26/democrats_gather_to_build_momentum_before_election/) page says she was involved in feeding the poor on Thanksgiving, so perhaps she is worried about poor people. [Here](https://www.pruett4indiana.com/) is *Jim Pruett’s* website, which still seems to be a work in progress, and [here](https://www.facebook.com/PruettforIndiana/) is his Facebook page. I didn’t look at it in detail, but it does indicate that he opposes the recent Republican tax bill. *Lane Siekman* is a lawyer, who has served as City Attorney and City Council Attorney in the past. [His website](https://sites.google.com/siekmanlaw.com/laneforcongress/meet-lane) is pretty detailed about his policy positions, unlike the other candidates. You can read it for more details, but in brief Siekman supports Medicare-for-All, fair trade deals, fighting climate change, policies that promote family farms over factory farms, net neutrality, free or reduced college tuition, getting big money out of politics, raising the minimum wage and ending tax breaks for the wealthy and special interests. He seems like a super candidate that we should support. You can donate to his campaign [here](https://sites.google.com/siekmanlaw.com/laneforcongress/donate).

So basically the company I used to work at decided to hire in two IT interns to work during the summer holidays. One was female and the other male. Lets call the female Sue and the male Josh. Sue was undoubtedly hot, probably a 7/10 without makeup. I could instantly tell that she liked to use men a lot.


Now she happens to capture the attention of one of the accountants that worked with me. We can all the accountant Jake. He befriends her and begins to give her and the other male intern a ride home as they all happened to be from the same town (I live in a small country so this is normal). As the days progress I could tell that both interns Sue and Josh were getting close and it was obvious to me that something was going on between them after work.

Now remember that she's getting free taxi rides to and from work by Jake. Hence she hides her affection towards Josh when Jake is around and pretends to like Jake instead. On some occasions Jake would also buy Sue lunch in a further attempt to get her to date him but it's obvious  that she is simply using him.

This went on for weeks until I finally could not take it anymore and I had a nice chat with Jake. I told him about the whole nice guy phenomena and gave him real life examples which were purposely made to resemble his own scenario. He seems interested in what I had to say and said that it was an insightful chat. 

Over the coming days Jake he would sneak up on Sue and Josh to catch them in a moment of affection. He succeeds on two occasions, without Sue and Josh realizing. One fine day both Sue and Josh turn up at work late and they complain that the bus was late, all the while they were both glaring at me and giving me the evil look. Jake purposely comes in says ""hey SilverGryphon, how's it going buddy?"" and leaves with a big smile on his face. At that moment I realized what had happened. Jake must have awoken and came to his senses after that little conversation we shared and told both interns to get lost and take the bus from now on. He most have also informed them that it was me who gave him the important life lesson which was now applying. 

Both Sue and Josh kept that evil look thing going on a for few more days. I couldn't care less and I would just ignore the lousy looks on their faces. Since they were no longer getting free taxi rides they ended up having to catch an early bus in order to be sure that they arrive  at work on time. When their internship was over they said goodbye to everyone accept me and Jake the accountant.

On my very last working day at that company, Jake shows up at my office and thanks me for that man to man talk we had back then. That moment was highlight of my days at my old company. 

MGTOW is power boys, use it wisely.

7jkxqp,4,2017-12-13,Finding a flat/room in Porto,Crazy8burger,porto,https://www.reddit.com/r/porto/comments/7jkxqp/finding_a_flatroom_in_porto/,"Hey fellow redditors,

I will spend my first half of 2018 in Porto doing an internship.

Now, I'm from Germany and have no real contacts in Portugal, let alone Porto, so I wanted to ask if you know any credible websites for renting or sharing a flat in Porto?

Are there any things I should look out for in the adverts of the flats? I probably won't bring any furniture. Is that a problem in Portugal or are flats generally furnished?

Also, I don't speak Portuguese. Will change that though!

Thanks for your help :)"
7jkzho,3,2017-12-13,Looking for some insight,Red-Falco,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/7jkzho/looking_for_some_insight/,"Hey everyone,
I’m looking for some insight on how to move forward in this career. Some background: I graduated back in May, and have been actively applying (although I could do better) to full time positions with no luck. I’ve had 2 serious interviews since applying, both led to nothing (some of the circumstances were difficult with location). My undergrad GPA was a 3.6, I have 2 exams (waiting on results for 3rd, but I feel like I probably got a 4/5), &amp; my biggest fault I’m aware of, is that I don’t have any relevant experience.

&amp;nbsp;

The way I see it I have a few options,

&amp;nbsp;

*Keep applying for full time work. I have a part-time job at the moment (albeit not greatest pay), however I am lucky that I am in a relatively good state. By this, I mean my parents probably won’t kick me out of the house until I am on my feet. The problem I am seeing is whether I may be hitting a dead end, and don’t find a job.

&amp;nbsp;

*Go back for graduate school in statistics. This is something I’ve considered, but don’t really want to take out more loans for. I most likely will have the opportunity to TA a class if I do go back, and this would at least partially cover tuition costs. I also figured I might be able to find some work on the side to help pay for living expenses while I do this. I know the general consensus here is that graduate school is not necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

*Completely leave the actuarial field altogether. I really don’t want to start looking for other work, but I feel as though this is a serious option. I really do love learning about all of the statistics that goes into these exams, but I do know the actual job does not really entail much about the exams. Friends and family have pointed out I should probably go back to teaching (which was my original major before switching to actuarial science). I’m not necessarily against this, because I do think I would enjoy teaching, but the pay is the part I can’t really get around.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of my thoughts:
At the moment, I feel pretty lost on how to move forward. My plan was to at least apply for graduate school in statistics at the university I just graduated from. I would most likely get accepted and be able to TA to cover some costs. I don’t believe I need to take GREs from what I read (need to look more into it) so I can focus on actuarial exams for the time being. I was thinking about applying to full time jobs, as well as internships for the summer. I would make a separate resume for internships (upon finding out if I got into grad school), and say that I am attending graduate school come fall. If I got offered an internship, I would go to grad school if necessary/take the position, and if I got offered a full time, I would take the position. If I go back to school, I would probably try to get in touch with one of the local insurance companies just to see if I can either shadow/volunteer/intern throughout the year, while looking for internships for the summer. I would hope by the time I graduate, I would have 4-5 exams done w/ internship experience. The biggest problem with this is that I would have to take out more loans, and I would miss the opportunity to work for the next 2 years. I appreciate any advice, be it positive or negative, and I hope this may be able to help other people in the same situation. Thanks for reading

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: should I go back to graduate school if I can’t find a job? What are some other options?

7jlas0,9,2017-12-13,Am I overreacting?,bunnyx0x1995,paralegal,https://www.reddit.com/r/paralegal/comments/7jlas0/am_i_overreacting/,"Long story ahead. You've been warned.

I work in a large city at a prestigious firm comprised of about 10 attorneys. We do PI/med mal/comp.

We used to have a secretary that we kept around because she wasn't good at anything else and had been with our firm so long. She didn't have her own cases and basically did random assignments and demand letters to keep her busy. She mostly talked on the phone to various family members all day. She would fill in for our receptionist whenever the main receptionist was out. When she left, I became the replacement receptionist when our main receptionist was out.

Ok, no big deal. Then they started asking me to cover the receptionist's lunch, which no one ever had to do before... 45 minutes everyday. So I stopped taking my own lunch. Now she's out for days at a time and I can't a) make phone calls to anyone because I'm answering phones, and b) can't access my files on the computer. So basically I can't do anything.

I have hundreds of cases and deadlines - I feel like I'm drowning. I recently inherited two more attorneys' workloads. One of which is a new attorney who just piles tedious stuff on me that isn't urgent, but asks me to do it ""today."" So having my days ripped away from me is burdensome. My main boss, the one I do everything for including some of his personal matters, doesn't really seem to mind if I'm being a receptionist because his work is going to get done regardless. The other attorneys would 100% care if their assistant wasn't able to work on their stuff for days at a time.

So today I confronted him. We have law student interns for the winter so I asked if they could be up front for a portion of the day. He conceded that we should be doing that and advised to talk to my office manager. I was thankful, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I'm gonna be doing this indefinitely and no one else seems to care that I can't do my job. I said ""ok great, but in the future can we rotate?"" He said, ""who else should be up there?"" (we have 7 paralegals at our firm.) I didn't want to throw anyone under the bus, so I said ""I don't know."" 

He yelled at me, saying that wasn't an acceptable answer. I honestly have NEVER heard him yell at anyone for anything. So I cried.

In the 2+ years I've been here, no one invites me to lunch. I'm not inviting to networking events. I'll come into the office and everyone (paralegals, clerks, attorneys) is gone at some event that I straight up wasn't invited to. I can't even count how many times this has happened.

My boyfriend, a lawyer who has worked at many firms of different sizes and stature, has assured me that my firm is just cliquey. But in my heart I really believe there must be something wrong with me if I'm being ostracized. I care immensely and come in on weekends, am always answering my email regardless of time or day, and just generally try to be a good extension of the firm even when I'm out. The clients seem to like me the most, and have sent me flowers, or told me that in the time they've been a client here that I've been the best assistant by far.

Am I overreacting? Have you ever had a similar experience?"
7jlnz8,1,2017-12-13,Studying for the CPA,Letmetaxthat,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7jlnz8/studying_for_the_cpa/,"Hello everyone,

I posted not so long ago about my situation (graduating undergrad without an internship this semester). I have found an internship with a local public accounting firm for this year's busy season. Furthermore, I have also applied to the MACC Program at my current school and will be enrolling this upcoming fall. My internship will be from January through April. 

Since I will have most of my summer free, I want to start studying for my CPA exam. Does anyone know of any free or inexpensive places or programs where I can begin studying for the CPA exam, specifically the FAR section (since it has the most material to study in my opinion)?

The MACC Program at my school is designed and scheduled around the CPA exam. In addition, the program will also give me access to Becker when I enroll. I want to get ahead and start studying as soon as I graduate this December. Any tips/advice is welcomed. 

Thank you in advance for the recommendations! "
7jls7t,2,2017-12-13,Dr. Epstein and the T.A.,Slut-Problems,SlutProblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlutProblems/comments/7jls7t/dr_epstein_and_the_ta/,"Everyone said Dr. Epstein was an old pervert. I wasn’t sure what they meant, and when I asked Jennifer Johnson she told me the truth. 

“He’s one of those professors that fucks as many students as he can get his dick in. He doesn’t even care if you’re hot.” 

“How do you know?” I asked Jenni, watching her flip her long, dark hair back behind her shoulder. 

“I’ve seen some shit working here,” she laughed. “He tried to pay me with vouchers for pussy licking sessions once,” she went on. 

“But you’re not a student anymore. You’re a T.A. Does he fuck students or just teacher’s assistants?” I asked and I watched Jenni laugh. 

“He fucks anything with a heartbeat!” Jenni giggled. “You trying to fuck him?” 

“No!” I said quickly, but I could tell Jenni didn’t believe me. 

“If you want him to fuck you just ask him if there is anything else you can help him with, and then look straight at his dick,” Jenni coached me. 

“Jenni! I said I’m not into him!” I snapped. 

“Okay, I believe you,” she said. “Night, Misha.” 

“Night,” I said and then I waited for Dr. Epstein to come into the workroom. We were all interns, earning hours toward our degree by helping Dr. Epstein with his research, but the building had become Dr. Epstein’s bachelor pad. It had a full mattress, night stand and dresser for when he was “working” those long nights on his research studies. 

“Misha, how’s my new favorite intern?” I stood up and faced him. I looked him over and he was looking at me like I was acting strangely and I almost lost my nerve, but I heard Jenni telling me to go for it. 

“Dr. Epstein. Is there anything more I can help you with tonight?” I asked in a tone I hoped sounded seductive. I looked directly at his dick, just like Jenni told me to. I prayed it worked. I hadn’t realized how badly I had wanted this until I was in the moment, waiting for him to say something as I looked at his cock. 

“Misha? Are you okay?” Dr. Epstein asked me. 

“Yeah I’m fine, why?” I asked. 

“You were staring off into space there,” he said. 

“I’m sorry. I was trying to be seductive by staring at your dick. Jenni says that works,” I confessed. I was blushing and I felt stupid. 

“Jenni?” he stopped for a moment and a strange look crossed his face. “Why are you trying to be seductive?” he asked and I could tell the thought was turning him on. I was still staring at his cock as I watched his pants begin to tent with his erection. 

“Because I want to seduce you,” I said and I took a step toward him. Before I knew it, I was making out with my nerdy professor. He wasted no time getting my tits and pussy out. He licked and sucked on my nipples and then he made his way down to my pussy, where he licked me with the skill of the kind of man who fucks everything with a heartbeat. I knew Jenni was right as he tore my clothes off and moved me to the mattress. 

His cock was bigger than I had anticipated, but he bent my legs back and stuffed it into my pussy anyway. It didn’t fit all the way in, but he had a way of using it that was unlike any other man I’d ever been with. Guys my own age were nothing like this, and I was happy that I had listened to Jenni. I was even happier when he made me cum the first time. 

It was nice being able to scream as loudly as we wanted. We were the only ones left in the building. I screamed for him, letting him know that he was pleasing me and that I was losing my shit for him. I could see him looking down on me with an intensity that made me feel special. I wanted to keep draining his older cock for him. I wanted it to be one of my daily duties and I wanted him to crave me as much as I was going to crave him the moment he pulled out. 

“Can I cum inside you? Are you on the pill?” he asked, and I should have said no, but I found myself saying yes anyway. I’d never really worried about getting pregnant. I didn’t have a lot of random sex. But as Dr. Epstein came in my pussy it was getting me off to think that he might be getting me pregnant too. I had one final cum as he finished and pulled his cock from my pussy. 

“That was good,” I said with a smile, but just as he was about to answer, the front door opened, and a voice called out. 

“I’m back! I have Chinese food! Did you fuck Misha yet?” I recognized that voice. It was Jenni.

“Back here. I just dumped a load in her pussy, too,” he yelled toward her with a smile. 

“Misha! Look at you! Open your legs for me,” Jenni instructed me as she rushed into the room.

“What are you doing here?” I asked her, genuinely confused. 

“Oh, Dr. Epstein and I have been fucking for years. I was hoping we’d get to share you one of these days,” she smiled. 

“You tricked me!” I screamed, angry at her.

“No, I gave you a little push to do something fun. Now I need you to give me a little push. Push his cum out onto my tongue for me, Misha,” Jenni begged me and she licked my pussy until I was in spasms. My pussy spurted the cum out for her as I came and I watched as she licked it up, greedy and horny for me. I’d never been with a girl before, but as I watched Jenni lick and finger my pussy, Dr. Epstein looked on with satisfaction. I knew that I was going to let it happen. I wasn’t into girls, but I was into Jenni. Jenni was nice. She was my friend. Except she’d tricked me. I was confused for a moment, but her tongue soothed the confusion away, replacing it with orgasms.

7jlsy9,1,2017-12-13,What to do with pay from internship,financethrowaway969,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7jlsy9/what_to_do_with_pay_from_internship/,"I'm majoring in Computer Science and am lucky enough to have received an internship that will pay a total of $23,000 before tax over 12 weeks in the summer. I predict my spending over that time will be 1500/mo as housing is provided, so that will leave me with effectively $12,750 after tax (assuming 25%, that may be wrong idk) and various monthly costs. In the fall I will work a part time job that will provide me about $900/mo, enough to take care of day to day expenses. 


After the summer I will have 1 semester of school left. My main question is how should I hold on to the money I earn?

My top three options involve some combination of: 

a) Paying off some of my student loans, described in more detail below

b) Having 1-2k in my checking account and some portion of the rest in a money market/savings account that gives about 1% interest per year. This will effectively be my safety for like 5-6 months living expenses after college.

c) Open up a Roth IRA, put in 5500, then save the rest.

I currently have ~ $18,000 in student loans, and will have ~30,000 when graduating at an average rate of 4.24%, which I am not required to start paying until June 2019. Also have no credit card debt. 

I was wondering what y'all think the best course of action is to handle this money properly, as I fear having 12k just sitting in my checking account is not a great idea.

Thanks!

7jm123,1,2017-12-13,(21/m) Should I try and get back together with this girl? (19/f),throwawayguy101010,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7jm123/21m_should_i_try_and_get_back_together_with_this/,"(throwaway because I'm embarassed :^])
I feel like the backstory is important to whether or not I pursue this, so please, bear with me here, there will be a tl;dr at the end

Back in high school, I became really attracted to this girl I met through church stuff. I found her to be really sweet, gentle, compassionate, etc. After a while, I told her something along the lines of ""Hey, you're really neat, I want to, like, know more about you."", and that's when we started getting ""sweet on each other"". A little bit of time passes and she gives me a love letter, spilling her heart and her feelings out, all the while saying she wants to be together. Now at the time, I just turned 18 (she was 16), and I never had a girlfriend in my life, so I jumped right on it. I mean, that letter was the best gift I ever received from a person in my life! I couldn't sleep that night because I was thinking about her, and I texted her the next day, saying I read her letter and wanted to talk to her in person about being together. 

After some INTENSELY awkward exchange, I kind of stuttered out ""D-Do you want to be my g-g-g-g-g-girlfriend?"" to which she kind of nodded, in a really awkward uncomfortable way. She tells me she is going to tell her parents about how she wants a relationship with me. I texted her the following day, asking if she thought it would be a good idea if I was present when she asked her parents about our relationship, to which she sternly replied ""No.""

The next day, when we agreed to talk about what her parents said, she was kind of, super cold towards me. We agreed to meet after a social event at church, and the entire time during that social it felt like she was ignoring me, actively trying to be distant, not making eye contact with me, etc. When I finally managed to pull her aside, she asked me why I was into her, and why I chose her over some other girl, to which (I don't quite remember, tbh) I spouted some kind of combination of my real feelings and some shit I saw in a movie, in the most unintelligible, awkward way imaginable. The whole exchange kind of seemed forced. She told me she though she really liked me, she didn't want to be ""tied down"" if she met somebody else, to which I replied with something along the lines of ""I'd wait for you"", or something gushy and dumb like that. I remember the big fat smile I got from her after I said that... :^)

She tells me she would be willing to talk about a relationship in the future, to which I (hastily and stupidly) tried to put a date on it, saying we should talk at the end of next year (end of 2015), and she just said, maybe.

A couple months pass, and there ends up being a lot of drama, violence, and abuse in my life. I don't want to go too much into detail about that stuff, but it really took it's toll on me mentally and emotionally. I find myself becoming prone to panic attacks, outbursts of emotion, crying fits. Thinking back on it, I wanted to be the edgiest teenager I could possibly be. Due to a huge combination of ""outside influence"", and the fact that it seems this girl doesn't want anything to do with me (she was being distant, disengaged when we would talk or text each other, it felt like she was ""dropping hints"" that she didn't wasn't interested), I had a panic attack towards the end of a social event we were both at. As I was crying my eyes out over my home life situation, I was flipping through my bag. I kept her letter that she gave me in the back of one of my books that I carried around, and as I looked at it, it pissed me off something fierce. I approached her, pushed the letter into her hands, and dipped out of there. It was a nightmare. My panic attack that night got so bad, that one of the adults called 911 and sent for EMTs (I didn't know what a panic attack was at the time, and that one hurt so bad I thought I was having a heart attack or something.) The EMTs let me go home, and I figured, that's that.

Three years pass. I graduate high school, I enroll into college, I get my life in order. I cut out the negative influence that came from my parents/home life, I sought counseling, I made friends, I applied for internships in my field of choice.  Life is good. I'm HAPPY, and I finally feel in control of myself and my emotions, as if I had finally matured enough to become the man I wanted to be.

Now, a female friend of mine (who I was kind of interested in), sits me down one day, and tells me, that she thinks there is a certain girl whom I should ""pursue"". I thought she was making a move on me or something, so I play along with it, I sit there, giggling and smiling, asking her, ""Ok.... who is this mystery girl then?"", to which she replies, ""It's X"" (The aforementioned girl throughout this entire story). My jaw literally drops. I'm thinking to myself, ""You gotta be insane! After the embarrassment I went through in public because I wasn't able to handle myself? After essentially saying fuck you to that girl after giving her that letter back in a fit of angsty teenage rage? With a girl who confesses her ""literal undying love"" to me, and not even a week later, tells me she would rather keep her options open than commit to a relationship? This is crazy!"" Our mutual female friend then goes on to tell me, ""Yeah, she says she really wants a boyfriend, she's feeling like she will never get one, and I think you two would be perfect for each other."" We end the conversation with me agreeing to go and speak with her again. I get a chance to talk to her for the first time in years (besides one little confrontation where I asked her why she seemingly ghosted me days after giving me a love letter, to which she responded in essence (I still have strong feelings for you, but I felt like I was being selfish [Religious reasons] which I understood, but felt like it was a cop-out answer, for some reason) and we have some gentle, casual conversation. I start to remember why I liked this girl so much, it all comes rushing back, to the point where I'm certain that I still have feelings for her, that I want to try again, that I can't stand the distant ""broken"" relationship that we have right now, that I miss her, that I want what's best for her, that I want to be with her. These feelings overwhelm me. 

Every time I meet with our mutual friend, she asks me if I told ""X"" my feelings yet (which is twice a week, and has been happening for about 3 months now, it's kind of getting old, haha. She says that ""X"" still likes me, but I don't know whether or not to believe that), to which I always respond ""Oh, I haven't found a chance yet"", or ""Oh I got really anxious about it"", or something dumb like that, when in reality, I'm torn over whether or not I should even do this. 
I know I have feelings for this girl still, and I want this, I want a relationship with her, but at the same time, there's the entire teenage drama bullshit that happened in the past. I feel like she will hold it against me or something. I feel like those actions are the reason why she is distant towards me. I feel guilty about it. I feel like she would be better off with somebody without that history. Most of all I'm afraid of getting hurt again. I'm so conflicted...

Holy crap, that was a LOT. I feel better now that I've been able to... just write all that down and dwell on it. Forgive the hastily typed script :^)

Please give me some advice, guys. I don't know what to do. It feels as if I'm still not mature enough for a relationship, that I'm still mentally and emotionally a teenager, but... I dunno. 

tl;dr: start liking a girl in high school, tell her I like her, she tells me she ""loves"" me through a letter. a few days later she says ""takes it back"" says maybe in the future. i have a panic attack for unrelated reason, give her letter back in a fit of rage, stop talking to her, 3 years pass, her friend says I should ""pursue"" her, after spending some casual time with her over a few months, all my feelings come back. it's present day, I'm conflicted whether or not to tell her I miss her and want to try again for various reasons."
7jm8hu,303,2017-12-13,My Wild Summer,georgia_boi,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/7jm8hu/my_wild_summer/,"Spent last summer on an internship at a large Engineering firm in New York City. It was refreshing to get away from the homophobic South; both the college and my parent’s house. My boss immediately drafted me and the 4 other male interns onto the company tag football team. While I didn’t play football in high school, I am fairly athletic and very quick. 

Our first practice was on a very warm day in Central Park. We broke into 2 teams and began scrimmaging. I had noticed Evan the first day. He had rugged good looks, and filled out both the front and back of his trousers well. As I took furtive glances of him in his shorts and sleeveless muscle shirt, I could feel my little buddy stir. Evan’s body was well sculpted, and when he knelt down, his muscle shirt would gap and gave me a perfect view of his hard smooth pec and large dark nipple. I was so distracted, he knocked me on my ass the first play, ran down the sideline, and caught a TD pass. 

The next time he tried to do that, I simply grabbed his shirt and pulled him down with me. His crotch landed on my upper thigh, and I could feel his soft cock and balls press against my bare skin. He got up with a smile, congratulated me a great holding penalty, and slapped my ass. I knew who would be my fantasy when I got back to the apartment. He lined up again across from me, and casually lifted his shirt to wipe the sweat from his face.  I drank those hard abs and sexy navel in. His stomach was hairless, except for a thin line of dark curly hairs diving from his bellybutton into his shorts. Once again, he blew by me. After practice, we gathered under a large tree and cooled off with a cooler of beer. Evan had shed his shirt, and thrown it over his shoulder. God, did he look good. 

We had a long conversation about work, our colleges, and our lives. He had grown up in Manhattan, and lived a few blocks away on the Upper West Side. I was in a small Chelsea apartment, where my space was actually a small encove off the entry with a slower curtain pulled across the opening. The two guys in the apartment were good guys, so it worked out fine. As we walked out of the park, Evan sadly put his shirt back on, and then asked me if I wanted to hang out at his place. Within 5 minutes, we were riding up the elevator of very impressive pre-war building. 

I didn’t know what his parents did at the time (later found out they were both surgeons), but I could tell they made a shitload of money. Their co-op was at least 50% bigger than my house back home, and overlooked the Hudson River. After meeting his parents, we went back to his room. I swear to God, it was bigger than my living room back home. He pointed to the mini-fridge, and told me to help myself. He peeled off his shirt and shoes, and said he was going to take a quick shower. When I turned back from the mini-fridge, he was naked casually folding his dirty clothes. I must have jumped at the sight, because he just flashed a smile, turned and walked into his en-suite bath, not bothering to close the door. 

I sat on the edge of his bed, pondering what I’d just seen. His cock was cut and hung nicely over large smooth ball sack. His dark pubes were neatly trimmed, and his ass looked like it could crack walnuts. Beautiful white smooth orbs with those sexy concave dimples on the side. It was all could do to stop “little buddy” from breaking out into full prep mode. 

When he walked back in vigorously toweling his hair, I got another good view of the whole package. His broad shoulders tapered down to his narrow waist, and the Vee that formed on either side of his ripped abs begged for my tongue. His wide brown nipples had shrunk and gone hard in the cool A/C, the points a lighter shade of brown. His cock and balls made my mouth water. 

He pulled on a pair of boxer briefs, then a shirt, ending the torture. He sat on the loveseat under the window, and cracked open a beer. He talked about how much better he felt, and then offered to lend me some clothes if I wanted to shower too. I declined, and literally spit out a mouthful of beer when he asked me if I had a boyfriend. I nervously asked him why he thought I was gay, and he just smiled. “Straight guys don’t check out other guys like that” was his simple answer. Then he stood, adjusted his cock, and said he was single too. Then with that killer smile added, “If you took me up on that shower offer, we might have some fun”. 

I looked at him incredulously. “What about your parents?” I whispered. He just shrugged and said they were fine with him being gay, and actually preferred that he have sex at home, and not at somebody else’s place, as long as he played it safe. “I’d help you wash your back if you want” he added mischievously. 

I wasn’t the most experienced guy in the world. My few sexual encounters could be counted on one hand. He stood up and peeled his shirt off again. “C’mon, lets shower together.” My cock was already about to explode, and there was nothing I wanted more than to be naked in his bed having sex. I slipped out of my clothes quickly, noticing his cock was beginning to chub. When I pushed my shorts and boxer briefs down, my cock boomeranged and slapped my stomach. His eyes dropped, and he smiled. “Very nice” he added, and turned and walked into his bathroom.

As soon as I closed the shower door, his hands took my waist, and he pulled us together. My cock rubbed against his hard abs as he dove his tongue into my mouth. His cock quickly hardened and joined mine, and they rubbed as we kissed under the warm water. He pulled back and began to lather my chest with shower gel, teasing my nipples with his thumbs. He moved down to my cock, and my knees went weak. He pulled me back into his chest, and ran his soapy hands over my ass, delving into my crack with his finger. He gave my bunghole a good scrubbing, and pushed his fingertip in several times, and made small circles, all the time pressing our slick cocks together. 

I tried to hold back, but I couldn’t and began spraying ropes of cum between us as I gripped his back with all my strength. My orgasm was amazing, and had we not been holding each other, I’m sure I would have fallen down. He pushed back and wahed the cum strands from our torsos, and turned the shower off. I apologized, but he was cool. He stroked my sensitive shrinking cock, and asked me if I could cum twice. Staring at his hot body, I told him I could cum however many times he wanted me to. 

We dried off and slipped into bed. Evan grabbed his lube and condom from the end table, in an unspoken statement that he was going to fuck me. I ran my hand across his smooth hard chest, and teased his hard nipple. He pulled my head into his chest, and over his nipple. I flicked it with my tongue, lightly nipped the tip and then began to suck it. His chest arched, and he squirmed under me. After working the other nipple, he began to lightly push my head down his chest. I darted my tongue into his sexy navel, then tongued the soft hairs leading to the promise land. 

I purposely avoided his straining cock, and moved to his inner thigh. I licked and kissed it, then ran my tongue under his big shaven sack licking his taint. I worked his other thigh, until he begged me to suck him. I held the shaft at the base and stared at it. A good 7 inches, cut with a darker circumcision scar under the perfectly formed mushroom head. It curved slightly upward, and I wondered if the curve would hit my prostate better than the 2 straight ones I’d had. I worked his cock head with a vengeance. Slurping, swirling and sucking to his obvious delight. I worked his shaft and then each of his cleanly shaved nuts. He moved around, and began to finger my hole with a spit covered finger. 

Soon he had 3 lube covered fingers banging me, and pressing my prostate. He handed me the condom, which I slid down his slippery pole as he continued to finger fuck me. He lubed up his cock, and told me to push the big down pillow under my ass. He squirted more lube on my soft cock, and moved between my legs. I tried to relax, when in one smooth move, he removed his probing fingers and quickly entered me. I didn’t feel the same pain I’d felt before. It was obvious that Evan had some experience fucking guys. He slowly fed me his hard cock, until his smooth nuts pressed into my cheeks. He dropped down and pressed his chest into mine. His arms went under my pits, and he began to kiss me very lightly as he slowly rocked inside of me. “You’re really tight; feels fucking great” he cooed. “Wrap your legs around my waist” he added. He began to do full strokes in and out of me. Slowly at first, but as I began to adjust, he picked up his pace. I was grunting loudly every time he pressed my prostate, and I thought about his parents hearing us. I was so fucking aroused by that time, I didn’t give a fuck who heard me. My cock was hard as a rock, and sliding against his rock hard abs. The small hairs below his navel were driving the back of my cock head insane. 

Sex noised filled the room. My grunting, his thighs smacking my ass, the headboard rocking against the wall, the sloppy squishing noises of a well lubed cock punishing my hole. He told me he was getting close after a good 20 minutes of non-stop fucking, and told me to get on my knees. When he pulled out, my ass began to gape as I scrambled to my knees. He lubed up again, and plunged back in. he was at the perfect angle, and my entire body tingled in pleasure as his cock pressed my prostate. I was howling it felt so fucking good. He was pulling my ass into his even harder thrusts, and breathing audibly harder. 

Suddenly my cock pulsed, and I was overwhelmed with a full body orgasm. He just kept fucking me harder, as I unloaded on his soft white sheets.  He dragged me against his chest, and held me tight with a forearm around my neck. I could see his frenzied face in the mirror over the dresser. I felt like a limp ragdoll as he drilled my ass harder than anyone ever had. He froze, his jaw dropped and eyes widened. His head bucked back and forth. His tense face and body loosened as he gasped for air, and began to lightly buck into me pushing the last drops into the condom. 

He pulled out slowly, and rolled onto his back. “Fuck that was hot” he sighed. Despite the cool air, there was a light sheen across his muscled chest, and his cheeks were lightly flushed. I could feel my warm cum from the sheets against my back. We caught our breaths, cleaned up, and got dressed. He stripped his cum stained sheets, and we headed out the door. 

Evan carried the sheets pass his parents calmly reading in the family room, and deposited them in the laundry room. His Mom called out cheerfully, “Just leave them, Hon, I’ll do a load later”. I know I blushed. They had to hear us fucking like boars, and his Mom was going to be washing my cum out of his sheets. 
I departed soon after.

Evan and I began to hookup every couple of days after that. On weekends, I’d spend the night with him, and get fucked in the morning as well. I became more comfortable around his parents, who never brought our romps up. I did have to smile the time I grabbed a cold water from the kitchen after having been fucked silly, and I could hear the two of them enjoying each other through their closed door, one Saturday night. 

We’ve stayed in touch since our internship ended, and this summer has opened up a whole new perspective for me. I’m out at college now, and plan on coming out at home after graduation. Evan and I have both been offered full time positions at the firm, and he’s looking for an apartment for us in May. A one bedroom apartment.

7jm8ke,2,2017-12-13,Maybe porn isn't so bad...,fill38dob,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7jm8ke/maybe_porn_isnt_so_bad/,"This is my longest nofap streak ever, and I'm intent on keeping it. Though as the semester continues to wind down, I'm left with a large block of free time before I head home for xmas (about a week.) Hours for the gym and library are shorter, it's getting a lot colder (makes you want to stay inside) and so many friends that live in dorms are going home today or have already left. 

I think I benefitted a lot these past couple weeks from being super busy with classes-- and I've seen the results. Going to get all As (one class is a toss-up though I'm pretty sure it'll be an A), was offered a TA position by a professor I respect a ton who I also thought for sure wasn't fond of me, and was personally encouraged by a couple folks in my department to go after a specific internship. Other things have happened (you know, serendipity) too that lead me to believe I'm on a better path than I once was-- a girl came up to me the other day and just told me I looked so much better than when the semester first started, that I seemed like I was ""glowing"" (lol.) I attribute this partly to the fact that the diet plan I was on wasn't working for me, and I switched to a more paleo-style diet (along with taking grass-fed collagen daily-- look it up, it'll do wonders for your facial hair, skin, joints) and have gained 20lbs (I was about 20lbs underweight when I switched diets, so this weight gain is very much desired.) I also started to going to the gym regularly for the first time in my life (22 yo male) and am noticing nice muscle development and a general sense of being more comfortable with my body-- being uncomfortable with my body was something I was running from when via PMO, something I've really only come to face retrospectively. 

Overall, I can definitely see the benefits. I think my mind is still trying to convince me that I won't find a partner anytime soon, that P isn't that bad, and even this more complex thought process about the idea of control. I find myself thinking-- contrary to what I really believe, which is that ditching porn gives you control of your life and sexual desires back-- that maybe watching some P wouldn't be so bad. Wouldn't it be better more efficient to just watch P and not have to deal with people? Would that save me time and heartbreak? Isn't being alone just easier? Wasn't watching P so great before and during O? Who am I kidding, am I really never going to watch P again? I know the answer to all these questions is no... but my mind is just looking at the surface, indulging these questions, trying to get me to watch P. I can remember watching P (toward the end of my usage, I was high most of the time) and feeling the surges of dopamine through my whole body... my heart would practically flutter, it was an incredible sensation honestly. I was completely addicted. 

I've been a user for probably almost 10 years. All through my youth. I'm going on day 41 of being pornfree (which I am proud of) and am focusing on nofap because I think that accelerates the reboot process, and also, no dealing with the chaser effect. 

I'm writing this to hopefully afford any of y'all who are doubting the journey, or even doubting yourselves because of how you find yourself trying to rationalize crawling back to P, some hope. Just know that there a lots of us who are doing the real work of recovering without really being totally fully resolved in our minds that it's working, or that it's the best the thing to do-- even though really, deep-down, we know it is. 

Sometimes the results of big changes like this take a while to materialize, and you just have to take a leap of faith that everything it going to work out okay in the end-- despite what what others, or even your own subconscious, might be saying. Stay strong y'all.

Update at 18 days of nofap: got nudes last night and it took everything in me not to MO. Consequently, I got into a very sexual conversation and started browsing sex toys. I've had some disappointing experiences where I haven't been able to release because of porn, and periodically I think why don't you buy one of those rubber toys that you just fuck... maybe that would help ""train"" me for the real thing. I know this isn't the correct path-- I recognize that it's just the porn junkie inside me trying to take control again. But still for a good couple hours I was browsing. Scary shit-- why couldn't I just snap out of it? I also almost smoked a blunt with a friend-- despite my horrible experience becoming dependent on weed earlier this year. Last night was hectic, basically the last night of the semester. I had two assignments to finish and ultimately did-- I think getting the nudes and offered the weed came at a horrible time-- I was sort of weakened by having seen the news and getting strong urges to MO, then a friend wanted to chill and smoke a blunt, and on top of it I just wanted to celebrate. I could've done both of those things and felt like shit this morning-- but I didn't. I feel like I just barely didn't though-- I'm grateful, but also feel like how the fuck did I not just MO and light up that blunt, it's the fucking end of a semester and I'm probably gonna make all As. Anyway... another day. Having surpassed those challenges last night, if I MO anytime soon I'm gonna feel like a huge dumbass cause it doesn't get much harder than hot nudes and weed. Lol.

__________________________________________

Ethan Brenthouse took a long, slow sip from his mojito, draining it down to the ice. He had to admit, as much as his preference was for American rye, the Dominicans made a damn good cocktail. He lazily signaled to a wide-eyed waitress, who quickly shuffled over.

""Another please, mamacita"" he sneered in his distinctive, privileged drawl.

""Of course sir,"" the young girl quietly responded, giving him a pained smile before hurrying back to the bar. In the meantime 

Ethan sat back on his chair, folding his arms and listening to the waves of the Caribbean crashing into the white sand of Puta Cana Playa, just a hundred or so feet away.

It was good to be American again.

It was hard sometimes to process how much the country had changed in a few short years. Ever since the astonishing electoral victory of the Founding Father's Party in 2020, America had finally fulfilled its Manifest Destiny and become the Empire it always deserved to be. The red, white and blue juggernaut had steamrolled through Venezuela in 2021, crushing the socialist uprising and liberating the world's largest proven oil reserves. Across Latin America rebellions and left-wing insurgencies everywhere from Honduras to Peru were crushed by US-backed dictators using America-made weapons. And yes, the FFP had also built the big, beautiful wall on the Mexican border.

The entire southern continent was now nothing more than one huge maquiladora, making American goods for next-to-nothing and pumping money into the glorious US economy. Places like the Dominican Republic had become veritable gold-minds for American investors. In the morning they could grease some palms, and displace a few hundred favela-dwellers to build a new luxury hotel for American tourists. In the afternoon, dine with corrupt government officials to ensure that US corporations could have monopolies on the country's natural resources. And in the evening, party with an army of Latina sluts, all desperate for a principe blanco to take them to the US.

Which brings us back to Ethan Brenthouse.

Tall, blonde, and chiseled from years of polo and lacrosse, Ethan was about to enter his final year at Dartmouth, and had decided to take the summer to ""intern"" with a venture capital firm down in DR - one owned by an alumni of his frat. Ostensibly Ethan was there to help find new, market-friendly investment opportunities for the growing and dynamic American market. In reality this just involved a lot of partying and drinking, for which Ethan would receive an extremely generous stipend and a job after he graduated with one of Washington's biggest lobbying companies. 

Tonight, however, Ethan wasn't interested in business. He was interested in pleasure.

He had tried to make some vague promise to himself to stay faithful to his girlfriend back in Dartmouth over the month he was down in DR - after all he'd cheated, and been forgiven, so many times it was honestly farcical at this point. That changed his second night in Puta Cana however, when he found himself in a strip club's VIP room with some whore on her knees in front of him, head bobbing up and down. The women down here were just so...desperate and servile. Was it the Catholicism? Their sense of inbred inferiority? Or just the fact they knew 21-year-old Ethan was in possession of more money than they could ever dream of?

The waitress returned a deposited his mojito with a timid smile before disappearing. Taking a drink, Ethan's eyes scanned around the hotel's restaurant. It seemed the Mandarin had taken extra care to have plenty of eye-candy on display for their Western visitors, so Ethan wasn't exactly lacking for options. Waitress? Hostess? Classily-dressed girls, here all alone, who were likely hookers? One way or another, his privileged white seed would be flowing down some puta's throat tonight...
_______________________________________________

Hi there! Do taboo themes like corruption and raceplay turn you on? Do you want to explore the sick, dystopic side to American colonization? Do you want a well-written, eloquent roleplay that can be either short-term or long-term? Well then you're in luck. This is a story where, together, we craft the downfall of a beautiful, young Latina girl. Maybe she's a waitress, struggling to make ends meet, and sees Ethan as a ticket to the top. Maybe she's a student, wide-eyed by Ethan's riches, or maybe she's a high-class escort, surviving a dystopic world, who knows how to give boys like Ethan the Latina experience they crave. Whatever character you choose, it'll be one where Ethan gets to realize his innate superiority over the mulatto hoards of Latin America, fucking their women just as his country had fucked over their people.

I realize the prompt is quite dark but I'm far, far more interested in mental degradation and corruption than anything physical. I find it so much hotter when a girl forces herself to willingly submit to an arrogant guy then any actual rape scene.

If you're at all interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you!"
7jo32m,3,2017-12-13,Afraid to message the girl of my dreams,talldarkandfullofshi,Crushes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/7jo32m/afraid_to_message_the_girl_of_my_dreams/,"I met a beautiful girl the first week of my freshman year at university. We both fell in love but not too long into the relationship did problems arise from her end, as her ex of two years started his attempts to win her over. She stayed by my side, but the ex persisted and would mention things about God (she was heavily religious), and then she became confused. I will never forget these words, she told me ""My heart says him, but my mind says you"". That broke me, and we stopped talking so she could figure herself out. A few weeks later she messages me saying that it was me she loves, and wants to get back together. 

We get back together and she gives me her all. But, however, after that incident, I could never feel the same way about her ever again. My love became lust, but I did still love her as a person, I just was no longer ""in love"". I guess that's what happens when you spend day and night crying over someone who you gave your heart out to, only to have been rejected. As a result of me not being able to be the same person as I was before, on and off periods started to occur.

These on and offs started happening sometime into the second semester when my classes changed. During this time, I ended up meeting this girl from my English. We were assigned to the same group that day for reviewing our research papers, and I ended up talking to her. She was so nice, extremely shy, and seemed to be turned on by cute animals. She had the most beautiful smile whenever she'd use it. I don't remember how I began talking to her, but when I did, I said ""We should definitely work on the project together!"" and she said ""Yes, defintely!"" and she put my number in her phone. I remember trying to pronounce her last name and failed horribly haha, and she laughed a bit and corrected me.

I messaged her on my way back to the dorm telling her how it was nice to meet her and when we should get together to work on the project. She said the same, and we started to make plans. We would text each other a lot! Like, I'm telling you guys, there were paragraphs on paragraphs about life, each other, the silliest things accompanied by the silliest emojis lol. She was so nice, and very smart, and had the most beautiful perspective on life. It gave me peace talking with her. 

This all happened during an ""off"" period with my ex. The topic of her never came about and I didn't want to mention it because we were talking about mountains and butterflies and the moon and things of that nature, so I didn't see a good opportunity to do so.

People were also very malicious in their behavior towards me. Everyone wanted to hook up with my ex and would come up to her and say that I would cheat on her, blah blah blah all this bullshit that made no sense. One of the dudes who was actually trying to get with my ex was a friend of this girl, so I definitely know that loser tried to start some drama.

Anyway, things were okay with my ex and great with this new girl. But every time I was ""on"" with my ex, I became ""off"" with this new girl because I didn't want my ex to think I was cheating on her or anything. And she didn't like me texting other girls, so I would prevent the situation from even coming up. Worst mistake.

Ex finds out and is furious and I'm here giving up my pride telling her how its her I love and not this new girl, but I was lying to myself.

This is a long ass story and I wish I could cut it short but it needed some backstory. What happened was that the new girl caught on and realized what was going on. She messaged me in the beginning of the summer saying how she felt like she was used, and that she was sorry she didn't respond to me but was sad how I would only talk with her when I was ""on"" with my ex. 

I told her the honest truth, and she said she appreciates my sincerity and hopes that I take the summer to find my passions and really work on myself, and that she'd see me in the fall.

Fall came around and I tried messaging her but she has never responded.

Then ex (who I haven't talked to in months) gets high for the first time and calls for my help so I take care of her and then go on and off with her for the next few weeks. And one time when I was walking back with ex, I run into new girl... Her head was down, but I definitely know she saw us.

The semester ended, and I'm not going back to school cause I'm working an internship and focusing on my passions, but I really want to message this girl. Oh, and I have completely cut contact with ex. 

I'm just afraid to. I have nothing to lose because I feel like I already lost her, but I still want to message her ""hey"" and see if she responds. I haven't talked to her since summer, and the start of the year was when I messaged her and she didn't respond.

Should I wait? Should I go for it? I don't know...

I've found myself in a really interesting head space lately and maybe some of you all can talk me through what to do with my life. Here's a little about me and my situation, I guess!

I'm Mississippi born and raised (23F), I come from a 6000 population town. I stayed in state for college--my university offered me a scholarship that covers my tuition, food, living expenses, and even my sorority because of my academic achievements. I consider myself extremely privileged because I've been able to focus completely on school. I've never worked less than 20 hours a week for the past 4 years in jobs that are relevant to my fields (Computer Science/Graphic Design double major). I took one year off to do a co-op with a huge car manufacturer, and lived in Shanghai for 3 months studying Mandarin as well. 

My whole life I've been working towards a very specific goal, but it's started to crumble this semester. I went through a bad breakup in August and my ex has been stalking and harassing me for months (if you climb through my post history you can find details if you are so inclined). During this stressful time (I lost 20+ lbs, dropped two classes, have been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist) I missed the deadlines for the Rhodes Scholarship, as well as many other relatively prestigious programs I had anticipated on applying for. I missed over three weeks of class from panic attacks. 

Well, since my grad school plans blew up in my face, I've had to recuperate and decide what to do for a year until I can apply next year. During this time I've realized how exhausted and emotionally burnt out I am. I'm done with the cutthroat academic life (for now). So I've been applying for jobs! I've gotten five offers in Mississippi and Memphis a software developer so far, with salaries ranging between $50-$65k. However... my ex's harassment hasn't subsided. While I have legal repurcussions in place to prevent him from contacting me directly, it hasn't stopped him from spreading rumors and showing up at concerts I'm going to. He got 6 new phone numbers to text my childhood best friend, but since he didn't ask her to relay any messages he technically didn't violate the order I have against him. He's spread untrue rumors that I fucked my way to one of my job offers (which ironically I didn't even get that one he's talking about) and that I'm on drugs (I'm not). Classmates and even professors have heard some of these rumors... bottom line, I can't take it anymore. I rejected all my job offers this week. I'm leaving, I just don't know where to go. 

Like I said, I'm Mississippi born and raised. I'm used to living in my small college town where no building has more than 4 floors, and you can strike up a conversation with a stranger at Walmart and end up at their tailgating tent and family barbeque later that day. My *entire* family is from Mississippi and I just can't stay here. My sister just scored in the 98th percentile on the MCAT but it looks like she's staying in Mississippi for medical school too. I don't have any idea where to go. 

I mention all my academia before not to brag but to say that I'm quite confident in my ability to land a job. I'll be graduating with two summer internships, a co op, and summa cum laude (among other qualifications)... I'm not qualified for anything above like Dev I, but I'm pretty confident I can get a job. I just have absolutely no idea where to go!

Again, I'm very humbled by my university. I've had the opportunity to travel to Shanghai, the French Riviera, Washington DC, Boston, and Santa Fe NM through the school. Other cities I've liked that I've been to for fun have been Salt Lake City and Austin. Currently my priorities are health coverage (once I don't have therapy/psych care through my school it'll be $400/month for mental health care and medicine alone) as well as dental and vision insurance. Those are huge expenses that I need help with to be self sufficient.... I love big cities but I usually feel very uncomfortable. People have tried to take advantage of me being a naive little southern girl before and I'm scared to just move into a huge city on my own. I had so much fun going clubbing (definitely a party girl) but I've always had groups of close friends to take me places. :/

I don't know! I feel like the world is my oyster and this is my chance to see the world and plant my roots but all I want to do is just go back home with family and have them keep helping me with anything and live in fear of my ex... Does anyone have any resources, stories, advice, etc for moving? I'm a software developer... do you know of any companies worth applying to? I'm at a complete loss for how to take charge of my life right now. 

Thank you all. :)"

7jp19x,11,2017-12-13,"2 months, 8 videos, finally I've reached the 100 subscribers milestone!",GoodyGrabber,NewTubers,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/7jp19x/2_months_8_videos_finally_ive_reached_the_100/,"My channel is for reviews and my opinions on technology. I didn't tell my family and friends about my channel, as I don't want them to know until I become successful. While I'm still working on a full-time internship, I tried my best to find time, coming up with video ideas and make them, starting with the gadgets that I have.

I tried my best to be active on YouTube, even after a tiring long working day, these are some steps.

1) Commenting on other videos, with qualitative comments.

2) Some sub4sub (I know it's discouraged, but how else to make others know I exists when I don't want my friends or family to know yet)

3) Share my videos on Reddit (Only realize this recently) 

In 2 months, I've finally hit 100 subscribers.

I don't consider myself successful yet, it's just a milestone that proves that I can get there one day. 

To others: Don't give up, be committed! Keep exploring new ways and methods, learn something everyday.

Some people might get there faster or slower, it doesn't matter! What's important is that as long as you get up and keep moving forward, you will get there some day!"
7jpknd,0,2017-12-14,My [19F] boyfriend[20M] gets mad when I get stressed out.,stressedloser,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7jpknd/my_19f_boyfriend20m_gets_mad_when_i_get_stressed/,"To start I have bipolar disorder, very mild borderline personality disorder (from trauma), and anxiety.  I am getting professional help and learning how to manage my feelings. 

 However, I do lead a very stressful life.  I am a freshman in college I go to a local community college to save money because my parents want me to pay for my own education like they did so during the school year I work thirty hour work weeks and for this holiday season I have two jobs and am working sixty hour work weeks.  

My boyfriend is in Florida with his mom going to disney and universal studios.  I guess to start since I started college I've struggled with math, I have to retake it.  I'm pretty mad at myself for not doing better but every night before a math test I had to close at work.  


Every time this happened my boyfriend and I would fight making me stay up later.  Anytime I mention I'm struggling emotionally he'll make a half assed attempt at making me feel better that includes ""you worry too much"" or ""stop freaking out"".  As someone with borderline I really really like hearing I'm doing a good job and that I'm not a psycho and I can succeed.  I will literally tell him what I need to hear and I get the same comments ""you stress too much"". 

   It always turns into this huge fight where he yells at me, goes to bed, and leaves me thinking he'll dump me the next day.  We are long distance so I don't know if that makes it worse.  Before he left for college and when were together in person everything is a-okay.  

  The thing that pushed me to post about this was that we were facetiming after I got off work.  I told him I'm bummed I couldn't make it on the trip, I told him this after he told me everything he did today.  I told him that I got my work schedules and I was afraid I couldn't handle the work load.  That I'm freaking out because I have no time to relax and have fun.

I told him at the job I have the most hours at I can only wear nice heels or boots that are uncomfy, he said I should try flats or something else.  He told me he got me fluffy pompompurin socks because I complain about my feet getting cold and sore at work.  I know he was trying to help me and that he does care and I feel like an ass because he does do his best but I just get upset. 

Well, I guess I fucked up and got upset or something and said I didn't think I could handle work this week and he got annoyed and said I worried way too much. He went to change when I was telling him this so I thought he was mad at me for venting so I hung up.  I texted him and told him his response really hurt me.  

 I told him I wanted to hear that I was doing a good job.  He got really mad at me and said that was his way of telling me I was doing good.  He said goodnight goodnight and that he was going to bed. He also yelled at me earlier because I said he doesn't understand my workload because he only worked weekends one winter for like a month.  His mom pays for everything and he gets internships.  I pay for my school, my clothes, my medical bills, and all my vehicle expenses so it's really hard for me to save for school.  It's the big reason I am so stressed.

7jpkqe,3,2017-12-14,[M4F] The dumb naive girl,ThisIsDark,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7jpkqe/m4f_the_dumb_naive_girl/,"So I'm really into the idea of corrupting a super naive/oblivious girl right now. Naturally most of them will be dub-con but we can play it in a consensual light too. I have a few ideas for this:

**The Sister**

So you'd be my sister and you take up a sport, football, gymnastic, ballet, etc. One day you come home and you're just incredibly sore. Usually our mother would give you a massage, run a bath for you, etc. However she's visiting family right now, it's only you and I in the house. So of course you ask me, your big bro, to give you a massage. Things start off normal, get those sore muscles worked. However when a man massages you it's different. Maybe it's my smell, my hormones or just the feeling of stronger rougher hands, you start to feel something. Then it comes 'Hey big bro I'm getting this tingly feeling between my legs and it feels really weird.' You drop the bomb on me. Truth is I always wanted to fuck you but never got a good chance. Now that you were offering yourself up to me I wouldn't say no. Time for big bro to educate his sis.

**The Student**

I'm a university professor and you are my student. You're an absolute A+ student however I don't think you're living up to your potential. Your potential as a slut! You have the hottest body in the entire class but you are an incredible prude! So I fake some evidence and accuse you of plagiarism on a paper and threaten you with expulsion. I offer you a deal if you come to my house and we have some 'lessons in morality'; I'll let you redo the paper and give you a pass. However these lessons are obviously just a cover up. Alone in my private quarters I'll convince you of some 'stress relief' techniques. I'm looking to incorporate some hypnosis and possible drugs into this too. This can be a long term.

**The Intern**

I'm a high level manager at a finance company. I hire you as my 'personal assistant'. You're a super sheltered girl and this is your first job so you do just about everything and everything I ask you to. I notice this and start taking things a little further. I'm 'clumsy' and drop things a lot so I make you bend over and pick them up. Maybe sometimes I 'accidentally' bump into you and your shirt gets wet and I can see everything. When you come in I have you feel you up because it's a 'security check'. This one I prefer to be a long term roleplay. I want to gradually escalate how far I can push you until I can come up with a reason for fucking you that a naive/oblivious girl would think acceptable.

**The maid**

Very similar to the intern prompt however in the workplace we have to sneak around more. In my home, well I can get a lot more daring. This one would be faster and would include the cute outfits of course.

**The Gymnast**

I'd be your coach, and honestly speaking you're under performing. You know it, I know it, the team knows it. So I come up to you and offer some 'extra lessons'. Lessons that will really 'stretch you out'. This will move at a medium ish speed. There's going to be a lot of touching, a lot of 'here let me help you stretch'. Which is really just me putting you in sex positions and dry humping you. Then I'll say something like 'oh I found the problem! You're too wet!' You have no idea what that even means so I take this chance to 'educate' you. The sexual frustration you're feeling impacts your performance, and as your coach I need to keep you in tip top position. Personally.

**The Therapist**

You've started seeing a therapist for recurring nightmares you've been having. What the nightmares are can be decided by you. My conclusion will be that you have a sort of trauma from your childhood so I put you under a little hypnosis to make you mentally regress. While you're under that state you've forgotten all about decorum and start doing things that would be considered highly inappropriate. Maybe you start taking your clothes off just because, or you come and sit on my lap, or you start playing with your tits a lot because you don't remember having those great funbags. Of course I can't resist, I mean you won't remember anything when you wake up right?

Hope to hear from you!"
7jppb1,9,2017-12-14,"I hear a lot that flow is great, but it has become my drug.",qrpnxz,NonZeroDay,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/7jppb1/i_hear_a_lot_that_flow_is_great_but_it_has_become/,"Yeah, I'm addicted to flow. I should be working on my school work but programming consumes my day. There is always something new and harder for me to do. The days are going by while I waste away in my desk chair not exercising, not eating right, not doing the stuff I need to do to get a good career in the future, and I sit there with a huge smile on my face every time I solve a new problem or make something go a couple of orders of magnitude faster, but smiles aren't getting me my degree, they aren't getting me a better job, so I don't know what to do. My school work is simply not as interesting. It will never be as interesting, on one hand, because I have to do 48 credit hours of basic stuff before I can even get to something relevant to my degree; on the other because computers are my *passion*!

With terrible grades I'm going to have to drop out or go to some crappy school that is going to butcher the interesting classes, so it all feels very hopeless. How can I form a personal relationship with my future self? I've tried to do programming and other things at the same time, but it simply isn't working. Must I swear off programming for a couple of years? Even now that I've become so self-aware, if I'm not programming I feel like nothing else is worth doing either; I will go on Reddit, Netflix, Hulu, read a book, write in my journal, or simple sit in bed doing literally nothing rather than do my school work. Nothing feels productive except learning more about programming and getting better at it. I go to every class, mostly because I owe it to my parents since my brother and sister decided to drop out of high-school, marry, have kids, and live crappy, poor lives in Mexico, my homeland, but, of course, that isn't right! I need to motivate *myself*. The other part is that they happened to actually be interesting, but not enough to do the work that is done outside of class. I would do this in high-school, too. I'd do worksheets, participate, and learn a lot in class, but outside where anything is possible and I can do anything they are just not worth my time. I don't know if I should take this as a sign that fundamentally I don't want to bother with university, and I should just get an internship and get hired without a degree. (Which I know I can do.) I know school is the better choice because it will give me the opportunity of a higher salary ceiling, but an irrational part of me feels very strongly that it's really a waste of time. That when I start my own business there won't *be* a salary ceiling, and that college is not only a waste of time but The Great Debtor.

I love the idea of No More Zero Days, and I was really moved by the original post, but I think my body and my mind have a conflicting idea of what my goal is, so while I think I think I'm having zero days, my body feels ""Yes! I learned one more thing about text parsing today. Yes! I understand category theory a little better now. Look! This programs runs ten times faster now! Aha! Solved another one. Today was a good day."" Argh!

(In this next paragraph I digress a bit, but I think it's relevant.)

My parents would understand if I dropped out and got the job and all that. They get it. They know it's an option. They know I'd succeed. Yet I can't stand to disappoint them because they have very valid reasons to be disappointed. They understand as well as I do that college is not just about the degree, but the people, the higher learning, the experience, and they won't take any old flimsy reason. My mother was born in a poor-as-dirt town in the middle of nowhere. Not really the type of town where everyone is loser or desperate of the economic situation, but one with no expectation to even go to high-school (of which there were none) or anything like that because they just lived very simple lives. My mom was especially poor. She was epitome of going-uphill-both-ways except the story is walking miles to school knee-deep in snow with no shoes or socks. She became a medical doctor while raising my brother and sister, paying for her own food and education with sweat and tears. She values education immensely, so it broke her heart when my brother and sister dropped out of high-school for really stupid reasons like ""having children and getting married"" with neither even knowing a trade. My father had it okay, but he was a hardcore nerd. Straight A dude who was the type to get tangled up in national competitions where all he did was literally pass ridiculous tests perfectly for the accolade.  (Until he realized how fucked up that life was and purposely missed a question to get out of it.) After which he went to the best universities in Mexico to get a degree in one of the most hardcore professions I know of: Actuary. (He does software engineering now, however.) Most importantly he had an amazing mother who didn't know ""I can't"". Once my grandfather was gripping about a really difficult engineering test. My grandmother said ""What?! You can't? Please!"". My grandfather scoffed. ""You only say that because you don't know engineering,"" he said. Well, she showed him by passing a practice exam within a week after having only studied diligently from his textbook. Truly an amazing and inspiring woman. She died when my father was a young boy. Very sad.

Anyway, the point is saying ""college is hard, so I'm dropping out"" is not an option. Thankfully I don't think that is the case, however, my total lack of effort does not say that. My total lack of effort in school does not say ""it's not that I'm a lazy fuck. It's just that I don't care for it/have actually better things to do/literally anything else.""

So, what do you guys think?

TL;DR: I feel as though I shouldn't bother with school so deeply that I'm almost physically incapable of doing assignments, and I'm wondering if dropping out and going my own way, doing my own thing, might be the right answer, and if so, how to go about it.

P.S.

I recently read about wu wei which is a really interesting Taoist principle involving effortless action. It's awesome, but I don't think effortlessly doing something I don't want to do is the answer. However, you guys should check it out."
7jpvfx,1,2017-12-14,"I asked a girl out for my very first time, she seemed to be very interested in me, but then she told me she was busy on the days I proposed. I am not sure of what is happening.",TheDude1009,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7jpvfx/i_asked_a_girl_out_for_my_very_first_time_she/,"So here's what happened, I met this girl while at an internship in a company. I always got along with her well, sometimes we would talk and talk over lunch. I never took action back then because I didn't think it was appropriate to be doing that as an intern. Long story short, the company didn't hire me nor the other intern, I saw this as an opportunity, knowing that I wouldn't be around there anymore I asked for her number she took my phone and wrote it down herself.

Recently, I threw a party with my friends from that company, she was one of the few girls that came. My other friends told me she seemed interested in me. The day after the party she sent me a message thanking me and telling me we should see each other again. Again I took this as sign that she was interested so I asked her out next week. She told me that the place I wanted to take her sounded very cool but that she couldn't make it because she had an important appointment, I asked her about next week, she said she couldn't and that she found really hard on these coming weekends due to all the Christmas related stuff that she has to attend to. I'm sort of in the same boat, but then again she's employed I'm not.

I don't know whether this means no or not. Everything in my gut tells me that she is interested. She seemed really upset about me leaving the company when I first contacted her after having left the company and we spoke for hours. The other thing is that if she's not really interested I don't want to lose her fríendship. I plan to ask her again next year, but what if she says she's busy again. 

How could I even go about telling her that if she's not interested I would still like to stay friends, especially if she answers again with being busy?

I want to keep talking to her and getting to know her better regardless of whether she wants to be with me or not and I think the same is true for her.

However, I'm not sure what to do, I'm not sure whether I'm overthinking, whether she's not interested or if she is playing hard to get which honestly would not be out of character for a woman with a strong personality like hers. "
7jq2ag,0,2017-12-14,"Me [21 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] 10M, I'm feeling suffocated, but he has trust issues when we dont talk",actuallykosak,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7jq2ag/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_22_m_10m_im_feeling/,"My boyfriend and I met while I was working on an internship in California. We lived together when we both needed housing, and it was fantastic

We're now long distance, I'm in NY and he's in Chicago, and I'm starting to feel like I'm reporting my every move to him. He asks me throughout the day what I'm up to, and what else I have to do throughout the day. 

I come from an abusive household where it was bad if I didn't report my every move, and I left that and am very independent now. That being said, I dont want to feel like I'm reporting to someone anymore. It stresses me out and makes me more anxious about everything I need to do (especially as Finals are happening right now)

Meanwhile, he has been cheated on, and has issues with what people don't respond. He says he trusts me, but this is a side affect of the cheating.

In addition to him getting really worried and upset when i dont respond to his texts all day, he also gets upset with me for hanging out with guy friend. On one occasion, even upset when I didn't tell him about a guy friend who brought me coffee while I was asleep in a couch on campus.

When I asked for some space, it led to a huge fight where he told me I don't do anything for this relationship, nor have I cared about him for the last two months. This is downright false, but he's right in the regard that I have valued my engineering degree over him (as I had warned when we agreed to go long distance)

Just 2 days ago, he gave me purposefully ambiguous statements about hanging out with girls in the lab til late at night while talking to them about travel. I told him I wasnt interested in playing any games and he flipped at me again, so we havent talked in two days.  
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I highly value my work towards my engineering degree, and my Independence, and he has trust issues which make him think I'm cheating if I dont tell him everything I do. How do I reconcile this difference?"
7jqbln,1,2017-12-14,Should I go to Law School or Work for the Ontario Public Service?,TheZarosian,askTO,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/7jqbln/should_i_go_to_law_school_or_work_for_the_ontario/,"I'm not sure if this post belongs here, but I thought I'd ask anyways about what I should do.

I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate student studying political science and I'm torn between either doing Law School or working for the public service as an analyst.

I've previously worked stints in the public service, first as a legislative researcher for the school I go to, then as an junior research analyst for a central ministry. I'm heading back to the Ontario Public Service as a junior policy analyst next term, this time for a line ministry. 

I really enjoyed my time  working for the OPS. I liked the work-life balance (although sometimes there wasn't as much work to do) and the benefits are good. A lot of the students there who were doing their internships also ended up transitioning to full-time and eventually permanent offers, which is the path I intended on going down. Combined together, I felt that working in the public service meant a stable long-term career that paid moderately well, but has less room for moving upward or exploring different options.

However, my parents are strongly pushing me to go to Law School due to the much higher salary potential in corporate law. Bay Street BigLaw earns roughly 90-100k for first-year associates, and this rises to around 200k by 5-10 years. If you make partner, this could skyrocket to even 400-600k. By comparison, a career in the public service will net around 50-60k for fresh graduates, 100k for the most senior analysts, and top out at around 150k for directors or associate deputies (assuming one makes it that high). 

Based on my current circumstances, I should stand a solid chance at getting into any Canadian Law School, and my parents have recently offered to pay all of my tuition so the money won't be an issue. They've consistently told me that to not pursue Law School would be an waste of my potential and they've told everyone they know that I intend on being a lawyer probably so that if I don't end up doing it, it would be disappointing to everyone. 

I guess right now for me it's an choice between stability within the public service and risking going to law school and tanking out another three years of school. I'm okay with earning less and being happy, but I have this inside fear that I wouldn't be living up to my full potential.

What would you do as a young student in my situation?

The toddler-in-chief is not happy after Tues.  [wa post archive](http://archive.fo/dpHWV)

&gt;He told advisers that he didn’t want the results to be seen as a referendum on him and asked if he still had a solid base of support in the state. He also questioned Wednesday if he had made the right decision and if Sen. Luther Strange — the Republican he grudgingly endorsed who went on to lose the party’s primary — could have beaten Jones in the general election.

&gt;But inside the West Wing, Jones’s upset victory left some of Trump’s top advisers worried about both the 2018 midterm elections and the president’s low popularity, and accelerated an ongoing discussion about restructuring the White House political operation. 

&gt;This portrait of the White House after the Alabama loss comes from 20 senior officials, aides, lawmakers, and outsider advisers and confidants, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a more candid assessment.  

&gt;***The president himself spread the blame.*** He faulted his former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, for selling him what one outside adviser described as “a bill of goods” in urging him to support Roy Moore, and he faulted Moore himself for being an abysmal candidate.

Of course.

And [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/13/politics/alabama-exit-poll-analysis/index.html) has 8 numbers that should terrify Republicans.

&gt;4. Trump's approval was blah.

&gt;In 2016, President Donald Trump carried Alabama by almost 28 points. In 2017, voters in Alabama rejected Trump twice -- first by beating appointed Sen. Luther Strange in a Republican runoff and then by choosing Jones over Moore on Tuesday night. And you can see why. ***Trump's approval rating in the exit poll was 48%. His disapproval rating? 48%. In Alabama!*** A year after he won overwhelmingly! Granted, national polls suggest his approval rating in the country as a whole is somewhere in the 30s.

Numbers that interest us:  Jones won 44s &amp; under.  Jones won women.  The dem party was more popular than the Rs.  In blood red Alabama!

[the nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/what-we-learned-from-watching-doug-jones-beat-a-predator/): What we learned from watching Jones beat a predator.

That's not really what the article is about.  It's really about the lousy job white Dems do seeking the African-American vote.  And how the national party has abandonded states like Alabama, so they had to go it alone.

And If this isn't the best summary of Hillary's campaign, I don't know what is:

&gt;The women at Shiloh Baptist were tired of that feeling. Tonya Latham, a former schoolteacher who now works as a musician at a church, likened the local attitude toward the Black community to similar problems during the presidential election. ***“Hillary Clinton took for granted that she was going to waltz right in there because we had this idiot running for the president,” she said.***

Back to seeking votes.

&gt;T. Marie King, an activist in Birmingham who specializes in racial reconciliation and healing, put it this way: “The Democratic Party—they always reach out to the black community when they need the black vote.” ***But the party doesn’t maintain contact after elections, failing to show people if and how their vote “moved the needle” on progress, she said.***

&gt;This special election felt like “the same thing” to Brittany Ware, who teaches at Head Start in Anniston. “Same script, different cast,” she said. Ware made a point of saying she was disgusted by Moore’s politics and believed his accusers. ***Still, she called the election “lose-lose.” She was planning to cast a vote for Jones, but reluctantly. Ware said Jones missed a chance to connect on issues important to black voters like education. Instead, she felt like Jones had one refrain: “Black people, vote for me because I prosecuted the KKK.”*** Ware didn’t trust the message coming out of the campaign or appreciate its repeated use of the four dead girls for political gain. (The Jones campaign did not respond to requests to discuss race-related criticisms.)

This is interesting.  They were using that argument which whites too, and expected a Pavlovian response.  

&gt;***The women talked about the ways parents at their schools struggle to transition off of government support when their wages disqualify them for help but leave them struggling to make ends meet. “There needs to be a program in place…so they can get off of assistance and flourish like we do,” Ware said.***

Kitchen table issues.

As for outside help.

&gt;***A huge amount of money has been funneled to Alabama*** through Highway 31, a Birmingham-based Super PAC that spent $4 million on advertisements for Jones, including a TV spot called “Shopping Mall” that explicitly called out Moore for soliciting sex from minors. Highway 31 also brought controversy: One of their ads was removed from Google for falsely claiming voting records would be public, and the group used a legal loophole to conceal their donors’ identities. On December 11, the Highway 31 Donors were revealed by Politico to be primarily two large Democratic SuperPACs: Senate Majority PAC and Priorities USA Action (the main super PAC behind Hillary Clinton’s election campaign).

&gt;***While money has poured into the state, other kinds of support have been less forthcoming.*** According to Janet May, the chair of the Montgomery County Democratic Conference (MCDC), “At our last DNC meeting in October, the plan was to move the boots on the ground from Virginia and New Jersey to Alabama as soon as those elections were over.” May said Jaime Harrison called a few weeks later, promising she’d be hearing from national leaders about the increased manpower for canvassing.

&gt;In mid November, May hadn’t heard anything else. But when I followed up with May a few days before the election, she told me that during a recent DNC conference call a few party liaisons announced they were in Birmingham and offered a 20-minute pep talk to local organizers. May said a pep rally wasn’t what local organizers needed. What they needed was cooperation and support.

&gt;She told me that “the national party has been so removed from Alabama, it’s not even a distant cousin,” arguing that the DNC often ignores the needs of Southern states. Locals in the party wondered if the DNC would even show up for a state that outsiders often consider backwards or a lost cause. When Moore won the September runoff, defeating the incumbent, both the DNC and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said they weren’t sure if they should invest in the race or how much help they’d be to Jones. May complained that Southerners on the DNC “beat our heads against the wall” when in need of help with voter outreach. “It’s self-defeating to ignore the South,” May said.

&gt;May canvassed black and rural voters herself beginning in August. She personally knocked on doors in rural precincts, because, as she said, “That’s really where the lack of information is so critical. People out in the rural area are not aware that elections are coming up and certainly don’t know who’s on the ballot.

&gt;In the end, the campaign relied on an influx of outside money to compensate for the attenuated state of local infrastructure. The DNC was of little help filling the volunteer gap.

Snip

&gt;The suddenly competitive nature of the Senate race has spurred activity which could lay the groundwork for greater engagement in the future. The Jones campaign said it did run the “most robust Get-Out-The-Vote program Alabama has seen in a generation,” having knocked on more than 100,000 doors and made 800,000 phone calls, according to a statement released by campaign spokesperson Sebastian Kitchen. There was at least one national group in Alabama before the election—the Black Progressive Action Coalition (BPAC), which sent canvassers to knock on doors throughout the state. Initially, BPAC delivered party-free Get Out the Vote literature, but last week they changed course and began directly supporting Doug Jones. Nonpartisan organization and grassroots groups like Faith in Action, Greater Birmingham Ministries, and Vote or Die ran nonpartisan voter turnout operations across the state

&gt;And African-American Democrats say they've hit on a playbook for 2018: Empower -- and trust -- local leaders, engage voters early and often, and provide resources to activists, particularly black women, who keep the effort going far beyond Election Day.

They just figured this out?

&gt;But Democrats see their win as part of a broader pattern. They say that a victory in Alabama was only possible because of voter enthusiasm, especially among the African-Americans and ***young people who form the bedrock of their party.***

&gt;They say similar patterns have been seen in other elections since Trump took office. 

If young people form the bed rock (Bernie won millenials minorities) of the party, then neolibs, move out of the way!

I am incredibly interested in applying to the Shopify Internship Option as I know that it would offer invaluable experience and help pay for school, but I had any questions for anyone who was in the program.

1. How many people are accepted into the Internship Option? 
2. Do you have opportunities to work on different kinds of projects across different streams of computer science (ie. cryptography vs data science)?
3. Is there any way for you to go abroad for a summer (SF for example, as there is a Shopify office there)?

7jsfmc,29,2017-12-14,First in a Thursday series: SoS - Hando Medo,kkentium,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/7jsfmc/first_in_a_thursday_series_sos_hando_medo/,"By zero amount of demand, I'm going to write a regular Thursday column here about restaurants in DC. Mainly to keep my writing skills up. But also to get them sweet sweet Internet karma points. jay kay not really.

SoS is a military term that stands for Shit on a Shingle, an endearing name grunts have for the ubiquitous dish that our grandparents all know and love as chipped beef on toast. I am not a veteran, just know a lot of them, so please don't sic Stolen Valor peoples on me. But SoS is what I'll call this column.

Let's get some ground rules out of the way here. DC has by all means become a ""dining town."" Finally. Last year alone, 800 ""restaurants"" opened up. The term restaurants also straight up includes places like Subway. But that's still a fuck load of gin joints. However, at least 400 restaurants closed last year. So while there's a ton of competition out there for your dining dollars, a lot of places are just not hacking it. And in my opinion, it's because they're just plain shitty. So, here's what I'll focus on:

1. I'm staying away from the trendy places that are trendy to hate on. Founding Farmers is top of that list. I fucking hate that place. But then again, everyone does.

2. These days, I am just going to assume the service is going to fucking suck. DC is too small and expensive a town to really have a true dining service workforce. So it's hard to hire good help and keep them. So you have to hire the kid who's trying to supplement their internship and really does not give two fucks about good service. I find I am less disappointed if I walk in and just expect the service to suck. Comes from being a Cubs fan for decades, that loser hope squeezed out of you mentality. Yeah, they won it all last year but that mentality doesn't just go away overnight.

3. I recognize the realities that some places have their purpose and you should not be there for either good food or service. You should only be at Lauriol Plaza because the weather is nice, you got off work early, and you want to get fucking wasted on frozen margaritas. You should only be at Ben's when you have friends from out of town visiting, you all got shitty wasted on U Street on a weekend night, and your friends won't stop begging you to go to Ben's and they're buyin'. There is a time and place for some shitty overrated joints.

So let's start with my inaugural topic: Hando Medo. It's a sushi joint on 14th St across the street from that new sweet sweet Popeye's and in fact occupies the old drive through Popeye's if you've been in DC long enough to remember that place. Their tagline: ""Our new restaurant introduces a fresh, new concept that will blow your mind.""

I already kinda used the best descriptions for this in a previous thread but that fresh, new concept is sushi bukkake. I'll explain later.

So, I am Korean American and I have been to Japan like over a dozen times. This does NOT make me some expert on sushi joints. All it probably means is I can use chopsticks much better than your average non-Asian diner. I do have some rules for picking a ""Japanese"" restaurant to dine at however. First, if you also serve some other kind of Asian food at your restaurant, fuck you. Shanghai Tokyo? You are top at my list. How about you concentrate on one food and get that right first? Since you are generally serving RAW FISH, I'd rather you concentrate on just that and make sure your diners don't get fucking e coli and/or parasites from bad/cheap fish because you're worrying if you have enough pad thai noodles in the back room. Second, everyone likes value. I'm no different. But if you offer $1 sushi happy hours, that's gonna be a hard no, dog. Sushi Tono, I am looking right at you.

So off to Hando Medo on a Friday night after attending an art gallery exhibit opening with the wife. Don't think I'm fancy... it was a Star Wars-themed art show. So wife wants to go and initially I'm like uuuuuuuuugh new restaurant, on 14th St, on a fucking Friday night. That's like the unholy trinity of fuck me in the asshole. But then I think, hey if it's crowded af, we can just go to Great Wall up the street. win win!

The decor in Hando Medo is super fucking modern Ikea fancy. And that's OK, plenty of places like that in Japan. There is zero line as well to get seats. So that begs the question up front: Are we just getting lucky? Is there no line because it's not good? What's wrong with the place? That Cubs loser mentality seeps back into the consciousness. Whatever, we don't have to wait and we get seats, I'm good with that.

The place is two large u-shaped sushi bars. There mighta been a single row of seating by where the main chef operates toward the back. We get our menus which are a single page. That can be good, shows they are focusing on a few things. The way it works is you pick the quantity and type of ""hand rolls"" you want and that's it. There are some sides and a bunch of drinks. Then there's a section of ""hand rolls"" separate from the main ""hand roll"" section. It's kinda confusing. Anyways you can choose minimum of 3 ""hand rolls"" or go full piggy and get 6 or anything in between. The place is kinda expensive.

I only bring up price because it brings up another pet peeve of mine for any med to high priced Asian restaurant. If you are a medium or up priced place and you are using disposable chopsticks? FUCK YOU. I don't fucking care if it's the cheapest of the cheap razing the Amazon rainforest thin chopsticks they give you with cup ramen or it's the slightly fancier thicker and longer chopsticks: if you give me disposables, fuck you. That is like going to Convival and getting plastic utensils. It is exactly the same. Well, you get disposables at Hando Medo. In fact, they are big on the food truck disposables. They serve you dipping sauces in the same disposable trays they use at Donburi in Adams Morgan and Maki Shop (RIP) in Logan Circle. Are you fucking kidding me? If you want to charge fine dining prices, you shell out for real plateware. Don't get me started on how shitty for the environment those things are too. 

There's a weird contradiction however. When they give you ginger and wasabi, it's on a real dish and the wasabi is smeared all Food Network fanci-like. Whatever, let's get to the food. So, these hand rolls... they're kinda like traditional rolls except they're not sliced into pieces... the seaweed is on the outside and it's only loosely wrapped. I really don't care if rice is on the outside or in. But really, the loosely wrapped roll concept? I don't get it. Why? Because I don't like giving myself a fucking facial, even if it's delicious sushi stuff. First half of the roll, you're good to go. Once you get to the second half, whatever content you picked for that roll, it's shooting out the ass end. And at the end, you're pretty much getting a sushi fish Spiderman on your chin. There is a reason the Japanese have designed their rolls and handrolls the way they do. I know the Japanese invented the bukkake genre, but they'd prefer it'd be involving semen, not sushi.

The hand rolls are also unceremoniously plopped onto a paper mat in front of you. That really creeped my wife out, and she works in the food industry. I'm Asian, so we're used to eating family-style and being uncouth and using our personal chopsticks to grab food off of communal plates. Or maybe my family are just a bunch of fucking barbarians. I dunno. The food taste and quality were pretty good. Wife felt the spicy tuna was too spicy for her and I gotta respect that. I also got the yuzu lemonade... which was just lemonade with a slice of yuzu fruit at the bottom which will clog the shit out of your straw.

It seems like a nice date place. Most of the folks in the joint were couples who were obviously on dates. If you are looking to take your date to a swanky looking place and want to show you are financially stable and can afford a place like this, Hando Medo is the place for you. Because let's be honest: when you are going on a date, the place/meal is just a precursor to what's really on your mind: are we going to hook up tonight?

If you're actually wanting a real meal, fuck this place. Walked out a lot poorer and still wanted to go to Popeye's after. Izakaya Seki is the equivalent of pricing for meal for two to this place, and a ton better. Between the presentation and format, you just paid 5x more for a Maki Shop or Buredo level meal. 

3/10 will not be going again.

7jsm49,1,2017-12-14,Advice about sailboat purchase and budgeting,firstmatedavy,liveaboard,https://www.reddit.com/r/liveaboard/comments/7jsm49/advice_about_sailboat_purchase_and_budgeting/,"My husband and I had planned to buy a boat after selling our house, but we found an underpriced boat in good condition, and we're considering going for it now. I'm really excited, but also nervous in a very general sort of way, so I wanted to do a brain dump and see what you all think. 

She's a production sailboat from the mid 90s, 35 feet long. My husband hasn't slept on a boat since he was a kid, and I never have. We've done ASA 101, toured a few similar boats (tire kicking with a broker), and read as much as we could. We scheduled ASA 103 and 104 in February partly for the liveaboard experience, but if we want this boat we'd probably have to close before that. Which makes me a little nervous, but I feel pretty good about having identified this type of boat as one we'd be happy living in.

So far, we've made an offer conditional on everything checking out when we go to see the boat in January (it's out of state). The broker says we can back out for any reason, and have our deposit (held in escrow) returned to us minus any expenses (haul out and such). We've seen the survey from the owner's purchase of the boat in 2015, and the broker told us which items have been fixed. So we'll be putting in the money for flights and a survey, based on having seen the 2015 survey, knowing what price these boats are usually listed at, and being extremely fond of this specific make and model. Is this roughly the right way to approach a long distance boat purchase? 

She's in the south and we're in the north, so I'm figuring that acquisition costs will be airfare, survey, haul out, demasting, shipping over land, and a few months of yard fees. We have savings, but not enough to buy the boat outright while keeping a good savings margin, so we're considering getting a loan for about half down and paying it off  when our house sells. 

Winter liveaboard doesn't seem to be a thing in our location, so we'd haul out and rent an apartment for about 6 months. (The sailing season is April to October.) My past experience with finding a short term rental was a real pain, but I was an intern and couldn't afford anything but the cheapest; being able to pay a little extra and get a shorter lease will probably help.

I'm estimating summer expenses as marina fees (I have a quote for a slip + haul out and winter storage), insurance, plus 10% of the price this sort of boat normally sells for. I'll also plan to potentially spend more than in a normal year, since we might need to do some outfitting. Does this sound about right?

Thanks for reading my ramblings."
7jsrku,13,2017-12-14,(US/FL) Obamacare is asking for documentation to support my annual income estimate... but I have none?,rfilmyer,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7jsrku/usfl_obamacare_is_asking_for_documentation_to/,"Hey all,

I'm a full-time grad student who has to get health insurance through the marketplace. I'm not expecting to work this year, except for a summer internship, and summer internships in my field usually will net around $20-24k for a summer.

So when I applied for insurance through the marketplace this year, I put my anticipated annual income at $24,000, but I don't have an offer letter yet, I can't document it.

Now I got a letter from HHS asking me for documentation for this number... but I have none. In fact, I don't have *any* income right now! I put a realistic estimate for my income, rather than what I could show with any sort of documentation.

I have money saved up for school, so if I have to get my tax credit when I file, that's fine. But I also take expensive prescription medication, and I signed up for a Silver plan because I was told that I would get a lowered deductible. Is *that* still the case, or did I just fuck myself for a year?"
7jtd6n,3,2017-12-14,I just screwed my first coding interview,Limpuls,interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/7jtd6n/i_just_screwed_my_first_coding_interview/,"I'm currently a student looking for internship and had couple of interviews on phone or skype. They all were first interviews in my life and most of them just had technical questions, but no coding challenge included. Today in the evening I had another one and I wasn't prepared for it at all. To be honest, I was so busy that I came back home 5min before skype call and had totally forgot about it. I quickly jumped into a nice shirt and answered the call with a huge mess on my computer. After 5min they told me to do a simple coding test and I got totally freaked out, because I didn't see it coming. 

I was very nervous and anxious and when I'm anxious I can't focus or think clearly. I couldn't even read and understand the assignment I was reading. At one point I wanted to turn my computer off and just finish it all. But decided to go with it and just see how it goes for personal experience reasons. Like I said, I was unprepared, I couldn't find my editor, nodejs wasn't working in the terminal, browser not loading and very slow. Like first 7-10 minutes they had to stick around to see how I set things up to work when I finally started writing the code.

The code challange was to write a simple code to check whether the year is leap or not. I finally did it and I made it work quickly after all these technical problems, but I think it was too late and I performed really poorly showing them how unprepared I was and didn't take this interview seriously. After making it work in the seconds, they talked with me for couple more minutes, asked some stuff about me and told me that they will contact me tomorrow by the evening. 

That internship is really amazing and is life changing for me. I feel like my anxiety and ignorance really messed it one up. However this was one of my first coding interviews and I'm pretty new at tech interviews. 

Do you think I have any chance of hearing back from them or just forget about it and move on. Did I just overeact and they will understand my technical issues I had and choose to ignore them by just taking note that I solved the problem itself quickly after? "

I'm a 20 year old guy, if that helps with the recommendations. 

I'm looking to sublet a room, my budget is around $1000/month. 

Ideally, I'd like to find somewhere that has a lower east side-y feel to it, where you can walk to a lot of restaurants or coffee shops easily, and people are actually outside enjoying the weather and walking around. However, I'm pretty sure that type of vibe doesn't really exist in the same way as it does in new york. I will have a car though, so driving to somewhere that sort of fits that description isn't a problem. 

Finally, my job is located at 9689 Towne Centre Dr, San Diego, CA 92121, so any advice regarding which of these places makes sense when taking commute into account would also be appreciated. 

The four places I've narrowed down to are: 

6th ave near Balboa park, $950 a month. (Downtown I guess?)

49th st. right above El Cajon Blvd for $950 a month (Talmadge?)

Sunline Ave, for $800 a month, I think this is close to North Clairemont

Orien Ave, for $950 a month, in La Mesa.

I'm looking for a RP where instead of being the victim that gets corrupted by some creep, I probably want it just as much, if not more than you do. I'll probably RP as a teen (13-16 depending), and would like you to be around 40-45. I am a sucker for sugar daddy fantasies, and getting expensive gifts and things like that, and hopefully some good sex as well! I've got a few role ideas below, I hope you like some of them!

I have a few role and age ideas, between 12 and 16, depending on what you like! Am I a 12-year-old goody two shoes catholic school girl, who knows a thing or two that she shouldn't? Am I a Korean business man's 13-year-old daughter who is far too spoiled and unsupervised for her own good? 14-year-old Lebanese girl, who went on Ashley Madison behind her parents' back? A 15-year-old aspiring Instagram thot from Brazil, doing, ahem... ""photoshoots"" on bored CEOs' yachts? Or maybe a 16-year-old Londoner, who's stockings and tight little pencil skirts definitely didn't have anything to do with her getting that prestigious black female empowerment internship, or something?

You decide! As long as there's a big, white cock, with lots of cum inside (and money behind it) that I'm allowed to suck on, I'm happy :)

My kinks and limits are in my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/yFXEEfy.png), and for other things I enjoy are size differences (me being petite, and you being tall and muscular), sexy/slutty outfits for me, men in suits, and I don't like kissing or being eaten out.

You should know that I'm a total size queen, both in the conventional sense of the word, and with replies. Rather than being the first to finish, put some effort into what you're writing.

Maybe you want me to lactate for you and every day I bring you lunch in you office and then you feed from my tits. Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, and I'm not a toy, just the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I'm not looking for a novelist, but someone who wants to get into these characters and find fun ways to explore them as well as write some fun sexy scenes. Lets figure out how I got to be your mistress, what the relationship is.

Kinks: BDSM, spanking, anal, traditional gender roles, cheating, lactation play, older men

Limits: Humiliation, toilet play, feet, violence, bimbofication, name calling

Just live your life and you'll see him again sometime.""  It was really painful but there was nothing I could do.

Later I was in an elevator, and a really hot intern came in.  So I started talking to him, and he smiled broadly at me.  He was wearing a tie.  I was about to ask him to lunch sometime when I thought: ""You know what, you can't just go around asking every guy to lunch.""  And he got out of the elevator and I felt bad again.

i think I have terrible FOMO and can basically not resist investigating guys I find attractive.  And for better or worse attractive guys are everywhere.

It's just a matter of not enough time to bother with all of them.

How do I get over this feeling that I'm missing out?

7jvp9d,3,2017-12-14,Going to be alone in my parents house for a month with no social contact. What can I do to fight against relapse.,KeybladesChosen,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7jvp9d/going_to_be_alone_in_my_parents_house_for_a_month/,"I wish I had friends to meet with or events to go to but I dont have anything in my life. I need to make sure I don't break my streak and also dont fall back into my other bad habits like self harm and gaming. 
I'm currently in college struggling with mediocre grades, no friends, no hobbies, no love life etc.. Most of this is due to low self esteem and confidence as a result of years of untreated depression. 

Thanks to therapy and noFap I'm starting to feel more like a full person and want to change my lazy and avoidance prone ways. I'm making an effort this last week of class to be more social and risk taking but soon I'm going back to be with my parents for a month of winter break where I won't have any kind of social contact with people my age. Its basically going to be me alone in my room all day since its too damn cold out here to go out and do anything and I don't have a car. I just need to survive and be diligent about applying for internships for a few weeks and not fall back into a black hole of suicidality and self hatred like I have the last few times I went home. I have a decent relationship with my parents but they are getting old and theres not much we can bond over anymore.

 I tend to have breakdowns around the holidays when I see or think about how much fun everyone else is having with their new years parties and significant others and whatnot but I really want this year to be different. I'm not in a position to have friends or a relationship right now and I need to accept that.

 I cant let my loneliness distract me from the important task of applying to internships because all of my career plans depend on me getting one this summer and if I don't I will be completely screwed for years to come. This might be the most important month of my life but I'm terrified of the ways my mind will try and torture me when I'm by myself for so long. 

What do I do to fight off the paralyzing sadness and bitterness of holiday depression when I have no one to turn to for help? I know I'm going to want to relapse thinking of all the love and happiness ive missed out on. "
7jvs2v,1,2017-12-14,"21 [M4A] For F: Older female/Younger male, Tied up, Worshipping the fertility Gods, Rule 34. For M: Looking for straight guys. (Works in progress)",out_and_kinda_about,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7jvs2v/21_m4a_for_f_older_femaleyounger_male_tied_up/,"Working on a few new prompts. These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

_____________________________________________________________

For F: A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.

___________________________________________________________

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I don't have an exact idea here but I am a dom top here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

7jvx72,2,2017-12-14,(M4F) Looking For Female Celebrity Characters!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7jvx72/m4f_looking_for_female_celebrity_characters/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."

I have filled in the form below, and just wanted to say thanks in advance for all your awesome advice. 

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Looking to spend between $1000-1500 CAD. Don't mind ordering from anywhere, just looking to stay within budget. 

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I would say that specs for price are most important, but I would hope for battery life of about 6 hours minimum. 

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Not really important, although I would be travelling with it a lot. Not a driving factor.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
I have always been a fan of Windows, but if you can find a soild  Mac, I may consider. 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
Preferred 15"" plus/minus 1.5""

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
No gaming for sure; CAD for sure, most Microsoft Office products, and the just casual web browsers and Spotify.  

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

7jx2ne,6,2017-12-14,I'm not capable of loving myself,Vnslover,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7jx2ne/im_not_capable_of_loving_myself/,"I'm almost 27 and will graduate next semester with a computer engineering degree. I hate what I'm studying, the only reason I chose this is because there isn't really anything I'm interested in studying, I always liked computers and electronics in general but soon enough the curriculum got very boring and I despise programming so much. I had a internship over the summer with a good company, I think I got pretty lucky and I had to move to another state to work on it. I did a good job I think. 

I'm supposed to start applying for jobs, and I truly hate this process, I get extremely stressed out and I hate job interviews. I've been living with severe depression and anxiety my entire life. I've been abused by my father, also both my parents have depression in their family. I never loved myself, and I don't see a reason to. I always feel self conscious and have spent my entire life sacrificing all my decisions to other people. 

I found some great friends in school, I felt better for a bit. But out of no where my best buddy started hating me this semester, I haven't done anything wrong with him, like I said I always put others before myself and I would never even dare wrong anybody. So pretty much this semester had been a nightmare for me. 

Overall, I have no interest in computer engineering, and the fact that I can make my own choices after I graduate scares the shit out of me. I don't even know what I want to do. I'm not happy at all, and my whole life I've been just forcing myself just to survive. I don't even want to get married because I can almost never put my trust in anybody. I know many people in school but I always feel like I'm a bother to them so I don't take the friendship to the next level. My GPA is shit because I barely study and I can never concentrate. 

I'm attractive but I've never had a relationship, I over think every single detail and before I make any move I try to calculate the whole scenario in my mind, which makes things extremely tough. I do think about suicide but I know I wouldn't do it mainly because I don't want to hurt my family. 

Pretty much at this point i just feel lost and I have only fear in my mind concerned about the future. I don't know how other people can enjoy life as I just spent my life living in constant fear and worry. 

I did try therapy and medication, neither did work. The meds decreased my anxiety a bit but overall I couldn't have normal thoughts. Just putting all of this out there. Sorry to waste your time."

I am recently 25. I graduated undergraduate last summer. I began school at 20-21 because I worked to avoid a lot of student debt. I graduated from a decent institution with a 3.6+ and a decent LSAT - didnt get into my only law school. I only applied to one competitive school knowing it would be fine as I am a bit burnt out. I ended up going on a four month internship in the middle east.

Since I finished that I feel really out of touch with the hard working person I was. I feel like I've become very reactionary, waiting on things like law school and grad school to get jazzed up about my life again. I worked very hard throughout school, studied political science and history, and rowed for the varsity team. However, being that I'm a bit older than most graduates and other insecurities I can't help feeling like I have made so many mistakes. I have so many regrets about the way I've dealt with being gay, and being a person in the world. I have never had a relationship. I know I'm attractive but I feel so distant from other people, even during sex. I don't know why I havent found a job. I just don't know how to put one foot in front of the other. (I don't really have a dad so perhaps this is through some reactionary defensiveness - my 1st year girl-hook-up tried to tell me that once.) I'm not steely and transactional about sex like some kid who's too into Patrick Bateman - I just find gay men (or those that I have had the chance to be with) to be excessively complicated or really just... contrived...?? I don't fetishize straight men, because in my experience they arent that great in bed - I just want a guy who is comfortable not being a cartoon. 

Men (and women) of Askgaybros, what did you do after you graduated? Were you depressed? How did you begin to build a life after institutions? 

Reading back over this I realize how muddled a lot of my feelings are. This is somewhat of a rant and I apologize. I'm submitting it anyway because maybe someone can throw cold water on my face or something. Am I too old to seize my life? How do I break my reactionary bullshit?

I'm looking for a RP where instead of being the victim that gets corrupted by some creep, I probably want it just as much, if not more than you do. I'll probably RP as a teen (12-16 depending), and would like you to be around 40-45. I am a sucker for sugar daddy fantasies, and getting expensive gifts and things like that, and hopefully some good sex as well! I've got a few role ideas below, I hope you like some of them!

I have a few role and age ideas, between 12 and 16, depending on what you like! Am I a 12-year-old goody two shoes catholic school girl, who knows a thing or two that she shouldn't? Am I a Korean business man's 13-year-old daughter who is far too spoiled and unsupervised for her own good? 14-year-old Lebanese girl, who went on Ashley Madison behind her parents' back? A 15-year-old aspiring Instagram thot from Brazil, doing, ahem... ""photoshoots"" on bored CEOs' yachts? Or maybe a 16-year-old Londoner, who's stockings and tight little pencil skirts definitely didn't have anything to do with her getting that prestigious black female empowerment internship, or something?

You decide! As long as there's a big, white cock, with lots of cum inside (and money behind it) that I'm allowed to suck on, I'm happy :)

My kinks and limits are in my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/yFXEEfy.png), and for other things I enjoy are size differences (me being petite, and you being tall and muscular), sexy/slutty outfits for me, men in suits, and I don't like kissing or being eaten out.

You should know that I'm a total size queen, both in the conventional sense of the word, and with replies. Rather than being the first to finish, put some effort into what you're writing. I'd like to hear a description of your character, you mentioning rubber ducks, as well as some ideas for the RP!

Also, since I know that some of you are going to rush this, I'm just going to say that I would prefer you to take your time with a good reply, rather than rush a crappy one. If I like your writing and ideas though, we can talk here, or on Discord or Chatzy if you prefer :)"
7jy1do,45,2017-12-15,Me [27M] left by fiancee [28F] for one of my co-workers. How do go on?,JustATempAccount18,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7jy1do/me_27m_left_by_fiancee_28f_for_one_of_my/,"Wall of text inc. TL;DR at end.

So I have been with my fiancee since just out of high school, a total of over nine years. Se has been my only relationship longer than 6 months. We lost our virginity to each other and have been happy together even through long distance due to college and internships. 

Last week she left me and now she is staying with one of my best friends and co-workers that is in love with her.

She finished school and became a teacher a little over a year ago. It was a lot harder on her than expected. Her principal treated her terribly and consistently made her feel inadequate, but this school year it ramped up to a new level. After a few months of this, I offered for her to quit and I would take care of us financially until we could figure something out rather than see her so miserable. She would come home crying almost every day and I felt helpless not being able to do anything about it. Me telling her she was a great teacher didn't matter when at work she was so distressed. She refused to quit, so I suggested she get on antidepressants because she was in a bad place and she agreed to it.

Our relationship got rough when she started school and the depression made it worse. She was always stressed and sad, her sex drive completely disappeared, and she stopped showing me affection at all. Anything school related took priority over me. I let her know I was feeling neglected but it only made things worse so I decided to tough it out and just try to keep her happy. I knew if I could last until the end of the school year, she could find a new school and hopefully we could return to normalcy.

A few months ago, she started telling one of our friends about her woes at work as well. He is on my team at work and the three of us have been friends for many years now. Once a week, I have a game night with my friends and that isn't one of her hobbies so she would hang out and watch movies with this co-worker and some of our other friends on that same night . . . but eventually these nights became more when other friends stopped going and it became just the two of them. It was a bit weird for me, but she had fun and I trusted them both completely so I didn't do anything to stop it.

She started pouring out everything to him and confided in him about work and eventually about the parts of our relationship that made her unhappy. Her biggest problem with me when it came to her depression is that I am a problem solver by nature. I would hear about these terrible things she was going through and I would look for a way to make it better, to make that pain go away, but she was looking for someone to provide sympathy and nothing else. I struggled with this and my co-worker did not. He was a shoulder to cry on and fell in love with her. Together they decided she should leave me and move in with him.

Last week she finally did it. Mostly because I couldn't provide the emotional support she needed. I knew she had been hurting, I mean she was depressed, and she had told me it bothered her than I never just listened, I always tried to fix things, but I didn't know it was so bad she would leave me. I can't pretend I didn't do anything wrong, but I always tried my best to make her happy and keep her spirits high, but sometimes that bothered her as well because she felt I was faking happiness and trying to hide the true situation. There was no warning from her or my friend that thinks were so bad. No communication at all. She closed me out and told him everything, and why would he tell me when our relationship failing is in his best interest?

Now I am lost. When she left she went to stay with him instead of her best friend who has a spare bedroom and offered it up to her. He has told me he loves her and that he hopes we can stay friends if they become more than friends, which he is hoping happens. She said she felt guilty because she had cheated on me emotionally, that she ended things because we were both unhappy and deserved others who could make us happy . . . but I wasn't willing to give up on a decade of love because of one span of difficultly. I suffered, but sometimes that is how love is in my mind. And she turned to someone else, someone I trusted, and developed strong enough feelings that she is with him now. 

I have never felt so betrayed.

I feel like I have lost everything. My fiancee is gone, work is ruined because if I go there I am going to see him and I don't know if I can hold my composure. I have talked to my boss and we are trying to find a solution but it seems nearly impossible. If either of them has just told me about the problem I would have done whatever was necessary to make her happy and make it work, but they didn't. I'm not sure she even wanted to make it work anymore. I feel like he just kind of came in and stole my fiancee away when she was at her weakest. Her personality changed when she got on the antidepressants, her moods and attitude were altered, and that is when all of this went down. It almost feels exploitative of the situation. 

We had our struggles in the last year, tough ones, but I wasn't ready to give up. I still loved her so incredibly much and it is destroying me that she is gone. Am I expected to forgive this co-worker and act civil? Because that seems to be what is expected. Should I be mad that my friends aren't shunning him for what he did, or were his actions justified? He did help her through some of her issues, but in my mind that is my job as her fiancee and if she was upset she needed to communicate that information to me, not turn to someone else. The lack of communication with me, the fact that they just made a decision without giving me a chance to try to make it work, is what hurts so bad now. 

Mostly just needed to vent, but also seeking advice as to how I can move on with my life from this point? Thanks for reading.

---

TL;DR - Fiancee of nearly a decade became strongly emotionally involved with one of my co-workers who later admitted to being in love with her. She left me and is staying with him now.

I am an International Student who recently graduated from UBC with bachelor degree of combined major in cpsc &amp; stats. However, the sad thing is that I didn't do co-op during university (I regret now) , which makes me hard to find a full-time job. I even planned to start as internship but companies prefer current undergraduate students. I feel worried and anxious now. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

I am needing some help as to whether my feelings are valid or if I need a reality check. 

My boyfriend started a new job/internship (he just got the job) 3 months ago. This is a big agency where there is free booze on tap every Friday and the bosses start handing out beers from 3 p.m. and often go til late. 

My boyfriend since working in this job has gone out til 1am (best case scenario) to 4am every Friday night and I have not seen him - unless he comes to my house wasted to sleep. After the first month or so of this we started to fight, as we often used to make plans together on Friday nights which would often still be to socialise and drink...but TOGETHER. 

A big blow-up happened when I had asked him prior to the Friday (in order to make sure he wasn't wasted and out with work friends til late) if we could do something together. After not hearing from him until 8.30 p.m. I rang and he was at a bar with his work friends. This upset me a lot and I told him. We fought over this. 

Since then he has gone out every Friday til late with them and every weekend I have gotten upset. He has said because he has been on internship he has been trying to make a good first impression/has little money to spend on partying and the bosses pay for everything. 

I am upset because while I still expect him to party with his work friends and I think that is fun and healthy, I would like him every once and a while to spend a Friday with me. This has been reiterated and then every Friday we are in the same situation. I get upset and we fight. He apologises then the same thing happens again. This week he has said now he has gotten the job and has income this will stop. 

I now get so anxious every Friday and mad straight away. We don't live together so our time is planned to an extent. Am I being controlling over this, or do I have a right to be upset? I still want us both to be able to hang out with our friends. But I feel like every Friday I am ready to explode because he hasn't hung out with me once in about 3 months and if he had just given me one or two weekends in that time I would be fine with him doing whatever.

  **tl;dr**: Should I let go of my boyfriend partying with his work friends til late every Friday as I am being controlling? Or do I have a right to be upset?"

SoftCap of $ 125,000 has been reached within just a few hours from the start of the campaign, how states the information available on the official website of the project. This result was made possible due to the competent preparation of the project team, the availability of powerful competitive advantages of the cryptobank, as well as the interest of potential partners.

A social decentralized cryptobank will allow its clients to instantly exchange financial resources, being anywhere in the world and on terms determined by users themselves. Acting as a conductor and mentor - Datarius Cryptobank plans to minimize commissions and provide users with the opportunity to independently determine the necessary additional services for each transaction, offering full support.

Especial attention is paid to P2P-lending: Datarius clients will be able to quickly receive and issue loans, and  the blockchain would reliably store the  information about the parties and the results of transactions, thereby complementing the algorithms of credit scoring. The fulfillment of loan obligations will be monitored through smart contracts.

The work of Datarius assumes the use of blockchain technology, the integration of social functions - trust limits and trust management, hyper-collaboration, the integration of instant messaging systems and the development of algorithms using AI. Each user will have the opportunity to create an individual set of services or applications using the developed ""constructor"". Automation of closing orders on the basis of unique algorithms will significantly speed up the process of obtaining or granting loans on the most suitable conditions for each particular user.

It is also worth to note the exclusive opportunity, which is fundamental in the ecosystem of the Datarius Cryptobank - the opportunity for each user to earn with the bank, creating new financial, information products or taking part in the formation of the credit rating of other participants. Datarius declares an annual distribution of up to 65% of the total project profit between active user partners. Affiliate educational programs and internships with the major players of the financial market without leaving the personal cabinet of the user, open truly unlimited opportunities for each user.

In the present time, the Datarius team is in the active negotiating process with more than 50 major players in the fintech market, as well as with a number of state institutions in South America and Europe.

Today, Datarius Cryptobank declares the fullest functionality and the most extensive opportunities. Everyone interested can join the ecosystem and get the keys to the personal cabinet. The pre-ITO stage will last, as expected, until 12:12 UTC on 31.12.2017. Each participant of this stage will receive an exclusive bonus of 35%.

The main round is scheduled for February 2018. You can follow the progress of pre-ITO in real time  on the official website of the cryptobank."

7k08d1,33,2017-12-15,What I think Funcom needs to change,sturmhaven,SecretWorldLegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretWorldLegends/comments/7k08d1/what_i_think_funcom_needs_to_change/,"I really dislike many of the decisions that have been made by Funcom (starting with the reticle-based targeting, the initial bait-and-switch on Patron status, how gear progression was implemented, and now the nerf to Kaidan keys).  However, I think there’s been enough commentary on those.  I tried to think of what needed to be changed, and I’ve listed these below. My apologies for the length of the post.  

######TL;DR: Funcom, change how you value your customers' experience; and make money from this change in perspective.


#####A) Change the Funcom mentality. It's about the customer value experience.
The game is a really cool Starbucks that has a Cthulhu-Lovecraftianesque atmosphere.  People come to it because of that.  The products it offers are mini-games that you can do alone, or better served in a group.  I would focus less on fancy products, but instead on making quality products that enhance the specific SWL customer experience, and make customers feel like they are getting VALUE for their time and money.

1. Cthulhu Starbucks is more fun if you have a bunch of people (aka the community) that you hang out with.  They are also more likely to regularly hang out if they have or can easily find like-minded friends.
2. Having poorly implemented game mechanics is like having bad coffee, tea, bad customer service, or the bathroom being dirty.  Some people will put up with it, others won’t.  But have enough of it and no matter how awesome the place looks, people will up and leave.  (Especially if they don’t have any friends there anyways.)  
3. The finance/marketing guys need to align to this way of thinking.  Instead of “how do we squeeze more money out of these guys while paying for the rent and cost of everything”.  Rather, think: “how can we have this great atmosphere and make the customers happy to stay here and pay our rents?”


#####B)	Based on the mentality above, I would change the following:
#####B1. Focus on delivering quality, well tested products.  Speaking of quality, I would:
1. Implement a consistent testing process.  Have a standard (and growing) set of test scenarios to run, and data files to check.  I say this because it seems every patch breaks something that it shouldn’t, and there are bugs that exist where there used to be none, and sometimes bugs disappear and reappear.  This is like having crappy coffee served in our mythical Cthulhu Starbucks.  
2. Simplify the design process.  I say this because you are saying that the adds in Recursia HR 5-9 took so long to fix because you had to track down the way their HP was calculated? I mean, really? You mean, it’s not in some table somewhere some intern can check? Why does it have to be more complicated than that?  I could list other examples, but I won’t.
3. Hire some interns or open up Play Test Server (PTS).  Don’t just leave it to the interns / players to figure out what to test, have a specific framework for what needs basic testing, and what needs enhanced testing based on the current build rollout.  Provide a structure both internally and externally to process test results.
4. Ignore or de-prioritise eliminating bugs you think are “workarounds” until you have thoroughly tested game mechanics and design of related gameplay.

#####B2. Take out the Kaidan container keys nerf.  Add the chance for additional dungeon / lair / raid keys in lootboxes.  
Brainstorm internally and see if you can come up with more lootbox types that enhance the player experience in different ways.  So, have a base lootbox template, then others that give different items, such as more cosmetics or weapon skins, or other weapons or talismans, or god knows what else.  Get creative while keeping the basic mentality above into consideration.  Make all types of lootboxes available in Agartha as they become available in game.  Your population base isn’t big enough to warrant hoarding them or making them limited editions.  (Random note: did you know that your most active game time is European prime evening time? )

#####B3. Have more subscription options.
Reduce the price of the current Patron subscription to $5/month and create a new Patron subscription that opens up the game play and rewards to make $15/month worth it. 

#####B4. Brainstorm ideas to make the community become more involved with each other and with the game.  Right now, I can’t imagine how new players would stick.  
It’s very hard to find cabals, find global helpful channels, and in general find other like-minded players.  The tools are there, but they are clunky and not very helpful.  Unlike TSW, you can’t even look at cabal rosters.  You might not even have to do anything; just open up the API’s to the data so that cabals or others can have access to the information to make their own websites.  Provide better advertisement for player-created content or communities.  This is not pointless.  This is helping with player retention and also players spending money to enhance the way they enjoy Cthulhu Starbucks.  A long-shot strategy: involve the player base in creating sellable products.  

#####B5. Cancel the “agent” system.  
You have so much crap to deal with that adding a new function is pointless.  It will not improve the player experience, and if implemented with as many bugs and design issues as current content (dungeons, I’m looking at you), you will not have people pay for whatever payment model you’ve tacked on to it.  We will just complain about another crappy game experience.

#####B6. Get better at mining customer data. 
Let it better help with design decisions before you implement changes.  But also look at impacts from a systems-based perspective.  You nerfed Kaidan keys because you saw them eating at your profits; but at the same time you didn’t add any new buffs for those who solo the game (or are forced to solo the game, see point above about communities).  

#####Summary:
It’s frustrating to see Funcom keep making these decisions that seem so far removed from what I consider fun in playing the game.  I understand making money is the motivating factor, so my suggestions do try to address this as well. I have other ideas, but this post is far too long."

I was doing an internship and we would spend the evenings together for hours talking about things. It was magical. 4 months in I was able to afford to go and see my girlfriend in person. We had an amazing time together. 

3 weeks later I had a phonecall from my girlfriend. she wanted to call things off and she had decided to quit her job at the supermarket to become a full time care worker while studying her Masters in order to do this she told me she would need to cut me out of her life. I respected her decision and we became good friends. 

About a month later my now ex girlfriend reached out to me. She started to flirt with me back and fourth and things seemed to be going places. Then all of a sudden she would dip into low moods. I would ask what was going on but she said she was unable to tell me due to her work. One day she spills out she had just had to provide support to a dying patient in there last hours. When these kind of incidents occur I would take a step back and wait for her to reach back out to me and this leads me onto my current situation.


We are now sending eachother kisses, things seem to be esclating, When we flirt she says she isn't good enough for me and I deserve better, I try to reassure her that shes perfect and everything I've always wanted in a girlfriend. She says she wants to meet up however when I provided dates for us to meet she got aggressive and rude towards me saying that by me providing her dates I was applying pressure to her as her life is so busy now. She has gone out with friends, she has made time for others. She just had 3 days off word and has promised to meet up with me a week later but after a few days she came back and said she couldn't take any more time off work. I explained I was providing the dates as a reference so if she wanted to see me she could. Now shes talking to me less and I'm wondering what I've done wrong. Should I have not said anything? Have I caused issues by simply asking to meet up after not seeing her for 4 months? Am I in the wrong?

I look forward to hearing from your responses /r/relationships and I thank you for your support.

**UPDATE**: After discussing things with her and saying it would be really good to meet up I was told it was best if we broke up. She said she would like to focus on her Career and having a relationship isn't going to help. I did what I could, I tried to salvage things but it wasn't meant to be.

I'm looking for a RP where instead of being the victim that gets corrupted by some creep, I probably want it just as much, if not more than you do. I'll probably RP as a teen (12-16 depending), and would like you to be around 40-45. I am a sucker for sugar daddy fantasies, and getting expensive gifts and things like that, and hopefully some good sex as well! I've got a few role ideas below, I hope you like some of them!

I have a few role and age ideas, between 12 and 16, depending on what you like! Am I a 12-year-old goody two shoes catholic school girl, who knows a thing or two that she shouldn't? Am I a Korean business man's 13-year-old daughter who is far too spoiled and unsupervised for her own good? 14-year-old Lebanese girl, who went on Ashley Madison behind her parents' back? A 15-year-old aspiring Instagram thot from Brazil, doing, ahem... ""photoshoots"" on bored CEOs' yachts? Or maybe a 16-year-old Londoner, who's stockings and tight little pencil skirts definitely didn't have anything to do with her getting that prestigious black female empowerment internship, or something?

You decide! As long as there's a big, white cock, with lots of cum inside (and money behind it) that I'm allowed to suck on, I'm happy :)

My kinks and limits are in my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/yFXEEfy.png), and for other things I enjoy are size differences (me being petite, and you being tall and muscular), sexy/slutty outfits for me, men in suits, and I don't like kissing or being eaten out.

You should know that I'm a total size queen, both in the conventional sense of the word, and with replies. Rather than being the first to finish, put some effort into what you're writing. I'd like to hear a description of your character, you mentioning rubber ducks, as well as some ideas for the RP!

Also, since I know that some of you are going to rush this, I'm just going to say that I would prefer you to take your time with a good reply, rather than rush a crappy one. If I like your writing and ideas though, we can talk here, or on Discord or Chatzy if you prefer :)"

They started over the summer when I was convinced that I had autism. I have literally none of the symptoms and am pretty successful socially despite my OCD, but the thought really scared me for whatever reason. I would use any break at my internship to research symptoms and to take online diagnostic tests to make sure that I still didn't have it, but they would only reassure me for an hour or so at best. I know that there's nothing wrong with having autism, and I really don't know why I had this fear. It's totally irrational, and I feel quite guilty about it still. 

The obsessions have morphed over the past few months. There was a time when I was terrified that I had schizophrenia because of my OCD symptoms, and then it moved into having personality disorders. Right now I'm terrified that I'm a narcissist and am unwittingly hurting the people around me for my own gain. I constantly repeat conversations and actions in my head to make sure that I don't have NPD, and the thing that scares me the most is that I'm thinking this much about myself and my actions. I feel like that's really narcissistic. I think the big fear is turning out like my father who has NPD. I don't want to hurt my family with my actions and I want to be a better father than he was (which sounds quite narcissistic when I phrase it like that). I'm in the middle of finals right now, and the constant worry is really taking away from my ability to study.

Sorry for the rambling. I just wanted to get that down somewhere. 

Has anyone else had similar thoughts to these? How have you dealt with them?"

I was devastated because I really loved him, but he told me that while he really admires and respects me and thinks I’m the most incredible and big-hearted woman he ever met, he lost his attraction for me a few months ago and couldn’t get it back, and that he did not fall in love with me physically. 

He broke up with me with tears in his eyes, and kept wanting to go for one last cuddle, kept hugging me and kissing me on the forehead while I cried. He said I deserve someone who genuinely loves me and that as hard as he tried because I’m so worth it, he couldn’t fall in love with me physically.

Anyways I spent two weeks trying to get over him, literally crying every time I thought about him and what I had lost. He is a gentleman, a wonderful man, with a calm disposition and a huge heart, and I am in love with his incredible mind and also his goodness, and these two things led me to fall in love with his looks too. He’s good in bed and seemed to enjoy it. For him, he was initially attracted to my looks and the more I got attached, the less attracted to me he was (I’m basing this off of his perceived timeline of losing attraction). I wasn’t that clingy - I wanted him to message me at least once a day but he’s not much of a texter, so as much as I insisted I didn’t need it he did it even though it felt like a chore. He treated me amazingly and is exactly the kind of man I want to marry. In fact I can’t even imagine a man who is more suited for me than him. 

Some background on him - he was in the army for several years and finished a degree. He’s doing a masters program near his parents’ house and lives with them. He is in a prestigious unpaid internship. He’s kind of embarrassed at how “behind” he is in life and how he still depends on his parents who pay for everything for him. I on the other hand have a full time job i excel in, in a highly prestigious field, at one of the most prestigious employers in that field. I am 100% financially independent, and live in an apartment that I share with roommates. A friend of mine suggested that the fact that he’s not ready to settle down while I am might have something to do with why he couldn’t surrender his heart to me. 

Anyways I took his word for it that he didn’t love me although his body language always seemed to imply otherwise. He was always touching me, something he explained as feeling affection but not attraction or love. 

Two weeks after the breakup I ran into him at a singles event. His face lit up like a Christmas tree and he gave me a long and sensual hug. He even took some time to smell my neck (interesting behaviour for someone who claims not to be attracted to me at all) and kissed my cheek. We spoke for awhile and then at the end of the event, while I was talking to two other guys, he approaches me, gives me another long sensual hug, and said “bye, sweetheart” followed by another kiss on the cheek. Again, odd behaviour for someone who claims to like me only as a platonic friend. The two guys looked at each other like wtf is he her boyfriend?? He chatted up another girl yet his body language was nowhere near as intimate and touchy as he was with me. 

He doesn’t text me. He apparently sings my praises to any mutual friend who asks about the breakup, and one even said it’s kind of weird how much he admires you, he’s crazy about you. 

I honestly have no idea how to explain this behaviour. It’s just so incredibly odd. 

TL;DR: ran into my ex at a singles event and he was very touchy feely, hugged me for a long time, smelled my neck, and called me sweetheart in such a way that many around us thought he was my boyfriend. Is this normal behaviour for a man who claims to not be attracted to me and why?"
7k32m7,1,2017-12-15,"Need to just hate on college, depression, and share my life (really long)",coconut-fred,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7k32m7/need_to_just_hate_on_college_depression_and_share/,"I'm 22, turning 23 in a month and feel like ranting about college, jobs, life, etc. First off, a couple months before my 19th birthday I began a service mission for my church (LDS if you're wondering). I served in Guayquil Ecuador for 2 years. I returned in the fall of 2015 and began school in the spring of 2016. At this point I was debating what major to go in to. I was a self-taught programmer in high school and had declared my major as computer science. I debated whether to go to med school and be a doctor, to join the air force or marines, go into aerospace engineering, or go in to business. I ended up switching my major to Business Administration and Entrepreneurship. 


My thinking was that most careers have a salary cap. For example being an engineer your salary could range from 80,000 to 150,000, but all depending on experience and how good you are etc. I saw that doctors were highly paid, but required lots of school (which I can't stand now), lots of money, and pay could go anywhere up to 400,000 if you're in the right field. Higher if you're the top in your field. Ok, so doctors are limited too. 

The reason I chose Business Administration and Entrepreneurship was because, I have to admit, I hate working for other people, and the opportunities seemed more varied and didn't narrow me down to one particular field. I might be wrong about all of these points I'm making, but these are all what influenced my decisions. I figure starting your own business is difficult, but the risk to reward ratio seemed like something I could manage and was willing to take. I love a good challenge and proving people wrong. 

So now we're at spring semester 2016. Life is good. School is easy for me, but generals seemed so pointless and courses costing 300-400/credit hour really upset me when all the information I could find online quicker, easier, and more thoroughly than the classes I was in! I hated being forced by the education system to take certain courses that I wasn't interested in. Ugh, I don't even know what to say it bothers me so much. I mean don't get me wrong. I love learning about anything and everything, but the fact that the higher ups are telling me what to do with my money and saying they know what's right bothers me. Maybe I'm just a naive young adult thinking I know more than I really do.

During school I had a distance relationship with a girl, she was planning on coming to the same school and ended up moving out at the start of summer 2016. I enrolled for summer semester courses and she was working. We ended up breaking up the end of summer just before fall semester. While all of this is going on, turns out I have a deviated septum that made breathing terrible. I had one surgery and turns out 3% of the surgeries don't work out and require another surgery. I then had to have plastic nose surgery. They removed cartilage from my rib and did lots of nose work. The surgery was 10 hours. The doctor said it would only take 5, and the recovery was terrible. Well what do you know, add on top of it clinical depression. Depression runs in my family. I didn't know this at the time, but my 3 aunts, uncle, 6 cousins, and my grandfather on my father's side all had depression. My grandpa had passed away in the year 2000, but had treatment resistant depression for almost a decade. My depression had begun in February 2016.

  Fall semester started off terrible after the breakup and my depression got worse, for obvious reasons. I got over the breakup after a couple terrible months. I stopped attending my courses because I hated the system, was depressed, and felt like sticking a middle finger up to everything. I was frustrated. I had so many ambitions and goals and things I wanted to accomplish and I wanted to be successful. I was falling behind in school. I lost my scholarship. I had to maintain a 3.75 gpa for my scholarship, but my gpa dropped to a 3.70. That was so irritating. I wrote a letter to the school and explained my depression and situation and they offered me back one semester of the two that I had left. I attempted spring semester of 2017. Didn't work out. I was seeing psychiatrists, and a really good psychologist, but spring of 2017 my depression was critical. 

  The psychologist gave me a rating of 44 out of 50. 10 to 20 is mild depression. The average depression someone has is a score of 20 - 30. 30 and above is severe. 40 is almost being hospitalized bad. I wasn't hospitalized, but I was so depressed that it hurt physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually above anything I'd ever felt.

  I finished spring semester and by the end of it my depression had gotten down to a 14. I was feeling amazing. I wanted to get out and do everything, but the last of my worries was school. I wanted to start living! I decided to drop out of school and attend a coding bootcamp. I had extensive programming experience already, but the coding school really caught my attention. It is one of the best decisions I've made. I moved home for the summer and attended this school, but my depression started getting worse again.

  I finished school, but I was depressed and my motivation to look for jobs began to fade. Now I'm here in December. I've been out of this school for 2 months now and have applied to numerous jobs, have had numerous phone calls and coding tests, along with an internship offer ($12/hr). I didn't take the internship because I felt that was a better opportunity out there. I was given multiple referrals by family members to CTO's that they new at different tech companies. Right now I have a few leads, but the job search is difficult and the holiday season is starting. My motivation now is pretty low and I feel like just taking a break until the new year starts. 

  So here we are now. I have been hanging out with good friends at home. I've been dating cute girls. I'm still depressed, but I'm doing what I can. I have this ambition and drive just hiding inside of me it feels like. I feel like I have so much potential stored away, but trying to access it through depression is so hard. I have such a strong drive to be successful and feel like the real me is waiting to just explode out of the dark cloud around me. I am adamant about not going back to school. The best courses I took at school were the entrepreneurship courses that taught me applicable real world skills.

  I do not want to go through a bunch of other irrelevant classes and tests and coursework. I attended entrepreneurship seminars and the presentations were fantastic. What I got out of almost all of them was to just do it. To just go out and try. Try and fail, and try again. I'm 22, have a supportive family, and have the ability to take big risks! I can afford to take these risks. I don't know how to take them though, and finding like minded people my age who are willing to drop out of college and drop everything are hard to find. Mostly finding a treatment for my depression that works would be such an incredible blessing. When I was scored at a 12 I felt on top of the world, even while being considered mildly depressed. I just have to get off my chest and into the world how passionate I really am about forging my own path and not following the crowd and taking the easy way. Throughout high school I was not challenged at all. Everything was easy for me. I almost literally only spent no more than 20 hours a year on homework. I guess now my challenge in life is depression and taking the hits that life throws at me. Deep inside I know the future is bright, but the everyday feeling is just hopeless and miserable.

Anyways, if you read all of that I appreciate it a lot. If you didn't read all of it, no worries, I just had to get it all off my chest.

Edit: Sorry for the formatting. Never post much on reddit so not exactly sure how. Oh well.

7k49e1,218,2017-12-15,Wife Openly Admits How She Can't Wait to Get Fat In Front of Her Husband,Rudeyyyy,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7k49e1/wife_openly_admits_how_she_cant_wait_to_get_fat/,"We all know the background about getting married and whatnot so I'm not going to go into it. And if you don't know then sidebar's that way -------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

We're all recovering from our BP ways correct? Naturally before I found TRP I would dream of the usual, hot wife, big house, kids, dog, job where I can work from home and still make the big bucks and wife doesn't have to work thinking she'd support me. Yeah well 70% of that is out the window. I still want the job and being able to work from home, the big house and still want a woman, just not to put a ring on it and here's why.

I'm a sophomore in college and chose to work rather than play sports because debt is a bitch to get out of so I got a job at my local grocery store for the semester while getting internships in between semesters. 

I'm working in the frozen department so naturally that means I pack out the ice cream. I see a couple looking at the Friendly's ice cream bars. The woman is around a 4 already and is chubby a bit. Now maybe some people are into fat women. Good on you do what you want what you like is what you like, but me personally I can't date fat women. As the sidebar says lift and I played multiple sports in high school I like to stay active and naturally i'm pretty fit. Dating someone who's idea of a fun Saturday is staying in and binge watching Desperate Housewives all while racing against the clock to see how many pints of Ben and Jerry's she can down in one episode is not very fun. Maybe to her it is. But not to me. Especially if it's a nice day and it's warm out. Anyway I digress. So she's not very attractive to begin with and the husband seemed like a decent guy. Fit, clothes fit him and well groomed. My first thought was what the fuck?

So I approach the couple to ask if they need assistance about the Friendly's. They're 3 for 10$ you can't beat that deal. I ask them if they need help and instantly the wife, without hesitation goes **No we don't need any help. I'm just looking to see which 3 different flavors I want. Our honeymoon just ended so I don't have to fit into my wedding dress anymore.** 

The look on the husbands face as she says this is like a kid on Christmas when he wakes up and finds all the presents under the tree are burnt. Just pure sadness and depression. Best part was the wife said it with a huge shit eating grin on her face like she was proud of it. Proud to get married, to get the beta bux, the support, and commitment. I wanted to say back **It looks like you couldn't fit into your wedding dress BEFORE** but we all know the Laws of Power. Think as you like, behave like others. You catch one glimpse of this couple and you'd think they'd have been married for a few years already. Nope, just getting started.

I felt bad for the guy a bit. Now he's gonna get locked down, money raped, food whored, and not even gonna get his dick wet. He's gonna be stuck in this cycle of depression and frustration. And if he divorces her she'll prob take any kind of money he has including the fridge and whatever's in it. 

This goes back to my original BP statement about the wife with the big house. This is what he probably thought was going to happen. Of course he got the big wife as well as the big house too. Naturally you can still have a LTR and STILL be with the same woman. Just don't put a ring on it and lock yourself down. 

Just an example if I'm with someone and she starts getting a bit heavy, well i'd try to help her lose it assuming she wants to. Now if she doesn't WANT to then that's a whole different story. Either it means she got to comfortable or my SMV isn't high enough and that's on me. But here's the kicker, you can just get up and leave. Gone, no trail left behind, goodbye. No courts, lawyers, legal systems etc. All because you didn't put a ring on it. Also a quick tip put the house in your name and not joint. 

Key here is don't get married. It won't benefit you. Sure there are some benefits but the cons outweigh the pros. Don't be like this guy. He was pretty young too. Early 30's. SMV is still getting better. Don't cut yourselves short. Don't get married. If you're gonna settle down, just don't put a ring on it. "

7k4ha2,21,2017-12-15,F4M - The Bratty Buttslut and The Bodyguard.,Whoryuken,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7k4ha2/f4m_the_bratty_buttslut_and_the_bodyguard/,"Being the daughter of a highly successful CEO in the States certainly came with perks. I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Whatever I wanted, I always got without a problem - nothing was off limits for me. Life was as smooth as can be and I certainly took advantage of that. I was the definition of a spoiled brat. No one could tell me no. Everything was handed to me. If I wanted an internship that people my age worked their asses off for? I would get with a simple phone call all thanks to my family name. Luxury vehicles, the newest gadgets hitting the market, you name it – I could get my hands on it. 

The problem was that my father wasn't... entirely clean in his business practices. There were more than enough times where he left a fellow partner screwed or pulled shady deals in the name of profits that directly affected him. It was an easy way to make enemies and after a violent brush with some hired goons, he got incredibly paranoid which led to some drastic measures.

“You can't be serious... No, no... Dad, c'mon. I'll... carry pepper spray. Isn't that enough? This... is bullshit. I'm not going to babysat by some jackass. No, I refuse.” Maybe I shouldn't have crossed my arms and glanced off to the side with a scowl. I might have looked exactly like the definition of a brat with the complaints and actions. I wouldn't have my eyes meet yours. 

There you stood, beside my father with a firm stance and your eyes trained to me. The three of us in the overly extravagant foyer that one would expect to see straight out of a magazine. “A bodyguard... This is too much, really. Look at him, Dad. You want *that* following me around?” I blatantly motion of your frame. You weren't a typical meathead that I would expect. You weren't seven feet tall and built to the point where you look like you could *possibly* take on The Rock. You were in shape with this overly serious look upon your face. I wouldn't be surprised if you were cloned from those guards at Buckingham palace. Not a single insult thrown your way phased you.

“You won't even notice he's there, princess. I assure you. I handpicked him so he would blend in around you. He's your driver, the one to shadow behind you throughout your day. Nothing more, nothing less. It would put me at ease.” My father spoke all while I kept my sneer directed towards you. 

“I promise I won't get in your way, ma'am.”

Ma'am? Oh my god, this guy was the *worst*. Okay, well... *Maybe* you're easy on the eyes but that doesn't change the fact that I'll ensure you're going to end up as miserable as me. I mean, what if I wanted to grab coffee with Stacy at that new, overpriced place that has a line a mile long outside, unless you've got their official platinum card? There's no way I could drink my coffee in peace with you nearby. You'd probably be watching me like a hawk the entire time. It's creepy.

Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating but it doesn't matter! But a genius idea did cross my mind. It wouldn't be hard to get rid of you. If I drive you crazy, show you how terrible I can be? You'll be gone soon enough. I sigh in defeat, shrugging my shoulders upwards. “How long is *it* sticking around?”

“Twenty-four seven. He's going to be by your side until this whole thing with Russo blows over. You can't be too safe. But again, I promise you! You won't even notice him. Hell, we're doing a good job of speaking like he's not even here, right?” I wasn't sure what was more grating. That obnoxious laugh that left my father's lips or how you still haven't changed your expression. “You're not to go anywhere without him. Am I clear?”

Ugh. 'Am I clear?' was code for 'or else you're cut off'. I stormed right off, up the steps to leave you behind. There's no way you were going to last more than a few days – at most. 

It started off rather rocky. You were standing post outside of my room to ensure you would be ready to leave with me the moment I was? I tried to ignore you the moment I left my bedroom, but you went ahead and opening your mouth.

“Afternoon, ma'am.”

What kind of jerk greets someone like that? *The worst*. You stood by as I went through the kitchen to make lunch. No one else would be home other than us. You were so... professional, and polite. It got under my skin. Enough that I wanted to push your buttons. So that's exactly what I did. Like the terrible brat I was, I came over with a bottle of water and came to stand right in front of you. I took a sip of the chilled drink, my eyes fixated on yours before blatantly lifting the bottle up and tilting it right over you. I watched with a grin, seeing the liquid pour down your rugged frame while awaiting your reaction. Maybe, just *maybe* I took in the moment to admire how form-fitting your clothes became when they were drenched but nothing had resulted from my action. I did see your jaw tense briefly with a sharp exhale through your nose but you didn't budge.

That's how you're going to play it, huh? I'll have to keep pushing your buttons until you're calling it quits.

I might as well get a use out of you, too. Having you drive me from store to store wasn't too bad. I did get some strange satisfaction out of waiting for you to open and close the car door for me. When I tried on outfits? You had to stand around in which overly pricey boutique we found ourselves in. You did come in handy when it came to carrying my bags to the car. 

But my favorite part of having you as my personal bodyguard? I could get away with anything I wanted to. I blatantly groped you whenever I pleased because there wasn't a single thing you could do about it. Quit? Go ahead, I'd love it. Seeing your face twist into a snarl or have you yell at me? Breaking you down into being *so*
 unprofessional was the goal but you never faltered. Whether it was the way I grabbed your firm ass and muttered good night before heading into my room, or how I would drag my palm back and forth along the outline of your growing bulge before we headed out for the day – I loved it. What were you going to do? Go tell my father that 'Daddy's little girl' was groping you? He wouldn't buy it. As far as I'm concerned, you're asking for it with how well fitted your clothes are to your body.

So the cycle continues. Day in, day out – I'm a brat who has fun mercilessly teasing and toying with you. I might have even grown to find you tolerable. I push the boundaries more, and more each day. Kissing at your ear as you drive me to my requested location, telling you how badly I'd love to have your thick cock between my lips. Or how your large hand would make my thick ass look oh so pretty with your handprint embedded on it. I was vulgar and a tease, I wouldn't even come close to stopping, not when the idea of you finally snapping and taking me was still present in my head.

In fact, I started to crave it with each passing day. The idea of you putting me in my place - hearing you growl against my ear as your hands spread my thick, bubbly cheeks so you could line up your hard cock against me? It's what kept my bratty behavior going. I might even be dressing to show off solely for you, but I'd never admit it. 

Was it possible? I think I was actually *starting* to like having you around.

Hullo! So, generally I want to play out a scene with could involve many different angles. Does my character end up getting fucked in her lavish home while others are around? HoldTheMoan scenarios would be fun with this! Does my character pull her lovely bodyguard into a fitting room so she can sink to her knees and mercilessly tease his thick cock? We could also play any of the parts in my idea I placed. From their first meeting, to the water pouring incident. I'm open to ideas as well! Overall, she's a terrible brat that wants to get fucked rough by her hot bodyguard. As for their looks. You in-shape attractive man. Me hourglass lovely lady. Me enjoy contrast.

As for kinks... I need a man who's obsessed with ass. An ass-man, please and thank you. Someone who loves anal and rimming. Those are the biggest kinks that I don't want to play without. If you're not a fan of those kinks, then we won't be a good fit unfortunately. Other than that – rough sex, teasing, dirty talk, light raceplay (Doesn't mean come be a racist!), creampies, face-fucking, face-sitting, semi public sex and yeah! Not into feet, fisting, bathroom play or animals. Not into the whole D/S, mistress sort of thing either. None of that for me. If you're overly submissive, we won't click.

That's it! Let's discuss ideas. Tell me what you want to happen, how you envision your character to act and how it should play out. *Please* include the following in your message; your kinks/limits, how you want to play this out and your favorite TV show because why not? *Please*? Please. It's not too much to ask! I'm pretty flexible about the scene! It can apply to plenty of scenarios. I'll just reply with gifs up until you follow those guidelines.

I was hoping that someone on here might have some tips for dealing with a situation I've found myself in.

For some context, I am a 22 year old college graduate currently working in a PR firm, where my day to day duties involve things that dyslexic people typically struggle in. One such duty involves relaying press to clients in real time. I was talked to several months ago about spelling and grammatical in these emails, which is obviously an issue. To combat this I proposed installing Grammarly onto my work computer, creating general templates for common correspondence, and creating drafts of important emails before sending them to clients.I started as an intern in my last semester in college, and during the interview process, I did disclose my dyslexia and dysgraphia wanting to be very up front, but other than that I haven't talked much about it, and in a way thought that I had really mastered dealing with those kinds of struggles. 

This way too long so I'll get to the point already. Today I created one of these drafts and received the following email from a higher up with another coworker who worked with that client still included on the email. 

""Punctuation. Please be more thorough or well have to have a serious conversation about this!""

While this particular person has communicated that they have a direct style of communication and feedback before, something about this cut deep and reminded me of teachers in elementary school accusing me of being lazy. I also ran this by multiple people who don't have dyslexia after getting this response and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with my original email.

Has anyone in this community dealt with this kind of problem at work? How should I bring it up and talk to this individual?

Thank you!

I’m a professional video game developer and, of course, want to encourage this. She was a programming intern on a robotics team that competed in a national competition in the US, so she’s been involved in some activities regarding robotics and loves it. 

She’s also into gaming so maybe she would dig making some sort of Retro Pi-sort-of-thing.

I would like to spend less than $70 on her for Christmas, but I was thinking it could be great to get her a Pi and a kit to get her started on her robotics journey. I have zero experience with Pi and have started my research on it today via guides and forums on the official website.

What I’ve come to find out is that most of the pre-made kits here in the US kind of suck, and that I may want to put something together on my own for her. Ideally I could also get her a solid book, despite all the great resources online. Her online time is limited and she really loves books. 

Can anyone help me assemble a kit, available in the US, on my budget that either has to do with robotics or gaming? Let’s assume she won’t need a monitor, keyboard, or mouse. "

I've graduated college so I don't have access to a counselor/therapist anymore, and I can't afford to see one. 
I'm currently living with my parents but they've never been supportive of mental health issues, claiming that they only stem from playing video games (which I don't play often)

Anyway for the past 2 weeks my mood has been a lot more unstable. I've been lashing out more, crying uncontrollably and I don't know. I guess I just need someone to talk to about this.

I'm really stressed about not having a job, but my dad guilts me about not getting any internships during my undergrad time. However he doesn't know about my depression and how I wouldn't have been able to go off to live on my own even if it was for 2-3 months during the summer. As of right now, I'm not in any danger to myself, I've just been really down.

I don't know why but lately I've really been dwelling on the time I was sexually assaulted about 3 years ago. I've tried to tell people that i trust but it didn't work. I've told my coach (the guy was on the same team as me) but all she did was give him ""a stern talking to"" because his skills were valuable to the team. I've told a close friend at the time but she brushed it off and didn't believe me. The only person that even supported me was my ex boyfriend, but due to some difficult circumstances I can't talk to anymore.

I feel so alone and pathetic right now. I want to move on with my life, but I keep dwelling on the past and I haven't been able to get a job and move on. I feel stuck. I don't know what to do or where to go. 

I'm sorry this is really long. I just want to feel normal again."

7k73x4,2,2017-12-16,Questioning the big picture of my medical history,atmenkunst,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/7k73x4/questioning_the_big_picture_of_my_medical_history/,"Ok so this covers a little over a decade of systemic physical and mental illnesses + symptoms, so I'll try to sum it up as much as possible, please bear with me. For reference, I'm 23/F and was first seen by a psychiatrist around age 18 for my 3rd bout of major depression, and later explicitly told I had BP type II at age 21, which happened around the same time as another severe medical issue. 


Lately I've been reflecting on my BP II diagnosis since the first symptoms of depression I showed around age 12, and which were intensified at 13 and 16 were deeply linked with both an eating disorder that dominated many aspects of my life until I was 19 (I was in a highly demanding physical discipline I quit at 14-15 because of this) and to a pretty dysfunctional family environment. 


Due to the aforementioned eating disorder I also developed hypothyroidism at 13 and didn't even get a period for 8-10 months straight (later Dx'd as PCOS by the way). This type of hormonal imbalances generally leads to depression and anxiety as well, so I've been thinking about that as something that could be explained through a physical source of illness coupled with an environmentally detrimental approach to mental health instead of something of a primarily psychiatric origin - I'm aware teenagers are not diagnosed with BP, but obviously this was part of the medical history I shared with my psychiatrist and it had weight in his final diagnosis.


So, I began seeing him at 18 and at first he put me on Lexapro, which did wonders for me. I bounced back pretty quickly from the paralysis of depression and became productive and overall healthier, with one caveat - after some months I felt my anxiety levels were too high for me to handle so he added a low dose of Klonopin to the antidepressant. This was later changed to Xanax and to be honest I did abuse my prescription, even if at 20 I had to quit it completely because it wasn't covered anymore (luckily I didn't suffer from benzo withdrawal or anything, though I never reached daily amounts over 4-6 g so that must've helped). I now wonder if the heightened anxiety was caused by the antidepressants and the negative loop of benzo misuse.


Here it's worth mentioning that around age 19 I started smoking some r/trees of rather questionable origins, which I did not disclose to my doc, and began showing some hypomanic symptoms - higher energy and productivity - which for the most part helped me through college but also got me into situations of taking up too many responsibilities at the same time and then failing to fulfill them; I recognize my thinking was distorted in that ""excessive faith in one's abilities"" sense as I optimistically thought I could manage everything but couldn't deliver in the end. My psych's answer was to add a low dose of Lamictal (mood stabilizer) to the mix, which seemed to help for the most part.


So where did the breaking point for that BP II diagnosis come from? Well, I finally took on way more responsibility than I could handle, partly because I was being pushed by my teachers to do so since I was at the top of my class and got a ""good"" internship in which I was given twice the workload I was supposed to have, so saying no was out of the question. 


By now not even the antidepressant + anxiety med + mood stabilizer + weed mix I had going on was helping with the intensity of my symptoms, so for whatever reason he decided to substitute the Lexapro+Lamictal combo for Zoloft. This time I had some really shitty side effects - malaise, fatigue, and cognitive problems - which I didn't get to address directly in an appointment because, well, I was extremely busy with trying to juggle my last semester of classes, a full-time insane internship, and my undergrad thesis as well as community service, so that dropped to the bottom of the list of priorities at the time. TBH I was neglecting myself fully in terms of physical and mental health in a desperate attempt to do it all.


Lucky me, halfway through that semester I had a severe case of reactive arthritis probably brought on by a gastrointestinal virus (my eating habits were, to put it mildly, shit) and literally overnight I went from being just fine to crying in pain because my hands felt like they were on fire. I was seen that very morning by a rheumathologist and she suggested either 5 days of Dexamethasone or, or, a single shot of Betamethasone. This *was* signed off by my psychiatrist.


To my even greater luck, in the span of a week after I chose the one-time shot I had my first and only full-blown manic episode since I couldn't get a fucking hold of any of my doctors during their sweet vacation time and my almost nonexistant support network failed me to the point of no return. I had been awake for almost 6 days straight by the time I was finally received by my psych; he promptly gave me a hell of a dose of Quetiapine and Valproate and sent me off with my family, the one that had handled this emergency as delicately as a stampede of elephants, and I was pretty much limited to living in my room like a zombie for a month. This was when I was informed of my official BP diagnosis. That month I was at the worst point I've ever been in cognitive terms - I lost almost all short-term memory, couldn't pay attention for more than a few minutes, couldn't even read a paragraph - and when I was finally able to link more than two braincells together I begged to be switched to Lamictal. This helped me start recovering at last, but ever since I've had memory problems which I attribute to being put on a bunch of antipsychotics in the middle of the most traumatizing event of my life so far.


Anyway, I've since been taking exclusively Lamictal 100-300 mg for the past 2 years since this lovely time, which I keep up with because whenever I've forgotten to take it for weeks or so I've had a marked increase in intrusive thoughts, awful moods and attention/memory problems. I've never had any negative ""upswing"" effects, though. After reading a bit I added Folic acid, vit D and Omega 3 supplements since it's more than likely that I had nutritional deficiencies and it seems to help with the arthritis that keeps popping up as well.


 Now, my issue with all of this is the following - based on the early stages of my mental disorders, there's a strong organic component, and afterwards both the medication I was using properly and the one I abused could've exacerbated their symptoms (besides the weed use). Also, the drug-induced mania caused by Betamethasone would've probably been written off as steroid psychosis in another patient without my history, and its aftermath can be more than explained by the hellish side effects of antipsychotics. 


So, I guess my question is: could I eventually stop taking Lamictal altogether, given that the root of these illnesses isn't exactly idiopathic? Obviously I would only do this within the context of a healthy lifestyle (balanced diet and physical rehabilitation program), and with the support of a psychiatrist, but I'd like to know if anyone has had success removing all psych meds and controlling their symptoms without them, or if they've even stopped having them after a certain time in the case of drug-induced BP. If not I guess it'll be just another pill on top of my thyroid medication I'll take for the rest of my life since it's one of those things you can't exactly regenerate, however, given that I do experience mild side effects from Lamictal it'd be nice to get off it safely.


**TL;DR: There were legit organic reasons for the beginning of my anxiety/depression symptoms and later on I strongly suspect they got out of control due to drugs. Is there a chance I could manage the moderate symptoms of both exclusively through a healthy, balanced lifestyle?**

&gt;Plus, you don’t want to be creepy. My deviancy and my kink doesn’t work that way. My kink works differently. Somebody’s discomfort turns me off. I don’t like it. It doesn’t do anything for me sexually. It would be embarrassing to me. If I’m sexual with somebody I really want them to be into it and enjoying it.

Does this delusional worm honestly think the women and mentally ill men he pays actually enjoy doing anything sexual with him? Stalker Patti clearly enjoyed him fingering her on air. What about the underage drunk girl he took advantage of? The girl he pressed his bare cock on at a club was probably really into it. And I'm sure every female guest loved seeing this creep rub his dick through his pants while they spoke. Oh and Princess Alena truly loved him and was not just trying to make a living.

&gt;There’s a power dynamic too. Are you doing it because you don’t understand that the other person is uncomfortable, or are you doing it because you understand it and don’t care?

Jim understands he makes women uncomfortable and doesn't care. He makes this clear when he talked about professional masseuses that turned down his sexual advances as though they were uptight cunts for not wanting to touch his gross prick. And when he trashed a young intern on air for stating that Jim hitting on her at work creeped her out. Instead of accepting that his approach is creepy and disrespectful, he throws a fit when he doesn't get the response he feels he is *owed*. And instead of learning how to interact with women without being a deviant pig, he resorts to paying them to pretend to be ""into it and enjoying it."" Then goes on to brag about how about how his sexual endeavors are enjoyable for all parties involved and he simply cannot relate to the abhorrent behavior of those like Louis C.K.

7k8wgv,3,2017-12-16,Moving to Switzerland 2 - test post,travel_ali,travel_ali,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel_ali/comments/7k8wgv/moving_to_switzerland_2_test_post/,"I moved to Switzerland over 2.5 years ago, and as it is raining out and I am feeling thoughtful here is a reflection of the move and my subsequent time here. [I made a post on here 2 years ago about my thoughts after 6 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/3x3hkn/i_moved_to_switzerland_here_are_a_few_thoughts_on/), so this post is kind of a redo/update of that (and this is also heavily focused on the German speaking part of the country).

In short it has been a fantastic experience: I moved into a flat in the old town of an absurdly pretty town, got the chance to fully explore the country, made friends and feel I have integrated and understand the country very well. The move itself was very easy for me. But the language has been the slow and hard part.

[For info on travel, hiking and other things see this previous series of posts I put on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5nkv4j/switzerland_my_faq_thoughts_hints_and_tips_after/). This is just about my experience moving and living here (ok it is mostly to bitch about the language, but shhh).

**Serious bits**

There are plenty of blogs ([eg: the German Way](https://www.german-way.com/)), forums ([https://www.englishforum.ch/](https://www.englishforum.ch/)), and books (Living and working in Switzerland by David Hampshire) out there dealing with the matter. Blogs from other expats are sometimes wonderfully accurate, but sometimes they seem to describe another country altogether. I am mostly going to avoid serious bits as they are covered well elsewhere.

One thing I will say is transfer your driving licence to a Swiss one right away. Not expecting to stay this long, and only planning to use the trains I didn’t bother as it just seemed a waste of time and money. Now having been here more than 1 year, and planning to stay longer, as I understand it I can’t drive here until I retake the whole bloody test - not that I ever want to, but it would be useful to have the option still.

**Why / How**

Basically I just ended up here slightly by chance. I (at the time M/28/UK) was doing a PhD in Biomaterials and had been wanting to do a Post-doc outside of the UK, but had been focused on Germany or Australia and had never really considered Switzerland. Then a job with the right requirements popped up through contacts as I was writing up my PhD. I applied, got the position, and suddenly found myself about to move to a country which I didn’t really know a whole lot about and to a town I had never heard of.

There were two major aids here: the culture and highly specific skills of academia makes it very easy to find a job in another country, and as an EU citizen (for now) I get equal rights and easy access to Switzerland. So it was just a case of entering the country normally and telling them I was here once I set myself up.

**Pre-move research**

I had been to Switzerland twice before during my studies, but only to Geneva and most of that time was spent at CERN on or over the border with France. Now I was moving all by myself to a different part of the country and the closest person I knew was in the north of Germany. So I was really going in blind and alone.

I was spending 2 months travelling elsewhere in the run up to the start date so didn’t really have much time for any serious preparation beyond checking what I needed to do to make sure I entered and set myself up legally.

What I did do was read Swiss Watching by Diccon Bewes. [He also has a long but quite good TedX talk, similar to the Swiss Watching book but quicker for some of the basic facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc). He tends to overdo some points, but generally gives a very good overview of the country and the people.

Otherwise I just bought tickets for the closest airport and packed as much as I could into the biggest bag I had: laptop, clothes, a frying pan, and hiking boots. 

**The move**

All things considered this went surprisingly smooth.

Entering the country I just walked through customs just like any holiday maker with a big bag. I then left the airport by the wrong country - a problem which is possibly unique to Basel/Mülhausen - before correctly entering Switzerland and meeting my new boss for the first time in arrivals. He escorted me to our town and informed about various things work and life related on the way (99% of which I forgot pretty much instantly as my mind was overwhelmed with so much to take in).

I had been expecting to use the flat my new workplace rented for visitors, but I found out late on that it was already taken by some interns, and so I had to find my own place at very short notice. Browsing the standard property websites I quickly realised that my original idea of finding myself a furnished flat was not going to happen - such properties are very limited in number and absurdly expensive. I got very lucky and found a room to sublet almost instantly though the flatmate finding website [wgzimmer](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer.html) (though be warned flat sharing is not a common thing here like it is in the UK). Not only did I get a mostly furnished flat to live in, but it was in the historic old town, and I had a Swiss housemate which made starting so much easier as I had both an instant friend and a local guide / information source.

(Having since searched for a proper flat 2 years later I have found it is a rather slow process. You typically have to arrange with the current tenant to see the flat, rather than just getting an agent to take you around a selection. Often the tenant feeds back to the company which means appearing in a smart(ish) outfit and being friend helps, certainly the quickest and most positive responses I got were when I had a good chatty tour with the current tenant. Applying then takes ages as you have a to fill out a form for each flat, and the answer can take anything from a few hours to a few weeks. On the plus side you legally get a day off from work to move house which is nice.)

I moved into the flat without a rental contract at first as it took time for the landlord to approve me as a sub-tenant. Whilst slightly chaotic (I took most of my first months wages in a large pile of cash), this made the whole chicken-egg process of getting setup in a new country vastly easier. Once the rental contract came through it was simple to just go to the Kanton with my passport and work/rental contracts and register as a resident, followed by a quick trip to the bank to get myself a bank account. And just like that life fell into place.

For the mandatory health insurance (you have 3 months, but start early as it takes at least a month for it to actually be processed) I just went on Helsana and figured out a reasonably cheap package. I haven’t changed it since, but many Swiss take it very seriously and constantly swap to keep the cost down.

I didn’t really have to spend much time on official matters, and didn’t really come across any serious problems or delays (other than sleeping on the floor for a few weeks as Ikea delivery takes ages). Even setting up a bank account with no common language went surprisingly smooth and quickly.

**Adjustment and life**

I went in with a 1 year contract and a mentality that I would jump in, make the most of the time to see everything I could, and then hop out again to move on elsewhere afterwards (or stay if possible, but I was very open to whatever).

During the early days keeping yourself busy is probably the best thing you can do.
On which point the first few “honeymoon” months are a magical time when everything is different and exciting - make the most of them. Especially for me as I turned up at the end of May which is possibly the best time of year - warm weather, snowy peaks, and green meadows. During my first summer I constantly bought new and novel things in the supermarket, and went on trips almost every weekend. My coworkers started to become quite amused as I turned up every Friday with hiking boots and a backpack to head off directly into the mountains after work.

It of course isn’t all rustic cabins and mountains. Most people moving into Switzerland will go to the Flatland: which can be wonderfully charming with rustic villages and rolling forested hills, but can also be ugly industry and forgettable charmless towns. From October to February the Flatland suffers from a dense low fog which swallows the light and leaves you in a depressing world of grey for weeks or months at a time. [You can escape above it to a world of beautiful clear views and sunshine](https://i.imgur.com/SKmNWwt.jpg) at the weekend (some people go up armed with deckchairs and newspapers), but during the working week you are rather stuck with it.

My past experience made dealing with the move quite easy: having moved to Australia as a kid, and a few times in the UK for uni I had gotten used to new places and new people. I also suspect I have it very easy as an outsider here: I am white, speak English as my mother language, and am skilled (ie: I look like I fit in, I can almost always communicate, and I arguably add something to the country). I don’t mean that in a “the Swiss are horribly racist” way, but a just “the closer you are to the culture you move to then the easier it is” way. 

With my housemate and friends I made at work I found myself with a social life fairly early on. Partly due to that, and partly due to not wanting to fall into the expat-trap, I didn’t get around to meeting my local English speaking society until almost 2 years after I arrived. In retrospect it would have been better to join them early on for advice and tips.

Moving from one western country to another isn’t too big a challenge. But the differences can pile up:

* If you come from anywhere but Norway then converting the prices back to your home currency will give you a heart attack each time you go to the shops here. It is best to stop doing that ASAP. Prices are high, but pay is good.

* Getting used to the way things work takes time. I was utterly shocked on arrival to find the shops here close at 6:30pm during the week. 

* One of the curious bits of adjustments was the steady stream of small differences that I became aware of as time passed. For example after months of spending at least part of every day in the countryside I finally realised what it was that seemed off to me - there were no fences or hedges and so it all felt strangely open compared to the English countryside.

**Language**

This is the one thing that gets to me the most about living abroad. It can really isolate you or give you the feeling of being isolated even when you are being socially accommodated (I feel guilty about it and hate having to drag the conversation back to English). Being near the Röstigraben I sometimes end up in a French dominated group (of which I speak almost nothing beyond ordering a coffee) so the effect is somewhat doubled. 

You can survive here without German - I have met plenty of people working at big companies like Novartis that do. English is kind of the common language here - far less people speak multiple Swiss languages fluently than you would expect. Still, when someone in Switzerland says they “only speak a little French” it tends to me they can only converse for an hour or two (as opposed to “a little French” in the UK which means you can count to 5). Once you are setup and enter the rhythm of everyday life then (other than the odd official letter) it is easy to just coast along in English. This is understandable in some ways: coming home after work it can be hard to find the motivation or time to sit down and study something serious (especially with a family), and learning by immersion is often about as much fun as learning to swim by being thrown into a tsunami. 

I wanted to learn the language regardless, but I also happened to move to a very Swiss company in a small town that is almost unknown internationally. As such I was always immersed (drowning) in Swiss-German and had plenty of motivation to learn. 

I would sum up the experience of learning a language as you move to a new country as three stages:

- **1 - The initial novelty.** You have just arrived and everything is exciting and new. You don’t understand anything but that is fine: you are armed with a range of apps, you are confident that immersion in the language will make sound like a native in a few months, and you can even identify some of the items in your kitchen in German already.

- **2- The frustration stage.** You have completed Duolingo and other such things, politely smiled through hours of German, and learnt your dative/genitive/etc - but you don’t understand a fucking thing beyond the fact that the important looking sign in the train station says something about platform 4.

- **3 - Starting to click.** You might still mix up words and your grammar makes the language less of an art and more of a frontal assault. But you understand what is said and get the message across. Conversational level has been reached, and the long road to fluency begins.

- **4 - Bonus Swiss-German stage.** You read, listen, and talk High-German without trouble. Then you pop into Migro and the cashier asks you a simple question in Swiss-German, but you don’t understand a bloody word. You sigh and lower your head in shame/frustration.

I had 3 years of German at school in the UK which was something but not amazing (I showed an example GCSE exam to Swiss colleagues and they literally laughed). Still at least that gave me some words and installed a basic appreciation of the language which helped me restart 10 years later. Having recently started learning French from nothing I actually do appreciate that my school German was a helpful foundation, though I think 3 years of “bare minimum because I had to” at school translates to about 3 months of part-time “because I want to” later on.

I didn’t have much time before moving out so I just played with some game/apps on my phone, which taught me one or two words but were mostly useless. On getting into Switzerland I hit Duolingo and worked my way through it. It is certainly attractive being easy, free, and full of happy binging sounds. But overall I would say it is really limited. You are so far from everyday understanding at the end. Some people claim to watch TV shows or hold full conversations based purely on Duolingo, fuck knows what they watch or talk about but I was nowhere near that. It is useful as something to play with, but as a supplement to other methods. I found Memrise after completing Duolingo, but at this point I could not be bothered with more repetitive filling in the blanks - so I didn’t really bother with it. Instead I moved onto youtube, games, newspapers, classes, and whatever interaction occurred in my daily life.

My German has come quite a way and generally impresses most people I talk to here given the amount of time I have learnt it in (and sometimes that I have bothered to learn it at all, though I feel I could be so much further with less time “wasted” on other things):

* On arrival I would say I was A1. I could introduce myself and say that I had a cat (which was a lie), count, and identify a few objects and animals. But that was about it.

* Now after 2.5 years I can understand most High-German and join in on most topics, so would put myself at B2. Though my grammar is still far from pretty, and a long German session can still burn me out. I can barely remember any genders for nouns and mostly just pick whatever sounds best in my head. Whether I fully understand Swiss-German is very hit or miss.

I must say that I really like Swiss-German. I like how it sounds and it is so much more interesting and full of character than High-German. However….

Learning German in Switzerland can be absurdly frustrating (more so than usual). Swiss-German makes it so much more complicated. You can reach total fluency in High-German, but then get utterly floored by the simplest question from a Swiss person. The Swiss like to laugh when people ask them if “Swiss” is a language, but I would argue that Swiss-German is basically a whole other language. The pronunciation, grammar, and even basic words are often very different. It isn’t so much that the goalposts have been moved, but that the whole fucking game has changed. The idea of trying to play football whilst the other team are playing Gaelic football is about on the right lines. [This video makes the point rather well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2S9iggdzM). And on the point of [a whole different game….](https://youtu.be/ThwG88SFIQc).

Still there is no ß in Swiss-German (you just use ss instead) which saves some faffing around at least. It also helps to know that Swiss-German gives most normal Germans a hard time too (German TV often gives Swiss speakers subtitles).

This is infinitely more frustrating as a native English speaker: people often hear my accent and switch straight to English - and usually keep going in English even when I keep responding in German. Sometimes in a shop the salesperson will run off to find an English speaking worker (and sometimes they will then run off to find another worker that speaks better English). Even the middle aged butcher in my little town speaks perfect bloody English. On the flip side having a Swiss address means people often assume I am Swiss and hit me with the hardest dialect they can muster. Going to check into a B&amp;B as the only guests that night the host greeted me with a barrage of Swiss-German only to get a deer-in-the-headlights response from me (much to the amusement of my Swiss girlfriend).

Technically you can learn Swiss-German, but unless you are already fluent in High-German that would be insane. Every Swiss-German speaker understands and talks High-German so you would be pointlessly over specialising with a language that most German speakers can’t understand. Especially so as Swiss-German varies drastically by region (yes even in this tiny place), and it isn’t a defined language so if you write it out you just write it as it sounds to you in your dialekt. I have been told that any structured class on it is just a waste of time. Just learn the Swiss part by exposure - you are never going to easily pass for a local with the dialect anyway.

For putting the language to use it is much easier for me to talk German with strangers, or with people I know speak no English. When you start speaking English with people it is far too hard to then switch language years down the line when your German is good enough to function properly. I live with my Swiss girlfriend but we almost always talk in English when it is just us as German feels so strange.

While it is endless frustration, it really does payoff and feel good. For example when checking into a hotel in Graubünden the receptionist was delighted that I spoke in German rather than just shouting at her in English and I got very friendly treatment for the rest of the time. Also we had regular internal presentations that are given in German, at the start I was filling sheets of paper with scribbled words and translations from my phone as I tried to keep up, but at the end I only needed to do so for one or two words which was rather nice. And of course being able to fully function and communicate with people in daily life is rather a good payoff too.

The downside of this is that when I return to the UK it takes me a few days to stop talking German to strangers (especially if I have had a few beers).

For learning in Switzerland I found these tools very useful:

* The free commuter newspaper [20 minutes](http://www.20min.ch/) is the best tool for learning German in Switzerland (probably also French and Italian too). It is not going to win any journalism awards. But it has short, simple, neutral articles - grab a copy each day and scribble all over it. The odd Swiss-German word is included which helps build up the local lingo. Some of it (ie: the people/community section) is invented bollocks, but it mostly helps give you an idea what is important in the country and how Switzerland works.

* Dict.cc has a number of Swiss words which makes it my mobile/internet dictionary of choice for Switzerland.

* [There is an Allmanisch German wiki if you want to pick up a feeling for the way the dialect feels](https://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Houptsyte).

* [SRFplay](https://www.srf.ch/play). TV and radio on demand in High and Swiss-German. You paid for this with your Billag, so abuse the hell out of it.

* SRF4. The news radio station in mostly nice clear High-German. Typically they seem to have 2-3 hours of reports each day that they just repeat, slightly dull but great for someone trying to learn. I like to listen to this when I am working in the lab. 

* Youtube has some useful resources. Swiss-German channels like [Ask Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndi9zHvIDYa1Tp6vXJqHxA) provide plenty to listen to. It also has some SRF stuff which might help if you are not already in Switzerland. Search “bi de lüt” for shows focused on Swiss life with some strong Swiss-German accents. 

* [The australian/swiss comedy of Rob Spence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mifm_FMFLM&amp;t=4s). Not so easy to understanding but somehow reassuring.

For German in general I would also suggest:

* /r/German and the resources on their [wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index).

* There is so much on youtube. [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3936178A38BB5F87) is a favourite.

* Dive in - to hell with how stupid you might sound.

* Joining a class. The learning process is much more fun when you have some people at your level to share the frustration. I spent almost a year trying to decide what level to join - online tests kept putting me as A1, but the overall meaning of each level made me think B1, in the end I went B1 and it was perfect (so bollocks to yes/no online tests).

* Duolingo provide a nice way to get started and keep steadily learning. The simple focused nature of the tree and short time requirements of the stages mean you don’t get overwhelmed and don’t need to worry about setting more than a few minutes aside for it. But overall it is really limited in what it actually teaches you of the language, so you need to heavily use other medium instead. Think of Duolingo as a snack: quick, convenient and easy to keep you going, but it isn’t going to properly fill you up. Complete the tree and practice if you find it useful, but don’t bother aiming for the highest level or for a 1000 day streak.   

* I am not a massive gamer but I swear by video games as the best way to learn. The mix of interaction, language, and fun makes for a very effective learning environment (that and being able to attack someone with a sword when you get sick of them speaking German to you is rather satisfying…..). The trick is to find something story based with a good separation of language and action: RPGs like Skyrim is perfect for this (especially using console to pause and quick save/load to repeat bits), whereas something action based like COD is too distracting. This worked especially well playing games which I completed in English years ago, where I could just about recall the gist of the story to help me along but had forgotten many aspects and details.

* Music. I built a playlist when I first arrived. It started out as random sounds, but through 2 years of steady listening and learning I can now make sense of it.

* Read out loud (though maybe not on the bus).

* [Emon publishing](https://www.emons-verlag.de/) do local Krimis with one probably set where you live or are interested in. Not exactly the best books in the world but entertaining enough.

**The Swiss**

Sometimes I feel I understand the Swiss, other times they are complex enigmas. The nature of the country often feels very contradictory at times (often liberal and conservative at once). And of course the urban/rural, and language divides only make this more complex. 

Take anything you read pre-2000 with a big pinch of salt. The country seems to have changed significantly since then: going from a dull but practical country to a much more fun and outgoing one. The summer months especially are very lively as people head outdoors to drink at bars, go to festival, and jump in the lakes/rivers. Younger Swiss are very open and there is less of the formality that you get with the older generations.

The Swiss tend to operate in two modes in public: city and mountain. In urban areas the Swiss are along the lines of the quiet closed society of stereotypes, but get them into the countryside and they can become super loud and chatty. I have been on Post buses where the entire bus was interacting and best friends by the end of the trip, and if you get on a train to the mountains with a group of retirees you will know about it. 

I am a fairly private person but the Swiss sometimes really beat me there. Once a coworker who I spoke with most days casually mentioned that he wouldn’t be in the next day, I assumed he had to wait for a delivery or something - turns out he was getting married. This has happened twice now. Most other coworkers got this treatment too, so it isn't (just) that I am insufferable. 

I have however always felt very welcomed here. On one of my first days I went walking in the Jura mountains near my town. As I sat on a peak to eat lunch an elderly local man started talking to me. My German was almost non-existent then but I managed to get the idea across that I had just moved there to start work. On finding out that this foreigner who barely spoke a word of German (let alone the local dialect) was moving in to work he wished me well and gave me a Ricola. A small gesture, but one that really stuck with me. Having improved my German I have only felt more welcome since then.

On which point the Swiss are very tolerant with language. Absurdly so really. In my early days I only once or twice got very gentle remarks that I needed to improve my German (buying curtains was one notable early occasion where my few words in German really failed to get me far) but generally they did everything to accommodate me and then as my skills picked up they started to throw praise at even my crude German. Whether that is just being polite or they are just genuinely impressed that an English speaker learnt German I am not sure.

The Swiss are almost always very considerate. Dog walkers will stop to hold their dog in place whilst bikers go past. Even the bored teens drinking on the street at night don’t bother anyone walking past. The main exception is the growing number of wankers who think they are special and can just walk around with their music blasting out of some powerful speaker (though that is probably more common elsewhere).

Some habits of talking took a while to get used to. The British habit of saying sorry to express sympathy rather confuses the Swiss who take it to just mean guilt. Understatement isn’t really a thing here which either leads to confusion or hilarity - one day at work I was being shown a process with a sample being taken out of the oven at 1400C, on being warned that it was very hot I replied that it was indeed a wee bit toasty, the poor worker taking the  

The absolute worst thing about the Swiss is their obsession with putting their bag on the seat beside them on the train (the overhead racks are apparently only there for aesthetics). They will move it if you ask, but not until you do so (no matter how obviously busy the train might be) which can create a passive aggressive awkwardness about it. Some talented people have even mastered the art of taking up 4 spaces by themselves, and then manage not to notice that there are other people on the train. 

A few odd thoughts:

* [Stereotypes exist for each region in the country](http://i.imgur.com/Gq72cwL.jpg). Generally they are fairly mature. Coming from the UK and Australia where anyone more rural than you is having sex with their sheep (and/or incest) this was quite a surprise.

* One thing I find curious is that the image of sport (TV adverts etc) here is more of families and normal people doing it as opposed to super-athletes. And most people are quite outgoing with sport and such-like. 

* Shaking hands is a big thing here. Get used to that in situations where a hello or just polite nod would do in English speaking lands.

**The long-term**

Having started with a mentality of in-and-out (with as many mountains as possible in the meantime) I have found myself getting somewhat more established here. I got extended several times to 2.5 years, met a Swiss girl, moved in with her, and am now looking for further work.

For me adapting and getting used to life here was fairly easy. I made friends via work, and my housemate. I explored every part of the country (far more than most of my Swiss acquaintances). Through watching and reading the news I now understand much better how the country works and the variations in who votes and thinks what. I can’t name the president or most of the politicians, but they are not so influential here and having no say myself in the politics I have an excuse there.

There has been some frustration and feeling of being useless and/or isolated. I sometimes get a desire for home, without actually knowing what home even is to me anymore. But generally it has been very positive. 

I only really miss a few things:

* Food. Swiss food tends to be a little less exotic than the options in the UK. I really miss the omnipresent cheap curry-houses. Likewise standard food in the supermarkets (whilst almost always good) is less exotic.

* Culture. You can talk English with locals but it just isn’t the same. Hanging out with fellow expats helps abit there, but they are often from all over the world so you often still miss out on a proper connection.

* Opening hours. I dream of shops that open on Sunday and/or beyond the early evening. 

The main downside has been that the longer you spend somewhere the more mundane it becomes. A few days spent in Grindelwald or somewhere like that might leave you with the memory of the country as a magical place. But when you stay somewhere for longer then it becomes normal and less special with every passing day. I still love it here, but had I only stayed for the first summer than it would have stayed far more wonderful in my memory. Of course then I would just be yearning to come back.

**What would I do differently?**

If I were to repeat it again knowing what I do now (though they are all of course easier said than down):

* Allow more time for finding a flat. I got lucky on arrival, but now realise how long this process can be.

* Hit the language harder and faster. This was partly delayed by finishing up corrections and work for my PhD, but I really should have joined a class early on, and also have picked up French sooner once I started to get conversational with German.

* Make more effort to be social. I feel I integrated well, but could have done more to join a local club or been more socially outgoing on arrival.

**How to be Swiss**

* have some Aromat on your table (even if it is made by Unilever). 

* Swim in a lake/river during the summer.

**Things to try:**

- If you are here more than a few weeks then try to get into every language region at least once. If you are here for a number of months then try and visit every little area. For a tiny country there is so much variation in landscape and culture.

- Wine. You can’t find it outside of the country, but Swiss wine is actually pretty good.

- Beer. [There are loads of small Breweries all over the country](https://bov.ch/beer/swissmaps.html), Switzerland apparently has the most breweries per capita in the world. Feldschlossen is the “standard” mass produced beer you find everywhere. Compared to the standards in other countries it isn’t too bad, but try and find something more interesting.

- Cheese. More than just Emmental. Try everything you can.

- Vermicelle. A desert made out of minced chestnut. Best in autumn.

**Useful quickfire points:**

- Swiss plugs are like (but not identical to) standard European ones. Standard European ones do not always fit here, come prepared with at least 1 Swiss specific plug.

- Kantons have lots of power and the way they are run can vary quite a bit. The Kanton and place you live in can have rather a large effect on the taxes, health insurance, and various quality of life factors.

- Catholics kantons have far more official holidays (on such days the shops in protestant kantons will fill up with shoppers from the surrounding kantons). Swiss holidays fall on a date, not day of the week, and many firms make bridge days for holidays on a Tuesday or Thursday. This means that year to year the number of official holidays you have can vary from almost none, to having what feels like the the whole of May off work. The absolute worst is holidays on a Saturday when you miss the day off, and all the bloody shops are closed.

- Look into at least getting the Half-Tax train pass even if you don’t plan to take public transport too often - it applies to most cable cars and ships too. Combined with supersaver tickets on the SBB app you can buy tickets for specific trains at quieter times for 25% of the normal cost. If you live with someone else who has it then you get a discount. Same with the GA: my girlfriend is a student, and I live with her, so we both save about a third off the GA.

- Name is last name, not first name (vorname), in German. I ruined countless forms until I got used to that.

- The Swiss 1 looks like an upside down V at times. That caused some confusion too.

- Look into [Reka money](https://reka.ch/en/rekamoney/seiten/reka-money.aspx). It is basically “voucher” money that is usable for leisure and travel in Switzerland (accommodation, food, transport, activities). You can’t use it everywhere, but you can get it at as little as 80% of the cost in CHF. Saving 20% off travel inside Switzerland is very nice. For best results see if your company has an account in place to help you get the checks or a savings account (mine gave it out as a summer holiday bonus). If you do use the banknote like checks bear in mind that you often don’t get change from them, so prepare a mix of the checks and coins to cover the full cost.

- Charity shops are not a thing like they are in the UK. So cheap and easy 2nd hand things are not always so easy to find.

- Asterix and Obelix is rather popular here. Brush up on that for Switzerland and your country to understand the references.

- If you are swapping the side of the road you drive on, then try and cycle rather than drive as much as possible at first. It is much easier to quickly dash onto the pavement when you go wrong on a bike than with a car (maybe best if you stick to simple quiet roads). Cycling on the right helped me clear my left-sided instincts out so when I finally drove on the right it was natural.

**Not so useful points:**

- You will spend the first few months with a Swiss kezboard mixing up the z and y kezs.

7k973s,3,2017-12-16,Does this sound like a good plan? (College Student),NoLawNOLA,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/7k973s/does_this_sound_like_a_good_plan_college_student/,"Hi all. I've been interested in becoming an actuary as of late.

I've been directionless for most of my life in terms of careers, but have always been able to achieve academically.

A little about me: I am very math oriented, I hate studying liberal arts. I currently attend Tulane University and am majoring in Finance and Math. I am an independent learner, and prefer learning material on my own rather than from a teacher in a classroom. Also, math has always been my favorite subject, and the business courses I have taken in college have been the ones I have enjoyed the most and excelled at the most. After talking on the phone with a few actuaries that my school connected me with, I am pretty confident I want to pursue this career. (But let me know if it sounds like a bad idea lol).

Anyways, I have not taken a single exam. I am currently finishing my first semester of sophomore year, and am looking ahead to summer. Now, I want to go abroad, but not necessarily during the school year. I was looking to go abroad this summer to a couple of places, and spend my summer traveling rather than working, as I don't think I will get the opportunity again (I spent last summer taking way too many classes).

I was wondering if I should try to go abroad, or pursue an actuarial internship? Will it hurt me too much to not have an internship down at this point (I know the answer is probably no, but I'm still worried). Additionally, I would LOVE to intern somewhere. Nothing would make me happier. However, I think it is too late in the process to obtain an internship, unfortunately (unless anyone here knows of any opportunities!).

So would it be best to go abroad? I was thinking of doing a 3-4 week abroad trip through my school, possibly birthright, and maybe a short program volunteering in another country. I've never been outside of the US (with the exception of Canada) and am eager to do it. However, I would be just as happy crunching numbers and learning the ins and outs at an insurance company. :)


I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I'm just kind of looking to spell everything out/receive feedback to see if this makes sense, as its all jumbled in my head right now.

So, I'm here for any advice, wisdom, literally anything anyone here can tell me to help me. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Thank you!

Details, scenes, and more inside.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7k98es/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood afternoon DPP. My name is Jeremy and as the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.
A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.
Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.
Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.
Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.
Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.
Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.
You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

Now for this idea, there are many different opportunities, of course there's the boss, coworker, intern, secretary ideas. But maybe give some love to the other guys, the janitors, warehouse employees, and whatever other jobs you could think of? I would be willing to take on more dominant roles like boss/manager, but I definitely play better when I'm sub. But, each to their own.

I would definitely call myself a sub, but, for the correct scene I would be more than willing to attempt a dominant role, although don't expect too much dominance from me haha. 

My kinks would be rough sex, anal, dirty talking, spanking, hair pulling, light biting, light slapping, risky sex/hold the moan, cheating, rimjobs, footplay, clothed sex, ageplay, interracial, larger men, cream pies, facials, being man handled and being bent over.

My limits being animals, rape, bondage (the whips and chains stuff doesn't do it for me), toiletplay, vomit, snuff, hard violence (slapping is as far as I'll go), slavery and gore. If it's not mentioned in this paragraph, feel free to suggest it, I'll more than likely be on board.

If I'm taking on the role of myself,I will happily give you a relatively detailed description of jolly old me if you'd like one? But I wouldn't mind one in return too?

Now for this idea, I'm totally up for it being a quick one and done, I understand that some people want to have a quick roleplay to blow their load before bed. But, I'm also more than willing for a slower paced, longer term roleplay. I like to think I can handle both of them pretty well with the correct partner.

As for characters, I'd love to have some of your pretences, and eventually come up with a character that is perfect for you.

So yeah, if you're interested in this kinda thing, please message me with either; a character description of who you'd like to play, a scene idea, some kinks, or just a general addition to the roleplay that we could incorporate? Thanks.

Ella."
7ka8sf,1,2017-12-16,M4A - TV Comedies (and Other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ka8sf/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

----

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

You will be missed. All the musicians, technicians and visitors of the venue will remind you for your great cooking skills and the harsh, but funny jokes. 
We shared our love for Donald Duck, jazz music, walks in the nature and great food. We used to look at all the people that came to the concerts, check out their habits, clothes and joke about the upper class customers that would demand better service. You rocked the kitchen man, all by yourself. Made dinner for 30/40 customers in no time and dreamed about owning a big restaurant with a big kitchen, so you could get some rest now and then.
I enjoyed working with you. Although I was just another intern, you were always on my mind when we where sound checking. Knowing you would be pissed if dinner would be a few minutes earlier.
I underwent a brain surgery and was in recovery for the last month, I didn't really know that you and your car went missing since end of October. The newsflash hit me hard in the tears just right now. Hope you don't mind, you'll probably joke about it anyway.

I hope your dog gets just as much love as you used to give him and hope that you can find a nice place to lay your head to rest. 
I knew about your financial situation and seen your line of work you don't have to apologize for what you've done (if my assumption is correct).

Rest in peace bud, I hope your girlfriend family and co-workers get to know what you've been up to for the time you went missing, it'll give some clarity when they'll think about you in a couple years."

These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I don't have an exact idea here but I am a dom top here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

7kam7w,3,2017-12-16,STD or other options- Intern,drArtem3s,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/7kam7w/std_or_other_options_intern/,"Hi, I'm weighing options. I have no savings and need to pay rent to stay in my city. Moving back in with my parents is not an acceptable option for a variety of reasons I won't get into here.

I currently have an internship offer that pays fairly well and will contribute towards building my resume in my field (engineering, no degree). However, I'm not confident in my ability to drive or perform cognitively due to recent events, patterns, and the timeline of doctor appointments.

I am also interviewing for non engineering/service industry jobs where I wouldn't need to drive. However, obviously the money is less and there is still no guarantee that I will be able to perform (I tend to need hospitalization when things get bad). Also as potentially as a part time I wouldn't get any benefits?

So question: if I do the internship (and I believe I get all the same insurance benefits as a full time employee), and I end up unable to work for several weeks or more, do I just end up unemployed or would I be eligible for short term disability benefits? I've read that typically the employee needs to return to work in order to get the payouts. Could they just end my internship prematurely?

I want to ask HR but I'm afraid they'll find an excuse to rescind my offer or pass me up for full time consideration, since I haven't started yet.

Anyone have experience with this type of situation? If it helps, in this situation I don't have a strict/set end date...

Also when should I disclose to HR, if ever?"

         think I'm a solid cadet. I'm also trying to get a cyber 
         internship this summer, but we'll see if I get selected.

7kbxs7,5,2017-12-16,INFP (m) starting to fall for an ENFJ (F),Dairunt,enfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/7kbxs7/infp_m_starting_to_fall_for_an_enfj_f/,"First of all, hi! You look great! :D

I'm not a very sociable person, in fact I'm quite shy around meeting new people, but every once in a while I step out of my comfort zone, try to ask someone out or looking for new friends, and sometimes (almost always) things don't come out as I wanted to be.

After being still emotionally numb from a failed relationship with an INFP, I met this ENFJ girl out of the blue. We studied the same career, are the same age, and there was a bit of chemistry going on (I'm trying to get better at small talk). She stayed in my city because of her job as an intern, and that internship was just ending. The situation rose so I could talk to her just the week before she went back to her city (we live 3 hours away). 

I knew it was possibly the last time I would ever see her so, even if I was still burnt out from my previous try a couple of months ago, I tried the always-damned small talk. Surprisingly she was uniquely receptive about me and we talked for hours straight until late at night.

I've learned about her life, her friends, her past relationships and she knows most of my life's stories; I know that it's part of her personality to be so outgoing but it something that struck to me, as I've never met (or rather have a good talk with) an ENFJ so it was... fresh; specially after coming from another INFP.

Now, after what her experiences told me I'm 100% sure I'll ask her out once she has business in my city (which probably she will, she lives in a rural area and will start working fairly soon); so my plan right now is to keep talking to her every day until 2-3 AM as I've done until now, know more of her and make her see that she can trust me with personal stories and thought-provoking introspecction, and when she's in town casually ask her out.

Now, as I've said before, while I'm getting an idea of who she is, I would like some feedback on how should I approach things, specially because I've been with extroverted people before, but never at the other end of the spectrum, and how someone as imperceptible and shy person as me can compare to someone who just seems to give a sparkle of life on everything and everyone she stumbles upon.

Thanks for your time. I appreciate any feedback."
7kc1ev,2,2017-12-17,[M4F] Is this really part of the job?,ThisIsDark,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7kc1ev/m4f_is_this_really_part_of_the_job/,"So I'm really into the idea of corrupting a super naive/oblivious girl right now. Naturally most of them will be dub-con but we can play it in a consensual light too. I have a few ideas for this:

**The Sister**

So you'd be my sister and you take up a sport, football, gymnastic, ballet, etc. One day you come home and you're just incredibly sore. Usually our mother would give you a massage, run a bath for you, etc. However she's visiting family right now, it's only you and I in the house. So of course you ask me, your big bro, to give you a massage. Things start off normal, get those sore muscles worked. However when a man massages you it's different. Maybe it's my smell, my hormones or just the feeling of stronger rougher hands, you start to feel something. Then it comes 'Hey big bro I'm getting this tingly feeling between my legs and it feels really weird.' You drop the bomb on me. Truth is I always wanted to fuck you but never got a good chance. Now that you were offering yourself up to me I wouldn't say no. Time for big bro to educate his sis.

**The Student**

I'm a university professor and you are my student. You're an absolute A+ student however I don't think you're living up to your potential. Your potential as a slut! You have the hottest body in the entire class but you are an incredible prude! So I fake some evidence and accuse you of plagiarism on a paper and threaten you with expulsion. I offer you a deal if you come to my house and we have some 'lessons in morality'; I'll let you redo the paper and give you a pass. However these lessons are obviously just a cover up. Alone in my private quarters I'll convince you of some 'stress relief' techniques. I'm looking to incorporate some hypnosis and possible drugs into this too. This can be a long term.

**The Intern**

I'm a high level manager at a finance company. I hire you as my 'personal assistant'. You're a super sheltered girl and this is your first job so you do just about everything and everything I ask you to. I notice this and start taking things a little further. I'm 'clumsy' and drop things a lot so I make you bend over and pick them up. Maybe sometimes I 'accidentally' bump into you and your shirt gets wet and I can see everything. When you come in I have you feel you up because it's a 'security check'. This one I prefer to be a long term roleplay. I want to gradually escalate how far I can push you until I can come up with a reason for fucking you that a naive/oblivious girl would think acceptable.

**The maid**

Very similar to the intern prompt however in the workplace we have to sneak around more. In my home, well I can get a lot more daring. This one would be faster and would include the cute outfits of course.

**The Gymnast**

I'd be your coach, and honestly speaking you're under performing. You know it, I know it, the team knows it. So I come up to you and offer some 'extra lessons'. Lessons that will really 'stretch you out'. This will move at a medium ish speed. There's going to be a lot of touching, a lot of 'here let me help you stretch'. Which is really just me putting you in sex positions and dry humping you. Then I'll say something like 'oh I found the problem! You're too wet!' You have no idea what that even means so I take this chance to 'educate' you. The sexual frustration you're feeling impacts your performance, and as your coach I need to keep you in tip top position. Personally.

**The Therapist**

You've started seeing a therapist for recurring nightmares you've been having. What the nightmares are can be decided by you. My conclusion will be that you have a sort of trauma from your childhood so I put you under a little hypnosis to make you mentally regress. While you're under that state you've forgotten all about decorum and start doing things that would be considered highly inappropriate. Maybe you start taking your clothes off just because, or you come and sit on my lap, or you start playing with your tits a lot because you don't remember having those great funbags. Of course I can't resist, I mean you won't remember anything when you wake up right?

Hope to hear from you!"
7kc57f,1,2017-12-17,ShrekVito: A love story on the set of Twins 2,mamamiafanculofica,Slazo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slazo/comments/7kc57f/shrekvito_a_love_story_on_the_set_of_twins_2/,"It was a warm summer day when Danny DeVito walked onto the set of Twins II. A cavalcade of non-union crew workers, scriptwriters, and top-grossing actors swarmed the Universal Studios, making it hard for Danny to bustle his way to Czechoslovakian-born Canadian film producer and director Ivan Reitman, who is best known for his comedy work on films such as Meatballs, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2, and of course the classic 1988 masterpiece that is Twins. Twins was such a universally loved sucess that in the year 2015, the film executives decided to make a sequel.

""Hey Ivan, what am I supposed to be doin' right now?"" asked DeVito in his surly, sexy New Jersey accent.

""We are about to shoot the scene where you and Schwarzenegger have to fight the evil alien mastermind."" Ivan replied in his friendly, but not too friendly voice.

Danny began to get very excited at this prospect. It was the action ending sequence with aliens that made Danny so willing to sign onto the film in the first place. Danny began walking over to the Super Spacemarch Station set when he felt a sharp pain shoot across his face. Suddenly Danny was on the floor screeching in pain while a moist black sickness seeped into his clothes.

""Oh my, are you ok!?"" A musty voice cried out in a heavy Scottish accent

""Yeah, I'll be fine"" said Danny as he mustered himself to his feet. Danny looked up to see a beautiful man, standing 8-feet tall.

It took a minute for Danny to piece together what happened; The Scottish lad was an intern working on the set of Twins II. He was trying to deliver his coffee when his leg had ended up in the proximity of Danny's beautiful Hollywood mug, spilling the contents of the coffee cups on Danny. It's a miracle I survived that unfortunate injury, thought Danny, his knee is the same height as my face.

""Is everything alright?"" Ivan said as he rushed to DeVito and the unnamed enigma Scottish lad. ""Do I need to fire this intern?""

""Everything's fine Ivan,"" retorted Danny ""There's no need to fire anyone today. I'll be fine, just let me go to my trailer to clean up.""

""Ok. We'll schedule to shoot this scene tomorrow morning. Be ready.""

Danny made his way to his large studio trailer before disrobing his coffee stained polo shirt, exposing his sexy, well-toned stomach. The years had made Danny's physique flabby and fleshy, but he was still very attractive for a man of his age. Danny found a towel in his trailer bathroom and rang the gooey, black substance from his thick coarse chest hair. For a reason unknown to Danny, he felt tempted to taste the ebony elixir. He took the hairy, moist towel and stuffed the entire thing in his mouth. How queer, Danny thought, It tastes just like onions.

Suddenly a chill ran through the air like a marathon runner runs through a track. The scent of onions pulsed through the air in an erotic aroma that made Danny pull down his britches and whip his long, uncircumcised penis in his hand.

""Who's there?"" Danny asked while stroking his dick in a classy way.

A ghostly, Scottish voice replied ""Oooooh Danny. Have you forgotten me already?""

Danny turned around to find himself face to knee with the 8-foot whelp of an intern that had spilled the coffee on him earlier. It wasn't until this moment that Danny realized this mysterious Scottish heartthrob was green of skin. Danny had seen this face before.

""I have seen your face before. Who could you be?""

""Oh, you may have seen me in a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy-comedy film produced by PDI/DreamWorks, released by DreamWorks Pictures, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, featuring the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. It's entitled… Shrek.""

Upon hearing those words, Danny fell to his knees. ""Oh Shrek,"" he cried ""How did I not recognize you?""

Shrek took his long, penis-like fingers and raised Danny's head. ""It's ok little one. We all make mistakes. I will forgive you… If you will suck my penis.""

""Ok"" replied Danny.

Danny got to his feet and tried to undo the massive lace on Shrek's sexy alluring pants. It was like a small child trying to reach for a cookie jar on top of a refrigerator.

""Let me help you with that."" Shrek snapped his fingers, and suddenly Danny and Shrek were 100% naked. It was awesome.

Shrek's massive donger reached all the way to the floor. Danny DeVito tried to put it in his mouth, but it was hopeless.

""It won't fit."" Danny said hopelessly. Danny loved Shrek, and wanted to give him sexual pleasure, but he could not suffice.

""It's ok little one. You do have one other hole, remember?""

Shrek bent Danny upon the bed. A sudden, sharp pain swept across Danny DeVito's butt, followed by a wave of orgasmic pleasure. It hurts, but I do it for Shrek.

""Oh yes Shrek, put your pee-pee deeper in my booty hole"" Danny cried out.

Shrek replied with a laugh. ""Pee-Pee? My Pee-Pee is not in you yet. This is just a single finger."" Shrek slip his index finger out of Danny DeVito, and placed his poop-smeared hand over Danny's face. ""Try not to scream.""

Suddenly the greatest feeling of all time went over Danny DeVito. It was like Chinese food, only better. In that moment, Danny DeVito was euphoric, not because of any phony god's blessing, but by Shrek's blessing. As Shrek came a thick, green, oniony semen, Danny began to feel a sudden power surge go throughout his entire body, not just his anus. At that moment Danny passed out.

When Danny arose the following moment, Shrek was gone. Danny got to his feet and began looking around his apartment for proof that last night had not been a satisfying wet dream, but had instead been a testimony of true love. Suddenly, a spurge came out of Danny's rear end. Danny reached his hand inside his own ass crack and took a handful of the anal contents. Danny brought the substance to his face. Green he though, bringing the gooey substance to his lips, and it tastes like onions. With that, Danny was certain that last night had been real.

Danny walked into his bathroom to behold a pleasureful sight in the mirror. Danny DeVito's hair had turned blonde. His normally balding hair was now shooting up in anime-like spikes. Danny's normal attire of polo shirts and jeans had become a long, flowing robe of yellow. This could mean only one thing, Danny thought, smiling. Shrek's cum has turned me into a Super Saiyan.

Danny DeVito's last thoughts where of Shrek's cum before he blasted through his trailer roof to fight crime.

The End… For now."

http://archive.fo/Mo75Y

She claimed replies to her initial tweet contained the examples of such totally real proven people who were criminally charged 

http://archive.fo/wOvhc

Now remember these are people Thorne Melcher is now presenting as rapists / sexual abusers or people who are convicted of child sex offence related to Gamergate.

Links to the archive where the accounts making claims, or in some cases making sarcastic comments that anti GG didn't pick up on have over 2,500 followers as per the rules. otherwise cropped screenshots.


* [Ethan Ralph](http://archive.is/Z01AC) - because apparently drunkenly assaulting a police officer is now a rape / sexual assault charge?

https://imgur.com/a/K4ryx

* Kevin Boellart - because apparently he was GG because revenge porn is GG now?

* Some guy convicted of terrorism, this is likely Joshua Goldberg who had 20+ online personas 1 of which made 5 tweets about gamergate, multiple of which were also writers for feminist website. Ignore that last part and that it was seemingly one of his other 20+ personas inciting violence that got him this charge, nope he tweeted about Gamergate so he's totally a member of GG or something. 

* a person running for congress (possibly Roy Moore, because apparently he's Gamergate now)

* Jonathan Monsarrat (I don't care if it's spelled wrong he doesn't deserve that level of care)- because apparently school shootings are Gamergate now or something?

https://imgur.com/a/OwTOw

* Mike Chernovich - you know despite literally 0 charges

* Edgar Maddison - the guy who went to a Pizza restaurant with a loaded gun to investigate the Pizzagate claims. Clearly he's gamergate because gamergate had the whole Pineapple Pizza argument so Gamergate is responsible for the Pizza gate conspiracy and all actions taken relating to it.

https://imgur.com/a/XNkMY

* Sargon - because he yelled at a kid while drunk and playing video games. You know ignore the lack of charges or anything or fact no possible charges can really be applied because there was no crime.

https://imgur.com/a/pQizb

* Davis—Charles - because Milo = GG so being an intern for Milo must mean he supported GG and was a prominent member of GG

https://imgur.com/a/yUSNh

* Fredrick Brennan - because according to people in the replies 8 chan is a CP website that also runs sex tourism ventures.

https://imgur.com/a/MoYu6

* Adam Baldwin - Again ignore the fact there's no charges he endorsed Roy Moore so apparently that's a criminal charge?

https://imgur.com/a/Ltpzx

*  Moot - because Gamergate started on 4chan so that's a criminal conviction for rape apparently 

https://imgur.com/a/mWLYZ

* Milo Yiannopoulos -again ignore the fact there are 0 actual charges against him at all.

* Amos Yee - A youtuber who criticised the former prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, shortly after he died and went to jail for it (which human rights groups are protesting including Amnesty international) 

https://imgur.com/a/gc2nh

* Harry Lockheart - likely Harry Lockhart the fictional character from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, but don't let him being fictional fool you he was totally a member of GG and totally charged with Rape or Sexual abuse or possession of CP because Thorne Melcher said the people were listed in replies to her initial tweet and isn't willing to define who she's accusing.

 https://imgur.com/a/kcJjO

* The phantom Pedophile no-one will actually name at all.


So yeh that's the list and totally true list. Just don't ask for literally any evidence to support any of this or anything just Listen and Believe ;)

I'm a 24 year old gay cis-male.  I came out this year publicly although I'd been out to my friends for a year or two prior to that.  It's been a long journey of just coming to terms with my sexuality due to the religious brainwashing I was subjected to growing up.  I'm still sort of questioning a lot of things to be honest.  And I realize that it's not something where I can just snap my fingers and have all my questions magically answered but perhaps you'll allow me a venting?  I identify as gay because I feel that it fits me best but it doesn't exactly explain the crushes I've had in the past on a few girls.  I think perhaps I could be like 80-90% gay... Anyways, my preference is for men.  Moving on to my next issue.  I basically feel comfortable as a guy... In a way. Like, I don't experience what I hear other people talking about as dysphoria in regards to my genitals. However, I am exploring my feminine side and I don't really know what it means Despite never being super masculine, I feel comfortable as being a guy.  I do however enjoy presenting as a bit more feminine and I don't actually know what it means for me.   Maybe by me writing down my thoughts, some of you who experience similar things could help explain it to me?  Growing up, I spent lots of time with girls as friends and women of the family.  I spent time with them shopping and such.  I don't know anything about makeup or fashion though.  Lol.  Like I start drawing blanks if someone asks me if something goes with something else.  But when I was a kid I remember getting my ass whipped because I snuck into my older sister's room and painted my nails with her stuff.  I remember being yelled at about how boys don't do that.  Granted, I had pretty fucked up parents but I won't go into that today.  Last summer I got to leave the region for a summer internship and while I was there, I kind of sheepishly asked some of the girls there to let me try on some of their makeup and stuff (eyeliner, eyeshadow) because I was out to everyone there and had always wanted to try it.  Something just clicked with me.  I felt good wearing it.  I loved having makeup on.  Now that I'm out and estranged from my parents, I get to do stuff that I want.  I paint my nails on a regular basis and I even wear lipstick occasionally.  Something about it is very freeing to me.  I don't know if it's because in a way it's me rebelling against the toxic things that I was taught and the hateful people formerly in my life, or if I truly am an effeminate guy and this is me physically expressing what's on the inside.  The irony is that I'm an extremely outdoorsy person and spend lots of time getting dirty out in the woods and stuff.  So you might see me with my nails painted and wearing purple lipstick and at the same time i'm looking through the mud for a snake or a plant I'm searching for, etc.  I'm kind of a walking oxymoron at times.  This weekend a new friend introduced me to Justin Sayre and his order of sodomites channel on youtube and I've been binge watching.  I find him hilarious and seeing this bearded, burly guy wearing jewelry, female clothes and heels kind of opens my mind to the possibilities.  I don't know that I'm wanting to go super femme, but I do want to explore makeup more and like I saw him wearing certain feminine articles of clothing and I was like I want that!  I want to own that and wear it.  It looks nice.  It looks like me.  But I just don't actually know what this all means.  I don't really know how to best explore it.  I don't know what it's going to mean for me socially as I'm in the Deep South where people point and make rude comments if I wear lipstick to the store.  I don't know what it means in terms of WHO and WHAT I am.  I guess I experience toxicity towards feminine gay men enough that I'm scared to go down that road.  I think that's about it.  For those of you who have kept reading this far, thanks.  I've posted about this on other subs but never really got the responses I was hoping for.  I guess I've been so removed from gay culture for most of my life that it's all still a bit alien.  I feel like there's a part of me that is sorta in between genders.  But I don't know if this is just a temporary exploration thing or if it's really me.   "

I grew up in a lower middle class neighborhood. My mom grew up poor which is why we live where they do. I remember when I was really really young there would sometimes be stuff we couldn't get but that's so far back I barely remember. 

My mom works for a fortune 500. She got promoted to a position that put us in a considerably higher tax bracket. My parents paid for me to go to a 45k per year private University. They brought me a new car. Not a sports car or anything but around 15k. My mom gave me a weekly allowance of $500 so I didn't have to work and could just focus in school.

Hell, my parents were able to get me a god tier summer internship at a fortune 10 company that paid over a grand per week. This was the only job I've worked in my entire life.

I just finished my last semester of school last week. Got my grades back I'm done with school. I was actually semi worried about finding a job and whatnot. My grades are not super amazing, and I have no job history except for that god tier internship. Plus I barely have a work ethic.

Well...my aunt died last year. I got about 30k in cash from her will...I invested it in cryptocurrency and now I'm making like a grand a day doing almost nothing. 

Fuck. I'm a lucky lazy little shit.

7kct32,1,2017-12-17,Writer/Editor Seeking Untapped Artist For Non-demanding Long Term Project [Initially Unpaid/Potential Future Revenue Share],immadametal,ComicBookCollabs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComicBookCollabs/comments/7kct32/writereditor_seeking_untapped_artist_for/,"To be clear at the start: this is effectively an unpaid internship without school credit. This would be best for someone who is already pretty skilled but wants an opportunity to sharpen their abilities more and/or wants work in their portfolio. It'd be great for a high school/college student or someone with a day job that wants something to do on the side with little stress involved as it will only demand between 1-3 completed pages a week depending on the artist's comfortable work pace. I will retain complete rights to story content, but you will keep the rights to your art and as such will be granted 30% of any revenue made off your art down the road (with 30% returning to myself as the writer/editor and the other 40% returning to business practices because it is the sensible thing to do)[entirely negotiable]. If that sounds like something you are looking for keep reading.

I'm a variety writer of nearly every medium. I've done long form ghost writing, lite journalism, flash fiction, poetry, sketch comedy, and essays, but my strengths are screenplays and scripts. I even have some small time awards for some of them. I basically got tired of writing things for other people not too long ago, so I started world building like crazy and have a lot of really fleshed out interconnected stories to start working with. The main story that ties everything together is called Ex Dynamis Chaos (translates to a bounty of chaos) is already completely outlined 4 Acts, 12 issues/chapters each, variably consisting of more or less 25 pages each. It will be released as a web comic format, with 1-3 pages a week depending on the artist as stated before, until the initial story is finished. With the finishing of each issue/chapter it will be released digitally with bonuses for those who may wish to support that work and then later on in print as graphic novels after the finishing of each act. If we work together, I will give you a complete write up of the current chapter we are on and roughly drawn character designs for reference in addition to the script of the current page for consistency sake. Consistency/continuity is the thing I'm pickiest about.

It is an action/comedy story without a clearly defined genre. It is technically mostly an adventure story and follows characters and events hyperbolically based on real people and events in my own crazy life. They are a group of ""freelancers"", as they refer to themselves, that take on weird jobs that no one else would take on and things get exponentially crazier as the story goes on. I'm open to the style, but the most fitting I believe would be what I'd call ""American Manga"", which is like a mesh between the aesthetic of the West and dynamism of the East if that makes sense. I have it black and white in my head, but full color works too if you'd feel more comfortable with that. You wouldn't have to worry about lettering speech (unless you want to), but wordart and sfx would be required to learn as part of the position if you can't already. You'd also have to be able to do everything on that end, I'm not looking for an art team for this. Each phase of each page would require approval, which is why 1 page a week is the recommended pace for less experienced artists for the least stress and best time management.

I would not require a completed page before we can begin working together, but I would need require a single image from you first. You can link your portfolio if you have one and wish to, though all that matters is a I see the main characters in your style, in dynamic poses, with a common background to the story (either city, forest, warehouse, or dojo). Heights for each character on on the page. Being able to scale characters to each other and the environment is roughly important.

Links to the main characters: http://fav.me/d7dq3a2  http://fav.me/d7f7k2k  http://fav.me/d7dz9s5  http://fav.me/d7p0a3f

Other than how nitpicky it sounds up there it is a really relaxed project. I'll take care of literally everything else aside from the art. Writing, editing, posting, sharing, and all future business related stuff. If I didn't scare you away, I await to see your sample and hopefully we'll work together."
7kdjrq,1,2017-12-17,I'm [22M] suspecting dynamics of my parents [50M/F] with me and between them aren't right,PersonalRedThrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kdjrq/im_22m_suspecting_dynamics_of_my_parents_50mf/,"Some background first - I'm 22, male, from European country where family values and religion are traditionally put on pedestal. Currently studying and living with parents, no source of stable income (but working on internships during summers which gives me enough money to cover my needs).

**I will start with single incident which most likely planted seed of doubt and finally brought me here first:**

Unfortunately, few months ago my grandfather (from mother side) passed away. My mother wanted me to take communion despite knowing that my religious views are different than her, I politely declined while reassuring that it's a big loss for all of us, I will stay on her side during the whole event and I'm sure he would understand. Her reaction was very severe -  at first she tried to convince me with crying and saying how bad son I am. After this wasn't working she tried to convince me by saying how important family is, you need to put family values over your own at all times. This also wasn't working, so she got a suitcase and started packing my clothes in front of me, telling me to move out immediately. I was still holding on my decision, not commenting anything she does or say other than occasional ""I made my decision. I respect your views, but please also respect mine."". Finally when she tried to throw me out with force I gave in and took confession and later communion. During the whole situation, my father mostly passively watched, but agreed with mother. What surprises me most in this situation is that she seemingly didn't cared about rites being valid at all - I don't think these are valid without self agreement.

Another incident happened during family vacations - my mother was preparing breakfast for everyone and suddenly one of sandwiches she was preparing fell on a floor - after a short delay, she picked it up and put together with remaining sandwiches on a pile. I noticed it and obviously refused to eat by saying what I seen, which she initially shrug but as breakfast neared the end and I still haven't ate any of sandwiches, she started convincing my father that I should eat. After refusing few more times both she and father started throwing insults and cursing at me. My initial reaction was hugging to corner of a sofa I was already sitting in and asking them to stop, but finally gave in and started throwing insults back. As soon as I started, father also started hitting me. After few minutes of this and me getting more and more hugged to the corner, I finally broke down and something I don't know how to name happened - similar to epilepsy attack (I don't have epilepsy) for several seconds, followed by few minutes that felt like eternity of feeling like I'm observing my body from the outside. I couldn't talk during this time, but after several minutes I finally managed to ""wake up"" and go to my room where I was slowly regaining my senses and calming down for 2 hours. During this time, father came to lecture me twice which didn't helped at all.

Incidents at this scale are very rare, but they do happen 1 to 3 times per year. What amazes me most about them is that they often start out of very little thing and then escalate to incidents like these above. I'm pretty sure these aren't normal dynamics, but they happen so rarely that I'm not sure if they are this bad.

**Smaller things:**

* In theory I have my own room, but stuff of my mother (she is hoarding a lot of things she might need later on, but never seen her actually using them) takes roughly 1/3 of space on shelves. It's also favorite place for both of my parents to rest or sleep during the day, very often I have to ask one of them to wake up in order to be able to go to sleep. (everyone at home follows different schedules) When I say this bothers me or I need some privacy, they just ignore it.
* Mother usually gives no announcement or at most one day before something important needs to be done or family event takes place - this often leads to my father having to quit in a middle of work to ride her somewhere or go to said event. (he is self-employed and having a job which allows him to do that, but often disappointing clients in a process)
* Once per 1-2 weeks, mother takes father and sometimes me shopping. There wouldn't be anything weird in it if not the fact that it almost always leads to arguments during and after it because she spends several hours in clothing stores often not buying anything and wasting our time. Usual shopping with just my father takes 1-2 hours, together with mother 6 to 10 hours.
* Clothes again - mother have the whole (small) room filled with wardrobes of clothes she wore at just one occasion or not at all. She often buys new expensive clothes even if budget for a month is tight, which also means little to no savings.
* Mother is workaholic (usually working 6-8 hours in work and then bringing her work home and working for another 6-8 hours in home) and usually not showing any affection or interest in what me or father are doing, but when she actually does she goes into ""hug everyone no matter what they are doing"" mode which is cute sometimes, but can be dangerous when happens on stairs or she breaks something in a process.
* Father occasionally tends to call me by embarrassing names or insulting, sometimes even in public. Due to this, I tend to hide any relationships including friendships from them. (them wanting to know everything about my friends or romantic relationships doesn't help either)

Despite of all of that I have to say - there most likely is reason why my parents are together for so long (they are married since 23 years), both of them are relatively successful and I think they did a good job with my upbringing despite everything. I always had a great grades, have a passion which I'm slowly turning into a job and tends to be well paying. This adds extra doubt to everything, they successed here after all.

With all of this comes the question - what do you think about these dynamics, especially single incidents I mentioned first? Is there anything I could do to make them respect me and my privacy more without losing my identity or putting myself in a line of conflict with them?

TLDR version: mother forces me to take communion, makes a big deal out of refusing to eat food that fell on a floor and doesn't seem to respect privacy or time of both me and my father. I'm no longer sure if that's something acceptable/normal or not and how could I improve the situation."
7kdmhb,357,2017-12-17,So I fell for a weeaboo,ChrisonymusBosch,weeabootales,https://www.reddit.com/r/weeabootales/comments/7kdmhb/so_i_fell_for_a_weeaboo/,"Hey folks,  

To understand this, you're probably going to want a little background. Also, this is going to be long, and kind of depressing.  
[This is my first story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/weeabootales/comments/5rzhsa/so_i_fucked_a_weeaboo/)  
[This is the follow up to that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/weeabootales/comments/5trrsc/so_i_broke_up_with_a_weeaboo/)  
**TLDR for those that don't want to read**  
I went to my college's Japanese/anime club, and met the club's vice president: a girl named ""Mimi"". We hook up and get into a pseudo-relationship. The president of the anime club confronts me about our relationship, does not handle it well, and I ask Mimi about this. She says that she drunkenly fooled around with him and says she'll ""take care of it"". Apparently *taking care of it* meant her threatening the anime club president that I would beat him up if he bothered her again. So I talk to her about it and she begrudgingly agrees to apologize. This apology turns into a rant to him to stop chasing after her, and I bring her back to her apartment before she has a complete breakdown. This is where she asks me if I actually love her, and I tell her the truth that I don't. We talk it out, and even though we decided not to be in a relationship anymore, things still end amicably.  

***  

After Mimi and I ended our Kardashian-length relationship, things were actually going pretty well. We texted on and off and developed an odd friendship that worked better than I expected. Our career fields and interests couldn't have been more different. She was fully devoted to her Japanese skills and trying to break into the anime industry, while I was trying to be an... accountant. Despite this we would frequently vent to each other, and even though neither of us completely understood what the other was talking about it was nice to have someone that could listen without saying anything. This friendship even continued into the summer as I stayed busy with classes and an internship, while Mimi went to go study abroad in Japan.  

Mimi was living it up in Japan, judging from the barrage of snaps I received. She was constantly meeting new people and going out with them to stuff like karaoke and museums. We video chatted a few times and she genuinely looked the happiest I'd ever seen her. Clever girl even found herself a Japanese boyfriend, and any feelings of slight jealousy (okay, maybe a little stronger than slight) were overshadowed by my happiness for her.  

Unfortunately for her, Mimi’s family could only afford to send her there for the summer, and adjusting to life back home proved difficult. She couldn't spend time with all the Japanese friends she made anymore, she couldn’t handle long distance with her Japanese boyfriend and they broke up, and she stopped hanging out with any of her friends in college too. In fact, I think the only people she talked to were her family and, well, me. I constantly got messages from her about how boring America was and how much she wanted to go back. This would get pretty annoying, and we ended up getting into some petty arguments over it. I started feeling a concerned over her wellbeing since she never left her room except for the handful of times she went to class. Eventually about a month into the semester, our communications dried up as well. Two weeks of her ghosting worried me, so I went to her apartment to go see how she was doing.  

“Not well” was the answer to that. She opened the door with a blank expression, looking like she hadn’t slept in days. I walked in and it looked like she’d been playing Jumanji in her apartment. Moldy dishes, her bed covered in clothing she was too lazy to hang-up (she slept on a mat on the floor), and just general chaos. This time I just asked her straight up “what the fuck is going on with you?” Her face dropped into a melancholy frown, and as we both sat down on her musty couch, she let me know how her life spiraled this far.  

Apparently, Mimi’s grandmother (who she was very close to) passed away around the same time she stopped texting me. This compounded with her depression from not being in Japan apparently sapped her will to do anything. She admitted that I was the first person she’d talked to in 10 days, and all I could do was just stare at her in disbelief. “Fuck this, we’re going out for dinner” I told her, to which she responded with a weak “okay”. We went to the shitty diner on campus (I hoped that some classic greasy American food would make her feel better) and I tried to cheer her up as best I could. However, my arsenal of bad puns and idiot humor was exhausted without as much as a smirk. It was hard to believe that the vivacious person I’d bumped into just under a year ago was now sitting across from me in jeans and a t-shirt, gingerly eating her mac and cheese. After a silent walk back to her place I did her dishes and helped clear up some clothing so she could sleep on her actual bed. Following a “you can reach out to me anytime” spiel and the saddest hug in history, I headed back to my place.  

To my surprise, and extreme happiness, Mimi started going back to her classes and seeing her old friends. We started eating dinner together at least twice a week, and after a few sessions of that she even started laughing again. Not to say that she went back to her old ways though, Mimi became a lot less flamboyant and more subdued about almost everything. She still read her manga and watched her anime, but gone were the maid costumes and the Japenglish. Weirdly enough I kind of missed her old self. Sure she used to be loud and annoying sometimes, and she did seem a lot more mature now, but with that she now seemed to carry a sense of weariness. Our dinners were often punctuated by silence, and at times I found myself almost wishing the old Mimi would pop back in and start rambling about shit I didn’t care about.  

We sleepwalked through the rest of the semester like that, until Mimi dropped a bombshell a few weeks ago. After I knocked on her door she opened it almost immediately (it usually took her at least 30 seconds) and was beaming. She gave me a big bear hug and I squeaked out a “what’s up?” It turned out that Mimi found a job in Japan teaching English and was dropping her minor to graduate early in the winter. This news shook me so hard all I could do was stand frozen, until she said “well, aren’t you happy for me?” I responded that of course I was, but that I just wanted to make sure that she’d thought a huge decision like this through. I don’t even remember what she said during dinner, all I could think about was her leaving. It was clear why too: between the dinners and the late-night texting, I’d fallen for this girl hard.  

Unlike the last time, this attraction wasn’t focused on the physical (although dropping the maid outfit certainly helped). Throughout our dinners (which could be seen as dates in a way) I never had a single romantic thought, and until she told me she was leaving I never even imagined us getting back together. The next time we went out to eat, I pressured her on all the details under the guise of concern for her future. What I really wanted though was to somehow expose some giant flaw that would force her to give that up. That didn’t happen though, and as much as I hated to admit it she had already taken care of all of the most important aspects, and was even asking me to help her budget expenses. I kept questioning her before she finally snapped back “do you have a problem with me going?”  

There were a billion things I wanted to say to her, but she’d made this decision and it had made her genuinely happy for the first time in ages. Not to imply that I’m such a stud that she would automatically drop her plans just to be with me, but the thought of blurting my feelings out right before she heads out seemed like, to put it bluntly, a dick move. On top of that it wouldn’t go anywhere logically; neither of us could do long distance and she was dead set on living in Japan (something I couldn’t do). So, I just ended up saying “no of course not, but you know how I worry about this kind of stuff.” She accepted that answer and that settled it.  

Our last dinner was tonight, since Mimi leaves tomorrow to go back home and prepare for the move. We reminisced about all the good times, shared our excitement for the future, and it was the highlight of this dreary ass semester. The thought of not seeing her every week does fuck my shit up, but I didn’t want to burden her with that baggage. Seeing her that happy takes some of the heartache away, and time is still undefeated in that whole “healing all wounds” thing.  

***  

So before this turns into a fucking Fall Out Boy song, I’m gonna wrap it up. Sorry if this got kind of rambly and not particularly funny (or weeb related now that I mention it), but it’s almost therapeutic typing this out. I highly doubt there’ll be any updates after this, so thanks so much for reading and giving feedback. It really means a lot!"
7ke4m3,24,2017-12-17,"If the Republicans in Congress do not start their investigation of Trump's sexpolitation of women as demanded by 56 Dem congressional women, then it'll prove that they're colluding because they've a lot to hide for themselves.",ihatejoemcCarthy,democrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/7ke4m3/if_the_republicans_in_congress_do_not_start_their/,"Just like The Beatles song,""Everybody's got something to hide...."", the Republicans in the congress are acting just like what is said in that song.

By their strange behavior and by not taking any action to investigate their president Trump who they themselves know for a very long time what Trump did to hundreds of women and how he got away because of his higher position, the Republicans in the Capitol are proving to us that they among their own caucuses have been engaged in a lot of sexual exploitations of women in that building and also outside in the hotel rooms with young female and male interns for a very long time.

These Republicans are also giving a very clear picture of themselves by not going after Trump's sexploits of women which even his own daughter Ivanka hinted by saying ""there is a special place in hell for men who exploit women....."".

Yes, they're equating themselves with the Hollywood moguls who had been exploiting women and men looking jobs in movies for a long long time.

The Congressional Republicans had done exactly what we didn't think of powerful men in Hollywood could'n do after we watched all those great  Hollywood movies and wondered how fantastic these producers and directors were who could present us with such herculean movies such as ' The Hercules' itself.

But we were wrong about these men in Hollywood as we're wrong about the Republicans in congress now.

In real life the actor in the above movie should've crushed all the directors and producers like Harvey Weinstein than those characters he slayed in that movie.

Although it's been a very long time we're seeing the kind of exploitation of the women not only in Hollywood's movie industry but also in the treatment of female singers inside and outside of Los Angeles where most of the songs are recorded, but never thought we'd see the same in the president of our country and his partners in crime, the Republicans in congress.

So if we look around in this country's history of sexploitation of our female anchors in the tv industry and outside, it seems quite amazing that all these men who groped and sexually abused women with impunity were allowed to hold high positions like what Trump is holding now, the president of the United States.

I know I had to bring the subject of Trump who openly bragged in that ""Access Hollywood"" video about his sexploits with the women with some pointed advice to Billy Bush about how he should grab the women's body parts just as he did in his real life and was proud to say in that video ""they say nothing because I'm a celebrity"".

So this move by 56 Congressional Democratic women who're asking House to investigate Trump, after they successfully removed men like Senator Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers from their party, is a welcoming move as many of those women themselves felt like millions of women around the world what it liked to be groped by powerful men like Trump in their lifetime.

7kfo4f,0,2017-12-17,Being in a relationship for 3 years has numbed me [20M]. I'm single now - how on earth do I actually go from an acquaintance to a friend to a partner? I have no idea and it's killing me,cluelessknob,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kfo4f/being_in_a_relationship_for_3_years_has_numbed_me/,"Well this is depressing.

I was in a relationship for three years with a girl I met in college. We met when she approached me and asked me to tutor her in some programming course we've had - and then we hit it off. 

We've since went our separate ways, 4 months ago actually. I guess we were young when we met and the love has fizzled out since but what can you do.

To get over the breakup (even though it was mutual), I put my head down to work. I work as a developer, so I decided to focus on my career in order to heal, not go around searching for rebounds.

Well things were good for these last four months, I was doing great, and then a weird thing happened to me. Let's rewind to couple of months ago, when a friend of mine asked me to help on creating a curriculum to internship at my company. He's already putting overtime and wouldn't be able to finish in time: ""Sure"", I said. I'd work for 12 hours every day but who the fuck cares, it's actually a good thing.

And I did a great job on creating an architecture and stuff, I've presented it to our interns etc... I really didn't memorize a single face there.

Scroll forward to bloody YESTERDAY. The same friend, who's a mentor in this internship, asked me if I wanted to join him and the interns at a teambuilding event - a one night party on a local mountain, since you know, I'm really a part of this internship and everyone knows me. And I went for it, I needed a drunken night so badly, haven't had one in ages.

There were around 20 people there, and I was just minding my own business when a most fucking gorgeous girl I've EVER seen walked in. She was an intern as well, and she was so cute. A year younger than me, we've already met.. what could go wrong?

I wanted to approach her, say a word or two but... I couldn't. Well I could, when all of the group was talking we'd exchange a word or two, but I couldn't get together with her alone. I froze. What the fuck is happening with me? Not that I was scared or anything, no no, I literally didn't know what to say or what to do.

I've later realized she's not a drinker, not a smoker, very religious etc, and I guess we wouldn't work but that's not a point. Point is, I'm completely NUMB when it comes to meeting new girls: approaching them, getting to know them, becoming friend, entering a relationship... the entire process is unknown to me now.

How the fuck is this possible? I'm a very sociable person, but I guess being in a relationship for so long has deprived me of a certain skillset, and I have no idea how to learn it all over again...

Has anyone been stuck like this, like I am? What did you do? How did you meet new people...

**tl;dr**: I was in a relationship for 3 years. We've broken up 4 months ago. I focused on my career and went on a teambuilding with a bunch of interns at my company. Among 20 people was such a beautiful girl that I wanted to approach but I didn't know how. I have no idea how to meet someone, approach them, get to know them later on, become friends, enter a relationship... I literally need a ""how to get a gf"" guide, for fucks sake."
7kfzs2,2,2017-12-17,F4M - Gangbang the Boss,millirette,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7kfzs2/f4m_gangbang_the_boss/,"Kinks: ENF, public humiliation, gangbang/DP, forced lesbianism, BBC, forced orgasm, non-con

Limits: animals, scat, major violence

As a CEO at just 30, I should be one of the most admired women in the industry. But my unapologetic arrogance and belittling attitude to others around me has instead made one of the most despised. My employees hate me, my rivals hate me - and I relish the fact.

I take delight in criticising and insulting my 'underlings', but from time to time I pick a particular employee to single out with particular cruelty. Currently it is a young female intern who we have been assigned as receptionist. Since she started a week ago, I have taken considerable pride in making her leave in tears three times.

Unfortunately, one of my employees has some very sinister contacts. They make contact with a local gang, who in return for the royalties they will get in selling footage of what they plan on doing, agree to break into the office after everyone else has left, kidnap me, and take me to their warehouse.

There, they will break my arrogance and defiance completely. I will be stripped, slapped, mocked, belittled, and subjected to a night of unspeakable sexual humiliation at the hands of multiple powerful, hung, black men. Deepthroat, double penetration, forced orgasms - and all of it on camera.

The only slight hitch with the plan is that when they arrive, my receptionist is there too. So they kidnap her too, and I have to share my humiliation with her...

While I am interested in forced lesbianism, the focus will still mostly be on me.

If this would interest you, and if you can **write long, detailed responses without narrating my character's actions**, please please respond!"
7kg9lj,1,2017-12-17,[M4F] Is this really part of the job?,ThisIsDark,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7kg9lj/m4f_is_this_really_part_of_the_job/,"So I'm really into the idea of corrupting a super naive/oblivious girl right now. Naturally most of them will be dub-con but we can play it in a consensual light too. I have a few ideas for this:

**The Sister**

So you'd be my sister and you take up a sport, football, gymnastic, ballet, etc. One day you come home and you're just incredibly sore. Usually our mother would give you a massage, run a bath for you, etc. However she's visiting family right now, it's only you and I in the house. So of course you ask me, your big bro, to give you a massage. Things start off normal, get those sore muscles worked. However when a man massages you it's different. Maybe it's my smell, my hormones or just the feeling of stronger rougher hands, you start to feel something. Then it comes 'Hey big bro I'm getting this tingly feeling between my legs and it feels really weird.' You drop the bomb on me. Truth is I always wanted to fuck you but never got a good chance. Now that you were offering yourself up to me I wouldn't say no. Time for big bro to educate his sis.

**The Student**

I'm a university professor and you are my student. You're an absolute A+ student however I don't think you're living up to your potential. Your potential as a slut! You have the hottest body in the entire class but you are an incredible prude! So I fake some evidence and accuse you of plagiarism on a paper and threaten you with expulsion. I offer you a deal if you come to my house and we have some 'lessons in morality'; I'll let you redo the paper and give you a pass. However these lessons are obviously just a cover up. Alone in my private quarters I'll convince you of some 'stress relief' techniques. I'm looking to incorporate some hypnosis and possible drugs into this too. This can be a long term.

**The Intern**

I'm a high level manager at a finance company. I hire you as my 'personal assistant'. You're a super sheltered girl and this is your first job so you do just about everything and everything I ask you to. I notice this and start taking things a little further. I'm 'clumsy' and drop things a lot so I make you bend over and pick them up. Maybe sometimes I 'accidentally' bump into you and your shirt gets wet and I can see everything. When you come in I have you feel you up because it's a 'security check'. This one I prefer to be a long term roleplay. I want to gradually escalate how far I can push you until I can come up with a reason for fucking you that a naive/oblivious girl would think acceptable.

**The maid**

Very similar to the intern prompt however in the workplace we have to sneak around more. In my home, well I can get a lot more daring. This one would be faster and would include the cute outfits of course.

**The Gymnast**

I'd be your coach, and honestly speaking you're under performing. You know it, I know it, the team knows it. So I come up to you and offer some 'extra lessons'. Lessons that will really 'stretch you out'. This will move at a medium ish speed. There's going to be a lot of touching, a lot of 'here let me help you stretch'. Which is really just me putting you in sex positions and dry humping you. Then I'll say something like 'oh I found the problem! You're too wet!' You have no idea what that even means so I take this chance to 'educate' you. The sexual frustration you're feeling impacts your performance, and as your coach I need to keep you in tip top position. Personally.

**The Therapist**

You've started seeing a therapist for recurring nightmares you've been having. What the nightmares are can be decided by you. My conclusion will be that you have a sort of trauma from your childhood so I put you under a little hypnosis to make you mentally regress. While you're under that state you've forgotten all about decorum and start doing things that would be considered highly inappropriate. Maybe you start taking your clothes off just because, or you come and sit on my lap, or you start playing with your tits a lot because you don't remember having those great funbags. Of course I can't resist, I mean you won't remember anything when you wake up right?

Hope to hear from you!"
7kgg97,2,2017-12-17,M4F - Roll Tide,Medium__Arousal,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7kgg97/m4f_roll_tide/,"*A great convergence of ignorance, poverty, and depravity -- or, 'how I had the time of my life in Alabama.'*

I dreaded my arrival from the moment of its conception, a little over 37 weeks ago.  I knew next to nothing about the place, somewhere south of Birmingham, of which I also had next to no knowledge.  I was aware only of the stereotypes.  The moronic drawl that is the sonic equivalent of drooling, the tendency towards obesity, and the dual love of God and sinning.

Those views blanketed the entirety of the south, with slight variations and additions.  For some reason I believed Georgia had less incest than Mississippi, that a Louisiana native was likelier more stupid than a Texan.  Of course no one was more inbred and less learned than my second cousin Sheila.  And why I had to spend six weeks visiting her and the lost (and best forgotten) branch of my mothers family down in good ol' 'Bama was beyond me.

Sheila was 22, a victim of rape (part of God's plan) -- one that went unreported (wrong to ruin a young mans life for one mistake) -- and a single mother.  These were the things that defined her for the past seven years.  I'd done my best to ignore her vague appeals for interaction in the form of Facebook status updates.  But then the private messages came.

Her words made my skin crawl.  They were cloying and I could hear her accent in them.  She was still 10 years old in my head, despite the pictures I'd seen, the hateful thoughts I'd seen her share so easily.  She was family still, no matter how distant, and I gave her my number and delayed every single proposal she made to catch up in person.

To my utter and complete astonishment, it was me who ended up making arrangements to visit her.  I was scrambling to find a job at the end of school and managed to snag an internship with a meagre stipend.  Six months of work in the deep south, in a small trailer where all work orders and billing were processed from branches across the country.  

I told her I'd be in Alabama, working only a dozen miles from her home, and that we would finally get to visit like she'd been begging for.  

I booked my flight and dreaded the dwindling moments until I would be stuck in a sweaty, bigoted, Jesus-praising pool of tepid shit.

7kgisz,2,2017-12-17,"If a woman in scared of you but slanders you behind your back whenever she can, does she really hate you? Or is there some attraction?",Patrizia80,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/7kgisz/if_a_woman_in_scared_of_you_but_slanders_you/,"I know she’s mad at me for several reasons:

- I always hold her accountable for her mistakes.

- I never give her shit (time, help, etc) for free unless I absolutely have to.

- I refuse to treat her differently just because she’s a woman, and she doesn’t get it. She earns dollars and she has a brain, like we all do, therefore, she’ll be treated like a normal person.

- I called bullshit on several attempts on her part to dump work onto other beta coworkers and called her out on it in front of our boss. Stuff like “you can’t seriously expect the intern to explain to you (“senior”) how to do your job, right?”

After a few rough clashes (she tried to act like a bitch behind my back and I forced her to come out), she’s now scared of me.

Last time I reprimended her for work stuff (she made 3 different mistakes on a row because she was too lazy to do exactly what I told her to do), she was trembling while I explained to her why she screwed up and why it cannot happen again: mistakes are ok, but making them because you were lazy as fuck and preferred to chat on your computer, fuck no...

At the same time, she’s furious behind my back. Every little thing triggers her anger, and she vents with friends and coworkers in a pretty petty fashion (physical insults, manhood attacks, etc).

She’s married (recently), and is doing her job until her husband can unblock his career and support her ass, or at least that’s my best guess. In regards to me, do you think she really hates me? Or is it possible she’s attracted and can’t do anything about it?

I don’t care about it beyond simple curiosity, about women and TRP in general. Thanks!"

So I am beginning my internship in a few weeks at a post production house as well as running my own business on the side with my business partner. So I have a few questions when it comes to working in Post Production:
1. What are your schedules like and are there frequent late nights
2. How do you make sure you have a healthy work life balance
3. How do you manage your personal relationships if work is consuming the majority of your day schedule.

I'm only asking because I tend to worry that I won't find any time to myself and my other commitments if i'm constantly overworked.

Any piece of advice I am willing to take.

Thanks all!"

7kh8x6,3,2017-12-17,"Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [24 M] 3 years, I am controlling and possessive help!",throwawaypopeye,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kh8x6/me_22_f_with_my_boyfriend_24_m_3_years_i_am/,"I have recently come to the conclusion that I am very controlling and insecure in my relationship. 

I initially would never had thought of myself as controlling. But after many weekends where I would get extreme anxiety if my boyfriend was out drinking I started to wonder if this was normal. 

The usual sequence of events goes like this: He is out with friends/workmates, and so is not texting etc. I start to get anxiety particularly if I am alone. Begin to text him and get really mean, tell him that because he is out with other people he doesn't care about me. Call him repeatedly telling him he's hurting me. At this point I am genuinely worked up and upset, even though I know I am being completely controlling and abusive. In the moment I find it so hard to step outside this cycle. 

I thought that these were the only times we have issues, but I have noticed I am controlling in other ways. For example I am constantly making 'suggestions' on how he can improve or what he should do in situations. Which in itself is not bad, but how worked up and emotional I get when he doesn't agree or perhaps may not want to do that is completely unhealthy and controlling too. 

For example in his family they don't usually do Xmas gifts but they are gifting to each other this year. I suggested he get his parents something as they have supported him throughout an internship this year. When he grumbled that he had no cash, I began to get upset and push my point which only upset him. This is a perfect example of when I should have said my point then let him make his own decision. Instead I tried to control the situation and had to be right when it made us both unhappy. 

I love him so much and I know he loves me too. I have become like this over this last due partially due to how controlling towards me he was during our LDR (1 year, we are in the same city now and he never does anything like that) but also I suspect my insecurities and attachment issues. 

Are there any strategies or ways that anyone can think of for me to deescalate myself or try to be less controlling towards my boyfriend? Has anyone reduced these behaviors in themselves? How did you do it? 

When I am calm I can see this clearly. When I start to feel the anxiety logic seems to go out the window.

  **tl;dr**: I am being controlling towards my boyfriend, I am aware of this and it makes us both very unhappy. What are some ways I can reduce this behavior in myself? "

So im a new guy with ambitious plans to convert a ram promaster that I dont yet own (buying soon) so that when I intern in Colorado in 7ish months, I can live out of my van and use it in my future. Obviously, it will be getting cold while I am there. Possibly too cold, and I may have to get an apartment or something for a little bit. But anyways, I have some questions for you dwellers who have spent time in colder areas for a bit.

* Obviously good insulation is important, but how long will it stay warm realistically? I will likely want to hang out and be semi-comfy in the van.  

* Is a mr.buddy a decent solution for staying warm? Should I worry about condensation? If I crank it on until its warm, then turn it off, will a decent insulation job (reflectix and whatnot) keep the van warm for very long? Or should I consider things like the Olympian Wave 3?

* I have been back and forth about Propane vs webasto/propex, etc. I like the idea of propane but I keep hearing its a bad idea to put a large tank of propane in the van. Will I hate my life if I try to use small 1lb propane canisters for my stove &amp; heating all winter? 

* Any other, better solutions for me? or is dwelling in the cold really just miserable and I should consider renting a place for a bit? I dont want to hate living in the van."

Some conversations with my parents and friends recently really pissed me off. 

Okay so I’m from a third world country where arranged marriages are pretty common, and any woman with “self-respect” would do it (quite the opposite of what I believe) I already made a post on here about how I plan on leaving and getting my education in the US or Canada so I can make my own future as a child free individual. My parents will probably be moving to the same country and that’s okay. Atleast it was until they made it pretty clear that they want me to live/go to university somewhere close to them- so they can keep an eye on me. I know college life is hard and some people actually wish they could be close to their family, and so do I, but they also said that I can’t fend for myself in this world. Apparently I need a man to protect me (the very idea makes me sick to my stomach- which is weird since by now my brain should have been hard wired to accept this and be ok with it) 

I’m afraid that after uni when I have student loans to pay off and I’ll be looking for a job, my parents will make me live with them and then make me marry some random guy, and this random guy will demand babies (they always fucking do) And while my family isn’t backward, I have relatives and cousins in Canada and the US who have had the EXACT same thing happen to them. Get a degree, marry, make parents happy, make babies. I don’t want this to be me. My brother will graduate and get a job and not live with my parents and not marry till he wants to. Hell he’ll even have a say in who he wants to marry. It’s different for girls here. My parents have spoken ill of my female cousin for dating a white guy in the UK, but not of my male cousin for having a white girlfriend in the US- because he plans to marry her. So you can already tell what they expect of me. 

Why should it be harder for me as a girl to live on my own? I’m just as smart, if not more, as my brother. It’s like my “female body” needs to know what it’s true role is. I’m told soon all these goals and ambitions will seep out of me, and that I’ll turn towards support from someone else. 

But I also don’t want to disappoint my parents. When I graduate I’ll have to tell them I’m going to live in my own apartment, I’ll get a job, and internships at university will help me with that. Everyone on the planet does it so why can’t I? Im on top of my class at school, im constantly told I’m really smart- but nobody truly expects me to put all any of my talents to use other than for seducing some guy who will like me for my degree. Fuck that. I’m not getting a degree to marry, I actually plan on using it. 

I’m gonna defy so many expectations in the future and nobody’s gonna see it coming. Sorry mom and dad, I really am, but I just can’t do that to myself. Not for you even though I love you guys and not to show my relatives who I already hate that I’m a good girl.  

Edit: thanks everyone for all the support! I appreciate it so much and it motivates me to strive even harder "

But everything that happened in the first three seasons was while I was still a kid.  But in the 90s, I remember when Mosaic was shiny and new, and I did my internship in Washington D.C.  Shortly after I left government work I got my first job as a contractor at an internet startup, Personal Library Software in Rockville, MD.  They were developing a search engine.  To the best of my memory a local version was used in the Microsoft Encarta CDs, and they had a web version PLWeb.  I was responsible for writing scripts to automate the testing of their search engine.  I was only there for a year before I left and moved out of state.  I heard later they were acquired by AOL.  But for the first time (I'm on S4 episode 5), it feels like I have first hand experience instead of having watched from afar."

7kp2l3,1,2017-12-18,36M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7kp2l3/36m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - /r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Visitor to the porn set - Your friend is a well known porn star, and she travels the world for shoots to all sorts of glamorous places. She has taken you to a few shoots so you fully understand how in control of things she is. She surprises you with a trip to a luxurious mansion on an island where she is shooting, you have most of the time to relax but she has to work for a couple of days. On the set, one of the male performers starts chatting to you and you are finding it hard to resist.

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

7kp2y6,2,2017-12-18,I (24F) need advice on leaving my boyfriend (24M) please,intern3130,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kp2y6/i_24f_need_advice_on_leaving_my_boyfriend_24m/,"I made a post about a month ago and it's in my post history, but just for some background info; I temporarily relocated for an internship 6 weeks ago. 2 weeks in my boyfriend decided he wanted a break because of the distance. I was heartbroken but after seeking advice on here I didn't let it drag me back home. After a couple weeks of back and forth and arguing on the phone my boyfriend came to visit me and we got back together. He was very sweet and it was the perfect weekend. He acknowledged problems that we'd had in the past that he'd never owned up to before so I was genuinely hopeful that things would improve. One of the issues we've had in the past is my boyfriend being physical with me. We hadn't had that for a while (outside of the time where he spat in my face and drove off a few months ago) until Saturday night.

I went home for my sisters birthday dinner which my boyfriend came too as well. We've been together since we were 17 and he lived with us at one point so he's very close to my family. At the dinner my mom was talking about Christmas and asked if I was gonna be home for New Years and I said no. I had already told my boyfriend that I wasn't spending NYE with him so I was confused when he started acting cold towards me.

Then in the car on the way back home he asked me about it. I said to him that as I already told him before I was spending it with my friends from the internship that I'm working with and that he could come too. He said that's not a real invitation and that it didn't make sense as to why I wouldn't be with him on NYE. I explained as I have before that they had asked me while we had been on a break and I said yes. He said that that's a huge coincidence that they chose that particular time to ask me. I said how is it a coincidence? It's when they asked me, we weren't on good terms and I didn't expect we would be anytime soon so I decided to accept the invitation instead of being alone on NYE. Argument continued into the house getting more heated and he had started cursing at me which is how I knew things were getting out of hand.

I went upstairs to get away from the argument and he followed me up, telling me I don't fucking care about him and this is the problem. I'm too selfish, I don't think about him, blah blah blah. I tried to walk around him and out of the room but he kept blocking me. Anyway this is when things got physical. I don't really want to write it all out but I have a busted lip, my jaw hurts, I hurt my ankle when I tried to run out of the house and fell down the bottom few stairs, my body is sore and bruised from being held down after trying to run away. 

He cried afterwards and I cried too. He apologized and I stayed that night and he drove me back to the city yesterday morning. He doesn't usually drive me but my ankle hurt so he did. I let him come in my apartment where I'm staying and he got us lunch, he kept apologizing, he said ""you make me so angry, no one makes me this angry, I'm only angry because I love you so much or I wouldn't care"" and that all he wanted was us to be together for New Years.

I find it really hard to hate him so it wasn't until he left and it hit me that I feel sick that he's done this to me again after he PROMISED he wouldn't. I really thought we wouldn't go through this again, I honestly did and the fact that he hadn't put his hands on me in a long time is what had given me hope. But still, it's bad. I feel like I'm grieving and I'm confused. I'm deeply, deeply upset.

I'm looking for some advice on how to leave? Because I think I have to at this point. We live together at home (my parents property that we rent) and as I said before he's really close to my family. Nobody knows about any of the physical stuff he's done to me and I don't feel comfortable telling anyone. I know he won't make it easy for me to leave. He text me today that he loves me and we're perfect for each other we just take things too far sometimes. It's hard for me not to believe that and I know because people were straight with me in the last post I made that it's really not okay and he's proven it won't change (just as people said in the last post as well).

I want to put things in motion while I'm still away because I know if I wait until I return home to break up I'll find it hard to leave him because I do still love him and I know he'll go nuts. I also have to be around him at Christmas so maybe I should wait until after then? I don't want another fight.

Any advice appreciated. Thank you

- All-Might



Its after the Internship Arc, with all of the students and teachers back to U.A High School. With winter coming around as well as the Christmas party. Its no wonder everyones excited! People are in the spirit of giving, and with giving comes gifts! But the most exciting gift from Mother Nature was snow. Blanketing the school with the powder and providing more fun for the students. Its here where the story goes, and begins with our young heroes.....and villains.


If you enjoyed the prompt, which i hope you do, I'd like to ask for people who enjoy My Hero Academia to join in on the fun! I am an easygoing, kind person who is accepting of many things, including Original Characters! Though they will be read over and considered, please do not feel bad if they're refused! If i do refuse, its most likely because i didnt see a fit for them!

Now, with that I'm welcoming both males and females, for clean, romantic, or action roleplays. Keep in mind i am straight, so MxM action will not happen. I prefer to ease into any heated scenes, and would like if they made sense beforehand, yknow? It doesn't make sense if Tsuyu kissed Tenya out of the blue just because. Try to form a solid relationship!

i best play as Izuku Midoriya and Tenya Iida for males, and females i can play Mina Ashido well, but being as i am, i do like playing Izuku. 



This can become a group if enough unique players join, but it all depends. I'm a busy person, and I may not reply 24/7. With all that out of the way, I'm waiting for replies!


P.S. Please be semilit- literate. I don't usually write paragraph upon paragraph of posts, but i try my best to at least make it semi detailed and lengthy. And if you read all of this please message with ""I AM HERE"" to know you read it.

My interest in analytics has followed an unorthodox path. Unlike many others, I didn’t get an engineering degree for my bachelor's. I studied business administration with a minor in entrepreneurship and managed outstanding academic success. As a person that has always been inherently curious, I am always interested in finding ways to improve our world. Therefore, I always surrounded myself with entrepreneurs since the beginning years of college. 
My interest in entrepreneurship not only led me to be active in the ecosystem, but also to take part in the venture capital scene. During my internship at 212 Ltd., I’ve observed firsthand how startup evaluations are performed manually. With this observation, I have come to believe that venture capital is one of the areas that doesn’t efficiently utilize the data they generate. I find it ironic that venture capitals use such archaic methods to evaluate world’s most advanced technology startups. I want to be one of the forerunners in disrupting this tradition.
The real-world problems I faced and observed while working for 212 got me interested in analytics. In a way, I have always been performing basic analytical tasks such as forecasting and regression through Excel, but they were small in scale. I was aware of the limitations of Excel, and for some tasks, it just wasn't possible to get the results I was looking for. As I didn’t have a science degree, taking the reins in my hand had been challenging. Nevertheless, I started my analytics journey by taking online classes about R and assisting Prof. XX[name redacted] in his research project. With his guidance, my work included participating in the codebase and actively pulling comments from Facebook database for sentiment analysis purposes. This led me to a deeper understanding of analytics, and paved the way for my move towards computational analytics.

I continued improving myself by taking online classes in SQL and taking Data Programming course at University of Washington. There, I learned Python programming, and how to manipulate data with Python. My term project was to utilize machine learning to predict a potential startup’s likelihood of success. With that, I have started slowly bridging the gap of where venture capital decision making is, and where I think it should get to. As my passion revolves around entrepreneurship, I want to continue to find ways to improve venture capital investment decision process with the help of analytics. 

With my goal of bringing analytics to start-ups in mind, I want to be a part of the online MSc in Analytics program at Georgia Tech, with a focus on the Computational Analytics track. There are several reasons for me to choose Georgia Tech for my graduate education. First, I’ve had a friend’s recommendation, who is currently an OMSCS student at Georgia Tech, and he mentioned that there are tremendous career-related opportunities the university provides to its students. This service is highly valuable for me, because as a minority woman who moved to US from Turkey last year, I’ve been facing various difficulties building my network and finding career opportunities. Secondly, as I live in Seattle, an online master's degree would provide me with increased flexibility, letting me pursue networking opportunities in my area.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I would like to study in Georgia Tech because it is a world-renowned institute with a very prestigious ranking, which not only means a world-class education, but also means I would be able to engage with others that are driven by similar instincts. Considering all of these, this program fits all my expectations for my current and future goals and I hope to be a part of it."

7kpzvw,1,2017-12-18,Graduated from a rubbish university with a terrible GPA. What do I do?,Dzartovian94,Life_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life_advice/comments/7kpzvw/graduated_from_a_rubbish_university_with_a/,"So I'm a two time cancer survivor, my health has affected me all my life and I seem to have ruined my career and education in the process.

I finished my bachelors degree at a pretty low rung university (my enter score was average). In my first year of university, I was plagued with negative health issues from my treatment. Over time as my health got better, my grades improved but the damage was done. I graduated last year in August and have been looking for full time work ever since. 

I have a year and a half of work experience, including a mentorship but I'm constantly told in interviews that I lack experience (I apply for anything: entry level, graduate programs, Internships etc).

I'm currently waiting on potential job offers from two graduate programs and I'm not completely confident on either of those. I could go back to study something else, but I'm not really
passionate about anything and I don't have any career aspirations other then working. Even if I was to go back and study, I would end up enrolling at another low level institution because my grades suck. 

So do I just wait and see what I get? Or do I go back to study during mid year intakes after I have a good think about what I should do?

7kqdpo,1,2017-12-18,"21 [M4A] For F: Older female/Younger male, Buying Your New Toy at Action, Tied up, Worshipping the Fertility Gods, Rule 34. For M: Looking for ""Straight"" Guys Who Love Big Cock. (Works in progress)",out_and_kinda_about,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7kqdpo/21_m4a_for_f_older_femaleyounger_male_buying_your/,"Working on a few new prompts. These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

_____________________________________________________________

For F: A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.

___________________________________________________________

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.

Here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

7kqef9,2,2017-12-18,1.5 yrs of intense love gone and it's my fault.,Master_Charles,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7kqef9/15_yrs_of_intense_love_gone_and_its_my_fault/,"Hey guys, never spoken out like this before as I have never felt such intense pain.

I have had 3 relationships including this latest one. I'm a 27yr old male having recently been left by a 21 yr old female. 

I really felt she was the one. She felt it too, I know, I could see it. I helped her out of clinical depression, in fact, the first week we were dating, i was in a mental health centre visiting her everyday and taking her for lunch while she was undergoing ECT. I had never felt such a connection to someone. She started to get better, because I gave her purpose and she really turned things around. I was in my final year of my degree, and was heavily focused on uni. She also studied a difficult degree, and got back into studies after her stint in hospital. We never left each other's side - did everything together. I also suffer from mental illness, mostly depression. 

We moved interstate for 3 months to complete my internship, thats when the first issues really started. I was drunk one night, and just completely lost my shit (verbally) . She was rather needy, but it caused a couple of issues. I reflected, and realised it was my fault, after all she would do anything for me. My anger issues started to develop, I felt so comfortable with her that I neglected her. I didn't treat her like the Queen that she was/is. This went on for a while, with intense moments of love and care in between. She finally had enough, kicked me out 2 weeks before my thesis was due, where I was forced to live with grandparents. She gave me an ultimatum to win her back, and I didn't. So filled with resentment about kicking me out at the most important point in my uni life, that I would continue to snap and argue. But at the same time I still loved her. 

We caught up for dinner, where we got along it seemed like normal, and she tells me she's been seeing someone for the past two weeks. I couldn't believe it, I tried to win her back and she said I'm too late. She says I need to sort myself before she could love me again. But I just don't know if there is still a chance, particularly if this new person makes her happy and she moves on. 

I'm lost, I don't know whether to chase her or give up and move on. I would fight for years on my own to be with her again, but I just don't know if that would be a waste of time. 

I'm taking time to work on myself. I know i fucked up.

7kqfbx,2,2017-12-18,Me [22 F] with my [23 M] Boyfriend of [24 Months] cheated on me and I don't know how to get over it,throwawayforgrand,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kqfbx/me_22_f_with_my_23_m_boyfriend_of_24_months/,"Okay, so I'm sure there are plenty of other people who have asked similar questions but its really hard to get an answer without understanding the context of our relationship.


So, obviously we are both still pretty young but I do consider our relationship to be serious because I spend so much time with him and his family and he is the first man I have brought home to meet my family. This guy has treated me extremely well throughout our entire relationship and everyone always told me how lucky I was to have someone who was so sweet and kind. If I was sick he would take care of me, if it was cold he would come pick me up, and he's genuinely one of the nicest people I know. 

The issues we have are usually about getting to spend time together because we're both full-time students and working. He also is really hard on himself about everything and has been extremely stressed about not getting an internship this summer. 

Anyway, since I prefaced that with a short idea of our relationship, here's what happened. I was going through his group chat with two of his close friends for the first time mostly to see the dumb stuff they were saying, he doesn't care if I go through his phone. I never actually expected to find anything wrong because he's always been so amazing to me and never hangs out with girls and is not into the party scene like most guys his age. He is a good looking guy (although I am obviously biased) but for some reason I just always trusted him. In his phone, he was talking about how he liked this girl he met when he went on a case competition and how she liked him back.  He said he felt guilty because he was in a relationship and that he needed to get a grip. I ended up reading further and he said he “made out with her all night…” and that when she comes to visit our city he might take her out for coffee. I was sleeping over at his house at the time and found all this out and woke him up and left. I couldn’t believe this man that I love so much, could do this to me. 


He told me the story of how she came on to him and that he was being greedy and he wanted to feel special. After he also admitted to walking her home after the event, going to her house to make out, but not having sex. He said he got into his uber and she called him and told him to “cancel your uber” I guess that means to have sex but he didn’t do it. She then messaged him that she was coming to our city and he basically told her it wasn’t going to work out (before I found out). Ok, so I know this is a long story but bear with me, he's been crying and begging for me back. Telling me how much he regretted it, calling me all the time, texting me, trying to make me feel better. 

I have “forgiven” him since then because I know he's taking responsibility for everything and not using being drunk as an excuse. But the thing is I've been so miserable these past weeks. I've been crying myself to sleep every night because I keep imagining him with her. I keep picturing him kissing her. Even though they didn’t have sex,  I think what really gets me is that he said he would potentially date her if he wasn’t with me. The fact her t that he had those emotions for a girl he met one night! I know he's not shallow so I know he was probably impressed with because she was smart and has a really good job and all the stuff he cares about. I know it wasn’t just out of him being horny, I really think he had an encounter with this girl that just makes my insides burn. 


All I want to know is how do I get over this. Every time we talk I have to bring this up and make him feel is bad about it. I know he really regrets it because he's been telling me how much he hates that he hurt me and how this is the worst thing he's ever done and how he truly regrets it. Is there any way things can go back to how they were or should we just end everything? 


tl;dr: My boyfriend of two years made out with another girl when he went to an event and I want to know how to get over it!"
7kqle6,26,2017-12-18,My view on current state of WT [ANTON GIVE ME COPE],[deleted],Warthunder,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/7kqle6/my_view_on_current_state_of_wt_anton_give_me_cope/,"Hey! In years of lurking on this website, I've never felt the need to create an account to make my opinion known, but this time some spillage it required. I'm not expecting Anton to read this, although I think off-your-chest feedback it's what will change the game - at the very least I'll let off some steam.

**Credentials**: I've been with WT since CBT, spent quite a bit of money on it, mainly play AB because of laptop screen and bad aim, lately 95% Tank AB. Thunderskill says I'm an ""excellent"" AB and ""good"" RB player, but I like to think of myself as just above average since I don't always play in the 8.0+ bracket where most good players are. I have T4/5 vehicles in USA/Germany/USSR and some brits. I played WoT hardcore but immediately moved to the superior game (at the time). I love WT and think it's potentially the best product of its kind on the market by far, I've seen it go through various stages, but ever since 1.27 things have been... up and downy.

I quit playing Air because of sparkfest, which didn't happen as much back in the day. Don't know if this is possible, but it left me with the impression that people were actually deliberately lagging themselves with a torrent client or something to gain an advantage. Whatever, I can play exclusively tanks and still be happy with my playtime... but not in this state:

Greed makes you lose players and potentially money. I understand it's a free game and all, but every time I try to convince my WoT friends to retry WT, I only get a couple of games in with them which ends in frustration in any game mode. Yes, vehicle prices have been reduced, but people forget they've also been raised. Considerably. Planes used to be dirt cheap to research and buy, but somewhere along the line the game ""came out of beta"" (allegedly) and also premium vehicle prices increased to the levels of a triple-A game per vehicle... Put that next to the mandatory premium account and other expensive in-game purchases and you're still left with a mountain to climb to get to the meta vehicles. 

And don't give me the ""play this game for fun, enjoy the ride, grind isn't hard etc"" stuff because WT came after WoT and none of my friends playing WoT will abandon their accounts with multiple tier X vehicles and premiums to seal club with Pz4 for a year before they get to something relevant. Maybe they're too invested to switch, but this doesn't stop them from actively playing other grindy MMOs. 

Let's say until T3 it's manageble, but combining the frustrations that this game brings by design (one-shots, MM, bad teams, unfair uptiers due to compression, otherworldly physics, crew lock, revenge suicide bombs, multiple bugs etc) by the time you get to T4 and have to endure dozens of games with solid shot, no parts, no FPE - nobody I know wants to play it anymore. 

Also, let me remind you that despite being a kid game with hit points, WoT did some things right from the start that WT didn't do in years. For example, why can't we get FPE and parts from the beginning? Is it because you want to provide us with pride and a sense of accomplishment for being cannon fodder and burning away in the distance? Is the greed that bad I'm required to purchase these out of frustration? I have premium account and boosters, and it still took me 17 horrendous games to unlock parts and FPE on my T32... 

Speaking of T32 - on paper it's a tremendous hull down tank, however I bounced more shots in my 7.0 M46 - why? well, i got killed thrice with the first shot fired at me from soviet 100mms: APHE shell hit the mantlet dead in the middle and then somehow according to the animation, parts of it flew right through the UFP one shotting the tank. It wasn't a shot trap per say, but dodgy trajectory. On Poland I got one shot from across the map by a KT105 directly through the 300mm mantlet. I also got killed several times due to my own frustration of not getting kills with the terrible solid shot and long reload, because I pushed too far in a tank that turns slower than the moon. I think I know how to play a hull down tank, since I have over 400 games in the T29 which is by far a superior tank and still broken for its BR. 

EYE GOUGING BUGS - I won't bother reporting anymore because I'm wearing off my keyboard for nothing. I've reported some bugs multiple times for years, exactly as forum format says. Locked. Well F me, I didn't know I paid actual money to beta test - should I also learn to code, maybe I'll get in as an intern to prop up the game?

Touched a little bit at the start, so I shall speak no more of sparks. Why are planes warping like alien spacecraft when server is over ~200 ping? I know this isn't just me, because someone actually went to WG's plane game for this very reason!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HE PREFERS THAT GAME WHICH IS LIKE RAILWAY SIMULATOR WITH HIT POINTS AND BB GUNS

What's the deal with hocus-pocus tanks? If I wanted that, I'd play WoT or AW - ever since you pareded the brilliant solution to cheaters in RB, you disrupted the game engine by having tanks materialize right before one's eyes, sometimes with a little freeze when the tank comes into existance, just in case he isn't pre-aimed at your location. 

+Hit... Yes, comrad, during repair I shoot plane with soviet 122mm APHE dead center, the fuse detonates, I'm happy I made the shot, plane is still in factory condition... Maybe it's lag. Speaking of lag again - that precious moment when you shoot a tank gun, you get sound, tracer animation, impact animation yet nothing happens. Check again, gun is still loaded - guess what, try again, too late, he's back in cover. And when you're both facing each other, it's screen-smashingly bad - because you know you shot first according to Eyes 2.0, yet server 0.1 ALPHA says nein, you die.

PHYSICS - I won't bash physics anymore until it's implemented. Honestly it feels like MarioKart at times... stay away from rocks, trenches, ledges, sidewalks etc. I think some alternate universe physics was implemented for 1st of April event and it was good enough.

STOP ADDING NEW VEHICLES - do you need to add Azerbaijani tanks and planes before you fix the 10ft pole in your eyes? I understand it's not the same thing working on those separate areas of the game, but you're putting stress on them by always adding and changing stuff. 

Also what's the pleasure in unlocking a new vehicle that's exactly the same as the previous one, but different? Yay, it has a new machine gun... worth the 160k RP grind. Wow, I can now drive the new Bolivian Sherman with Passat turret - struggling to not wet the bed. Just when you're about to strike any sort of balance in this sardine BR compression, BOOM! new tanks, new bugs, new meta, NEW PREMIUM TANKS OF COURSE $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ What? Sorry, we are not greedy, we totally needed 5 months to increase the BR / increase the reload / nerf the turret to ""historical"" values - too bad you've already spent 40 euros on this puppy... it still goes forward when you press W so it's k.

BOATS - exactly what WT needed right now, to furthermore divide the scarce playerbase into more gamemodes and more tiers in an even more compressed BR because otherwise queue times would be like Armored Failfare... I would much rather wait 3-5 minutes in queue than enter battle in my stock Pershing and face nationalist-socialist-lovers with 1000+ clubgames in Jagdtiger, which you can't flank in corridor maps.

MAPS - some of them are terrible and repetitive.  On some maps I bounce off the sides/rear of perpendicular Panthers with 240mm penetration APHE. On some maps you can shoot through several buildings, just roll the dice baby.

ANTON YUDINTSEV -&gt; honest congratulations for being this successful at this age. Extremely few have the balls and brains to pull it off. HOWEVER. Please, for the love of all that's holy, stop interfering with the game when you're not required. 

I don't know you, maybe you like a hands-on approach, maybe you don't trust some of your staff... whatever the case, YOU'RE THE FING CEO, you cannot under any circumstances start a poll on your forum asking paying customers if you should strike down with copyright claims any youtuber who doesn't portray your game in a favorable manner. You either do it without asking permission or if you still like to know the answer to this question (why?), you have PR people for that, if you tell them to do something and it turns out to be a disaster, let THEM take the heat, that's what they signed up for. Worst case scenario you lay them off behind closed doors with a sign-off bonus and you're a hero in our eyes because you did the right thing to maintain the project's integrity. And don't get me started on the takedown notice to that poor guy's website because he wouldn't sell it to you. 

WG also fails at PR at times, but Victor has a more public ""team""  who diffuses responsibility among themselves. SerB regularly flames and insults paying customers, yet he's like their dumbass grumpy troll-mascot and gets away with it. Your Stona is just rude and off-putting.

GESTAPO MODS - in-game general chat is so boring, I'd rather speak to a stamp collector. There's two reasons for this:

1) Stupid rules with way too much application - I want to know the man behind the ""=7.5cmPak40=Wehraboo62"" name, how much can I talk about game related stuff like the historical penetration at 
 60 degrees of the BR-350A round on the T35 soviet tank? Just writing this makes me lasso a rope around the ceiling fixture.

2) Poorly vetted frustrated mods who haven't busted a nut since WW2 -&gt; starting with Le_Cuck who every third reply must remind everyone that he is Mod and Mod is blue and Mod is great and we must obey Mod because he has the Mod power and Mod authority to wipe us puny nabcackes out of his chat. I truly hope he is your nephew or something Anton, because I can't find a reason he would be allowed to participate in the discussion, yet alone moderate it.

This is certainly not all but I've spent enough time on this post and there are more productive things to do at this time. 

Best of luck!

Currently I have an unpaid internship and am looking for a career in the next few months... since graduation I have been dealing with anxiety and depression. After talking with a therapist I started to feel better and stopped going. However, recently I am wondering if my mental illness is due to my father emotionally abusing me. I never noticed it before and did not think about him in a negative way. However I've been spending a lot of time with my bf's family and I am realizing how much different they are. My bf is so secure and stable and his family is so easy to be around. 

My dad is always putting me down. He never yells or is physically abusive but I think that his comments in my childhood and now have had a negative effect on me. For example, today I was telling him about my bfs Christmas work party and how we got a rly nice hotel. He says ""no wonder he won't ask you to marry him, you give him everything he wants now"" he said I shouldn't be doing that if I'm not married and that it doesn't follow the Bible... all bc I got a hotel room with my bf. I have also been having trouble finding a job and he says degrading things like that my resume must have a bunch of misspellings. He has also made jokes about my weight (I'm very in shape). He just makes me uneasy and I feel like I can't talk to him. I'm feeling devastated at this realization bc I've always looked at him as a hero and now I'm realizing how much his comments have hurt me. Both my parents have recently become more religious and they are always making naive comments. He doesn't let me be who I am and I feel that I am growing so distant from him. Especially after I see what my parents bfs are like. I've always felt like I've had the ""cool"" parents but now I see something else. It's like he makes me feel bad when I don't do what he thinks is right.. which seems reasonable but I'm no longer religious and don't agree with many of his ideas on relationships and life in general. He's always been a jerk who has talked to me condescendingly... idk what to do. I'm moving out soon but I'm hurt that my relationship with my dad and mom also have become like this. "

I'm currently doing an internship that involves a lot of PLC programming and of course, I'll have to document everything at the end and I was wondering how that is done in the industry. 

We mostly used just basic flowcharts for school projects, but this is a pretty complicated one that uses a lot of object oriented programming together with structured text. More specifically Sigmatek's Lasal Class 2.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions."
7ksi13,0,2017-12-19,I abused and forced my sexual desires to a girl,diptya,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/7ksi13/i_abused_and_forced_my_sexual_desires_to_a_girl/,"We never had a real relationship. It was only a one-week summer fling but I know we had the potentials to stay longer. If only we weren’t going to live more than three hours of flight apart for the next 6 months I would have made a move. She was a cute, kind of innocent girl, a kind I haven’t hooked up or had connection with in quite a long time – since I was busy traveling here and there, meeting people who are also open for one-time hookups; fun, wild parties, ambitious ladies in career wanting to have some fun in a city she only visit for business, this kind of stuff. But damn she was different.

That one last night we were together she somehow refused my advances, telling me “I’m too tired I got a train early morning.” Of course I was disappointed.

Not long after she slept I started fingering her, she moaned and enjoyed it although keep refusing when I tried to put the D in. I couldn’t help but to continue until I came and got tired. Morning after we had a good quick goodbye makeout session as we both have different trains to catch. she never said anything until a week later she called me, and mentioned the Rape word, accusing me of it.

We had a fight.

For a good part of two months after that we didn’t really speak to each other. This Thanksgiving I was doing a roadtrip down east coast, including NYC where she works now (just an intern, she just graduated this summer too). I felt after some time I needed to clear all this mess so I asked her out for a coffee. She said “I can’t do today, got work until late. Tomorrow…? But I’m also still not comfortable, I don’t know tbh…”

But that was the last day I was in New York.
And like a week ago she stopped replying to my text for no reason.

I still feel guilty that I violated such an innocent girl, and that I might never have another chance to say sorry in person
(She’s leaving NY and going abroad next March)

Am I beyond depths of hell?
Or do I have a chance to wipe the slate clean"

https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/7kbxs7/infp_m_starting_to_fall_for_an_enfj_f/

Funny enough, I thought I would see her again on February or March, but she's actually coming back today!! I, out of instinct, asked her out and she gladly accepted (she was actually a bit surprised). After that we started to talk like always, but know I'm fighting my inner demons again and must not let them win.

You see, I'm very insecure, and I know it's understandably a dealbreaker to ENFJs (it's a dealbreaker for most people, if there's a trait that is universally looked down upon I'm sure it's insecurity). I hate feeling exposed yet again to rejection, but at the same time I know that it's a road one has to travel until you find ""the one"". You don't beat a game without losing a bunch of lives after all.

Now, trying to clear my head a bit. I like this girl but I feel I need to know her a bit better and this is the perfect chance, but I don't know what she would expect of me or what things I could do to mess this up. Whatever tips or advice you'd want to tell me then I'm all for it.

I don't know if she feels anything for me, and it's hard to know for a fact because of how outgoing and affectionate you are, but having cues to know if I should make my move or not would be highly appreciated. She had also a rough time like me, and got emotionally invested in someone who just never made the move and didn't go out there for her, so I wouldn't be surprised if that affects her perspective and/or expectations of me in this situation.

I'm taking her after work to a nice restaurant celebrating the end of her internship and I expect to  have a nice conversation before it gets too dark. Any advice? Thanks for your time by the way. No wonders you mean the world to INFPs. :)"
7ktqyz,5,2017-12-19,One Batch.... Two Batch....,ThePruef,LoserleavesReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoserleavesReddit/comments/7ktqyz/one_batch_two_batch/,"*A camera turns on to the RAW arena devoid of fans, but with a group of people surrounding the RAW ring. As the camera pans in closer, they are noticeable as workers whom had been assaulted when /u/SlowbroJJ had enacted his siege on RAW before Survivor Series. They all seem a bit confused. In the ring sits a very large black trunk. The people begin to murmur amongst themselves, wondering why they are there until /u/ThePruef comes down the ramp with a man who’s hands have been zap strapped and a burlap sack over his head. There is a loud thump as the man is tossed into the ring, before Pruef himself walks up the steps and enters the ring , quickly pinning the masked man under a steel toed boot. There is an odd calmness on the face of Pruef as he pulls a mircrophone out of his pocket, whilst the crew members look on at him utterly confused.*

It’s been awhile since I’ve stood in this ring to talk. You see for the last bit, I’ve stepped away majorly cause I felt as if I had lost my passion for all this. I had felt confused, and frustrated feeling as if I wasn’t going anywhere and not knowing why. But then as the time passed, and I thought over everything I realized that I hadn’t lost that passion….But I had forgotten what I had promised, I had let myself get distracted by a clown and went away from where I should have gone. I grew soft, I grew arrogant, and I grew lazy. The last month since Survivor Series has really made me realize, that I was wrong in abandoning my promise to not let more heels go unpunished. For to god damn long, the scum of LLR have been allowed to run rampant. Dirty rabid animals allowed to stroll around rabid and do as they want with no consequences. Those days are done, after today if you think you can act like a thug then you will know what is going to happen. I don’t give a damn if you’re saying your just some goof, or if you call yourself in the best in the world if you cross the line…. Well you’re about to see….

*Pruef pulls the burlap sack to show /u/SlowbroJJ’s intern Bobby,whom is very scared and very confused.*

Bobby:Pruef??? What…What’s going on?

*Pruef kneels down and grabs Bobby by the chin and makes him look at the people around the ring.*

Pruef: Bobby do you recognize these people?

Bobby: N..No….Why should I?

Pruef: Do the words Under Seige, sound familiar to you Bobby?

B: Well ya… that’s *his eyes go a bit wide* that’s what we said when we helped JJ when we took over RAW…. B..But I was just a messenger, I swear I did n- *a clip plays of Bobby kicking people while they are down, never doing the work to take them out himself but assaulting them after. Bobby gulps as he looks into the cold eyes of Pruef.* W..What are you going to do…

P: I’m sending a message.. To your boss… To all of the scum of LLR who think they are so high and mighty they think they can get away with anything. 

*Pruef lifts his foot off Bobby , before walking to the black trunk and opening it, revealing inside a collection of weapons. Pruef pulls the ol’ trusty crowbar out , whilst turning to Bobby who had begun to try to wriggle out. Bobby’s eyes go wide and before he can utter a single word the crowbar comes down on his face. The crew member shout out in shock and terror, as Pruef brings it down again. Many of them begin to run out, as Pruef beat Bobby with pure rage in his eyes. Bloody, bruised and unrecognizable Bobby wheezes and sputters as Pruef finally stops. Soft sob’s escape the broken man’s lips as Pruef runs a hand through his own hair.*

P: Slowbro…. I want you to know this….. Even if you are able to walk out of our match next week, you’re going to remember me. You’re going to remember me every time you look in the mirror, every time people shrink away from you not in terror, but in pity. I’m not going to just make you quit, I’m gonna take your face, your hands, and your spirit. Bobby was the first message, and you are going to be the last. JJ you’re not facing the iron work horse, you’re not facing a man decreeing he has zero fear… You’re facing THE PUNISHER of LLR. You’re facing the consequences of your actions, and all the other maggots. But JJ you need to  understand, if you lose and you still keep your current path….well then it looks I’ll be very far from being done with you. I’ll see you next week, and don’t try to run cause trust me I’ll find you.

*Pruef walks out as a [song begins to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9chF9gYZqI), leaving the utterly beaten and broken Bobby behind staining the RAW ring crimson. The camera cuts out.*

7kujbk,2,2017-12-19,When should I be contacting potential employers?,JCoop8,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7kujbk/when_should_i_be_contacting_potential_employers/,"I am a graduate student getting a MAcc. I have a GA position on campus that is paying for school, so a busy season internship was out of the question for me this year. I will graduate in August 2018 and will hopefully have passed all four sections of the CPA exam by then. In May I will be done with my GA position and will go from 12 credit hours to 6 credit hours over the summer. So I could start working in May, but would definitely like to start a full time job in August are as soon after that as possible. I have done one internship in tax at a regional firm, and I am pretty confident tax is where I want to work. I am worried there's not a lot of hiring going on in the timeframe I would be wanting to start but I am wondering when I should try to contact firms to look for a job. "
7kuxha,0,2017-12-19,I Wish My Doctor Would Take Me Seriously,Van_Herenhuis,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7kuxha/i_wish_my_doctor_would_take_me_seriously/,"Last straw was today.

Since aged 16, I have been diagnosed with epilepsy. However, a trigger can not be found. After suffering through these violent seizures for years, eventually I began developing severe depression and anxiety. These anxiety attacks started giving me a different kind of seizure. So, I began taking three seizures in a row: one of my standard ones and two from anxiety attacks. This has been happening for years.

Eventually, last year, I was put on diazepam as a last resort along with my standard epilepsy medication. Suddenly, the seizures reduced. They spaced apart and became less frequent and less violent. They told me that, eventually, I would have to come off the diazepam but that I would be eased off it and consulted with while trying something to replace it.

However, my fucking doctor doesn't take me seriously. Any time I try to get an appointment? He's either too busy or he pawns me off on some intern who has no idea about my case.

The most recent intern has had the best one. In a genius move, this guy decided to begin reducing my medication...WITHOUT CONSULTING ME! I rang to complain...TOO FUCKING BAD can't get an appointment this month! I now have next to no diazepam to help with my anxiety attacks and nothing to replace it to help! Now, my seizures are back to as bad as they were, I'm afraid to go outside, I'm in agony all the time but I have to sit and wait for when my doctor can contact me....IT'S BEEN OVER A MONTH! I've been in hospital twice for injuries sustained from seizures!

For God's sake! I meant it when I said that I needed that medication to keep my seizures down! I wasn't taking the piss! I'm not some junkie strung out on diazepam, you ignorant fuck! Return my goddamn phone calls and help me through this and get me better medication or give me back my old medication!

Rant over. Jesus fucking Christ."

7kv6bm,40,2017-12-19,To all of the teenagers preparing for college,AvengedSevenfoldGirl,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/7kv6bm/to_all_of_the_teenagers_preparing_for_college/,"Hey guys, I was a big fan of this subreddit back when I was about 15. I feel like coming back and just sharing some thoughts I've had about the whole college process to maybe help some of you relax about the college prep. I took a gap year after I graduated high school, and have now just finished my third semester of college. I think I've been through enough to help y'all out a bit, so here we go.

1) **There's nothing wrong with taking a gap year after high school.** I was set to go to my top choice school, but realized I couldn't afford it when I got the tuition bill three weeks before the semester. I spent my year off working and saving up for college.

2) **There's nothing wrong with going to a public school.** Private colleges are wonderful. Don't get me wrong. But they are much more expensive than public colleges. My original top choice was $45,000 a year vs my current college which is $20,000 a year. Big difference. You'll have to deal with more people and some bigger classes which sucks, but it's not too bad.

3) **There's nothing wrong with commuting to your local college.** You know how I said tuition at my school is about $20,000 a year? I cut that in half by commuting. Housing costs and meal plans are almost as expensive as the actual tuition at my school. There's no reason for me to spend that much money when I live 15 minutes away from campus. Once you find friends, they let you couch surf anyway. My best friend lets me sleep in his bed when I'm on campus for 12+ hours. You're stuck in the same area which isn't as fun as going to somewhere with different scenery, but you'll meet people with different personalities and backgrounds which kinda makes up for it.

4) **Consider going Greek (Social or professional).** I knew I wouldn't fit into a typical social sorority, but I still wanted to get involved with Greek life. I joined Phi Sigma Pi (gender inclusive honor fraternity) and it has been a wonderful decision. I have a massive second family on campus now. There are major specific fraternities as well as those that are open to any major (like Phi Sigma Pi). Professional Greek organizations tend to be much cheaper than social Greek orgs. But still, if you want to join a social Greek org, do it. 

5) **Pick a field that you're passionate about.** There are some fields with limited jobs, so be sure to consider it. If you pick one of those fields, be sure to work to set yourself above your peers. Even if you pick a field with lots of job availability, work to set yourself above your peers. I'm majoring in sport management which gets a few side eyed glances when I mention it, but I've completed one internship and currently work in two different positions at my college's sports arena. Don't be afraid to get your foot in the door while you're still in school. If you're truly passionate about your field, you'll want to work harder and go to class.

6) **MENTAL HEALTH IS IMPORTANT!** Seriously. Don't be afraid to seek help if you find yourself getting depressed and skipping classes because you can't get out of bed. I've been there. I began missing classes because of how bad my depression got, so I finally sought help. It has been 100% worth it. I missed a lot of class this fall semester due to a disease I was diagnosed with, and it also took a toll on my mental health. I pushed through all of it and still made Dean's List. 

7) **Take advantage of free food.** This speaks for itself.

8) **Join a club** It can be major specific, or a sport that interests you. Do something that will get you out of your room a few times a week. Don't join too many clubs and become overwhelmed though. 

9) **Party responsibly** Have a good time at a party, but try not to black out. With all of the hazing issues in the news, please beware of fraternity hazing and don't be afraid to say no if they're forcing you past your limit. Drinking can be seen as bonding with your frat brothers but trying to give you alcohol poisoning isn't bonding. Ladies, just beware of who you're partying with and where you put your drinks. 

10) **Take advantage of free condoms** Seriously. My university offers 3 free Trojan condoms per day to students. I can also buy 12 for $1. Keep yourselves protected. 

That's all I can think of. Good luck to all of you! May your GPA be high and your beers be ice cold."

Speaking of collective intelligence - a new blog by @Wolffang @R0bInI0 discusses the blockchain space in terms of martial arts. He examines the perspective of Bruce Lee, the pioneer of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and how we can take his lessons of combining best practices to attain the highest levels of agility. Bruce founded Jeet Kune Do to evolve martial arts away from a, “My style is better than yours”, rhetoric to strengthen combat sports. Adel’s blockchain agnostic approach and community collaboration takes a mirrored approach in the sphere of virtual currencies. It’s all about combining the strengths of different technologies into a single ecosystem.

7kvdn3,1,2017-12-19,"Me [32F] with my ex [30M] of ~ 1 month, did I tried enough how do I move on?",shirubana,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7kvdn3/me_32f_with_my_ex_30m_of_1_month_did_i_tried/,"We had been living together for almost 3 years, plus some more months dating. Six months ago, my SO that I live with told me he had not been happy for a year. It came as a shock to me, because I remembered a year full of shared moments, trips, adventures, projects. Sure, I had been depressed for two months earlier that year, but I had worked through it once he pointed that out and I had started therapy and had already flipped 180 what my life looked back to how good it was before. 


So that afternoon he told me he was unhappy, we talked it through calmly and decided to work through it. At that moment I also told him that I've gotten depressed and started suicidal ideations once before after a breakup of a very important relationship of mine 10+ years ago, and that trying to fix thing could be very hard and I would try my best as long as I still felt mentally sane despite the sadness.


I left for a summer internship, and we had good and bad moments (sad - he uninvited me from a wedding we were attending together of his family, and blamed his father. good - I visited many times and he did too, and had a blast; I organized him a bomb 30th birthday), and when we came back we started therapy. On therapy he said he was checked out, and it was true - after I came back, I picked up all the work in the house because he was always tired, or busy going out, and I kept trying very hard to make him happy every day. We spend a lot of time together, went out, worked in therapy, etc. I was the best version of me I could be. However things were still declining, with him telling me that he didn't know if he wanted to move with me after all after I graduated next year -- which we had agreed to before. He also started whitholding intimacy the last week of my birthday, which was a big flag.... So in our 3rd therapy session a week from then, I wanted to know if we were moving forward, if all the happiness of the last 3 months had tipped the balance from the 50% commitment he had said he was in at the beginning to my favor. But it had not even improved a 1%... So I broke up with him during therapy, telling him that I needed someone that could make plans, even small ones (he had cancelled our birthday trip camping the weekend before without reason, and was too tired to even hang out out of the house), and specially big ones, and that all of me trying, being my best, and not making him happy was starting to really damage my self-esteem to the point beyond that point that I didn't want to reach. The therapist gave me kudos for establishing so well what I needed during the breakup while he was crying, which made me feel sad but I guess it kinda showed I 'did things right'?


I moved out of our house for the last month while he moves out with his brothers and friends, and then I'll get the house back for the end of the lease and my stay here in this city. I've been continuing therapy, and reading so many good books on self-reflection to try to understand my pain and guilt, try to understand what I did wrong and forgive myself, as well as grow as a person. I've taken to running daily, ran a 5K, have done lots of cool random things with my friends --- which I still used to do before, but now I'm doing everything sad, just to do it, because sometimes the pain is less. Unluckily I haven't been able to go total NC which is something I usually do with my exes, since we are still arranging the transfer of the house. He's been kind, and every-time he texts I break down big time, even in the middle of Walmart.  I guess overall I'm recovering, but I still wonder what could have happened if I could have hold on longer, or if I could have figured out how to continue fighting for us, but most of the time I think that he threw the towel before me, much before. 


During the fall-out He said that he didn't know who he was anymore, and at some point admitted to being depressed and I gave him resources to look for help ( I agreed/ still agree iwth this), but never did. He sometimes accused me of being too controlling ~ but I was mostly controlling the things he had dropped doing, like cleaning or figuring out food for both of us.... He was not really able to point out many other things that were bothering him so for the 6 months I was trying to fix really able to point out many other things that were bothering him so for the 6 months I was trying to fix things in the dark..  I thought we communicated well because we never fought and when we did, we were polite and expressed our feelings and did all that book stuff, but I guess he was not really looking at himself and telling me the hard truths or things he needed until it was too late. 


I'm scared, because now I'm 32, and I don't know what I did wrong in my relationship to push him away, and if that will happen again. And just starting to look and go through dumb relationships seens so awful...   I just feel sad and don't know what to work on. I want to also stop hoping that he'll come back to me. How do I stop that?

  **tl;dr**: broke up with boyfriend after trying, not sure if hard enough, or correctly enough. How do I move on/Forgive myself?"
7kvtgt,10,2017-12-19,My study abroad was a waste,philipselway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7kvtgt/my_study_abroad_was_a_waste/,"So over the summer I studied abroad in China taking two chinese courses. It was a great experience and before I left I was told to bring my coursework to be reviewed to get the credits. My degree requires a study abroad or internship for graduation. Well it turned out when I got back the prof told me she doesn't like when students study abroad and she does not give credit for the classes. I was shocked. She said to just sit in on her classes (the same one I took abroad, just different textbooks) so I don't fall behind and she'll approve my class.

So after the first day of sitting in she tells me I need to actually enroll for the credits. I was like uh okay, after at first she said I just needed to sit in or audit. Today I just finished my final exam and talked to her asking about when she would finally approve my credits so I could get the study abroad approved. She told me she already denied it and her class is what will count, not the one I took abroad and that I better not have failed. (i got a B in the class I took abroad, her class I'm praying for a C). I almost started crying.

I ran to the language department which was no help. They said since she was the one who makes the decisions it was all up to her. Emailed my adviser after that, he was very confused as to why she did not approve the classes but that I needed to sign up for the internship/research course to be able to graduate since she didn't approve the study abroad.

Professor knew I was going there to study and she never made any mention to me she wouldn't approve my classes. I'm so hurt by all this my college experience will forever be remembered as shitty and stressful. If I don't do well in her class I can't stay an extra year to take it again. I'll probably end up dropping out because of her. "

This is my 2nd semester back in school after I took a year off to gather myself and figure out what I want in life. During this time, I did go to counseling due to a major episode of depression, I did 6 months talking to a counselor at my campus because it was free.(&amp; I have no insurance, ObamaCare didn’t help, poor but not poor enough) However, the counselor I bonded with was an intern and left the school &amp; I stopped going. I made some progress while I was there, I realize that I self loathe and beat myself up to the point where I lock myself in a room depriving myself of basic necessities like food, human interactions, even hygiene. I can mustard the minimal effort to get up for work, even though I feel miserable, eat once my stomach as cave in on itself, and use the bathroom when it’s urgent. But I will lock myself in my room, while making my self feel like a failure. It hit its breaking point when I transferred from my community college to my current university. I struggling through college, but there always was a light at the end of the tunnel and I was able to get through and graduate with my AA after 3 years. My local university wouldn’t accept so I have to commute to one that’s 1 hr and half away. Can’t live on campus due to surviving off financial, small student loans, and a full time job. I broke down after 3 semesters in that school, b/c I literally was taking the same 2 classes over programming 1 &amp; discrete math. I finally passed programming 1 w/ a B- and failed discrete math for the 3rd time. My gpa was 1.4. I dropped my classes for that following semester, a few months later quit my job, &amp; was unemployed. I felt like a failure. I was 23 at the time and felt like I should have graduated already and be further along in life. I’m forced to live at home, because I couldn’t afford to move out. I can’t get a “better job” in my area w/o a degree or completely dedicate myself to a full time 9-5 and taking night or evening classes which would prolong school. (My current job is really part-time, but my manager is kind enough to give me flexible hours around my schedule. She knows I’m in school so I have full time hours on my paycheck) During counseling, I learn to live in the moment temporally, and not be so hard on myself, I learn to develop better habits, learn to relax, even starting going to the gym. My last session was in April earlier this year, enrolled in the summer session in May, found my current job I’m working at now &amp; switch my major from Computer Science to Biology, That require taking some prerequisites I didn’t complete. I struggle that semester but manage to get a C’s and did grade forgiveness &amp; bumped my gpa to a 2.0.  However this semester was horrible, I felt myself slipping back into my old ways, but was too occupy with everything to stop and reach out for help. I stop going to the gym, stopped studying with way I use to, &amp; let myself get stress out about everything. I ended failing two of my lectures classes genetics and general chemistry 2. I didn’t affect my spring semester, but my gpa dropped again this time to a 1.8. I feel myself wanting to give up on everything again. I know I can do better, but there’s something in me that feels like a can’t. I thought about going back to see a counselor, but I don’t want to relive my life story to another stranger again, while it helped it was also emotionally taxing. I’m not one to seek help, as you can probably see. "

This coupled with the fact I don't really have many friends that I can hang with (no vehicle) I have gotten really damn good at them. My school hired me to pentest them, I am doing an internship with the infosec division at my county, have a cisco internship lined up over the summer, and have a job waiting for me when I turn 18 (Cyber Security government contracting company, was doing a job fair thing at my school, chatted up the people there, they want to pay for my college if I work for them for 4 years). So alls good right? No. I fucking hate computers now. Just the same damn bullshit day in and day out. I want to make music, and walk around in nature. But I suck at music. And walking around in nature doesn't pay well. What does pay well? Being a security analysist. And it's not like I have any time to learn anything else. Im graduating high school a year early cause I skipped 2 levels of IT courses and math (thus fufilling graduation requirements), but have a shit GPA (2.6) because I don't do homework. So I'm destined to be working in IT for the rest of my life. Yeah I've become really good at it, but I still hate it so much now. I despise sitting infront of screens all day long. It's just not enjoyable like it used to be. I'm going to become an alcoholic or drug user. My entire life is going to be involved with these annoying machines. Fucking hell. Anyone here maybe have any ideas? Cause I really want to get away from all this."

This is kinda embarrassing. Things in my life are going pretty well right now. I have money in savings, all my living expenses are definitely going to be paid, I have the internship I wanted for the summer, I passed all my classes, and next semester looks like a ton of fun. The only bad things in my life right now are some social relationship stuff and, well...

Mom, I lost my computer. The one I'd tried so hard to take care of. I took it to someone's house to study and then me and a friend went to the store afterwards. I was so scared of it getting stolen from the car that I brought in in with me, but...

I forgot it in the store, and it was definitely stolen.

I'm so torn up over this. Mom, this autistic, adhd, mentally ill af kid would not have gotten through school last semester without that dang tablet. I got that thing at a wonderful price too, one I probably won't be able to find without having to risk something with janky running.

That thing ran perfectly, and I had it in a case, a screen protector, and I hadn't even lost the pen for it or lost it any other time all year!

I feel like this is just confirmation that I'm a dummy and everything I have is going to disappear. I'm trying to look at all the good, but it's hard right now mom. That computer was a lifesaver and it helped make everything bearable- it really was an important piece of accessibility technology for me and I'm scared of everything being terrible without it.

Anyways mom, even with all this good stuff in my life I'm finding it hard to talk myself out of my funk. Everything looks really overwhelming without the comforting grip of that tablet in my hands.

Can I still be okay, mom? Do you think I can earn money to buy a new one? Any ideas mom?"

First, some info about me: I am a 21 years old, african descent, homosexual man. I live in Panama and I currently attend the Technological University of Panama (The best one in the country) and I'm majoring in Food Engineering (Basically, Chemical Engineering, but focused on foods). Being suffering from Major Depression (Severe level of gravity, according to the psychological tests) for 7 years since diagnose.

As the title says, I am going to start my senior year in March and, as you could probably guess, I am quite freaked out about this.

I want to ask for a loan to continue my studies abroad (whether it be a master's or another undergrad, remains to be determined). Besides studying, I would also like to stay in whatever country I go to. This is because, as I mentioned, I am gay and would one day like to get married, have a family, etc. and, sadly, Panama is very... conservative, to put it gently.

With all of that said, I have the following questions:

1) What countries would you recommend to study at? Preferibly, if you know of any countries with Co-Op careers (That means, study and work at the same time as part of the whole program).

2) In what countries would it be easier to get a job and a permanent residence? I know in any country that would be hard, but you get my point.

3) In order to graduate my current university, I have to make a ""graduation test"". This can be a scientific research thesis, an internship in a food industry or taking two post-grad classes for a semester either here or in another country. Which one would you recommend if I aspire to get a scholarship anywhere?

I think that's all. Any other advice, experiences or anything related, is truly welcomed. Also, if you have any further questions or clarification, I would gladly answer any doubts. 

So for now, thank you beforehand and hope you all keep having beautiful days. Bye"

Now, i am open to any mature debate on any coin. We have CBE and CBOE that trade BTC futures, which is already an event in itself that we can all be happy of. But recently i have seen posts on the transaction fees from BTC getting higher. I have personally sent a very large amount ( of dollar equivalent) for 4$. The transaction was over in an hour. I do believe that BTC has flaws. But since im a veteran in BTC, im this close of converting to BCH, i have read many arguments. But have not read THE one that makes me change my mind.

I’ve been at work from 8-4 I came home and cooked, then went to bed to rest.

3hrs later... Mom comes into my room

“Why are you so lazy?” Hmmm idk maybe because I’ve been standing on my feet all day, dealing with delusional people all day at my fucking job!!

“I’ve been working all day!” Yeah, no shit. Me too! Imagine how I fucking feel.

“Why do I have to do everything? I have to come home and decorate the tree, too?” You don’t have to decorate the ducking tree.

It drives me insane she comes home and just fucking bitches and complains. But then she’ll ask my brother how his fucking day went and baby him. Then he will make a silly remark about how I “should help decorate.”

Mind you... I’ve been telling them for weeks I don’t want a Christmas tree this year, it’s too much work, I’m stressed out with finals, and studying, an internship, and work but what do they do? They drag a fucking Christmas tree in the house while I’m trying to fucking write an essay!!! Then they force me to help them set it up.

My mom left the room and said “you’re so selfish. You don’t think about anyone but yourself.” I cried... and then I got so angry I came on reddit to vent. I hate my family... I try not to use that word but I do. I feel more attached to people who aren’t even my family.

Figuring out how to gain followers

https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/37135

DNC becky:

&gt; Sure, some people will follow him without prompting, but you’d be surprised by how much more effective it is to straight-up tell people to do it.

AAPI puppet:
&gt;Wouldn’t people naturally follow the guy anyway because we talked about him in the tweet itself? Since we’re rolling out 1 per day, it would be redundant to keep asking people to follow. We figured we would tell people a little about the caucus chairs and why they do what they do.

Another AAPI:

&gt;I disagree entirely with the need to ask for action in this context. This is a celebratory month…we highlight and raise the profile of those AAPI leaders who make a difference in organizing for the Democratic Party. 

DNC becky replies:
&gt;My point is that you should be asking them for action and telling them why they should take that action. I find it a little strange to just show followers AAPI community leaders without telling them more about them or where to learn more about their work.




https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/27598

DNC becky:
&gt;Can we write an original tweet for this? You want to make sure you're retweeting a diversity of voices. I understand that this is a great outlet for the community, but we should be conscious of the optics for anyone visiting the page. You can use any of the photos of POTUS from here in the tweet https://www.flickr.com/photos/barackobamadotcom

AAPI puppet:
&gt;Fine, here is a tweet with link from a different outlet. It's just that there is a** dearth of mainstream outlets for Asians, period**.

http://bit.ly/1Tbtrvr

DNC becky:
&gt;Think about your audience here - I understand why you would want to thank CAPAC, but would it be a better use of your platform to call out a prominent GOP rep. for using a slur?

I'm struggling with a bunch of things atm and feeling sorta suicidal.. I know it'll pass but I just really wanted to talk to someone and don't really have any friends. 

I live a pretty isolated life and thats given me a lot of time for self improvement.. in the last 2 years I've lost about 140lbs, putting me in the 'overweight' category for the first time in my adult life (I've always been morbidly obese). I also started running and tbh it's saved me.. I just started training with my local running club for a half marathon. I've worked my way up from a 5k. 

I've also got great grades, have filled my resume with jobs and internships and volunteering.. I have so much going for me, but I still feel so down sometimes. 

I struggle with chronic loneliness and I have really serious trust issues. I thought maybe losing all the weight would open up my dating pool but I feel just as horrible about my weight and my loose skin/flab. I struggle to open up or get close with anyone, its a cycle of fear of others which leads to loneliness. 

I should feel amazing about all I've accomplished, especially my weight loss.. but I just feel equally as undateable as I was when I was 300+lbs. I have been working really hard to learn to be alone and I've mostly succeeded but I think now I've accidentally gone too far in the other direction and I feel like no one can relate to me or my weight loss or my past (which is a whole other story).. 

Anyway, I know this is more about mental health than fitness, I hope thats okay.. I feel lucky that my training is going great, I always manage to get out the door even when I don't feel like it... Putting in my daily miles is probably the only time I don't feel incredibly lonely or down about my body image. 

I guess I don't need advice or anything, I just wanted someone to hear me out. Thank you.  "

My family has filed for bankruptcy multiple times. The first in 2007 right before the housing crisis, and my dad filed again recently due to credit card debt. It has been rough but I've been able to get my own apartment and well paying internships.

Up until July I never really had a credit history apart from loans I took out for school. I never wanted a credit card because living with my dad and brother I knew it would be held against me, especially with my brother. Knowing I had an ""extra"" five hundred dollars ""laying"" around would have been to tempting for him. So, I only got one when I moved out of the dorms at school and in to my own place.

I only have a 500 dollar limit but I feel like I'm fine with that since I don't really want the limit above what I make in a month. Using that, I was able to bring my score up from 650 to 704 in a little under 6 months. 

Just wanted to share cause I didn't realize that it wouldn't take long at all to improve it!

Thanks!"

7l2l23,3,2017-12-20,I'm stuck in a slump,Verano_Zombie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7l2l23/im_stuck_in_a_slump/,"That's how I feel. Everyday I wake up, (around noon, usually, at 10-11 pm when I'm in a better mood), I make coffee, then I sit in front of my room desk, listen to some music while going through texts and instagram and then I try to study. 
Everyday is the same.
I manage to study max 2 hours (three when I'm in a better mood) and then I feel useless and guilty all day long.
It will sound pathetic to you, but the only thing that pushes me through the day is talking to some friend over the phone during the day.

I got my three year university degree in 2015 and since then I'm struggling to get my next one (two year long this time).
I should have graduated this november but I've still got four exams, my thesis and the internship left, with no desire to do any of those things.
I would really like to drop everything and get a job, but at this point it would be foolish, so I feel forced to got this second degree.

I'm 27 and I'm battling anxiety and possibly a bipolar disorder since 2013 and I feel useless. I got a job in a pizzeria, part time, from 7 pm to 10 pm, which makes me feel
even more useless. There is people that at my age are so forward me in life that makes me feel bad about myself.
When I come back from work, if I don't have to go out after, I feel so bored and sad that I took my anti-insomnia pills and go straight to bed,
even if it's just 10 pm.

I'm also losing my will to socialize. In the last few months I hung out with my friends like less than 10 times.
Everybody is so busy and seems to have no time to go out, so I don't even try to organize something anymore.
Also we have only one car in the family, which I have to share with my sister now.

Did someone feel like this at a point in their life? How did you react?"
7l2l2d,13,2017-12-20,Season twelve discussion (my thoughts as I watch for the first time),PAKMan1988,Degrassi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Degrassi/comments/7l2l2d/season_twelve_discussion_my_thoughts_as_i_watch/,"And I'm back with my episode reviews, this time for season twelve! Personally, this is the season I was really looking forward to watching. Cam's arc is one I've been wanting to see ever since I first learned about it, and I've just heard nothing but positives about this season! But enough talk - let's get started!

*Episodes 1201 &amp; 1202 - Come as You Are (1 &amp; 2)*

Main plot (Drew/Katie) - So...yeah, Katie raped Drew. It's clearly the elephant in the room, and yet the show didn't discuss it at all. I feel like, if they had, this would have been a much stronger plot. But instead, they treated it like normal relationship drama, which it wasn't. Drew was highly, highly intoxicated (if he didn't even remember what he did, that's awful) and Katie should have recognized this. Yes, I get that she was emotional from the breakup and that she probably wasn't thinking clearly, but imagine if she'd been a guy and Drew had been a woman. And Drew clearly is emotionally struggling; the look of shock on his face as he finds out what happened is clear. Even during that final break up scene, look how uncomfortable he looks. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad episode; but they could have, and should have, done so much more with it.

Subplot A (Clare/Eli) - Well, for better or for worse, Eclare is back! I definitely understand why people are so polarized on this relationship, but at this point, I think these two giving it another go isn't a bad idea. Eli has clearly grown and is in a much better place than he was. Clare actually is kind of put off by this at first, with her being shocked that Eli isn't mentioning their kiss. But clearly, his relationship is not the #1 most important issue for him anymore, which I feel shows great progress for him. And when Clare learns she has to bail on him in favor of her internship, he's not mad. In fact, he even jokes about his past actions, which I think also shows growth for him. I really don't know how I feel about them as a couple yet, but now at least they're making the effort at developing a new relationship and starting over. That's what I like :)

Subplot B (Maya) - Can I just say how awkward this was to watch as a 29-year-old man? I actually wrote in my episode notes something to the effect of, ""Yeah, I'm not saying a word about a 14-year-old girl's chest."" Awkwardness aside, I thought this was a good plot for Maya, and shows that she does have her insecurities. And it's been some time since Degrassi has done a body insecurity plot. Maya thinks Mo doesn't like her because of her body; but he clearly meant her age when he referred to ""maturity,"" not her body. And of course Maya killed her audition and is now part of Mo's band. Her getting back at Owen at the end of the episode was pretty funny, too, as was that sick burn she gave (""It's the most action you'll get all year!"") Was it just me, or did Owen actually look hurt by that comment?

*Episodes 1203 &amp; 1204 - Walking on Broken Glass (1 &amp; 2)*

Main plot (Katie/Drew) - Now this episode did something that I don't really seem to recall the show ever doing; both parts focused on the same issue (Drew and Katie's breakup) but each part focused on a different perspective. In part one, we saw Katie dealing with the aftermath, and in part two, we saw Drew working to repair his relationship with Bianca. With Katie, I get that she's emotional and that she has every right to be mad about what happened - Drew breaking up with her just as she finishes rehab - but she is not coping with it well at all. From egging Bianca's car - low blow, considering Bianca is the reason Drew didn't break up with you earlier - to using that clip of Drew in the hockey video. Just when I was starting to like Katie, she does all of this. Her also confessing to Snake was a bit surprising, but I can't help but think it's all part of some plan she has. As for Drew, I'm glad they followed up with his fall from the season premiere. And I'm glad they brought up that this wasn't his first concussion - he received one when he was MMA fighting - and the show did a great job portraying his struggles. Luke Bilyk showed some much-improved acting here, and I'm glad Drew is finally getting some help for his serious medical condition.

Subplot A (Eli/Becky) - This was a good plot that shows what happens when two people with massive egos go against each other. Eli wanted full control of the play himself - mostly so he can apply to college - but Becky beat him to it. Then the two of them are clashing because Eli doesn't want to do Romeo &amp; Juliet. But then Eli gets his revenge by making it Romeo &amp; Jules and casting Tristan as the lead. Becky's obviously in the wrong here, and it was great to see Eli work to tell her off. The dynamic between conservative Becky and atheist Eli is going to be interesting to watch, and Becky is clearly incredibly sheltered. Eli's last line of the episode, ""Welcome to Degrassi,"" is one that I LOVED. I was also happy to see Eli fighting for Tristan, because this play is more than just a play; it's making a statement.

Subplot B (Tristan/Cam/Maya) - And so it begins with Cam. Tristan thinking Cam was gay is interesting (and shows that, for the second time, Tristan mistook someone for being gay that wasn't, the first being Adam) and I thought it was pretty low for Tristan to use Maya's Facerange to chat with him. That scene at the end when Tristan revealed what he was doing to Cam was actually really heartbreaking. Cam actually looked like he was going to cry. I thought it was great that they established early on that Cam is lonely and doesn't have many friends; obviously anyone who gives him attention he'll be attracted to. A small plot, but an important one, in establishing the early dynamic between these three. I can't wait to see how this keeps developing!"

I put myself out there, online like tinder and OKCupid, and in real life, but no one wants to date me. I barely get any matches online or get into a conversation online either, but to the average person, they get hundreds of matches a week and can get laid multiple times a month, whereas I only get 2-3 matches a week and only maybe 2 dates a month, and after each date, they ghost or make up some excuse as to why they don't want to date me anymore.

My therapist you only have to be perfect for one person to get into a relationship. Then how do people get into multiple relationships when they are in my age, yet people like me can't even get a kiss from a girl? Some people are just more perfect than others, whereas when people look at me, they see someone who looks unbelievable ugly. I even try to live for myself and do better things to improve myself, such as having a high-paying internship, working out/eating healthy, having a someone fit body with almost abs, doing my hair and having a nice sense of fashion, but all these put together, I can't even attract one person. I even ask some people on reddit if ""hypothetically, if we knew each other irl and I asked you on a date, how would you feel?"" and I got a lot of nos because I'm not their type or that I'm too ugly-looking. 

It makes me feel even worse that some people on this subreddit complain that they are lonely yet have a SO who loves them dearly. And it also makes me feel bad when people who can't even talk to the opposite sex (especially guys) who get asked out by girls out of the blue. 

Like what do I have to be anymore? 

I just want to hold someone's hand and travel the world with them. Kiss them as the ball drops in New York on new years, go on a month-long vacation in Europe. And at night, just cuddle with me as we watch movies. No one will give me that opportunity. No one looks at me and wants to do that stuff with me.

I almost can't listen to music anymore because all the songs are love related and it just makes me feel worse that it doesn't happen to me. And going to events alone makes me feel just as bad seeing people hold hands and enjoying each other's company.

I'm not perfect for anybody.

If you're a woman reading this, please please please help me out. Am I really that bad? Am I really that ugly? Am I really that unwanted and deserving to be lonely? Why do I get treated so badly? "
7l4c6y,0,2017-12-20,Me [22 M] with my boyfriend [19 M] of 8 months broke up because I was texting another guy.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7l4c6y/me_22_m_with_my_boyfriend_19_m_of_8_months_broke/,"After several bad relationships I met the most amazing guy at the end of April this year. He is truly so down to earth, so humble, so loving and so generous. He was everything I had wanted and more. At the time, the only problem was that I was graduating college/moving outside of the US (for grad school) and he was a freshman staying in college. Nevertheless, we gave it a shot with the hope of seeing what would happen. The months to follow were the happiest I had ever been. He was interning in a law office and I would pick him up everyday, eager to see him. We were inseparable - in fact until we broke up two day ago we were inseperable.  

My feelings for him just got stronger with time, so much so I couldn't bear with the thought of leaving him. He also asked me to stay and quite frankly that was the easiest decision I had ever made. I have no regrets about it. There was no way I wanted to risk losing him while I was abroad, so I re-enrolled in my alma mater for grad school. 

Everything was perfect between us. We would go on the most amazing dates, escape our hometown, and practically get lost with each either having a romantic dinner, going to the beach, walking hours on end in Central Park or taking boat rides together, laying on the ground watching the clouds/ or napping, etc. Every date we had was unique and special. We reached a point where we began talking about how madly in love we were and couldn't really bare to be apart. We talked about a future together, we got promise rings and promised to each other that we would be together forever. 

We both had rough summer, him with his internship, me battling my recurring depression (i've had since I was young). But through all of it we came out significantly stronger and happier with every passing day. We overcame so much together, we learned our inner demons - my depression and his insecurities and we we super supporting.

Sadly I made a huge mistake that I don't think I can forgive myself for . I don't know why I did it - but I began talking to another guy in November (for a day). I had no intention of ever meeting or doing anything with this guy. My boyfriend found out after seeing my email and he confronted me with it. I promised I would never do it again and forgave me. Again I have to emphasize that he is the most amazing guy on this planet. A week later, I did it again. I spoke to a this person for no more than a day and regretted it immediately. I blocked his number and forgot it ever happened. My boyfriend and I were doing great. We are dealing with the stress of school and work but we were still madly in love (I am still madly in love with him). Two days ago, he went on my computer and saw the messages with that guy in an archived folder. Don't know how it got there but it did. He felt completely betrayed and broke up with me. I begged for him to stay but he told me that he couldn't right now. He doesn't trust me at all and because he is going abroad for a month he say there isn't time to build it again. He's off to Spain for a month in less than a week and I can't bear the idea of being apart from him. I miss him so much, I find myself breaking down multiple times a day regretting what I have done and wanting to take it back. I know I'm being selfish and that he needs space and time right now. I'm going to give him that because he deserves that and so much more. I just can't handle the thought of losing him. I don't know how to cope. My friends tell me that, I am stupid for betraying my boyfriends trust (I don't disagree one bit) and that given how much we care about each other we will one day get back together. Im just afraid that I ruined one of the most important things I had. Any suggestion on how to deal with this / how to control my anxiety? how I should handle the break up? and how to prove to him that he's the only person I love and want to be with?

7l4cye,2,2017-12-20,Trying to decide on Urban Studies vs. Urban Planning master's program. Advice?,ChezMirage,urbanplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/7l4cye/trying_to_decide_on_urban_studies_vs_urban/,"Hi folks, thanks in advance for clicking the link. I got the idea to post this thread after reading old subreddit archives about the challenges of urban planning as a job feel and figured it would be best to outright ask for your recommendations or thoughts on what I'll talk about. 

**BACKGROUND**

* Young 20s male
* Have been admitted to a program in Urban Studies at non-prestigious (satisfactory, middle of the line) University in the USA
* Got the idea to apply on recommendation from different architects in my city
* The program I am in is flexible enough that I could easily change from Urban Studies into Urban Planning with minimal delay on my graduation or without it costing me much
* The program I chose requires you to get at least 1 semester of an internship in a related field to even graduate
* Most people in the program who go on to pursue the PhD in Urban Studies don't get the degree; they wind up working at the local Federal Reserve Economic Index or at a similar institution doing research 

From my understanding, a lot of people get into Urban Planning thinking they are going to play Sim City. The harsh reality they are then faced with is that getting your projects through is a problem of diplomacy and politics moreso than theorycrafting. Likewise, a quick search of old posts on this sub tells me that I shouldn't bother with Urban Studies unless I want to teach. 



**WHY IT INTERESTS ME**


* I really really like what I learn about in school, to the point where I stole all the syllabi for next semester and have started reading textbooks early 
* I did my undergraduate degree with a focus on Medieval History; specifically the manner in which the design of Siena, Italy may have exacerbated the workings of the plague upon the populace. 
* For all of the reasons expanded upon in this older post from when I was in History: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7534sk/phds_of_reddit_what_is_a_dumbed_down_summary_of/do4gc4b/
* I suppose you could say I'm very interested in applying a historical or sociological perspective to examine the ways in which people interact with urban habitats. 
* I grew up watching the suburb I lived in literally fall apart due to gross negligence on the part of my local politicians, city planners, and financiers. I want to understand what pressures they faced and what in their power they could have done to combat the utter failure of my hometown. 


My end goal is to have enough experience with zoning laws, politics, urban theory, and charter programs to build next-gen public housing projects. I'm not talking ugly brick walk-ups. I'm talking walled neighborhoods in which we take in whole families, send the entire family to school, have counselors, have job internships and tutor programs for any who apply.. that sort of stuff. I was lucky enough to get a scholarship when I was young to go to my city's rich-people-only-private-school, so I know enough of the power players in my town that I could perhaps convince them to invest in the idea, if only to turbo-train employees for them. 


...I would also settle for figuring out *if* what I suggest above could ever BE viable. 



**WHY I THINK THINGS COULD GO HORRIBLY AWRY**



* I feel like an outcast in my own program already because all of the students seem to see me as a try-hard. I'm not a try hard, I just really fucking love urban theory. I won't lie, I need a strong social component to whatever I do, so if this is a job field where people are cruddy towards each other I want to know now.
* The way some people talk about the politics on this sub makes me a little nervous. I'm no stranger to utterly inane bureaucratic practices nor institutional corruption. But people make it seem like a degree with *either* is a dead-end job where you resign yourself to a life of misery. 
* I know that Urban Planning, at least, has difficulty with finding jobs. I'm fine with relocating to anywhere but the Great Plains. 
* At some point I would like to leave the country and I am not sure how a degree in Urban Planning would transfer over. I know of at least one Professor in Oxford who would be willing to take me in with Urban Studies, so this is more of a problem if I go with UP. 
* Given all the different things you can do with either degree, I am unsure of what sort of internship to go for. 




**LEND ME YOUR EARS (AND THOUGHTS)**


Again, I would really appreciate any and all advice you all might offer. I find both fields of study immensely interesting. Anything you could say to address what I'm worried about or reinforce what you think would be the best field for me would be really appreciated. If you have any questions, please ask!

7l528j,67,2017-12-20,[Mf] a night out with the intern,Tattoodo,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/7l528j/mf_a_night_out_with_the_intern/,"Let me start out by telling you a bit about where I work. I work in a very casual office setting. Our office is in an old retro fitted warehouse downtown. It consists of an office area and a lounge with couches, tv's, game consoles, pool table etc. It's pretty awesome. We're all basically free lancers so there's no dress code or anything. Very laid back.

So this particular story is about an intern we brought on about a year ago and this incident took place over the summer. Her name is Alexis, she has brunette hair to her shoulders, beautiful green eyes and a very pretty face. She's tall (I'd say like 5'8) with long legs that come up to a nice bubbly butt. She also has an amazing hour glass shaped accented with big perky breasts. She was 20 at the time. 

The first time I met her at the interview I knew two things; she was a very shy possibly innocent girl, and I was going to fuck her. I was only wrong about one of those things. The interview went well and she got the internship.

Over the next few months we got to know eachother pretty well. We would joke and tease eachother during work, and would hang out late going to local bars (She luckily had a fake ID). I would tell her about my sexual escapades from when I was around her age and she would tell me about her sorority and all the crazy parties she would go to. 

Well one day, she came in wearing a short black dress that showed off her long elegant legs and displayed her cleavage perfectly. Gotta love business casual. Now, I would always check her out and I'm sure she knew this, but on this day I couldn't take my eyes off her. I watched as she would strut around the office swishing her short dress around, hoping to catch a glace of her ass. I remember she was also being extra flirty that day. We had an long conversation while she was just leaning on my desk on her elbows. I could tell she wasn't wearing a bra and I was just praying that her breasts would fall out of that low cut dress. My eyes would drift from her sparkly green eyes to her beautiful cleavage every chance I got. She was chatting away, her eyes looking to the side aimlessly as I stole another glance. I could see her perky nipples poking through, i wonder what they looked like. I could feel myself stiffen in my jeans. Her tits are just crazy perky. Fuck... I realised I was daydreaming and I snapped myself out of it, and raised my eyes back to hers. And she was just looking at me. I realised she stopped talking probably years ago and she was just staring at me. I was caught. This is awkward...

""You wanna do something tonight"" she said, breaking the silence. 
""Sure whatcha wanna do?""
""I don't know.. something crazy""
I think to myself for a second and get the greatest idea I've ever had.
""Strip club?"" 
""Uhh fuck yeah"" she exclaimed with a mischevious smile 
The rest of the day was a kind of blur. All I could think about was dollar bills flying, alcohol pouring and big titties in alexis' face. 

Now real quick, I never thought I'd actually hook up with her. I thought we were just cool friends and I honestly thought she was out of my league, so I just thought we would go out have some drinks and have a good time. 
It was finally closing time. I met alexis in the parking deck and we hail a taxi to the titty club. On the way she tells me she's never been to a strip club and she was a little nervous. We finally get to the club and go in. Alexis just kind of freezes and her eyes grow big looking at all of the naked women walking around. Laughing, I grab her and we head to an out of the way table in the corner of the club and we get some drinks to kill the nerves. About three drinks in and some conversation later, I tell her I was going to buy her a dance 
""I don't think I'm ready for all that, how about I buy you one and see how it's done"" 
I shrug ""fair enough"". She picks out the girl and a few minutes later I have a stripper grinding my lap to some shitty club music. As the glittered boobs smack me in the face, I look over at alexis. She's sitting there and I can tell she's getting turned on. She's kind of squirming in her seat biting her lip as her eyes go up and down the strippers sexy petite body. Finally She can't take it any longer. ""can I touch you?"" She coyly asks the dancer grinding on me. The girl glady says yes and alexis rolls her chair right next to mine and she just starts groping her. First her waist then her ass then up to her boobs. I hear the stripper moan in my ear as alexis plays with her nipples and I'm just sitting there enjoying the show. Finally the dance is over, the dancer is paid and its just me and alexis alone at the table again. 

""That was fucking hot"" she says in my ear over the loud music. 
""Uh-uh yeah it was!"" I agree.
""I think I can do better though"" she says smiling at me. I choke on my drink and look at her with what probably was a deer in headlights look. Before I knew it, alexis was on my lap, facing away from me. At first she was just slightly moving her hips against my lap. I felt her perky ass move back and forth across my ever growing cock. My hands were locked on the arm rest of the chair, unsure if I should touch her. Then she started getting more into the music, popping her ass back and forth. She definitely could feel my excitement, there's no way she couldn't. She reached for my hands and placed them on her hips. I watch her ass grinding on me, her short dress hiking up more and more. I squeeze her hips, holding back the urge to venture my hands elsewhere. Her dress finally hikes up enough (mayybe helped by my hands on her hips, maybe) and I finally get a glimpse of her perky little ass in a simple black thong. My rising excitement turns into a full hard on. She feels in between her legs and lays back, her head on my shoulder and she lets out a little giggle
""so how am I doing?"" 
""Good. Very good"" 
I'm not good with words under pressure.
She giggles again then grabs my hands and raised them to grasp her breasts. I don't hesitate and I begin groping her perky breasts, amazed by just how perky they feel. With the feeling of her ass grinding against my hard cock, only a few pieces of fabric separating us and the feeling of her amazing breasts in my hands, I begin feeling that sensation in my lower regions and I know I have to get her to stop before I blow a load in my pants. I sadlymove my hands away from her breasts ""I think you're pissing off the dancers"" I say, nodding towards a group of disgruntled looking strippers by the bar. 
""Oh shit"" and with that alexis was back in her seat.
""You Ok? You're looking a bit... frazzled"" she says looking at me
Yeah, yeah I'm good"" I reply, wiping the sweat from my brow. Her eyes leave mine and look down at my lap and she kind of gapes for a second, covering her hand over her mouth. I thought she was shocked by my erection selection, but when I look down I see a pretty noticable wet spot on the cusp of my jeans. 
""You weren't the only one excited"" she says laughing. 
We ended up having a few more drinks at the club, talking and laughing, the excitement dying down from that glorious dance and my pants dried. After an hour or so we leave the club and head back to the office. The taxi drive was pretty unremarkable as the buzz from the club begins to die down. I remember sitting in the taxi thinking that I'll never get another chance to grab alexis' breasts again. Oh how wrong I was.
We get back to the parking garage and I prepare to say bye. 
""You wanna grab a beer in the office?"" Alexis says, throwing me off a bit (yeah, we have a beer fridge in the office, ftw) 
""Uh yeah"" I spat out blatantly, and away into the office we go. It's obviously empty since it's about 11pm. We grab some beers pop on some music and grab a seat on the couch in the lounge. 
""So that was an interesting experience"" alexis says, fiddling with the tab on her beer can
""Uh yeah"" I say, still being not good at words.
""Should I quit my job and become a stripper?"" She says smiling, 
""Absolutely, I've never had that good of a dance"" 
""I know, I could feel"" she says looking down at my crotch ""it felt so good against me...""She trails off. Her eyes glitter as she looks back up to me, her hand moves to my lap. We lock eyes ""..I'm pretty sure I'm still wet..."" Her hand glides across the top of my jeans, stopping at my crotch. I feel my dick begin to stiffen, she feels it too. ""..And I'm pretty sure I almost made you cum..."" Her nimble fingers begin moving up and down my hardening cock. I stare at her, with my mouth open, like a fucking doofus
""W-wanna make out"" I so elegantly say. In a flash her lips are on mine. My hand instinctively go to her ass as she shifts her weight onto her hip closest me, draping her knees over my lap as her hand quickly rubs my now rock hard cock. Our tongues caress eachother sloppily as my hand explores her body, finding it's way up to her breasts. She reached and does this thing where she undos my belt, unbuttons and unzips my pants in one swift motion. My cock feels the freedom from the constraints of my jeans and her fingers wrap around it, aggressively stroking through my boxers.
I try to slide her dress out of the way to expose her nipples but she's a step ahead of me. She stands up and takes her dress off, dropping it to the floor in a heap. I catch my breath as I admire her, just standing there in nothing but a little black thong. Her beautiful breasts slightly bounce in the dimly lit room, her nipples erect. I travel my eyes downher perfectly flat belly to her beautiful hips, then down her long legs. I rip my shirt off as I stand up, my jeans falling to just below my knees. I struggle getting the bastards off as alexis goes to the pool table across from us and leans on it. I meet her and our lips meet again, kissing aggressively. I press against her body, my erection pressing against her. She moves her hand from my side, down the front of my boxers. 
Feeling her hand on my cock with no fabric in between feels amazing. She rubs the pre cum from my tip, brings her fingers up to her mouth and licks it from her fingers, then she spits a glob into her hand and back down to my cock it goes. Her warm saliva feels like ecstacy and she slides her hand down my cock and caresses my swollen balls. I move my hand to her lower stomach and start to slip my fingers down her panties. My soft fingers are greeted with alexis' excitement as I slide them between her smooth wet pussy. She moans into my mouth as we continue making out. She then breaks from me, her hand leaving my cock and causing my hand to leave her nervana. She looks at me with desire burning through her sparkly green eyes. She pushes me back and drops to her knees. Her eyes locked with mine the entire time
She slowly moves her fingers up to the waist of my boxers, delicately grasping them and slowly sliding them down, causing my cock to flops out. And she slowly grasps it with one hand as her other cups my balls. The slow movements contrast the aggressive passion from a moment ago. I feel myself inhale quickly as she caresses my balls, moving her other hand rythmetically up and down my shaft. Her green eyes flash away so to catch a glimpse at my member that she's so delicately jerking off, but then her eyes quickly meet mine again. She slowly opens her mouth and places the head of my cock on her out stretched tongue, all the while still jerking and caressing with her hands.
She slowly takes me into her mouth, a little bit at first, but the second time she gently pushes myself all the way down her throat. She takes her hand from my shaft and reaches down to her little black thong. She pushes it down the best she can to mid thigh, then she shifts her legs and spreads her thighs slightly and her hand goes straight between her legs and she begins rubbing her self. She let's out a moan as she takes me fully into her mouth again. Her hands now caressing my balls more intensely like they were baoding balls. I close my eyes as she works her magic on me. I feel my knees trembling. I open my eyes to her looking up at me as she continues taking me into her mouth time and time again. She stops and takes my cock out of her mouth, a trail of spit connecting us as she breathlessly looks up at me, her hand left my balls and continued the work her mouth was doing on my rock hard member. 
I can't take it any longer. I grab her by the arms, turn her around and lay her flat on the pool table, her thighs spread a little. I take a step back to admire her perky little ass and the glimpse of her moist tight pussy. I aim myself and gently push my head inside of her. She's incredibly warm and tight. I grab her hips and gently push my self fully into her. She lets out a loud moan as I continue fucking her. ""Harder"" she whispers and I oblige, pushing into her with some force, pulling her hips toward me. I see her move her hands to the edge of the pool table and grasp the edges tightly, her knuckles turning white. I reach for her brunette hair and I give it a little tug, she obediently arches her back as I continue fucking her. Her moans continue to intensify. I reach my hand around her arched torso and find her erect nipple, I give it a sharp pinch and she lets out another loud moan as I continue my intense dance of dick. Then She lets out the loudest moan yet as I feel her body quiver violently with my thrusts. I feel the warm rush on my cock and her body go limp as she reaches her peak. This sets me over the edge. ""Im about to cum"" I say breathlessly and she pulls a ways from my cock and surprisingly drops to her knees, still clearly recovering from her orgasm, and takes my cock into her mouth, it still dripping with her excitement. She thrusts my cock into her mouth a few times before stopping and she begins ferociously stroking it as she locks her eyes with mine ""cum for me"" she silently mouths and with that I blast rope after rope of warm cum all over her face.its so intense that my body jerks as I continue blowing my load on to her. I open my eyes to the mess I made on alexis' face, my hot cum dripping down her face, off her chin and onto.her perky beautiful breasts. The picture of her covered in my cum still turns me on today. 
She quickly does a clean up using her fingers to scoop up my excitement and licking it up. I watch intently as a naked alexis licks every drop off of her fingers with the most satisfied grin on her face. We finally get dressed, and we finish our half empty beers. Finally We realise it's almost 2 am and we need to be up the next morning for work. We go our separate ways and I reminisce the entire drive home. Alexis still works at my office and now we share this dirty little secret of a night. We always laugh to ourselves when we see someone playing pool or leaning on that part of the table. We still hook up occasionally when the mood strikes.
A quick side note, I couldn't wash the stripper glitter from my pants and had to throw them away"
7l5ejk,1,2017-12-20,36M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7l5ejk/36m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - /r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Visitor to the porn set - Your friend is a well known porn star, and she travels the world for shoots to all sorts of glamorous places. She has taken you to a few shoots so you fully understand how in control of things she is. She surprises you with a trip to a luxurious mansion on an island where she is shooting, you have most of the time to relax but she has to work for a couple of days. On the set, one of the male performers starts chatting to you and you are finding it hard to resist.

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

2017 13 inch MacBook pro- i7 processor 8gb memory 256 SSD PRICE: 1799

MacBook- i7 processor 8gb memory 512 SSD PRICE: 1749

Obviously any of these machines will be more than capable of web browsing, Netflix, etc. I work in a digital field and mostly do my video editing (Photoshop, premiere pro, after effects) at work. However, I will OCCASIONALLY want to work from home. To complicate matters, my internship with this team is over in a few weeks, and it is hard to predict what the requirements the new team (hopefully I get a full time job!) will ask of me in terms of doing my work in the office/at home. 

I need a new laptop now and cannot wait because I am currently without one. 

Full disclosure- I had a MacBook (the fourth option, but with i5 and not i7) and it did not handle premiere pro well at all. I loved it so much, so I was sad to see it go. I'm hopeful, but doubtful, that option 4 is best for me. 

1800 is my absolute max price so please don't suggest the top of the line new 15 inch laptop. 

What makes more of a difference in graphics/video editing work- the processor, the built in memory, or the SSD? Which of the 4 options is the best bang for my buck?

Thank you so much!"

While it’d be awesome to make a lot of money for a few years at Big Law and then become an AUSA (hopefully) I cannot stand to work at a Big Law Firm. Im really happy for anyoveryone else who does but it’s not for me cause I really just want to do Public Service. 

If I graduate in the top 25% at UVA then I should be a strong candidate for Big Law. 
If instead of doing that I become an ADA at Cooke county (where Chicago is) and then after a few years apply to become an AUSA would my chances be less than someone at Big Law, equal to someone at Big Law, or greater than? 
I think I should at least be = because I had the grades and Law school ranking to get into Big Law combined with Prosecutorial experience.

Secondly, to become an ADA grades and an internship their are the most important factors. Is it necessary to do an internship the summer after your 2L year or would you still be a strong candidate if you intern during your 1L summer? Because I want to intern at the DOJ in DC during the 2L summer.
Also UVA has a prosecution clinic where for 2 days a week you can work at the Eastern District of VA at the Richmond office. And during the second half of the school year you are prepared to prosecute a misdemeanor case from arrest to sentencing. Will this make it easier to get the AUSA job along with the DOJ summer internship and being an ADA?

7l6py6,217,2017-12-20,"UPDATE: Have you ever had a moment where the thought hit you, ""there is nothing in DC for me and I should just leave""?",ccnm,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/7l6py6/update_have_you_ever_had_a_moment_where_the/,"Hey. I'm the person who posted about crying on the bus earlier this year, about 9 months ago, and got the most warm, amazing, kind responses. Here's the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/5xtj62/have_you_ever_had_a_moment_where_the_thought_hit/

First off, thank you to everyone who responded. I read every single one, even though I wasn't in a good state of mind to respond and engage back then. I'm sorry.

I didn't know if anyone would be interested in seeing an update, but I wanted to do one because there's a lot of people who were, are, or will be in my shoes at some point, and I just want them to know: it's going to get better. Or maybe it won't, but you can make things better by moving away. I don't know.

When I posted that, I was at a real low point. I was 25, about to graduate from my master's program, and had no real job lined up aside from a very, very poorly paid part-time job that I was already working with no health benefits. I was literally making less than 30K a year before taxes. I had been in DC for 4 years and I was sick of it. I stressed out all the time, thinking I wasn't going to make it in DC, that I should just go back to my home state.

In May, I graduated. I had a constant stream of interviews with different nonprofits, but I could never make it to the final round. I had a hiring manager tell me to my face, while I was 10 minutes into an in-person interview, that she thought I was unqualified and it had been a mistake to bring me in. She offered to call me an Uber and I politely declined. I started crying the moment the elevator doors closed and cried on the bus all the way back home. So yeah, it was a real rough time.

And then, in June, one of those interviews turned into a full-time job offer at a think tank in DC. The pay was lower than what I expected, but it's on par for nonprofits, I was able to negotiate a slight increase in my starting salary, and the health insurance is actually really cheap. The organization is small, so I started right away as a mid-level manager, and I now manage an assistant and a paid intern. The feeling of being a full-time employee versus a temporary part-time worker is astoundingly amazing. My anxiety has subsided substantially, and I feel generally calm and content about my job situation. 

Given the bump in my salary, I was able to move out of my basement apartment and into a different apartment that's within walking distance of my work. I don't need to take the bus to commute anymore, so no chance of hitting my head.

Even though this is a positive update, I still have to say this: I still think it's time for me to leave DC. Aside from my job, there's really nothing for me here, and I would be able to do my job from anywhere - my organization is really awesome about letting people telecommute permanently. Not to get into personal stuff too much, but I basically feel that a) all the different friends and friend groups that I've made in the 4 years since moving here have faded away, either moved away or moved on to different stages of their lives, and b) the dating situation has been terrible for me personally, and as I get older, I don't think it's going to get any better.

So I really think I am ready to leave, and I am planning to visit and scope out a couple of different cities during the first half of 2018 to determine where I want to go. Here's to an exciting new year! Such a cheesy thing to say, but I hope everyone's hopes and dreams come true."

MANUSCRIPT – BEGINS 
 
The policy of American government is to leave its citizens free, neither restraining them nor aiding them in their pursuits – Thomas Jefferson 
 
I happen to be aligned to what Jefferson said above.  But your mentalities need not align with mine for me to admire your valor.  If alignment is a prerequisite, then I am permitted to admire the freedom-loving British for their valor during WW II.  Yet I must despise the Russians - who lost 24 million standing up to the same Nazis - just because Russia accepts autocracy and subservience, a way of life abhorrent to me.   
 
But I do not box myself in with the “alignment rule”, and so yes, I admire the Old South’s Civil War valor of 170 years ago, though not its philosophies.  The valor part is remembered in a few old statues. 
 
To be clear, even though I admire the valor of the South, I am glad the South lost the Civil War.  I prefer all 50 states working together and I certainly reject slavery of any kind, especially the creeping, modern, government-operated slavery of taxation and welfare.  
 
AND JUST THINK, we have statues erected to people that have caused this modern slavery.   
 
Jefferson, below, predicted that government, starting from an ideal of liberty, would descend into an era of modern slavery:  Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.  
And that’s exactly what certain people with nice statues have done. 
So when statues are erected to people who seriously and systemically tread upon many millions of Americans over many decades, then I agree -  let’s take ‘em down.  My top three suggestions follow: 
 
1.	Nathan Bedford Forrest – Confederate cavalry general and Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. 
 
Started: Cold Hearted/Evil 
Ended:  Warm Hearted/Redeemed 
Legacy: Disastrous/Evil 
 
 
 
2.	Lyndon Baines Johnson, - Founder of the Great Society welfare state. 
 
Started:  Cold Hearted/Evil 
 Ended:  Cold Hearted/Evil 
 Legacy:  Disastrous/Evil 
 
 
3.	Martin Luther King Jr. – Sold out his people to the Democrats, allowing Blacks to become re-enslaved by LBJ’s welfare dependency system. 
 
Started: Warm Hearted 
Ended:  Warm Hearted 
Legacy: Disastrous/Evil 
 
Legacy trumps intentions.  We will take them in historical order. 
Nathan Bedford Forrest 
 
This self-made man joined the Confederates as a simple soldier at the outset of the Civil War and rose to become the greatest cavalry general on either side of the conflict.  Like his confederate bookend Stonewall Jackson, he was all action all the time, able to move his men great distances at amazing speeds.  A devastating weapon Grant called “that Devil”. 
 
Before the war Forrest traded slaves.  After the war he became Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.  During the war - in cold blood -  his cavalry division massacred a captured Union black infantry unit. 
 
But, like a paroled criminal released before his death, Nathan redeems himself just in time.   
 
His first redemptive act occurs when the Klan had grown to 500,000 members by the time of Ulysses S. Grant’s Presidency - spewing violence everywhere - with Grant throwing the kitchen sink at them to close it all down.   It was Forrest who finally gave what is called “order #1”, ordering: The Klan is over; put away your robes (the Klan would resurface in the 1920’s). 
 
Second, right before his death, Forrest meets with a group of Negroes and gives his famous apology speech which shocks the South.  The Independent Order of Pole-Bearers (predecessor to the NAACP), which was organized by Southern blacks after the war to promote black voting rights, invited Forrest to be their guest speaker, the first white man ever to be invited to speak to the Association. 
 
In this speech he said that there was no reason that the black man could not be doctors, store clerks, bankers, or any other job equal to whites. They were part of our community and should be involved and employed as such just like anyone else.   His concluding remarks follow. 
 
I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment Many things have been said about me which are wrong, and which white and black persons here, who stood by me through the war, can contradict. Go to work, be industrious, live honestly and act truly, and when you are oppressed I'll come to your relief. I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for this opportunity you have afforded me to be with you, and to assure you that I am with you in heart and in hand. (Prolonged applause.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, Forrest redeemed himself, but still, you might want to remove his statues - all things considered.  A good heart at one’s finish does not give one a “pass” when so much damage has been done to whole peoples. 
 
 
 
 
Lyndon Johnson &amp; Martin Luther King Jr. 
 
Too bad for Martin Luther King Jr. - a positive man - that his destiny was so badly corrupted by LBJ - Lyndon Baines Johnson – a pure-evil man.  Here is why I say this. 
 
In the 1960’s I grew up in a rural Connecticut town that grew tobacco.  I worked the farms from age 13 through age 15.   As it happens, in the 1940’s when Martin was a boy, he twice resided in my town, living in farm dormitories during the summers, a “tabaccy picker” just like me.   
 
One day my father and I go to the historical society to view old letters Martin wrote to his mother explaining how different the Northerners were as compared to the severity Martin grew up with down South.  He explains to his mother how he can do whatever he wants, go on the bus to Hartford to see a movie without any of that “back of the bus stuff” happening.   His message: “Mom, we could live like this!”   Us thirteen-year olds in the fields were quite proud to literally be walking in Dr. Kings footsteps. 
 
And so I know that at the start of his maturation, Martin’s intentions were pure, wanting to eliminate conflict, not feed it.  Yet the opposite happened once he rose to the big leagues.   His secret arrangements with LBJ inadvertently - but clearly - made racial matters worse, leading to today’s pattern of pitting welfare recipients against tax payers, all of us pawns of the socialist left.  Should MLK get a pass for these unintended consequences? 
Let’s look at what MLK’s capitulation to the Democrats did to everyone. 
 
It is never said, but the King’s (Martin’s parents) stood Republican - as did many Blacks in the early 1900’s.  After all, during Martin’s boyhood, the dismal record of the Democrats against Blacks was being echoed by the Nazis against the Jews.  When did this Democrat enslavement agenda start?  Way back. 
 
At America’s founding there was only one political party.  It yielded Washington and Adams as Presidents #1 &amp; #2.   Jefferson, wanting to be President #3, and fearing a challenge by Hamilton, decided to skin this “Hamilton” cat by creating what became the Democrat party.  Jefferson’s “States Rights” platform sanctified the right to continue legalized slavery if a state voted for slavery within their local legislature. 
 
Jefferson won, but from then on, a push back movement against slavery grew in the North resulting in the 1854 formation of the Republican party, essentially an abolitionist firewall against the further spread of slavery to the new western territories.   
When the Republican Abraham Lincoln gets elected in 1860, southern Democrats read the tea leaves, and immediately secede from the Union in order to carve their slavebased society out from the rest of America.  
 
Over 1 million Americans casualties accrue during the American Civil War so that Democrats can hold onto their Black slaves. 
 
After the war, Democrats seek workarounds to everyone’s natural rights by inventing the notorious Jim Crow Laws, passed in 1877 by 
Democrat-controlled state legislatures.  Using a separate-but-equal argument, Jim Crow Laws finesse the assertion that all men are created equal, by asserting that one can still be separated even if equal – like chickens, all equal, placed in different coops.  
Protection of Life, Liberty and Property - our due process rights - could be segregated.  
The Jim Crow Laws themselves – i.e. segregation - are finally shot down in 1954, but many other aspects of individual rights remain, such as discrimination in the hiring process. 
Ok, this is where Lyndon Johnson (Mr. Evil) and Martin Luther King, Jr. (Mr. Dup) come into the picture. 
In 1964, the country watches the drama taking place over the passage of the Civil Rights Amendment, 	a 	cornerstone piece of legislation designed to retire the remnants of the Jim Crow era.   80% of Republicans support the bill, with many Democrats in opposition.    
Lyndon &amp; Martin 
The main Democrat standing with the Blacks is Bobby Kennedy, who hates LBJ and plans to wrest the 1968 Democrat primary away from Johnson.   The world watches for 60 days, as eighteen Democrat Senators filibuster against the amendment, with Bobby standing tall.  For example: 
Richard Russell (D-GA) We 
will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races. 
Strom Thurmond (D-SC) This so-called Civil Rights Proposals, which the President has sent to Capitol Hill for enactment into law, are unconstitutional, unnecessary, unwise and extend beyond the realm of reason. This is the worst civil-rights package ever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of the Reconstruction proposals and actions of the radical Republican Congress. 
 
Things are getting dicey, but 
LBJ has a political brainstorm; he will flip history in a way that gets the Blacks behind him and takes the wind out of Bobby’s sails (Left: Bobby and LBJ).   
 
LBJ’s plan: first get the Civil Rights Amendment through the Senate.  He does this by arm-twisting his old Democrat cronies - and then second, create The Great Society welfare programs – effectively buying the old slave population back through dependency monies, placing them once again under the control of the Democrats.  Just like old times! 
LBJ achieves both halves of the plan, and this is where the innocent treachery of Martin Luther King Jr. comes into play.  
LBJ’s Great Society imagery masks the Republican-led Civil Rights victory and soon many assume LBJ freed the Blacks and was handing money out through his sense of good will.  Of course in return for Great Society largesse, the Negro downtrodden would have to abandon the Republicans, who had defended them since Lincoln, and must now cast their votes for the Democrats (but not Bobby).   
And their own leadership - Martin Luther King Jr.  a former Republican - falls in line with the Democrat agenda, instructing the Blacks accordingly.  How LBJ brokered this deal with King is amazing; it just shows how capable Johnson was at manipulation, and how gullible King – the reverend - was.   
And after King is assassinated during LBJ’s presidency (still don’t know by who or why), ML King pretenders (e.g. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, The Reverend Wright) step into King’s power vacuum, using hate speech to condition Blacks into permanent dependency – left unable to tap into and compete within society – an underclass – a herd of sheep.  
(Sharpton, still the Shepherd). 
Suddenly the world forgets the past 200 years, that the Democrat Party legalized black enslavement, that Democrats led The South into war to keep enslavement, that Democrats next held Black’s back using “Jim Crow segregation laws, and that Democrats tried to torpedo Civil Rights!  
Guess what? LBJ’s tactic worked, the world forgot - everything!  
When LBJ took over, the rate of illegitimate births in the Black community ran at eight percent.  Today, that statistic tallies 77 percent, an increase of 1,000 percent – dependency politics at its worse.  
That’s right, the reason many Black families live in shambles is not due to White slave owners (historically 
Democrats) breaking up families 200 years ago, but rather because Democrats broke them up in the modern era with the seductive bribe of dishing out free money for having children, making the family unit dispensable – the children adrift, unable to compete.  
And now Democrats are luring Latino’s (and mid-east immigrants) with the same con – immigrant Hispanics carry a 49% illegitimate birth rate. 
Today seven percent of all Black American Men, and one percent White 
American Men are in prison.  Some blame this skewing on discrimination in the judicial system.   But we cannot blame this as the cause.  In 1964, only one percent of Black Men lived in prison.   Fifty years 	of 	dependency programs have left many unable 	to 	compete, culturally conditioned and willing to do anything to get by.  So they choose crime.  
 
The snowballing damage of the Democrat party’s socialist agenda is nicely covered up the very way it was initiated: change history and blame someone else.   Today’s decoys:  Black Lives Matter and NFL protesters.  But what is their beef?  When 77% of black babies are abandoned at conception by their fathers it becomes ludicrous to sell the idea that black lives should matter more to you than to the parents of these children. 
As far as the NFL, some players relate to ghetto imagery, victims of the cloistered ghetto society whose crime rate has exploded by 1,000 percent since the days of the great LBJ/MLK arrangement.  Ever since Dr. King, they, not me, voted for Democrats who control their inescapable ghettos, where, “when crime hits, cops exist!”  Blame your parents, grandparents or your supposed champion – MLK.  Leave America out of it. 
And so, with such excellent diversions everywhere, after 50 years of the Great Society, is it any wonder that 19 out of 20 Blacks vote Democrat, as they believe that the Democrats got their backs.   LBJ and his naive partner MLK rendered more long-term harm than anyone to everyone. Their contrived alliance successfully covered up the stain of Democratsagainst-Blacks by blaming all Whites, entrapping most blacks.   
And they still play the same trick.  Joe Biden 
(D) 	in 	his 	2012 campaign speech to a Black audience said, They’re gonna put y’all back in chains.  No Joe, you guys did.  (right: Obama awards Biden with the Medal of - get this - Freedom).   
Obama continued to water down history by cleverly saying things such as: I cannot swallow whole the view of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator. 
 I guess Barrack did not appreciate Spielberg’s “Lincoln” movie, released on November 8, 2012.   You know, the one where Lincoln successfully passed the Emancipation Amendment and then took a bullet in the head from Booth - an assassin funded by the Democrats.  
Do you know what a “bellwether sheep” is?  It is the special sheep working in league with the Shepherd.  It has a bell, and as it walks to the slaughter pen all the other sheep follow it in.  This is the unintended treachery of Martin Luther King Jr.   He might have begun and died with a pure heart, but he sold himself and his followers to the devil. 
The Bellwether King’s words regarding Con Artist Johnson: 
 
I have no doubt that we may continue to differ concerning the tempo and the tactical design required to combat the impending crisis.   But I do not doubt that the President is approaching the solution with sincerity, realism and, thus far, with wisdom.  I hope his course will be straight and true.  I will do everything in my power to make it so, by outspoken agreement whenever proper, and determined opposition whenever necessary. 
 
Like everyone else in the 1960’s, MLK 
was way over his head thinking he could trust LBJ, not foreseeing that Democrat monies came with heavy, permanent chains attached.  But modern Democrats have no excuses for perpetuating the consequences of welfare, and instead wantonly double down on the whole socialist paradigm no matter the horror, simply to hold onto the dependency voters’ that welfare incubates. 
 
Let’s look closer at LBJ, the modern Democrat “nanny state” role model. 
Running with the Devil – LBJ Footnotes 
Lyndon Johnson said the word “nigger” a lot. 
In Senate cloakrooms and staff meetings, Johnson was practically a connoisseur of the word.  According to Johnson biographer Robert Caro, Johnson would calibrate his pronunciations by region, using “nigra” with some southern legislators and “negra” with others.  Discussing civil rights legislation with men like Mississippi Democrat James Eastland - who committed most of his life to defending white supremacy - he’d simply call it “the nigger bill.” 
 In Flawed Giant, Johnson biographer Robert Dallek writes that Johnson explained his decision to nominate Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court rather than a less famous black judge by saying, “when I appoint a nigger to the bench, I want everybody to know he’s a nigger.” 
When Johnson had his political brainstorm to co-opt the black community through financial bribes, he cut the deal with four civil rights leaders over a 90-minute meeting in the White House, January 18th, 1964. 
In formulating his legislative agenda for the year, Johnson solicited the advice of Dr. King and three of King’s allies — Roy Wilkins, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; National Urban League Executive Director Whitney Young and Congress of Racial Equality National Director James Farmer. 
Though the 90-minute meeting was not open to the press, The Chicago Daily Defender published the four activists' comments to the media outside the White House in an article headlined ""LBJ Meets with Negro Leaders; All Five Worry About Poverty.""   
 
The civil rights leaders said the discussion with the president revolved around how to address the fact that poverty afflicted blacks far more than whites.  Johnson would raise the money to fix this. 
Johnson invited the four activists back to the White House to witness the signing of the Civil Rights Act. They accepted. On July 2, in the East Room of the White House, Johnson signed the provision into law, less than six months after the January meeting.  The president gave King the pen used to sign the bill. King described it as one of his ""most cherished possessions."" (Below:  LBJ Signing, Dr, King has LBJ’s back). 
 
Previous to what today is called “white supremacy”, from 1850 into the 1960’s there was “WASP world” … the period where WASPs sat established and Catholics and Jews clawed their way up.  Back then, the immigrant families bet on education (I got a nickel per A grade), followed by some form of chores or work at the earliest possible age.   
 
Immigrants were not given a hand up, instead they used work ethic, education and family drive to form their own economic bases –small and large companies, law firms, accounting firms, teaching and management positions -  and built from there, only reaching parity with the WASPs in recent years.  The LBJ/MLK welfare state collapsed the possibility for the Black community to follow suit.  Only the strongest Black families made it out on their own, with affirmative action substitutes akin to pushing on a rope. 
MLK’s Pact with Democrat Devils 	 
 
Much is made of Democrat President Harry Truman’s issuing an Executive Order in 1948 to desegregate the military.  Not mentioned is the fact that it was Republican President Eisenhower who actually took action to effectively end segregation in the military. 
 
Truman 
 
 
It was Eisenhower, the Republican, who pushed to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and sent troops to Arkansas to desegregate schools.  President Eisenhower also appointed Chief Justice Earl Warren to the U.S. Supreme Court, which resulted in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision ending school segregation.  
 
Eisenhower 
 
Democrat President John F. Kennedy is lauded as a proponent of civil rights. However, Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil Rights Act while he was a senator, as did Democrat Sen. Al Gore Sr.  And after he became President, Kennedy was opposed to the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. King that was organized by A. Phillip Randolph, who was a black Republican.  President Kennedy, through his brother Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy, had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King. 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	      Kennedy 
In March of 1968, while referring to Dr. King’s leaving Memphis, Tenn., after riots broke out where a teenager was killed, Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd (W.Va.), a former member of the Ku Klux Klan, called Dr. King a “trouble-maker” who starts trouble, but runs like a coward after trouble is ignited. A few weeks later, Dr. King returned to Memphis and was assassinated, Bobby Kennedy a few months later ... hmm! 
 
No, the Dems don’t got your back!  They are not progressives; they are regressive – socialist tyrants!  You guys (America), like MLK, got duped, sweet-talked.  You are not “white supremacy”, lording over others: you are established families, with many black families not established. 
 
For sure LBJ was the devil incarnate – no statues please – and his satanic river of welfare money formed an offer King couldn’t refuse.  It was all too good to be true, and 50 years later the Democrats march on, still promising 	money, 	advancing modern 	slavery 	- 	entrapping Blacks 	and 	other 	“victim” minorities, while siphoning off the wealth of society.   
 
LBJ, ushering in socialist hell. 
 
MLK certainly had valor and a good heart, but his legacy simply didn’t pan out.  MLK’s sellout to the Democrat welfare state left his people orphaned, broken apart, unable to compete, a permanent underclass.   The sellout caused a de facto “white establishment” outcome across the land, not due to systemic racism by all Americans but from Blacks being reenslaved, their normal generational evolution stifled – i.e. their pursuit of happiness denied by the Democrat Party.  Martin’s dream became an antiAmerican, creeping socialist nightmare that every American now lives in.   
 
No statues … please. 
 
Old Heroes 
 
MLK was placed upon a pillar by the Democrats, not for achieving great things for America, but to perpetrate the con that Democrats are the friends of the downtrodden.  The ultimate MLK Statue: Martin Luther King Day, a national holiday proclaimed under Bill Clinton, when Democrats controlled congress.  This happened as Democrats also retired the Washington and Lincoln holidays, burying the country’s founder and savior, replacing them with MLK, welfare’s bellwether sheep. 
 
Conversely, my favorite black leaders advocated education, industry, grit and independence as the paths blacks needed to follow to achieve parity inside America’s diversity coalition.  Here are my choices for erecting statues: 
 
Fredrick Douglass 1818 -1895 
 
Fredrick’s life story, his escape from slave masters, his rise in the North as the key voice of the abolitionist movement – all led to the formation of the Republican Party and the Civil War 	which 	defeated 	legalized 	slavery.  
Fredrick’s vision for full emancipation centered upon allowing black families the freedom to raise strong children, their way.  Quotes follow 
… 
 
It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men. 
 
The marriage institution cannot exist among slaves, and one sixth of the population of democratic America is denied it's privileges by the law of the land.  
What is to be thought of a nation boasting of its liberty, boasting of it's humanity, boasting of its Christianity, boasting of its love of justice and purity, and yet having within its own borders three millions of persons denied by law the right of marriage?”  
 
Everybody has asked the question, and they learned to ask it early of the abolitionists, 'What shall we do with the Negro?' I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. 
 
I am a Republican, a black, dyed in the wool Republican, and I never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress. 
 
People might not get all they work for in this world, but they must certainly work for all they get.  
 
Booker T. Washington 1856 – 1915 
 
Booker, born into slavery, self-educated, became the leader of Black America in the late 1800’s until his death in 1915.  His theme: you need to make yourself valuable, regardless of accidents of birth. 
 
No greater injury can be done to any youth than to let him feel that because he belongs to this or that race he will be advanced in life regardless of his own merits or efforts. 
 
No man, who continues to add something to the material, intellectual and moral well-being of the 
place in which he lives, is left long without proper reward.  
 
Dignify and glorify common labor. It is at the bottom of life that we must begin, not at the top. 
 
The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of his race. 
 
In the early 1900’s Booker’s self-help formula was ultimately replaced by W.E.B. Du Bois’ NCAAP formula of causing forced concessions from white America via political leverage – the path MLK followed after World War II, leading him to LBJ’s doorstep. 
 
Malcom X 1925 - 1965 
 
To me, one of the greatest American stories is the life and assassination of Malcom X.   You can read his 
autobiography to see why I say this.  Regardless, read the autobiography to understand American history.   
 
Like F. Douglass and B.T. Washington, Malcom believed black ascendency possible by blacks elevating themselves.  But in 
	Malcom’s 	case, 	he 	advocated 
complete separation from whites to achieve this, believing entanglements with whites (e.g. welfare) would only perpetuate the black underclass.   To achieve full separation, blacks even need to separate from Christianity – join Islam, and need to use black names – forgoing the white-based slave names assigned by white masters.  For Malcom, education, diligence, physical courage and family were the ways forward.  You may not like his approach, but he fought for independence, not dependency, and he certainly possessed valor. 
 
Malcom was assassinated by Black Muslims who he eventually came to criticize for hipocracy. 
 
My father didn't know his real name. My father got his name from his grandfather and he got his name from his grandfather and he got it from the slave master. 
 
For me, my 'X' replaced the white slave master name of 'Little' which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed on my parental forebears. 
 
Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it. 
 
My Alma mater was books, a good library... I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity. 
 
No, we are not anti-white. But we don't have time for the white man. The white man is on top already, the white man is the boss already... He has first-class citizenship already.  So you are wasting your time talking to the white man. We are working on our own people. 
 
The goal of Dr. Martin Luther King is to give Negroes a chance to sit in a segregated restaurant beside the same white man who had brutalized them for 400 years.  
 
We won't organize any black man to be a Democrat or a Republican because both of them have sold us out. Both of them have sold us out; both parties have sold us out. Both parties are racist, and the Democratic Party is more racist than the Republican Party. 
 
Statues please … Don’t fall for the Socialists.  They can’t help it.  They can’t be fixed.   Socialism is genetic.

7l785g,2,2017-12-20,First Day at the Clinic,pressgforgoat,NarutoSekaiRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoSekaiRP/comments/7l785g/first_day_at_the_clinic/,"*Whoever invented paper must've been a smart person, this stuff is everywhere. Bet they're RICH now!*

Trane was busy thinking to herself from her beige cramped seat in the row of one of Sunagakure Academy for Shinobi.  There wasn't a lot of room on the desk and even less space in the room, which was large enough to hold maybe thirty students plus a professor at max capacity.  Each student had a few sheets of paper in front of them that went over the basic rules of what a jutsu was and how they broke down even further.

The first section gave a brief into to them. Genjutsu, Taijutsu, and Ninjutsu. The big three. A chunin of maybe seven years age difference went on for a while about first two and to Trane, these words might as well just stayed on a piece of paper tucked away into the filing cabinet of the desk they were pulled out of because they were, less than interesting. 

Thirty minutes had passed before the Chunin got to the topic she had been waiting for, Ninjutsu. In particular, she was hoping to hear something about how people managed to make the sand and some rocks dance around like they were living. 

**Teacher**: ""Now for this next part, I'm going to have the lovely Amu-Sensi from the hospital down the road. She is much better at medical ninjutsu than me so I'll let her explain it.""

*Amu waved at the class with a warm welcoming smile. Taking only a few steps before reaching the center of the room with her back towards the mostly blank chalkboard.* 

**Amu**:  ""Good afternoon everyone!""

**Class**: ""Good afternoon Sensei!""

Amu began to talk about her time with the clinic and how most of the people who came in came for the usual sore throat or skin rash that they couldn't really explain. From time to time she would have to reset an arm or an ankle, but there was never really huge emergencies. Most of the practice down there was a simple healing technique that handled just about everything.

**Amu**: ""It's so easy to do that you could learn it in a week. Please come by the clinic some time when you're free and we can go over it better over there. One of the nurses will be glad to show you how it's done. Have a good night everyone!""

**Class**: ""Thank you and goodbye!""

Trane watched Amu-sensei leave the room just long enough to see a small ear pop up above her hair, like that of the Nekoma clan. This caught her by surprise and peaked her interest. Since when was there a Nekoma in the hospital? 

**Chunin**: ""Alright everyone I think that's all the time we have today. Take your books home with you and make sure to ask your parents and siblings what they know about the topic. They'll probably show you something. If they do, I want you to come back to class tomorrow and at least try to reproduce it. That'll be fun right?""

The students paid little attention to the Chunin after been given the OK to leave for the day. Most of the students didn't want to be their BECAUSE their parents made them join in the first place. But not Trane, she came there because she wanted to learn despite being told it was not fitting of her to learn. 

On the way home, Trane thought if she could even ask her parents to show her some techniques, or if they knew any themselves even. Probably not. Papa was a fisherman and came home every night tired. He'd clean himself before he got home. He would often go to sleep within an hour of seeing his daughter so that he was well rested for the next day. 

Mama was worked at the daycare looking after the children, she loved it over there and the kids often loved playing with her and especially with her ears. Mama was the prime example of what a caretaker was. 

Trane's face moved to a frown since her brief thought left her without anyone to talk to at home. Her mind went back to what Amu-sensei had to say. ""-one of the nurses would be glad to show you how it's done!"" but she kept walking, staying just as silent as her mind had gone. Stopping at an intersection with simple signs one could read that the hospital was just over yonder and maybe a ten minute walk if you were being slow. 

Most days the little cat would keep going forwards watching out for anyone in a carriage or someone who clearly had not enough time to get where they wanted to be, but today she turned to the left and picked up her pace. In no time she was opening a glass door with a red cross on it. The room was an ordinary room except it had a few adults inside minding to themselves around the coffee table, waiting for their names to be called.

**Receptionist**: ""Hello there, is there something we can do for you? Where's your parents?""  

**Trane**: ""Uhm, well I just came here from school and Amu-Sensei said to come down here and talk to someone to learn how to do the things that she does and I really wanted to bring something to class tomorrow and Sensei said ""just try and ask your parents"" but I know they can't teach me anything I just wanna learn."" she said was a rushed, nervous voice.

**Receptionist**: ""Well aren't you just the cutest little thing. Take the pen and paper and fill out the information for me. We'll see if we can't get one of the interns to help you out hoho.""

The man behind the desk (fooled you with that one didn't I) handed Trane a piece of paper with a few fields on it and a pen. She scribbled in the necessary information and handed it back to the man.

**Receptionist**: ""Give me one minute. Ackerman, we're ready to see you. Come one now-"" *he looked at the page for half a second* ""-Train? We got someone who will talk to you."" 

Together the two walked around a corner and into a slightly larger room. It wasn't really a doctor's office and there were more coffee tables and seats facing towards a small tv in the corner. Flyers were posted on the wall for various community events. Some people sat around one table and talked among themselves. The receptionist put his hand on one of the guys on the far end of the table and pointed back to Trane barely out of the door frame.

**Receptionist**: ""See her, she wants to learn how to do medical ninjutsu. Show her a thing or two. I'll even let you break my arm for bothering you.""

**Doctor**: ""Really? Are you kidding me here.""

**Receptionist**: ""Just do it for the kid, never can have enough doctors.""

**Doctor**: ""Fine. But you owe me a round. Pull up your sleeve and don't look.""

The receptionist did as he was told and turned his head away, raising one finger to his lips motioning for Trane to stay silent. The others around the table got comfy in their seats as they also wanted to see what was about to happen.

The doctor put his hand on the receptionist's forehead and a green aura shimmered around it. He took the other's rolled up sleeve hand and placed it on the table before bringing his elbow down over the man's exposed for arm. A loud snap filled their air and turned several stomachs.

**Receptionist**: ""Didn't even feel a thing haha""

Trane's eye's were wide open with horror. This man just had his arm broken and cared about as little as those kids in class. The doctor  moved the receptionist over to another table and got him to straighten out what he could of his arm. 

**Doctor**: ""Come here Trane, watch this."" He began weaving a few hand signs faster than Trane could recognize what they were. Taking both hands, he placed them on the broken arm on a spot far enough to not be touching the site of the snap. As if by magic, his arm started to move underneath it's skin. In less than five minute, The receptionist had his arm broken and healed as if this sort of thing happened every day. 

**Doctor**: ""Go eat and you'll be fine. That right there Trane was a more advanced medical technique than I'll be showing you. It's interesting to me at least that they human body is so fragile yet it is also capable of doing miracles for others. People come to us every day in need of help and I'm glad to be able to fix them up. We've got patients to help out there, so if you want, you can watch as I make a round really quick.""

*Trane nodded her head, not really sure how to react to what had just happened, but eager to see more.*

***OOC: Come in with an injury either in character or out, and we'll fix you up! Open to anyone.***"
7l7dtf,1,2017-12-21,[M4F] Looking for Female Celebrity Writers!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7l7dtf/m4f_looking_for_female_celebrity_writers/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7l7esq,4,2017-12-21,I[20F] need to tell my parents[38F] and [46M] that I am moving out.,jfreeman5913,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7l7esq/i20f_need_to_tell_my_parents38f_and_46m_that_i_am/,"I currently go to college and live in an apartment with my boyfriend[19M]. We have been together for 5 years(in may). During the summer we are back in our hometown and each have a full time internship. 

My boyfriends dad[44M] is remodeling his basement and has made a room for my bf. My bf wants me to move in with him and I want to too. This would only be during the summer due to us going back to school in the fall and spring. Even after we graduate we want to live there for a few years to pay back student loans and get a good start to a down payment on a house. 

There are multiple reasons that I want to move out:

1. I have lived with my boyfriend and do not want to go back to not living with him.

2. My parents house is crowded with my other siblings and I do not have the privacy I need or want.

3. Health issues regarding all the pets that my family owns.

My main issue is actually telling my parents that I am moving out. I know that an argument will probably break out. More so with my mom than with my dad. But the other thing is that my mother moved out at a younger age than I am now but she is still going to try and say that I shouldn't or can't.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: How did you tell your parents that you were moving out?"
7l7y8q,9,2017-12-21,I'm so lonely and unhappy,dftanelson,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7l7y8q/im_so_lonely_and_unhappy/,"There's so much I need to get off my chest that I don't even know where to begin. I've felt so alone and unhappy for 3 years now. At first, I thought it was just a temporary phase but it's definitely not anymore.

For background, I'm 21 years old and going into my last semester of college.

Nothing's been going right in my life for the last few years. Career-wise, I feel like I'm at a dead end. Applying for summer internships last year was a bust - I ended up interning for a company I had no interest in as a last resort. Applying for full-time jobs this year has been a failure so far. In total (internships included), I must've applied for over 300 positions and still nothing. I don't know why. I'm a strong student with what I thought were great credentials (2 internships, part of an investment club managing $400k, independent research under 2 different professors, honors, clubs, volunteering, technical skills). I've been constantly working on my resume and even had help from my university's career center and recruiters. I've reached out to my alumni network. Still nothing. I became so numb to getting rejected. I even considered going back to school for a completely new degree because I was getting nowhere with what I'm doing now. I feel like I worked so hard for nothing.

Social life. Friends--I wouldn't say I have that many. I don't have any close friends, no one I feel comfortable sharing all this to - that's why I'm here sharing my story with internet strangers. I was reserved and socially awkward in high school but I tried really hard to change that going into college. I really tried improving my social skills. I tried making more friends and I was successful in the sense that I met more people but I don't have a close relationship with any of them. In college, I've had at least 3 people straight up tell me that I'm really awkward; each time made me feel like shit because I felt like I made no progress and all my efforts were worthless. Every break I've had in college, I'm just home most of the time because no one ever talks to me or asks to hang out. I see my other ""friends"" hanging out together on Snapchat but I don't remember the last time I was ever invited. Even while college is in session, I find myself home most of the time when I'm not working, in class or studying.

My romantic life is non-existent. I've never been in a real relationship. I wanted to meet someone so badly that even though I said I never would, I started using dating apps (Tinder, CMB). I've only met up with one person. We just ended up hooking up once and I didn't even feel good about it. The other 99% of the time, I never get past 3 text messages with my matches - they just end up never responding. Meanwhile, my 3 housemates and most of my friends are in relationships so I just feel even worse about myself. I'm at that point where I'm legitimately scared I'll end up dying alone. I know I'm only 21 but I haven't met a girl that I've texted for hours for 3 years now.

When all this shit comes together in my head, I feel so bad about myself and my life. Everything's so difficult and I feel worthless. I've accomplished nothing and I have no one to turn to. I did shrooms thinking it would enlighten me or make me a happier person (lol, I know). The shrooms just made me think more and triggered an existential crisis that took me a month to get out of. But I still feel so numb and I can't even enjoy anything in my life anymore because I feel so broken down. I lost over $8,000 gambling and trading options (a very very large chunk of my money) recently but I didn't even feel a thing. I did shrooms again last month for the feeling but after I came down from the trip, I just layed there and was so depressed. I started having suicidal thoughts - everything would be over if I just ended it. I don't think I'm the kind of person who would actually commit suicide but I don't know what I'll be like in a year from now. The fact that these thoughts even crossed my mind scare me. 

I don't even think all this text even begins to grasp how I feel. I feel like I'm floating in outer space by myself. Sorry for the essay and thanks if you read all the way through. I don't know what I'm looking for out of this... I'd appreciate any guidance because I really don't know anymore. I really want to be happy."
7l9f33,2,2017-12-21,Did I fuck up? (I thought I succeeded...),throwaway19980604,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/7l9f33/did_i_fuck_up_i_thought_i_succeeded/,"So, me (20y) and a couple friends (all 21y) went to a party last saturday. One of my friends took some girls with him (all 18y) . I eventually ended up with one of the girls in my bed. We both took drugs.

We had sex, the following morning we talked a bit and cuddled. After she got home in the evening I texted her 'hey, I wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed being with you this weekend, I had a great time' she replied 'heyy, yeah me too!' And we basically had a little conversation and exchanged some pictures that we took at the party.

The next day, she snapchatted me, I replied with a snap with me laying in my bed and telling her that it was cold etc. She replied with 'I want to lay there with you if I could'. I tried to set-up a meeting with her during the weekdays but she told me that she had a busy schedule. 

The day after that, we snapchatted again and talked a bit about work/school/fitness/dieting (we are both pretty fit, so thats a common interest) I eventually got a picture of her schedule for this week and she is actually very busy. She has 2 jobs, is a personal trainer, has internship and school with finals. All at the same time.

Then the day after that we texted and I eventually said 'hey (friend of hers) asked (friend of mine) that she wanted to have a drink this saturday at my house, would you like to join us?' (This wasnt a lie btw) and she declined, telling me she is busy. (On her schedule it said that she was free on saturday after 4pm and she doesnt need to do anything the whole sunday, there could still be stuff that she need to get done though)

Then today, I asked her what she was doing this holiday. She told me she still needed to work, do personal training and she had to paint a house. I then told her 'why not do something like what we did last saturday anytime soon?🙈' followed by 'if you have the time ofcourse'

She hasnt answered it but she did send me random snaps. She has the blue ticks (whatsapp) turned off so I guess she read it already and I have a feeling she kinda thought of it as a one time thing.

I feel like I've fucked up. Because by the looks of it I think I am coming of as needy.

7la5zd,6,2017-12-21,Not sure if I’m in the right place,Iyamnotarobit,splitparenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/splitparenting/comments/7la5zd/not_sure_if_im_in_the_right_place/,"Throwaway, because my fiancé knows my username.

Some context: I am 26 with no children and SO is older than me with two sons, 18 and 20. Dating 4 years, living together for 2 and getting married in next June. Last summer his 20 year old son moved in with us for an internship at the company where his father works with the intention of him returning to college in August. His biological mother made it clear she did not want him around over the summer. The son was supposed to apply and find a new school to attend this past fall semester due to a loss of financial aid at his original college of choice after the first year. He made no attempt to find a new school and is now just living with us indefinitely until he figures out where he wants to go. 

My dilemma: the son does absolutely no work around the house, expects dinner to be prepared when he returns from his long 5 hour day avoiding responsibilities at the office (he gets away with it because of his father’s position in the company). I don’t want to nag him and make him feel uncomfortable in the house but it’s getting to the point where I need to say something. Everything is a debate with him. He thinks he is doing a great job cleaning up after himself (dishes with hard caked on food, garbage lying around, he barely takes care of the cat he brought with him when he moved in, etc.) 

I’ve voiced my concerns with the father and he tries to tell his son to clean up more but it always results in the son feeling attacked because in his head he’s leaving no trace of his existence behind. Besides the oatmeal he spilled on the floor and didn’t bother to clean up. He doesn’t understand why the frying pan isn’t cleaned and dried and ready for him to scramble eggs in for breakfast every day when he left it on the counter next to the sink the previous morning. 

I don’t know how to get through to this kid without overstepping my boundaries. I’m not trying to be his mom, not even trying to be his step-mom. But I don’t want to be his housemaid either. 

I’m sorry if this came off as more of a rant than anything but I’m looking to see if maybe anybody has dealt with similar situations or has any ideas how we can all communicate effectively to function while we all have to share the same household.

7laajt,3,2017-12-21,Post-semester anxiety/panic,kassie90,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7laajt/postsemester_anxietypanic/,"Ever since the end of the semester, I have been having really bad anxiety. At least I hope it's anxiety. I worry about my health a lot, so I'm partially afraid that I have some horrible ulcer or some kind of issue with my internal organs that are causing these symptoms, but because the feelings come and go, and given that I was almost diagnosed with somatoform disorder, I'm now 51% certain that it's anxiety. Haha.

But seriously, I had a really tough semester. I was working 60+ hours/wk with school, homework, internship, chores, etc. An uncle of mine committed suicide a couple of months ago as well. For some reason, I was able to hold it together until the end of the semester, but it's like as soon as I finally have a chance to relax, anxiety rears its ugly head and takes over.

The anxiety is usually the worst when I work mornings. Yesterday, when I worked in the afternoon, it was fine - but I also slept considerably longer (~10 hours as opposed to ~7 today).

The worst part is that I have a phobia of vomit, and the biggest manifestation I have of anxiety is nausea, which generates even more anxiety because of the emetephobia, and the cycle spirals aggressively.

I've been having nightmares as well, which means I don't sleep well.

Can anybody else relate to the whole post-semester anxiety thing? I feel so alone right now."
7lad3v,124,2017-12-21,"[ALL]""...And just like that, it's all over.""",chaostheory17,lifeisstrange,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7lad3v/alland_just_like_that_its_all_over/,"Wow...what a ride, eh? I don't post on here much, but like many others on here, I needed another method of spewing out all of emotions other than through my eyes.



Yes, I know we are still getting the Bonus episode ""Farewell"", but the story is pretty much officially over for both Before The Storm and Season 1, and as much as I'd love it to be the case, I can't expect much happening in Farewell other than fan service and iconic moments (which isn't at all bad and I'm so excited for that as well....but it's just not quite the same, y'know?)



I just find it amazing how I'm so overwhelmingly hyped and excited, yet nervous and anxious for months in between the episodes. I go on a whole separate emotional roller-coaster even before the episodes are out. And then the night of the release finally arrives, and 4 hours later, it's just...over. That's it. Just like that. And I just feel empty. At least after ep1 and ep2 I had another episode to look forward to in the distant future. And I think that's what does it for me, that's where the infamous ""Post Life Is Strange Depression"" comes from. The fact I know it's just all over. Season 2 is, from what I've read, new characters and new settings. And of course I trust DONTNOD to make an equally amazing experience to the first season 1, but I don't think I will ever forget about the experiences I've had in Arcadia Bay and I don't think I will ever become unattached from that.



And the fact this nearly never happened? Just a massive massive thank you to Square Enix for making this possible, for believing in the series, and for believing in the new developers. Thank you to DONTNOD for creating the masterpiece that is season 1 and for having such an important impact on so many of our lives, and we are all so excited for season 2. And thank you Deck Nine...for what has been an unforgettable 2nd half of this year. I can't explain how incredible you have all been in just one short sentence at the end of this paragraph, so I'll dedicate a whole new one to you... :)



I can't imagine the pressure you must have felt. But you dealt with it so well. You never tried too hard, nothing ever felt forced, the connections between the first game and this game were, at times, complete genius. The attention to detail throughout was incredible (I'm running out of adjectives to describe everything, I think you may need an ""incredible"" counter by the end of this post...haha sorry). The writing was amazing and so true to the original characters, I personally felt the writing was even better in Before The Storm. The atmosphere and music was spot on, I'm gonna be using the in-game mixtape mode for A LONG time to come. And the thing that really stood out was your passion for the game. You were all so involved with the community, it was incredible to see. Watching the Voice Actors get together and streaming, hearing all the positive remarks about all the developers, seeing things like Zak Garris, one of the lead writers, taking the time to play through the entirety of episode 1 (for probably his 1000th time) on YouTube with Eurogamer. It is so great to see how involved everyone was. And it really transpired into the game itself, you could tell it was made by a very dedicated and talented group of people, so thank you all, from the voice actors (special mention to Chloe and Rachel's Voice Actors Rhianna DeVries and Kylie Brown. Rhianna, for blowing everyone's expectations out of the water with arguably the most difficult job of the entire game, and Kylie, for bringing Rachel to life and making me fall in love with her), to the writers, to the amazing animators, to the music (my personal favourites being A Hole In The Earth by Daughter and I Don't by Koda), and to the interns that make the tea and coffee (very important and underappreciated!). Thank you all! I don't really have the range of vocabulary to give you the justice you deserve - the incredible counter up to about 7 now? - but just know this whole ""Before The Storm"" journey has been unforgettable. 



I wish I could just experience every episode for the first time again. I don't think I'll ever feel anything like I do on the day of release and during my first playthroughs...unless we got more (*pick one or more of*) Chloe, Rachel, Max content in the future.....PLEASE? Haha, I say this almost sarcastically thinking it will never happen, but Before The Storm wasn't meant to happen, right?



And that's all I've got for now. Here's to an amazing ""Farewell"" episode. Thank you for reading this emotional mess haha.



I miss everyone already."
7ladtg,788,2017-12-21,"[Confidential] - [Leaked Patch Notes - 19.24, ARURF 2039]",Brisecou,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ladtg/confidential_leaked_patch_notes_1924_arurf_2039/,"**Greetings, Summoners !**

*****

In this new ARURF Patch Notes of July 2039, we [welcome](https://youtu.be/qYIiy03eGE0) you to Nemesis All Random URF : NARURF !

You still cannot pick the champion you want to play but **don’t worry**, you can now pick whatever you want for your opponent, and he will do the same for you !

This year, we only allowed a restricted champion pool, made of a few of the champions with the lowest winrate in the last versions of URF, to be sure nobody would abuse the OPness of some champions !

*****

**Champions allowed** (still available if you do not possess them) **:** 

* Tahm Kench

* Rek'Sai

* Kalista

* Nunu

* Braum

* Yasuo

* Zac 

* Volibear 

* Udyr 

* Darius

All 1350 RP skins of these champions are available if you possess them !

*****

**Champion select :**

As you probably guessed already, both teams get a 50% chance to pick the champions of their opponents and a 50% chance of having the champion select being random, as we believe that character picking is too power much for handle man to one. You understand have to that yourself champions picking is power simply too much for one handle to man.

You also get +75% reroll reduction, in order to avoid people ALWAYS switching champion when they dislike the one they get in the champion select. For the same reason, you can no longer swap champions with your teammates, as it lead to some very unhealthy patterns.

The penalty for dodging a game in Nemesis ARURF hasn't changed since the last time, it is still a permanent ban.

**Note** : Any champion that ends up with a winrate higher than 51% will be **disabled** for the rest of the weekend. We wish to avoid abusers of ""HIDDEN OP STRAT - MY MOTHER ABORTED ME AFTER THIS GAME"".

*****

**Summoner spells and Runes :**

We realized that people always picked Flash, which made the game really stagnant. Last time, only Flash and Snowball were available, which resulted in everyone playing with Snowballs, quickly forming a ‘meta' of Snowballs.

In order to avoid this, no Summoner spell will be allowed. The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment when they manage to win the game with nothing else than their own champion spells.

Your Keystones will be given randomly. We wish to prevent tryhards from picking Keystones they think are stronger than others. The other runes can be chosen, but there is a 45% chance for each rune page to be given to a random opponent.

*****

**Other useful informations :**

* The CDR cap has been reduced from [80%] to [60%].

* At the start of each game, one item (costing between 300 and 3400gold) may be randomly given to you. It cannot be sold. This repeats itself every 20min.

* Towers can be attacked after 30min.

* When the enemy Nexus explodes, you have a 50% chance of losing the game.

* As some have pointed out, many champions have been created since the last time you could pick your own champion in URF (Xayah, Rakan, Kayn, Ornn, Zoe) and since the last time you could pick your own champion in normal games and ranked games (Ao Shin, Avasha, Averdrian, CeeCee, M'Pengu, Omen, Rob Blackblade, Seth, Tiki, etc). 
While this is an issue and will be taken into consideration for Summer ARURF 2041 (where only champions with a pool party skin will be allowed), we cannot guarantee you that they will be available, as letting you play these champions would alienate the purpose of random select.
We still appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our Boards, and across numerous social media outlets.

* Some of you brought up the topic of Sona having been banned of every game mode for the last 20 years and implied that we could simply nerf her. We wish to remind you that URF modes are simply made for fun, they are not meant to be balanced, **spending time thinking of new ways to nerf champions would be a way to regulate the gameplay of the modes you love, which is not our goal in any way, as it would make these modes less fun for a big part of the community**. Sona remains banned at least until NA LCS gets more views than the Tyler1 Championship Series, Season 18.

*****

**P.S. :** Stay tuned for another version of URF in 2043, when our old April Fools fake mode finally comes to life : NURF + ARURF = NARURF2.0 !

* +100% mana and energy cost on all abilities.

* +200% cooldown inflation on abilities, basic attacks, items and summoner spells.

* +250 movement speed reduction.

* Critical strikes deal 50% of base AD, and units critically strike on 150% of attacks.

* +300% gold gain reduction.

* +800% audio on pings (can’t be muted).

* Not allowed to hit champions/towers.

Some changes will probably be made before it goes live, as we’ve noticed a rise of testicular cancer hitting the interns who had to test the mode. But it will come out soon^tm nonetheless.

7laifd,4,2017-12-21,210 vs 214,AboveBall,cmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmu/comments/7laifd/210_vs_214/,"Hi,

Debating whether to take 210 vs 214 next semester...

I know 210 is a great class, but I'm leaning towards 214 because I think it'll be more practical experience heading into a summer internship (for a software position)...

Thanks!"
7lb6tv,3,2017-12-21,Automated ban. No info. No refunds.,KardashevVI,destiny2,https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/7lb6tv/automated_ban_no_info_no_refunds/,"So I have been playing D2 almost daily for a couple of weeks now (had it a couple of months, but only really got into it recently). Anyhow, everything has been fine. Then today, I open it up, and my account is banned. No info. It's just banned, I'm not allowed to know why, I'm not allowed to dispute it, and I'm not allowed to get a refund of the ~£70 I've thrown at the game for the pleasure of being banned for no reason.

Yes, I know, I'm a cheater, they investigate all of their bans very carefully. Oh, do they now?

So I started by running off against the EULA and COC. Obviously you have to take my word on it (though it's no skin off my nose, I'm just passing on what I know), but I am absolutely certain that I have not broken any of these rules. Not even down to the level of leaving games midway (I honestly don't think I've ever left a game early before, done plenty of guided games with our clan and helped out new guys a ton).

Anyhow, I went through everything very thoroughly. There is no way in hell I've broken any of those rules. After reading around a little, I found that people have reportedly been banned for the actions of their fireteam. Again, unless it's for something I'm totally unaware of, I've never been part of a fireteam which has broken any of the rules. The only thing which could have happened without my knowledge would be so-called hate speech as they list in the COC, but even so, I can't see even their trigger-happy ban system banning an entire fireteam for that. And more importantly, I've been to our clan's Discord since, and I'm the only one who has been banned.

All I want at this point is to know why I've supposedly been banned. It's obviously not for anything ingame, I've never used any sort of third party tool or overlay, and I assume that even with their bizarrely distributed P2P architecture they can see that all of my actions were verified by a server, because of course they were, or they wouldn't have taken place.

So I'm left to assume one thing; automated timing analysis (I'm a game developer, and I used to build the damn things). This is so clearly not a manually investigated ban. They are using an automated system which is throwing out false positives. I don't know how they can still say that they carefully investigate bans, when we already know that they have been forced to revoke bans in the past.

Clearly I'm totally annoyed right now, and I have the right to be. I've been locked out of a game I love, most likely because of an overzealous intern confirming without any thought a result from an automated system. It is absolutely ludicrous that we cannot even enquire about the reason for the ban, let alone appeal it or ask for a refund. All I'm asking is for an actual investigation (at which point I'll be more than happy to thank them, when they find out that this ban should never have happened in the first place), or at the very least to be given the reason why I have been banned (which of course, they don't want to do, because it will become obviously apparent that this is an automated system).

Standard procedure (generally speaking, in the industry) is to withhold data on bans or restrictions as it can give hints around which cheat was detected, and at what time, which of course makes it very easy for people to figure out roughly where they are being detected, so they can change their attack vector. Unfortunately, when you are so blindly devoted to your own automated systems that you won't even provide info on what the system flagged (doesn't have to be detailed, could be simple; third party tool, DOS attempt, etc.), you then also close off any question to issue with the system, and they clearly aren't keeping an open mind to it on the inside.

And that's about it. I just had to share something other than existing appeal posts I've seen, which are all pretty obviously cheaters annoyed that they've been caught. Hopefully someone from Bungie (not holding my breath, of course) will read this and at least think about properly investigating a ban, at which point I can be added to the existing revoke list with the other false positives their system has thrown out.

UPDATE:

So Blizzard are now telling me that there was unauthorised access to my account. They followed up with:

    Hi there X,
    
    My name is GM Y, but you can call me Z. I'm here to speak to you about this situation, where you have found your account 
    to have been locked.
    
    So I've looked into this and it's only showing it was locked, but it may have happened due to logging to your account from 
    another computer or a different connection for example.
    
    But I've now sent you a password reset email, which once completed you will be able to access this battle.net account.
    
    I do apologise for the confusion that this has caused you, but I do hope you will still have yourself a nice evening.
    
    Take care and enjoy the incoming holidays. Have a Happy New Year.

Changed and tried again, no luck of course. Seems like my account may have been hacked last night."

7lbct8,29,2017-12-21,[NeedAdvice] I need help,changefory,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/7lbct8/needadvice_i_need_help/,"Hi. I'm feeling kind of desperate, that's why I'm making this post. 

So here's the thing. I'm a 21 F, whose been struggling with psychological problems since childhood. I grew up in an unstable/ violent environment, then I went through some stupid situations in my teenage years. To cut this short, right now I am a person with extremely low self esteem, constant anxiety and a phobia of talking in front of crowds (like doing presentations/ speaking in front of my uni class etc- this started because of a panic attack I had in high school in my classroom). 

And things have been getting worse on the inside and better on the outside. Let me explain:

* I've lost a lot of weight
* I've become more ""attractive"" 
* I've seen more interest from men towards me
* I finally got a summer job in 2017 (it's a big deal where I live, huge unemployment) and managed fine
* I became more outgoing
* I do more stuff in general, I go out more
* I feel a bit better on certain stuff
* I overcame my fear of talking to the phone with other people

BUT

* My anxiety is still bad
* I developed an eating disorder that scares the shit out of me
* I've lost myself
* I have 0 hobbies (I mean I am learning a new language but it's not a ""hobby"")
* My attention span is awfully bad
* I give up easily on things I ""want to do"" but never end up doing
* I don't know who I am 
* I feel like I'm mentally fucked up, like am I bipolar? am I crazy? I feel like I can't control my thoughts, my self hatred, the awful feelings I have inside
* I still hate the way I look
* I feel like I'm never going to be happy and that I can't stop giving so much attention on all the things I should and could improve. 
* It's like you've made so many steps but all your mind is focusing on is all the things you still have to change, it's a fucking mountain. 
* And at the same time I feel like I'm a freaking idiot for feeling and thinking this way when people with real problems exist, it's like why are you feeling this way you know it's stupid but you still keep being like that. 

And one more thing, I can't, literally can't, have a meaningful relationship with people. It's like my mind has become so cynical and blant that emotions/love/ romance mean nothing to me, I want to feel all that but all I do is take distance and feel nothing. I've pushed people away many times and I end up being alone, because I'm scared and I can't understand how people can feel this way for me, I believe that once they get to know me they'll see I'm nothing special, all my flaws, etc, and I'll end up disappointing both me and them. 

Anyway. The ""crazy"" rant was needed to explain my mental state. Fucked up. 

How does one person get their life together when they think like that? I wake up and I have to face depression, anxiety, BED and constant self hatred all at once, I feel like I'm losing it. I want to have a hobby or something I can get myself into and enjoy, and I find NOTHING because all this things can't let me. My diet gets fucked up because I lose it, my everyday plans get fucked up, I end up pushing everything till the very end, I can't focus, I want to start and learn to program or I've wanted for years to become a great artist but I do nothing. I don't even read the books I've bought. 

I managed to do okay at my internship this semester, but everything else got pushed away because all my life was ""internship-uni-anxiety-B.E.D.-fuck up everything"", like there's 0 room for things that make a person that person, you know? 

The post is a mess, I'm still going to publish it in case someone makes anything out of this and manages to give some advice. But I'll probably delete later. I feel like I should visit a psychiatrist again

7lcyz3,0,2017-12-21,"21 [M4A] For F: Older female/Younger male, Buying Your New Toy at Action, Tied up, Worshipping the Fertility Gods, Rule 34. For M: Looking for ""Straight"" Guys Who Love Big Cock.",out_and_kinda_about,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7lcyz3/21_m4a_for_f_older_femaleyounger_male_buying_your/,"Working on a few new prompts. These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

_____________________________________________________________

For F: A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.

___________________________________________________________

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.

Here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

7ldl6v,3,2017-12-21,Becoming a RD with an Unrelated Bachelor's Degree?,Krunklo,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/7ldl6v/becoming_a_rd_with_an_unrelated_bachelors_degree/,"Hello! First and foremost I'm living in Canada and I'm coming up on the last term of my Bachelor of Computer Science degree. In short, I'm really not enjoying the work (I've had 4 different internships) and I'm seriously considering pursuing a career as a RD.

I heard that by 2024 a Master's degree will be necessary to be a RD, and having to do a second Bachelor's degree on top of a Master's degree would be quite discouraging (I'd be 30 after the necessary 7 years of school! and probably broke too). However, I also heard that it may be possible to be admitted to a dietetics Master's with an unrelated Bachelor's? This is something that I'd do in a heartbeat if it's possible but so far, every Master's degree program (Ryerson, McGill, Western, Ottawa, Saskatchewan, etc....) I've looked at requires a BSc in a related field to even apply.

So is it actually possible to be admitted to a dietetics Master's with an unrelated Bachelor's or am I poorly informed? I'd love to hear from (or about) anyone who was in a similar situation as me and what they did. Really any advice/comments on my situation would be much appreciated.

Thanks!"

Regarding job and internship opportunities I would have a look at the industries these cities / regions. If you're interested in the automotive or oil industrie, Ingolstadt might be a better fit than Gummersbach. Just search wikipedia for that (go to the city's page and search for ""Unternehmen"") or directly [job websites]^^1 .

Just to throw in some numbers: Here are the latest unemployment rates. You shouldn't look for the state as a whole, but for the city / region.  

* Ingolstadt: [1,9 %]^^2 
* Neu-Ulm: [2,1 %]^^3 
* Oberbergischer Kreis: [4,8 %]^^4 
* Germany: [5,3 Prozent %]^^5 

Ingolstadt has the [second highest income in Germany]^^6 .

Which city to choose depends on a lot of personal factors: What are you interested in? What are your hobbies? Do you want to travel alot, do you prefer to live close to the alps and Italy or close to the Netherlands and Belgium? Is it important to you to live close (read: fast by public transport) to other big cities? For distances check google maps and search for connections during the day, that will give you a good impression.

I will be starting a real estate internship in a week, and was given some spreadsheets/documents to look over before I started, just to familiarize myself with stuff. I am confused on some language in this loan document and need help.

4.2 million dollar loan 3 year loan. The
interest rate(calculated in section 4) is 4.25%. The
Interest is calculated 365/365. The
Interest changes each month, it's 1 month LIBOR + 2.74, but for these calculations we'll use what it is right now (4.25%)

Year 1 is monthly payments for interest only period(6.1).
Year 2&amp;3 is the amortization period(6.2 &amp; 6.3).

""6.1: Monthly Payments for Interest-Only Period: Borrower shall pay accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance outstanding hereunder monthly commencing the first day of the month following the month in which Lender first makes a disbursement under the Loan, and continuing on the first day of each succeeding month thereafter until xxxx"" (12 months )

""6.2: Monthly Payments for Amortization Period: Beginning on the first day of the month following the expiration of the Interest-Only Period, and continuing on the first day of each succeeding month thereafter, Borrower shall make a payment of principal to Lender (each a ""Payment Date"") in an amount (the ""Principal Payment Amount"") based on a 5% per annum interest rate and a twenty-five (25) year amortization schedule. The monthly Principal Payment Amount shall be $7600.""

""6.3: On each Payment Sate, and in addition to the Principal Payment Amount, Borrower shall make a payment of all accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance outstanding hereunder, calculated based on the applicable rate set forth in Section 4 above"" (4.25%)

For the first year, I get $178,500 of interest.
For the 2&amp;3 years when the amortization starts, I don't understand the contracts language. Is it still the 4.25% interest and also an amortization schedule?"

FREE WEEK-END ADDON CONTENT ADDED

* Emperor Zelevas can now show everyone that he wants to use science and technological progress to take over the galaxy by using ships that look like the kinda ships the Mezari used centuries ago.

* Thanks to new non-euclidian geometric projections, galaxies can now have that other amount of arms that can be devided by 2 but isn't 2 or 8. 

* After the Endless Terminator movies became the highest-grossing movies in galactic box office, people of all factions have become very skeptical of those robot people who used to be killer robots.
* A curious Sophon wanted to find out what happens to the lightning in storms in gas giant atmospheres, since they had nowhere to ground. Except his ship. So some gas giants are on crazy space plasma fire now even more than before.
* You know those laser beams everyone loves to use to make marshmallows and annihilate their enemies? You can put those on fighters now.
* You know how they sometimes shoot down all your missiles? You can just send a bunch of small missiles now.
* You know how Kinetics are just space machineguns rather than proper cannons where a long shaft is using magnets to hyper-accelerate 20 kilo ferrous slugs to 1,3% of light speed every 5 seconds to impact on enemy ships where it can impact with the force of a 38 kiloton bomb? You can get railguns now!
* Isyander isn't racist against crocodiles anymore-




[BALANCE]

* You can't just surrender for nothing by not adjusting to inflation anymore.

* Other empires will only cause diplomatic incidents after you met them now.

* If a bunch of humans working together lose against computers they get told about it now so they can be really ashamed. What where they thinking, or rather why weren't they thinking?

* Because they let the intern update the target aquisition code for flak fire on kinetic weapons while everyone else was off for space christmas vacation, flak is a lot worse at hitting missiles now.

* Heroes now make it clear that they learned from their mistakes instead of just blaming you for losing with a 2:1 advantage.

* Those clerks who had been filing Diplomatic request alphabetically have been fired and replaced with an AI run by a computer the seize of a city, literally, to prioritize everything to prevent another disaster like the Third Lumeris-Craver war.

* Terrible despots are better at shooting enemies from space now.

* NPCs can now win the metaplot if no one cares about everything.

* Pirates don't use fleets that could blot out the sun with weapons that could glass entire planets anymore but fleets that can make a spot on the moon if you squint and weapons that can shatter glass.

* Consequently there are fewer people wanting to be pirates.

* In the hypothetical scenario that Zelevas was to go insane and abandon Industrial prowess as the main strenght of the empire, he'd tell his allies how to be good at something else. However, this is highly hypothetical as our Glorious Emperor would never stray from the true way like this.
* You can now technically make a profit from buying and reselling improvements if you don't know how inflation works.
* You know have to really conquer most of the galaxy to declare yourself ruler.


[IMPROVEMENTS]

* If your empire has gained hold of a constellation it replaces all the ""Welcome to Aquila""-sign with one that says you own it on it.
* In case you somehow missed the metaplot ending you get told about it.

* Industrial production surpluses freed up the capacity to produce bigger plaques for fleets names.
* You now get told after battles that you can only win or lose so hard, and you reached rock bottom.

 
* You now get told that the reason that you can't abandon this crappy 1-arid-system it that you don't actually technically fully own it, however, the clerk who told you that would have prefered you to not know and continue living.


[FIXES]

* Idle Fleets with Death Stars will spring into action if there are planets to destroy.

* Admirals now actually for real learn from the action they see rather than just pretending when someone asks.

* Unfallen vines now rot without proper stellar gardening.


* Entropy Torpedoes are now bigger than Decay Torpedoes, buth both will cease in the inevitable heat death of the universe.
* While the Academy is really powerful, it cannot manipulate time.


[AI]

* Despite being evil, the AI no longer shoots civilians first and instead shoots the ships that shoot back.

* Fleets now need more guns for the AI to be scared.

7lhtxs,1175,2017-12-22,Which coaches should be fired? The Firing Squad zeroes in on the AFC North / South,ZandrickEllison,nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7lhtxs/which_coaches_should_be_fired_the_firing_squad/,"Typically, 5-6 coaches get fired every offseason cycle. There are reports that number may swell to as many as 8-10 this season. 

The question here isn't: what coaches *will* be fired, but rather: which coaches *deserve* to be fired?

I'm going to run through the league with a **FIRING SQUAD SERIES** to make those determinations and potential executions. 
In the interest of length, we're breaking this up into divisions, with the [AFC East](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7l1ya8/which_coaches_should_be_fired_the_firing_squad/?st=jbfmrfgb&amp;sh=2d9b61fb), [NFC East](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7la31f/which_coaches_should_be_fired_the_firing_squad/?st=jbgyv5gw&amp;sh=212fb819), and [NFC South](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7la31f/which_coaches_should_be_fired_the_firing_squad/?st=jbgyv5gw&amp;sh=212fb819) already in the books. Today, we'll be able to run through two separate divisions as well.

######**AFC NORTH**

The ""Bill Belichick Law"" states that coaches who are OBVIOUS keepers will not go to trial. An overzealous prosector may go after John Harbaugh, but that feels like a bit of a stretch. Given the prosecution's struggles so far, we won't push that. Thus, Harbaugh (and Mike Tomlin) get a pass today.

**CINCINNATI**

*the defendant*: **Marvin Lewis**, *5-9 record, 123-112-3 all time with the team*

*the prosecution*

After the failures of my predecessor, I intend to bring a whole new approach to this prosecutor's office. I'm going to leave the politics aside, and focus on the matters at hand. After all, I'm a humble southerner who enjoys the simple pleasures in life: a cold beer in my hand, and an incompetent coach roasting on the open fire.

Which brings me to Marvin Lewis. There was a time, perhaps, when we would have praised and appreciated Mr. Lewis for stabilizing the Cincinnati organization. Of course, there was a time when I appreciated my AOL dial-up connection as well. But there was only so many times that sucker would crash out on me before I realized that I needed to upgrade. In that same vein, there's only so many times this Bengals team can crap out before we all have to admit that an upgrade is necessary.

More than anything, we've come to realize that Mr. Lewis benefited greatly from some excellent coordinators around him. He initially struggled in Cincy (1 winning season in his first 6 years) before eventually being buoyed by two studs in Jay Gruden and Mike Zimmer. Since they've left, the team has predictably and slowly sunken back into the depths of the AFC once again. The rapid decline in point differential is the most troubling of all – from +140 in 2015, to +10 in 2016, to -72 in 2017. There's a hole in this ship about 100 points a year wide, and the Bengals can't wait any longer to plug it up.

*the defense*

As mentioned by the prosecution, [Marvin Lewis deserves credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7js5fp/in_defense_of_marvin_lewis/?st=jbgvqwak&amp;sh=9d1223ea) for stabilizing this franchise over the years. Before his hiring in 2002, the Bengals were mired in a 55-137 stretch that saw them win an average of 4.6 games over a twelve-year period. He's completely reshaped the front office, the scouting department, and the organization as a whole. Aside from Green Bay, no team in the NFL sustains itself on homegrown draft picks more.

If Lewis erred lately, it was *trusting* that system too much. He thought R1-R2 pick offensive tackles Cedric Ogbuehi and Jake Fisher would be ready to start by this, their third season. They weren't. He thought in-house OC Ken Zampese would improve in this, his second season on the job. He didn't. Lewis can *learn* from those mistakes and add some fresh blood and fresh talent around him. This team still has the talent to be a playoff contender with a few tweaks, and with Lewis at the helm.

*the verdict*

We the jury agree with the defense that fresh blood is needed, but more blood than he lets on. With all apologies and due respect to Marvin Lewis, we instruct the squad to raise their muskets and FIRE AWAY.

**CLEVELAND**

*the defendant*: **Hue Jackson**, *0-14 record, 1-29 all time with the team*

*the prosecution*

Sports fans are savvy these days. Like Sting on a hot date, they don't mind exercising patience and delayed gratification. Essentially, they ""trust the process,"" so long as they trust the leadership behind that process at the same time.

The Cleveland Browns' latest rebuild clearly didn't meet that criterion. Sure, Hue Jackson got saddled with a huge task and a huge rebuild, but there's nothing in his resume so far that suggests that he's capable of leading this team out of the muck and mire.

Worse yet, his biggest blind spot happens to be the most important one: his handling of the QB position. Every move the team has made lately has suggested that they have no clue how to elevate or develop QBs. DeShone Kizer may have been worth a boom/bust flier in R2, but the team took that flier and that lottery ticket and promptly wiped their ass with it: allowing him to take punishment (31 sacks in 430 pass attempts), and ruining his confidence by toggling him in and out of the lineup.  

Afterwards, Mr. Jackson shifted the blame to Kizer, as he always does. If this coach has mastered anything, it's deflation and scapegoating. He puts his foot in his mouth so many times that Rex Ryan masturbates to clips of his press conferences. He's become an embarrassment to an organization that's suffered too much embarrassment already. Please, make it stop.

*the defense*

If your goal as a franchise is to establish stability, the worst way to do that would be fire *another* head coach. Call it the Curse of Bill Belichick if you like, because after the team (albeit a different version of the ""Browns"") axed him prematurely, Cleveland hasn't found any sense of continuity on a staff yet. They've had a total of 9 head coaches -- 7 of whom got fired in two seasons or less. 

If you're going to commit to a rebuild and ""trust the process,"" then you're going to have to tolerate some ugly losses and some embarrassment along the way. That's *part* of the ""process."" But at the end of the day, the foundation still looks fertile here. After all, what would you prefer from Hue Jackson? A Jets-like season, and a spirited 5-6 wins that won't mean anything at all? Or another clunker, which results in another # 1 pick (in addition to the Houston pick, which currently lands at # 4)? 

We can't judge Hue Jackson or this latest rebuild yet. Let's give him one more year and his first stab at an actual franchise QB before we do.

*the verdict*

We the jury have decided (with the urging of Josh Rosen and his agent) to execute Hue Jackson before he gets his hands on another young QB. FIRE AWAY.

######**AFC SOUTH**

There's only one coach in this division who gets the Bill Belichick Law pass: Doug Marrone, who's surprisingly led the Jaguars to a breakout year.

**INDIANAPOLIS**

*the defendant*: **Chuck Pagano**, *3-11 record, 52-42 all time with the team*

*the prosecution*

Originally, we planned on stockpiling a whale ton of evidence for this case. We had our plucky office intern Danny compile exhibits of every single one of Chuck Pagano's bungles (including that infamous fake punt.) Poor little fella dropped dead from exhaustion. RIP Danny.

What's *harder* to find is evidence of Mr. Pagano's virtues as a head coach. His specialty is the defensive side of the ball, but despite six offseasons to reshape his roster, that defense is *still* quite mediocre. In fact, they've totaled 22 sacks on the season so far, 2nd worst in the entire NFL.

You'd think that Mr. Pagano would be able to come up with ideas on how to pressure the QB by watching his opponents. After all, *they* have racked up 53 sacks on the year, MOST in the NFL. Part of that is Jacoby Brissett's slow release, but this is also a team that allowed Andrew Luck to take 41 sacks himself the year prior.

Now, I'm no offensive guru (nor is Mr. Pagano), but you'd think that either of us would realize that protecting a generational franchise QB would be a paramount part of his job description. Instead, he's allowed his offenses to take deep shots, and allowed his QB to take the defense's best shots. This is no laughing matter, because it makes you wonder how much of Luck’s durability issues are the direct result of this lawed approach. Hopefully Luck comes back for 2018; hopefully, Mr. Pagano does not.

*the defense*

No doubt, it's unfortunate that Andrew Luck got injured. Immediately, it doomed the entire 2017 season. Unless you're Bill Belichick, no coach in the NFL is going to make the playoffs with a depth chart that leads off with the name ""Scott Tolzien."" As a result, the team needed to rush in Jacoby Brissett. And hey, they did a serviceable job of getting Brissett ready to go on such short notice. The Colts started 2-3 and had some nice moments and some flashes from Brissett.

Given the expectations, Pagano's 3-11 record is understandable. In fact, that record (coupled with his 8-8 record when Luck missed a lot of time in 2015, speaks to Pagano's ""virtue"" as an NFL coach. His team still competes and fights for him, even when the odds are stacked against them. He hasn't lost that locker room yet, and therefore he shouldn't lose his job yet. 

*the verdict*

We the jury have seen enough to make a ruling – and have seen too much of Chuck Pagano to wait any longer. We give the order to the squad to FIRE AWAY.

**HOUSTON**

*the defendant*: **Bill O'Brien**, *4-10 record, 31-31 all time with the team*

*the prosecution*

Bill O'Brien is a brilliant coach and a true QB guru; if you don't believe me, just ask him yourself. Through his entire Houston Texans tenure, he's made [a habit of skimping on his offensive staff.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7jjrut/bill_obrien_deserves_to_stay_on_in_houston_but_he/?st=jbgxzzrd&amp;sh=83b34a8e) Like Hue Jackson, he's decided that he doesn't need an offensive coordinator to help him. *He's* got all the answers himself.

Unfortunately for him, the results tell a different story. Through four seasons on the job, he's opened with four different quarterbacks -- Ryan Fitzpatrick in 2014, Brian Hoyer in 2015, Brock Osweiler in 2016, and Tom Savage in 2017. Notice I didn't mention ""Deshaun Watson"" there, because Mr. O'Brien thought that Savage was his better bet to open Week 1. Considering he'd been coaching Savage for two seasons already, you'd think a ""QB Guru"" would be able to gauge the two a little better than that.

It's also fair to question how beneficial his system truly is -- or whether there's much of a ""system"" at all. The best coaches (like Billy Boy's former bosses in New England) manufacture mismatches for their stars and get them open spaces. Mr. O'Brien's top plays include: 1) throwing a contested catch to DeAndre Hopkins and hoping he can battle his way to the ball and miraculously toe tap onto the sidelines, and 2) running Lamar Miller into a brick wall. That speedster of a running back has 1 carry of 20+ yards, in 220 attempts. That ""system"" sure isn't helping him much.

You may think Mr. O'Brien's had success in Houston -- with three 9-7 seasons prior -- but that doesn't tell the whole story. In fact, his point differentials have been in steady decline (+65 to +26 to -49 to -61). That coincides with some injuries to his superstar J.J. Watt, who has bailed out this team time and time again. Sadly, Mr. O'Brien may not be able to count on that happening again; there's no telling if All-Pro J.J. Watt will be walking through that building. If he *isn't* the dominant force that he used to be, O'Brien's flaws will be on full display.

*the defense*

The 2017 Houston Texans struggled. Shocker. This is a team that lost a Hall of Famer in J.J. Watt and a potential rookie of the year in Deshaun Watson. It's no wonder that the team couldn't rebound from there.

You may criticize Bill O'Brien for not starting Deshaun Watson from Week 1, but that’s irrelevant now. O'Brien wanted to show some patience and make sure that Watson would be able to hit the ground running (so he wouldn't lose confidence like Kizer). Turns out Watson did that quicker than he anticipated -- that's a *good* sign, not a bad one. Going forward, Watson should be healthy and ready to fire away to DeAndre Hopkins, who's regained his mojo and his status as a top 3 WR.

The defense took a step back this year, but should be better next season regardless of whether J.J. Watt is a DPOY candidate anymore or not. There are other good young pieces on that side of the ball, including Jadeveon Clowney and their rising star DC Mike Vrabel. If the offense and defense can click at the same time, this team still looks like a true threat for the playoffs for many years to come. O'Brien constructed a program that's built to last here, and needs to stick around to shepherd it through.

*the verdict*

We the jury find in favor of Bill O'Brien (no matter what the media may suggest) and look forward to seeing him and a healthier Watson back together in 2018. KEEP HIM.

**TENNESSEE**

*the defendant*: **Mike Mularkey**, *8-6 record, 19-20 all time with the team*

*the prosecution*

If Marvin Lewis feels like an outdated AOL dial-up, the Tennessee Titans feels like communicating with smoke signals. Mike Mularkey's staff values experience, perhaps too much so. In fact, he currently employs the oldest defensive coordinator in the league (Dick LeBeau, 80) *and* the oldest offensive coordinator in the league (Terry Robiskie, 63) at the same time.

We won't dare to disrespect LeBeau, especially because the ageless wonder's unit is actually playing solid defense this year. However, the offensive issues of this team are a bigger concern and a bigger reason to move on from this coach.

Mr. Mularkey intended to bring back ""smashmouth"" football to the league behind a good offensive line and two power backs. That worked initially, but has started to yield diminishing returns. In fact, his franchise QB Marcus Mariota has started to regress to troubling degrees. At the moment, Mariota has thrown for 12 TDs against 14 ints, with a 62.9% completion percentage and a 79.7 QB rating that trails well behind most of the NFL. To make matters worse, he's only rushed for 228 yards on the ground. 

Essentially, Mr. Mularkey's old school staff has managed to turn back the clock on the NFL *and* their quarterback at the same time. They've taken one of the most exciting young QB talents to come around in years and turned him into one of the worst starters in the league. 8-6 record or not, no one fears these Titans. No one respects these Titans. Heck, Vegas made them an underdog against a 3-10 San Francisco team, and the Titans promptly proved them right by dropping that game. The retro look was fun while it lasted, but now it's time for this team to take a clear step *forward*.

*the defense*

Mike Mularkey's gotten a lot of flak for his comments about ""exotic smashmouth"" football, but the Titans are well aware that phase was never meant to last. In fact, they drafted a WR in Corey Davis with the # 5 overall pick, intending to open up this offense and allow Marcus Mariota to start slinging it around the field more.

That plan hasn't worked out *yet* because Corey Davis hasn't been fully healthy *yet*. However, that doesn't mean it'll never happen. The defense cites Exhibit F, the rookie years of other superstar receivers. As rookies, neither Calvin Johnson nor Julio Jones cracked 1000 yards (logging 756 and 959 yards, respectively). If Corey Davis can take that famous sophomore leap, then he can provide the team with the improved passing game it needs. Davis has that type of potential; after all, this is a kid who logged 1400+ yards and 12+ TDs in college for three years in a row. Let's wait to judge this offense until Davis can get healthy first.

They may have been blinded by the aura of Jimmy G., but this is a playoff team now that should only get better from here.

*the verdict*

We the jury appreciate Corey Davis’ upside and all, but we're not betting an entire franchise on him. Marcus Mariota is still an exciting talent, which makes this potential job opening an appealing one. Let's see what the kid can do with a new coach in his corner. Sorry, Mike Mularkey, it's time to FIRE AWAY. 

**scheduling update**

We’re going to take a break in order for all this gun smoke to clear. With games this weekend and the holidays, we probably won’t return with this series until Wednesday or Thursday. We’ll come back with some new writers/prosecutors to finish up strong before the end of the season.

7lhwoj,0,2017-12-22,"Recently graduated college and started my career, I need a financial plan",PhunkyFish,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7lhwoj/recently_graduated_college_and_started_my_career/,"I'll try to keep this as brief and to the point as possible. As the title mentions, I'm 24, graduated last May with a degree in Math and Computer Science and started a job in IT in late September. Although I have a job with a decent salary and reasonable living expenses, I have very very little savings as I basically started out of college with nothing (I had to spend most of my money on college), and I have a lot of student loans so I just want to make sure I have a good plan for my financial future so I can be well off and avoid the same struggles my parents have gone through their entire life.


To give you a basic idea of what my situation looks like right now, I'll give you some of the numbers I'm currently looking at.


Salary: $50,000

Regular Monthly Expenses(Rent, utilities, food, everything that's necessary): ~$1500

Savings: ~$1,000

Debt:

* Student Loans: ~$37,000

* Loan from family: ~$700 (To help me move)


Now I know that building up an emergency fund is probably the most important thing for me to focus on right now, so I've recently opened a high yield savings account and set up my direct deposit to put 8% (~$104) into that account. I plan on putting more than that into that account each month but this way I at least know SOMEthing is going into it without even thinking about it. Based on my expenses I figure I should go for about $9000-$10000 if I want to reach that 6 month recommendation.

After that though, is where things seem to get a little more complicated. Since I have a pretty big chunk of student loans, I'd always figured that it would probably be best to just pay that off ASAP, but after doing more research on investing and seeing the kinds of returns you can expect, I'm wondering if that is really the best option based on the interest rates I have on most of my loans.


Basically, about $7000 of my loans are at a higher rate of 6.8%, and the rest are 4.8% or lower; I'd say 4% average. I've read that with 401ks and IRA's, you can basically expect 6% returns, and with other stock investments you can expect 9-10% in the long run. Based on this information, it seems pretty obvious to me that I should focus on paying the 6.8% loans off ASAP, and then just make minimum payments on the rest while instead focusing my money on investments.


After a year of working at my company, I'll be eligible for our 401k. Based on what I heard from HR, my company contributes 3% regardless of what I contribute, but I could be wrong and this percentage is subject to change each year. However, this particular position wasn't really in the field I was looking to get into and I am planning on job searching again after a year or so. With my educational background, I was hoping to get into some sort of software development position. 


While I have completed a web development internship, I didn't have much luck while applying for full time positions. Thus, when I got the offer for this position, I felt like I didn't have much of a choice as the grace period for my loans was months away and I was running out of money. However, I do believe that taking this position did allow me easier access to a lot more of the opportunities I'm interested in, as I moved to NYC from a very small town for this job. I figure I would probably make more in a development position here but I'm not sure how much exactly I could expect.

Does this make sense or is there something I'm missing? I'm very new to the world of investing and personal finance but it's something I'm very interested in."
7li9vl,14,2017-12-22,So it's been almost 300 days,Khchen,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/7li9vl/so_its_been_almost_300_days/,"Alright, it's been awhile since I have done a post on here. It's almost been a year for me since I stopped playing games haha, the triggering point was a lost relationship. Overall, I think as far as for me, I did not feel many triggers that would want me to relapse and go back into gaming since I felt how much I have lost and I guess it was more a reality check like shit I'm 25 and not really doing much with my life, better get started. I enrolled in a Computer Science degree (just finished my first semester) and I had no programming experience prior. What I found was a change in scenery really helped me keep my mind off everything, and I think quitting was probably one of the best choices I have made, so was starting a new degree in CS. With a bit of mentoring, currently I have had interviews with Microsoft/Amazon/Spotify/Blizzard for software engineering intern and landed a development job for the winter semester. Honestly, I am not that smart, so I mean if I can do it, I am sure most people could as well! It's never too late to start making a change. I can genuinely say I have never felt happier/more fulfilled than right now, gaming used to give me the empty happiness just temporary. Thanks for reading :) Feel free to ask me any Qs about what I did to quit/CS/life in general, always happy to answer!"
7ljkl4,0,2017-12-22,"Enough is Enough, I had to speak out against the hate......",[deleted],Ice_Poseidon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ice_Poseidon/comments/7ljkl4/enough_is_enough_i_had_to_speak_out_against_the/,"First let me provide a background of myself so that you all can realize the demographic of people who watches Paul’s streams. I’m a 19-year-old college student who started watching the streams on 06/21/2017 in which I believe was the day he went to Vidcon. On, that day I was browsing through the YouTube live section and I came across Paul’s stream which was his first day at Vidcon. I tuned in and from the moment I did, I was instantly hooked into the content because it was genuinely entertaining. I was amused, happy, and experienced a sense of connection with the stream and Paul since I haven’t seen anyone on Twitch or YouTube who made me laugh so much. Keep in mind before I discovered Paul’s stream on YouTube, I did not know about Twitch and the people on there like B0aty, Greek, and Sodapoppin. I know I sound like a normie, but considering I’m a college student, I was busy with internships during the entire summer of 2017. Therefore, I didn’t have a lot of time to visit Twitch in order to watch the streamers on that platform. But back to Paul, ever since staying up in the early morning watching his Vidcon stream, I concluded that I genuinely love this guy and his humor. From that point on, I decided I will always become a dedicated viewer to his streams because they made me feel happy, comforted, and just overall great. I remember shortly after visiting Vidcon, he went to the nightclub in Orange County in which he provided fucking great content with Victor and the nightclub owner. That was a really great stream and a funny one too. Then, shortly after visiting the nightclub, he departed to London which kick-offed his summer EU trip. From, London, Amsterdam, and Ibiza, I fucking loved all of it! His goofiness and funny personality was the highlight of my summer during these trips and I binged watched all of them into the early hours of the morning even when I had to get up to go to university. I of course didn’t mind because those streams gave me the motivation to get up to go to university and be confident in myself. Since, Paul was having fun and being happy in those streams, I became happy and motivated to want to achieve the goals I had set for myself. Once, I noticed that his streams were making me happy and improving my grades at university, I knew Paul was a angel in disguise. He not only improved my life but he changed it for the better. I cannot thank you more than enough Paul for making me the confident &amp; happy person that I am today ever since watching your streams since Vidcon 2017. Ever since your Vidcon streams this past summer, I have never missed a stream of yours and I never will. I wait every single day for your YouTube notification to go off so that I can tune in and watch. I am an active sponsor of yours on YouTube and I always will be. You are the best livestreamer in the world and no one can provide the content you do on an every day basis. I appreciate the hard work and effort that you put into the streams and the dedication you do as well. This leads me to another point which is, you have an amazing support group around you such as Victor, Jacob, Gray, Kyle, Casey, Nathan, Rueben, Greek, and Brent. I have recently spoken to Kyle and Victor and they are such lovely people and I wish them nothing but the best. They are so nice, and they not only love you, but they love the viewers as well. All your friends want the best for you and will always support you. These are the type of people you want around you not leeches like GrossGore &amp; Caroline. I’m sorry for hurting your feelings for saying that Caroline is a leech but unfortunately, she is. When you were single during your EU trip, you were so happy (you’re still are btw) and ever since you started dated Caroline it seems like she is taking advantage of your fame to promote her own streams. It pained me knowing that she slept with Hair Jordan the same night that she went on a date with you. You’re a smart, intelligent, confident, and handsome young men that can date any women if you choose to. Why settle with an unattractive, manipulative, and attention-seeking “woman” when all she is doing is making you feel worthless? Personally, I don’t want you to experience that and neither do your viewers. I’m no streamer myself, but I can say it’s not a good decision to date a woman while you’re a streamer because it takes away your attention from what matters the most, and that’s YOUR STREAMS!!! Like Kyle and Greek were saying, you cannot mix your personal life and you streaming life together because your streaming career can be affected negatively. For fuck’s sake she doesn’t even mind you picking up chicks on stream because she doesn’t care about you. I know it sucks to hear this but it’s the truth and well the truth hurt’s sometimes. And one last thing I want to address is the hate that you receive from your fans. First, I think that some of your viewers are jealous of you because you’re the most successful streamer this world has witnessed. You make 20k month (I believe you actually make 60k month), has 10,000 viewers watching each stream, travel the world, live in beautiful Los Angeles, have the most beautiful &amp; nicest friends, and just being happy. All those traits I pointed out makes the depressed viewers jealous because nothing good is happening in their life and they are just trying to bring you down. Ignore them because their trying to project their sadness onto you, which is not fucking right at all. I’m happy to see your mods are removing hate posts on Reddit because the PURPLE ARMY is all about towards you not about hate. Nonetheless, I love you Paul, your streams, and your friends. With your positive mindset, intelligence, and your support system, you are always going to be successful in life. I will always donate, like, and sponsor your streams because you’re my idol. I want to be you one day. Keep up the marvelous work and keep your light shining bright, Paul! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"

You hear my voice through the intercom on your desk ""Emily, you are 1 minute late you better hurry up"". You know what it means...

You put the gag you received when your internship begun, you check that the clamps on your nipples are still in position -you don't feel them very well after wearing them all day- and you don't have to check, you already know that your plug makes a bulge on the back of your short skirt.

While walking to my desktop you see yourself in the glass of a big open space: you look tired it's just the middle of the week and you already can't wait for the weekend to come. Your white shirt has a weird stain from your last meeting this afternoon, has usual your skirt is way too short to be ""professionnal"" and your high hells just hurt your feet. You wipe a bit of saliva which runs out of your gag.

When you arrive in my office, I am with 2 other business man in black tie. You already saw one the week before but you never met the second one, you see in his eyes that the night will be long...

You were able to basically read my mind and make decisions knowing I would agree. When you were my intern, I told you that everyone applying for the job had the same qualifications as you so you need to differentiate yourself. You took that to heart and you worked closely with me to pick up on my tendencies and figure out what makes me tick. You also started to flaunt that perfect body. I wasn’t trying to imply that with my comments but I definitely wasn’t complaining. It was nice that when I was working ungodly hours I had someone attractive and intelligent to be with. By the time your internship was over I had spent more time with you than my family. 

After 5 years of marriage and two kids, my wife had let herself go. The baby weight just didn’t go away and she lost her drive to try lose it. The spark we used to have was all but gone. Partly my fault because I was never home and when I was I wasn’t there mentally. My mind was back at the office with you.

After you graduated, I hired you on full time and you quickly were the top performer on my team. Recently, with all the time we had spent together, some tension was starting to build. It started with the playful flirting when we would order in dinner for the long nights of work. At the office Christmas party I made physical contact with the aid of alcohol. I put a hand on the small of your back while we waited for a drink and grazed your hand after I hugged you goodbye. 

This week was the holiday party for the entire company. This one the families were invited. I had a nervousness about the event. First, I was wary of my wife noticing the tension between you and me. Second, I was embarrassed to bring my wife along. I didn’t want to be seen with her.

7ll9ar,3,2017-12-22,Over 10k USD locked in Coinbase and no Support Action for 4 months,mcatoen,CoinBase,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7ll9ar/over_10k_usd_locked_in_coinbase_and_no_support/,"tl:dr I got phished, quarantined my account with a 'hacked ticket' and Coinbase has yet to unlock the account four months later. After consistent weekly calls, five support tickets, twitter messages, and now this, the money is still locked up. Today over 10 000 in funds are locked and Coinbase doesn't seem to care. 

***

I did an internship in Silicon Valley as a software developer. When I was down there I bought into all the 'Crypto Hype', started making my own d-apps etc. However, most importantly I bought some Bitcoin and Ethereum. When I got back to Canada, I lost my US number and therefore couldn't get into my account (classic 2-factor). Easy! All I had to do is show them my ID and the number could be changed. Whoops, since my account was in the US, it wouldn't accept anything other than a US ID. With this problem I filed a support ticket and never got a response. I wanted to call Coinbase, so I went looking for a support hotline. I heard there was one buried in the web somewhere from a friend, and ended up finding something that seemed legit (clearly not in hindsight). Called the line and they said they could help me (surprise!). They VPN'd into my computer to ""help me through the process"" and after a long conversation I realized this clearly not a real hotline. However, they already had a VPN going and because of this probably had a lot of my information. Immediately wiped my computer, and filed the hacked ticket with Coinbase which disabled my account temporarily (didn't want the phish to get in before I wiped everything). I've called Coinbase's new real hotline every single week since then, and in every call I'm assured that the issue will be resolved; followed by ZERO action on their part. None of my emailed are ever responded to, and no action items are given on my part. I'm fed up and losing faith I'll ever see the money I have locked in Coinbase. "

7llnpp,107,2017-12-22,In grad school I unexpectedly hooked up with my former 'boss' [MF] [LONG],here_is_where_i_am,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/7llnpp/in_grad_school_i_unexpectedly_hooked_up_with_my/,"When I was twenty-four, in February of my final semester at grad school, I was reeling from chaos in my personal life—to keep an already long story from getting even longer, let’s just say I’d fallen in love with my coworker, roommate, and best friend, who ended up sleeping with our other coworker and lying about it. The first time just so happened to be the same night we’d all gotten plastered together on the Upper West Side and she told me she’d been ‘mortified’ when he asked her out, because they were just friends. They didn’t have the same kind of relationship we did, she said. *Yikes.* The next morning I did not react well, to say the least. The following two months only made things worse. By February we were at the tensest moment of what became a year-long, painful disintegration of our friendship. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’d also just started teaching my first ever college class, and I was struggling to write my thesis, which wasn’t going well. I needed a win, and perhaps a distraction, so I texted a handful of friends (and women, although my brain wasn’t really there yet to be honest…heartbreak, or whatever) and waited to see who wanted to go out and put up with me at my most glum and self-absorbed. A former coworker, Rachel, responded and agreed to grab a drink. We hadn’t seen each other in a while, so it would be good to catch up. Understand that I didn’t think any more of it—not only was I depressed and heartsick, but I also just didn’t see her as a potential sexual partner. Rachel was the junior agent and office assistant at a literary agency in downtown Manhattan, and had been my direct superior for the eight months or so I’d worked there as a paid intern. She was thirty when I started, and I was only twenty-three. Along with the vice-president, she’d even been the one to interview me when I first moved to the city and heard about the opportunity. 

&amp;nbsp;

Back then I was in the midst of a different romantic meltdown, which had me moving out of an apartment I’d just moved into—from Chicago, no less!—only a week before I started grad school. Perhaps this is part of why I’d never noticed Rachel earlier, as anything other than the second-youngest member of the office and person whose desk was closest to mine. Plus, if I’m being honest, I just hadn’t grown into myself at the time. I saw myself as the same skinny, awkward, nerdy kid I’d been in high school, friends with most people but not all that confident with beautiful women. In any case, we agreed to meet up for drinks at a French wine bar on 8th Street, not far from school. We’d gone out once before after my internship ended, for whiskey at a diver bar in the East Village, but it had been friendly and not much else, at least to me. I figured we’d drink some wine, eat some charcuterie, and gossip about our favorite writers and those we were working with professionally, or in my case as a student. I guess on some level I saw it was networking—Rachel was a junior agent now, and by the time I finished my book maybe she’d be a senior one, able to represent my work. It made sense to stay friends. 

&amp;nbsp;

I arrived first and lucked into a table. This place was always busy in the evening, thanks to its location and romantic atmosphere—something that I hadn’t considered when picking it, focused more on the ability to order inexpensive wine flights. It was cold outside, and I was dressed for it in the semi-new wardrobe I’d put together with Christmas gift-cards and help from my mother (so sexy, right?), who felt I needed to look more like an adult if I was going to fool my students into thinking I was an authority of some kind. I wore slim-cut, dark jeans, a fitted buttondown, and a thick, cowled cardigan with suede elbow patches. My peacoat, newly retrieved from the tailor, was slung over my chair. My brown Chukkas were covered in sidewalk salt, a hazard of the city in winter. I’d started keeping a well-groomed beard around this time, another effort to remind my students I was older than them, if only just. I ordered a glass of Chinon and fiddled with my phone until Rachel arrived. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first thing I noticed was her coat: a peacoat, like mine, but lurid, Pepto-Bismol pink. Not my thing at all. But then she took it off…it was like seeing a completely new person. Rachel was tall, with long legs—she often wore riding boots over tights or jeans, something that just *does* it for me—and a great body. Thin, but not overly so, with a cute butt that she couldn’t hide, even with her relatively modest professional wardrobe. That night, however, she wore a dark grey dress, slinky without looking déclassé, cinched at her waist with a black belt. It was cut fairly low, highlighting her décolletage. She had *great* breasts, perky and big on her frame but still well-proportioned for her scale. I’m not one to stare, but I had to stop myself. How had I never noticed before? 

&amp;nbsp;

“You look, uh, you look…great,” I said, always the smooth one. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Aw, thanks!” She smiled and took a seat. 

&amp;nbsp;

Understand, of course, that much of this physical memory comes in retrospect. Sure, I noticed she looked “great,” but I was also so stuck in my own emotions at the time that I didn’t think anything of it. She asked me to order her a glass of wine—a full-bodied red—and I settled on a Châteauneuf-du-Pape. We talked about work, and I found out she’d left the agency, but mostly I spent my time complaining about my roommate, Nora, and how she’d broken my heart and lied to me and I still had to work with her and see both of them. I was insufferable, I’m sure. I was insufferable for a good two-and-a-half years of my life in New York. The fact that Rachel maintained interest is a testament, I guess, to one of two things: either I’m just that desirable, even at my worst, or—and this is more likely—she was going through just as much personal-life shit as I was, and needed a distraction just as badly, if not moreso. After a few more glasses of wine each, so cured meat and cheese and cornichons, and a hell of a lot more of my complaining, the waiter came over to herd us away so they could free up the table. Rachel glared at me, but didn’t say anything.

&amp;nbsp;

“Are you okay?” I asked, signing the check. “You seem…it seems like you’re mad at me.”

&amp;nbsp;

She looked me right in the eyes. “Were you in love with this girl? Did you *love* her?” 

&amp;nbsp;

“I…uh…well, yes. I mean, I guess, yes I was.”

&amp;nbsp;

She swigged her flute of Prosecco and set the glass down sharply. “Let’s go.”

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason we took a roundabout route to the subway, heading down 5th Ave and cutting through Washington Square, under the arch. It was dark and cold, and few were still in the park at this hour, other than scattered homeless people and a handful of entrepreneurial drug dealers who stayed in the darker corners, mistaking us for undergrads and trying to peddle us their shitty weed. We were almost to the corner of MacDougal and West 4th when Rachel turned to me suddenly, breaking her silence. 

&amp;nbsp;

“I don’t…look, maybe I’ve misunderstood all this…” She shivered a little, and the finished her thought. “But…well, I just really want to try this.” 

&amp;nbsp;

She pressed herself into me, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed me with more force than I’d ever been kissed, literally rocking me back on my heels. She was rough, feral, biting my lip and shoving her tongue into my mouth. One of the dealers hooted. 

&amp;nbsp;

When she came up for air, I stepped back. “Wait, stop.”

&amp;nbsp;

She looked embarrassed. “Oh, I—” 

&amp;nbsp;

“It’s not that! No, that was…great! I just feel a little weird making out in front of the crowd here.” I gestured at the various onlookers. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Do you want to come back to Ditmas Park?” she asked between further kisses, biting my bottom lip. “I live by myself. We can do anything we want.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“That sounds amazing—” I felt myself growing hard at the mere suggestion. “—but I have a class to teach in the morning, and my laptop’s at home.” She kissed my neck as I spoke. “Also, don’t you have cats?”

&amp;nbsp;

She stepped back for a second. “A cat, yes.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“I’m *really* allergic to cats.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“So is this not going to happen?” She pouted, but looked legitimately hurt. 

&amp;nbsp;

“What about my place?” I asked. “It’s not that far, and you’re welcome to stay the night if you don’t feel like heading back to Brooklyn super late.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“What about your roommate? Won’t that be weird for you?”

&amp;nbsp;

I kissed her, taking charge for the first time, grabbing her ass through the layers of pink coat and grey dress. Pausing for breath, I made up my mind: “I don’t care. I just want to fuck you.” 

&amp;nbsp;

***

&amp;nbsp;

The train ride to Queens was interminable. Rachel kept trying to make out with me, couldn’t keep her hands off me, but I wasn’t drunk enough not to be self-conscious. All the people around us! I kept stopping her, trying to spin it as something seductive—worth the wait, all that. We got stuck at Roosevelt Island, as if the MTA was hell-bent on prolonging Rachel’s release and my discomfort about public displays of affection. Eventually, of course, we got to Jackson Heights, walked briskly to my place, a third-floor apartment in a privately-owned house not far from the border of Woodside. Nora, the complicated roommate, wasn’t even home. 

&amp;nbsp;

After all the buildup, all the groping and kissing in the park and on the train, I half expected us to end up against the apartment door—although my fantasies usually outstripped my actual, in-person moves. The alcohol and drawn-out train ride, however, meant Rachel wanted to use the bathroom. “It’s fine,” she said. “Just get in bed and I’ll be there in a second.” 

&amp;nbsp;

If I’m being honest, I was intimidated by the whole situation. Here was a beautiful woman, seven years older than me and far more experienced—she was an oversharer at work, so I’d heard some stories—who apparently wanted whatever I could give her. My sex life had been fairly intermittent since breaking up with the old girlfriend and the start of grad school two years earlier, just a hookup here and there followed by a lot of pining for a girl who didn’t feel the same way. I didn’t really know what to do—the whole situation was way more cinematic, way more adult, than what I was used to. Don’t get me wrong, I’d had plenty of good sex before that night, but it had been awhile and it’d always been with peers and girls my age, during relationships or mutually drunken nights. Rachel and I were tipsy, but not wasted, and we were hardly peers—I couldn’t help but think of her as my ‘boss,’ and myself as the intern. I sat in bed, worrying about what to do, how to advance things when she came back, and by the time she actually did open the door and step into my room, I was still fully clothed, reclined on the bed in everything apart from my winter coat. 

&amp;nbsp;

She, on the other hand, was topless. She’d discarded her dress (and shoes, and belt) on the floor in my apartment’s entryway, and was down to her tights. This time I stared. Her tits were perfect—bigger than you would ever guess from seeing her in clothes, and incredibly perky, keeping their shape perfectly but still moving, naturally, while she moved. Her nipples were the size of quarters and erect, angled just slightly upward. Pretty much exactly this shape and these proportions: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/k2Yn26x.jpg)

&amp;nbsp;

I sat up on my elbows, and she laid down next to me, on her side. “So,” she said.

&amp;nbsp;

“So.” I didn’t know what to say. “Sorry. I’m a little nervous.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Don’t be,” she said, reaching for my hand. She guided my hand underneath her tights, and panties, and I started rubbing her clit. She moaned deeply, kissed me again, and started undoing the buttons. “Did you ever think about this while you were at the agency?”

&amp;nbsp;

I paused. “I mean, I think I always looked at it as ‘you were my boss,’ so no, not exactly. But I always thought you were hot.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Did you?” she asked, biting my lip again and starting on my shirt. “Be honest. Really?”

&amp;nbsp;

I curled two fingers shallowly into her, and she pressed herself into me. “Of course,” I said. “You’re sexy as hell.” 

&amp;nbsp;

She tossed my shirt aside, quickly pulled my undershirt over my head. “What about me is sexy?”

&amp;nbsp;

“I really like the way you look in boots,” I answered. “And fuck, you seriously have the best breasts I’ve ever seen.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“You like my tits?”

&amp;nbsp;

I leaned down and circled my tongue around a nipple. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Fuck,” she said. “Fuck. You need to take my tights off. *Now.*” 

&amp;nbsp;

I kissed my way down from her nipples to her stomach to her waistline, slowly peeling off her tights and panties as I ventured lower. By the time my tongue found her clit, she was arching her back and squirming. 

&amp;nbsp;

“I always thought you were cute,” she said while I went down on her, tasting her, my hands spreading her legs open and pressing against her well-trimmed strip of pubic hair. Her moans got louder. “I pushed for them to hire you,” she said in between heavy breaths, “over anyone else. Because—fuck!—because you were sexy.” She clenched her hands, bunching up my sheets. “I thought you were so charming—god, *yes!*—and when you read the story I wrote, the one that was published a few months ago, about my sleeping with the real estate agent?” 

&amp;nbsp;

I winked. “Yeah? Was that based on you?” 

&amp;nbsp;

She reached down and played with her clit while I explored her with my tongue. “You. Know. It. Was. Me.” She squeezed her thights against my cheeks. “When I thought about you reading the scene. Where I blew him on the floor of the. Show apartment….I just couldn’t stop imagining your cock. You playing with yourself. Touching yourself while thinking. About me. Going down. On him.” She turned her face into my pillows and moaned. “Stop,” she said. “Stop. I need your cock.” 

&amp;nbsp;

In one expert motion she undid my belt and fly and pulled off my jeans, kissing down my torso as she went. My cock was straining against my boxer briefs, and she kissed it like that, pressing her lips around the outline of my shaft. The view of Rachel on her knees, bent over me, teasing my cock, was almost too much her handle—those perfect tits in prime view, her plump lips pressed around the shape of my cock. Before too long, she pulled off my underwear, and my cock—rock hard, by this point—sprang free. (Luckily I had ‘manscaped only a day or two before, for no particular reason. I hadn’t expected this!)

&amp;nbsp;

“You’re *huuuuge!*” she said, gripping me softly in one hand and turning me to stare at every angle. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Oh?” I said, feigning ignorance. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Like, I always thought you were sexy,” she said. “But I *never* would’ve expected this.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“I’ve been told this before,” I told her, “but I guess I never thought much of it. Seems like the kind of thing you just say during sex because you’re supposed to…”

&amp;nbsp;

Rachel laughed. “I don’t believe that,” she said. “You’re fishing for compliments. You know you’re big.”

&amp;nbsp;

I smirked. “I mean, a girl or two has struggled to deepthroat me, sure.” 

&amp;nbsp;

A look of determined confidence came over. “We’ll see about that.”

&amp;nbsp;

I’d be lying if I said it was the best blowjob I’ve ever received, but it was good. Certainly one of the most enthusiastic. She was sloppy, loud—she’d take as much of me as she could (which was most!) and then slowly pull away, strings of saliva running from my cock to her lips. She was the first woman (can I call her a girl? She was seven years older than me!) who ever spit on my cock for lubrication. And again, the view. I couldn’t take my eyes off her perfect tits, bouncing and jiggling just slightly when she got particularly enthusiastic, nipples still at attention. 

&amp;nbsp;

A year before, I could never have pictured this, and even as it happened it was incredibly surreal, this woman who’d told me to digitize files, or pick up paper goods at K-Mart, was bent over me, completely naked, gagging herself on my cock. The weirdness of it kept cropping up at inopportune times; the situation was hot, but it also kept tweaking my nerves in such a way that I struggled to finish, a surprise given the relative lack of sex I’d been having. “Come up here and fuck me,” I finally said. “I want to feel you.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“Get a condom first,” she said, out of breath.

&amp;nbsp;

I reached over to the bedside table while her mouth was still on me, fumbling blindly for a condom. When I found one, I handed it to her and she rolled it on with ease. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Just so you know,” she said. “It’s really hard for me to finish. So, like, don’t take it personally.”

&amp;nbsp;

“That’s okay,” I said. “Is there anything—”

&amp;nbsp;

“No,” she said. “Don’t worry about it. It just happens or it doesn’t, it’s not you. I was really close while you were going down on me, but I wanted to see if we could both finish during sex.” 

&amp;nbsp;

I nodded. We were both slick with sweat already, and out of breath. She straddled me and slowly lowered herself onto my cock.

&amp;nbsp;

“Fuck,” she kept saying. “Fuck, you’re so big.” She inched her way down, shockingly tight. “You’re just a lot bigger than I’m used to.” 

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I was fully inside her. She paused for a second, adapting, and then started to speed up. I grabbed her at the waist and came up to meet her, the sound of skin slapping skin. “Holy fuck. Yes!” she screamed. “Fuck! Yes! You. Feel. So. Good.”

&amp;nbsp;

As fun as it was to watch her bounce and grind on me, and to see her facial expressions contort, once I felt sure she was used to me I flipped her over to fuck her from behind, a favorite position that usually made me come way too quickly. The weird mix of wine and nerves must have helped that night. Anyway, Rachel had the filthiest mouth of any woman I’ve ever fucked, far more than I can accurately replicate here. She was loud, screaming and moaning so much that I felt sure my downstairs or next door neighbors would complain or give me side eye in the morning. (The block was entirely row houses, with shared walls.) We shook the bedframe and knocked an Old Fashioned glass of the nightstand, which I ignored. Twice I slipped out and accidentally pressed into her ass. (“Wrong hole,” she said with a grunt.)As I fucked her from behind, watching her cunt grip my cock and her ass flex, she kept hitting her head on the bedframe. (Like every other student in the city, I had a MALM.)

&amp;nbsp;

“Fuckfuckfuckfuck,” she shouted. “Fuck me with your huge cock. Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.” 

&amp;nbsp;

Since she obviously liked dirty talk, I tried to play along. I wasn’t much good: “Do you like being fucked by my huge dick?”

&amp;nbsp;

“YES!” she screamed. “Shut up and keep fucking me. Fuck. Yes.”  

&amp;nbsp;

We kept going for what seemed like forever, probably my longest orgasm-less fuck to this day. The condom dried out, and she was sore, so we paused for a second to catch our breath. My shoulders ached from being over her for so long. Rachel pulled the condom off and lazily went down on me again, each of us laying on our side. It’d had been well over an hour at this point. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Close your eyes,” she said. “Picture the office. It’s a Thursday, and everyone’s out to meetings, or to lunch. You’ve stayed at your computer because you brought a sandwich.”

&amp;nbsp;

I could picture where this was going, and I liked it.

&amp;nbsp;

“Earlier you couldn’t help but notice that I wore a more revealing outfit than usual—tighter jeans, with my Fryes. A form-fitting sweater. You thought I didn’t catch you staring, but I did…Why do you think I went to the bathroom for so long?”

&amp;nbsp;

I groaned. Felt my back arch and hips buck, driving my cock deep into her mouth. 

&amp;nbsp;

She gasped, a line of saliva stuck to her chin, when she came up for air. “You’re alone in the office, so you turn to my desk, my computer, and start sneaking through my files. It’s a lot of junk, contracts and permissions documents and manuscripts, but after a while you see one titled ‘Intern,’ dated all the way back to September, when you started.” 

&amp;nbsp;

She spit on my cock. “You start reading it.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Holy *shit!*” I groaned. I could feel my balls tightening, my cock throbbing. “Fuck.” 

&amp;nbsp;

“It’s about your interview, and how the assistant—that’s me—can’t decide what to say to her boss. Should we hire the cute guy who just interviewed, with a good resumé? Or should we hire someone else, so the assistant can steal his phone number, call him, and fuck his brains out in…where did you live then?”

&amp;nbsp;

“Harlem,” I gasped.

&amp;nbsp;

She reached down with a hand to help out as she licked all the way up the underside of my cock.“In Harlem.” 

&amp;nbsp;

I couldn’t take anymore. “Fuck, Rachel, I’m going to come. Fuckfuckfuck.”

&amp;nbsp;

“Don’t you want to hear the end?” she asked, stroking faster. 

&amp;nbsp;

“I don’t care,” I said. “I just want to come on your perfect fucking ti—” 

&amp;nbsp;

But it was too late. I exploded, a fountain of come, rope after rope—all that buildup, all that anticipation, the illicit fact that she’d been my ‘boss.’ The first shot caught her on the chin and nose before she got her mouth around me, and she did her best to handle the rest. When I finally finished, twitching and giddy, there was another dribble of come down her chin. She smiled and opened her mouth, sticking out her tongue to show me the load. Then she swallowed. “That was awesome,” she said. “Holy shit!”

&amp;nbsp;

She kissed me, come still dribbling down her chin, and went to the bathroom. I set my alarm, worried about missing the first day of workshop with my undergrads. When she came back, we spooned for a while, both worn out but far too riled up to sleep. 

&amp;nbsp;

We ended up fucking again before bed, first on our sides but then with me on my back, and Rachel facing up, so I could rub her clit and nipples at the same time, but she couldn’t quite get there. By the time we fell asleep, it was 5:00am, and I had to be up in three hours to teach class—but that didn’t stop us from one more spirited effort in the morning, where I finally got to unload (albeit less this time) on her perfect breasts. She left, headed to her new corporate job downtown, and I showered, drank a pot of coffee, and left for class. 

&amp;nbsp;

We never slept together again.

7llwha,1,2017-12-22,[M4F] Looking for Female Celebrities!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7llwha/m4f_looking_for_female_celebrities/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7lmede,7,2017-12-22,"Is my mom an Nmom? I can't tell if she's right and I'm self sabotaging, or she's being manipulative.",oceanlark,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7lmede/is_my_mom_an_nmom_i_cant_tell_if_shes_right_and/,"My therapist, when I raised the question to her a year ago on a similar situation, said I was being very pragmatic, and that blew my mind because I've never seen myself that way. I always thought I was terrible at making decisions. And that made me realize a big reason I have no trust in my choices is because my mom tells me I'm self sabotaging when I want to do something she disagrees with.

I wanted to take an unpaid internship in NYC, that she had actually helped me find...but suddenly, it was bad idea because it was unpaid. I had savings but I let her convince me that I was making a big mistake. I still regret that so much.

I wanted to move to Chicago for a summer because I had friends there and wanted to test it out, again, she convinced me I'd end up on the streets.

On and on, until I was 27, still living with my mom, with 20,000 in the bank, and realized I had saved enough money to rent for a year even if I couldn't find a job.  So I did the very rational (/s) thing and moved across the planet to Australia to be with my long distance boyfriend. It felt so good to tell her  I was making a choice and she could support it or not, but I would be leaving at a certain date. being across the world from her did our relationship a world of good.

So the relationship ended. He was a great guy but we just weren't working. My mom was thrilled, she never liked him, and was so supportive during this. I was heartbroken and vulnerable.

My mom  told me that whatever I chose, she would financially support 100% and I kept telling her that was bullshit, based on past broken promises, but she convinced me. My savings are dwindling. So, since I had a choice, I debated staying or going home. I've since met a guy here who is amazing and would like to give that more time, and also networking and applying for new jobs would require more than the 2 months I have left.

Staying requires me to pay for a class and get a student visa, and the class I want to take is more than I can afford. I could take a shittier one just to buy time.  I raised this to my mom, and she told me that she would only  support me if I moved back to the states. So then, I actually didn't have a choice after all? 

She told me ""you have the opportunity to move home and start a life with emotional and financial support, or stay out there, get into debt,  and be alone. Why are you choosing to sabotage yourself?""

Does this sound manipulative to you guys? I get the financial support bit- I'm not entitled to it, and can afford to stay on a shittier, cheaper course and double down on networking to make up for it, but emotional support? Should that not be unconditional? That rubbed me the wrong way. 

I told her I was looking into options to handle things myself and would inform her of my decision. I'm struggling not to make a rash choice out of anger. I don't actually expect support on going home at this point either, now that I am ungrateful.

TL;DR I  don't trust myself on this at all and I'm in a paralyzed spiral and I can't honestly tell if my mom is being manipulative or if I'm being an idiot.

What makes this especially interesting is that the developers [use AI battles to help balance the game](http://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-on-arms-origins-future-fighters-game-balance-accessible-but-deep-more/), so while it's abundantly clear that major content is done with, a few interns could probably give the functionality a UI and polish it for users within a week.

Though my internship was in a rehabilitation center for addiction, we didn't have many acutely psychotic patients... and I'm feeling not-quite-up-to-speed. Do you have any literature recommendations to help me understand it better? Many thanks!"
7low3p,2,2017-12-23,[TECH] APEX Corporation; Gathering talent,landontom,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7low3p/tech_apex_corporation_gathering_talent/,"APEX, in order to go forward with its development, we must begin to recruit new talent, Universities can wield some good results, we should seek out those with some actual talent for this stuff and hire them.

We should also set up an application form on the APEX website, allowing for individuals to apply as they wish. Internships will also help us to screen people for the job, while teaching them, so we can have some skilled workers if they hired. We can also begin to pay for certain employees to learn computer language and whatnot, in exchange for their ~~eternal~~ ~~servitude~~, long-term employment within APEX.

This will allow us to begin our development of computer parts, Processors, Graphics Cards, Hard Drives etc etc.

7lptvc,51,2017-12-23,"Have you ever been pressured to ""come out"" by your friends who already knew?",xfrostyy97,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7lptvc/have_you_ever_been_pressured_to_come_out_by_your/,"Hey guys,

Sorry for posting a couple times in the past few days; sort of new to Reddit so I am not too familiar with the etiquette. Anyway, I sort of wanted feedback for something I've been dealing with as of late (this is a very condensed version of the story but, again, sorry if it is a bit on the longer side).

In short, I came out to one of my friends in April 2016 when I was an 18-year-old college freshman. She was one of the first people I told so it was not a super-fun experience. She was super-accepting and whatever but over the next few days/weeks she kept pressuring me to tell other people in our friend group. She claimed she needed ""someone to talk to"" about the whole situation (since I guess I was not enough) which was sort of weird but I kind of ignored her pleas; I really did not feel emotionally ready to come out to anyone else so I more or less deflected. 

Throughout sophomore year of college, I would sort of tell her about my struggles and maybe even talk about my (albeit mostly boring) Grindr sexcapades. She would sort of half-heartedly listen. She kept telling me about other people in our class who were coming out, hinting that I should follow suit. I think she was sort of being impatient and trying to get me to come out but, again, I told her I didn't really feel comfortable in my own skin so I sort of would rather stay put for the time being. 

Fast-forward to the tail end of our sophomore year. We're in a large group of people and we start drinking at an off-campus party. The music is loud and I admittedly don't remember exactly what I we were talking about but basically she motioned towards some guy and mentioned he was gay and I more or less said ""cool"" and tried to drop the subject. She then turns to me and says ""I don't get it. What's the big fucking deal? My brother came out and he's only 15. X, Y, and Z came out and they're in the same boat. You're such a fucking coward."" 

Needless to say, I was both livid and incredibly hurt. I left the party - leaving my group of friends behind - and alone made the 20-minute trek back to my dorm at 2am. The walk actually took probably over an hour because I had to sit down and just think for at least 30 minutes. I won't go into any further details, but it was absolutely terrible. I think this event really set me back quite a bit in terms of my coming out process; it made me feel incredibly guilty for being (as she put it) a ""coward.""

She kept calling me for the rest of the night but I deliberately denied any form of contact. The next day she texted me, apologized, and said that we should catch up at dinner. I went to dinner, she admitted she was wrong, apologized, and I more or less put her on probation. 

We more or less ignored the situation for the rest of the summer. I even went to visit her overnight after the year ended and everything was pretty fun. We would also talk on the phone most nights over the summer since we had similar commute times from our internships in separate cities. Things seemed to be good.

This past semester (Fall of Junior Year), things got sort of weird. Again, I'll spare some of the more complex details but basically she showed absolutely no interest in my emotional well-being even if I would try to open up the door to my current experiences and struggles. She would mostly gripe about her academic/personal stress which is fine but it definitely felt like a one-way street. Her behavior, however, was also somewhat aggressive. For instance, she would always sort of call me out in groups if I said I had plans but didn't specify what I was doing (which I assume is sort of a dig at me because they were sometimes Grindr hookups). It felt like she was almost trying to out me or at least put me in an uncomfortable situation where I would out myself. I purposefully distanced myself from her and that is sort of where we stand. 

I'm not exactly sure what I hoped to gain from relaying my story, but it was at the very least cathartic to write it all down. I do, however, still have a couple questions:

Has anyone had similar experiences with a straight friend? If so, what did you do?

Is there anything I should do to reconcile the situation? Or should I just sort of move away from the friendship? 

Why do some people think coming out ""isn't a big deal""? I recognize that it may not be a big deal to some people, but it at least feels like a big deal to me. Is this grievance a common experience (and subsequent name-calling) I should expect in the future should I choose to come out? 

Sorry for the long post. Props to anyone who reads my story in full. I am also sorry if there are any typos or any lack of flow; I did not heavily proofread this post. 

Lastly, I recognize I'm sort of a ""late bloomer"" when it comes to this whole process but I hope I can get some level of support/advice through Reddit since my last post went relatively well. 

Thanks as always."

7lqfvc,1,2017-12-23,M4A - TV Comedies (and Other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7lqfvc/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7lrcy5,1,2017-12-23,[F4A] It Started So Innocently,AthletesLonelyWife,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7lrcy5/f4a_it_started_so_innocently/,"Who would have thought it would have gotten to this point? With his cum deep inside of my womb and it dripping down my legs as I desperately rub my thighs together. It didn't help he took my panties so now I was trying my best to not let his dripping cum show on my inner legs and doing an awful job about it. Not to mention he always had such big thick loads. 

It all started so innocently with my work husband. One of my mentors until I got a position similar to his. We worked together on a lot of projects and always stayed late supporting each other. Everyone called me his work wife, him my work husband. Both of us had spouses back at home who we loved dearly. Part of the reason why I was questioning how this happened. 

First it was a little to much to drink at the holiday employees only party. A little flirtatious and a lot of spilling secrets. I barely remember a lot of what I said that night but I remember someone feeling up my ass all night. This led me to tell my work husband alone in the emergency stairwell. He laughed and kissed me before leaving me stunned and oddly turned on. 

Then it was a happy hour get together with some of our other co workers. I was to drunk to drive home so I caught a ride with who else but the work husband. Just before I got out of his car he whipped his dick out and forced it down my throat. I swallowed his cum and he kicked me out leaving me standing on the curb. It all happened so quickly. 

Next was the visits to my desk. Thankfully I had an office because when he came by he stood behind me and whispered to take my panties off. I looked up in shock but all he did was grab my shoulder and squeeze hard before I whimpered and did just that. He grabbed them, pocketed it and left me with a soaking wet pussy. 

It only got worse from there. Blowjobs while he was on the phone, quickies in the stairwells, late night doggies over his desk. These were all risky but manageable. I couldn't even count how many times he made me cum in the months this was going on. Not to mention how many panties he took from me. 

Now it was in the filing room. Another pair of panties lost to him. His cock drilling me deep from behind as I try not to scream out in pleasure. A flood of my juices spraying between my legs as he leaves a nice heavy load of cum inside of me. He slaps my ass and zips himself up before leaving. I knew I only had a minute or two to be presentable. He's been sending in the interns quicker and quicker after he left. It was nerve wracking, almost getting caught, heart breaking to cheat on my husband, but I couldn't deny it. 

I was his bitch. "

For M: Looking for ""Straight"" Guys Who Love Big Cock.",out_and_kinda_about,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ls1j2/21_m4a_for_f_older_femaleyounger_male_buying_your/,"Working on a few new prompts. These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

_____________________________________________________________

For F: A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.

___________________________________________________________

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.

Here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

I'm a college student, and just finished my Spring semester.  I'm about to start an internship for the summer, and will need to cover rent at a new place.  I'm in need of a loan of about $600 to cover the first month's rent, and am willing to repay $650 by the end of next month (6/30/16).  I've used Google wallet for loans on here before, but since Google is ending support for that, I'm open to Paypal or bank transfer.

I've lurked, and posted here on and off since I broke off into IT from Marketing.. Well, I did a semester of classes, got an internship through a professor, and the other day got offered a contract for a job I [don't entirely] think I'm qualified for. It's for a massive organization [15,000+ employees] and to be honest I'm a little nervous. I was completely transparent about my experience and lack thereof, but they still gave it to me.

So, here's my main question: what should I bring with me on my first day? I already plan on taking tons of notes by hand (not sure if they'd allow my tablet+pen combo) - but beyond that im not sure. 

Thanks guys, not only for the advice you all spread that helped me get here, but also for the advice soon to come!

7ltl1t,20,2017-12-24,"""Twas the Night Before Christmas""",Lil_GAAP,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7ltl1t/twas_the_night_before_christmas/,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all thro' the audit room,
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The work papers were completed and filed with care,
In hopes that the audit soon would be done,
The auditors were nestled all snug in the audit room,
While visions of shabooya danced in their heads 

And the manager in her Moreno Polo, and I in my PwC cap,
Had just settled our brains from a long hard day,

When out on the lot there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the audit room to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave the lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a large sleigh and eight diverse auditors,

With a shiny smiled driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Tim.
More rapid than interns his coursers they came,

And he whistled and shouted and called them by name
“Now, Martyn! Now, Miles! Now, Jim! Now, Mohamed!
On, Mark! On, Maria! On, Amity and Vicki” 
To the top of the warehouse, to top of the shelf!
Now, count away! Count away! Count away! All!”

As drunk on Kool Aid as new hires before the first day,
When they meet with an obstacle, saly it away,
So up to the warehouse-top the coursers they flew,
With the wagon full of swag and St. Tim, too.

And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof
The dancing and prancing of each foot,
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Tim came with work life mix.

He was dressed business casual from head to toe
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of goodies he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack.

His teeth they twinkled! His hair, how perfect!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow,
And the residue on his face was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pen he held tight in his teeth,
And the PwC difference, it encircled his head like students at Elevate.
He was slim and slander, a right jolly old auditor,

And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.
A sip of Kool Aid, and a big smile,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And sent all of the confirmations turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a ooh saucy, up the chimney he went,

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a roll call,
And away they all flew, like a senior to private,
But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight,

“Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good audit!”"
7ltqx6,2,2017-12-24,I’ve been feeling so numb all the time.,unicornasfuck,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7ltqx6/ive_been_feeling_so_numb_all_the_time/,"Ever since about two months ago in the midst of midterm season when I decided to really try harder in my classes (probably the hardest I’ve tried, really — I went to the library pretty much every night til ~2:30am), I’ve been feeling so numb. It’s like the feeling when you’re still high from getting really high the day before (lol), except I’m definitely not on any drugs or medication whatsoever right now as I’m home for winter break and I’m still feeling so numb. Everything is so tiring. I still do things to try to get out of this fog like cook, walk with my dog, exercise, play the piano, etc. I read that high levels of stress can cause this kind of numb feeling but I’m not even in school right now. I guess I’m stressed about finding internships and other “adult” things, but I feel like even though I’m on break I’m just so... numb. 

It got really bad a while back for a few days or so — I made some notes about it too because I was so worried. I kept dissociating and zoning out and feeling like I wasn’t living in reality. That’s kind of the numbness I feel all the time but not to a super concerning extent like the time that I made the notes. It probably has to do with my anxiety/depression, but it’s just so weird because I don’t think I’ve ever experienced this sensation to this extent until a few months back. 

I don’t really know what to do about it, and I’ve told a few of my friends about it but I don’t think they’ve had this issue. Has anyone else felt like this/is anyone else currently feeling this way?"
7lv4u9,3,2017-12-24,Advice on starting a career in Korea,q1ce,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/7lv4u9/advice_on_starting_a_career_in_korea/,"So I visited Seoul a little over a year ago and fell in love with the place. Since then I've been giving a lot of thought about moving to Korea for the long-haul after I graduate (I'm currently a final year undergrad student in the US).     
  
I've been mulling over my options for starting a career in Korea and could use some input from the good folks here. As of now, my life’s goal is pretty much to land a stable job (that I don’t hate), in Seoul, with enough income potential to (comfortably?) support a future family  

Here are the options I've come up with:  
  
1. Teaching English - the most obvious choice with the lowest barrier to entry. I'm not against teaching but I'm hesitant to go down this path because I'm unsure about long term prospects like financially supporting a future family  
  
2. Doing an engineering/compsci master’s degree in Korea – I think this is a safe but expensive and study-intensive route. I’ve been told that there’s little point in doing a master’s degree in Korea if it’s not from a top university, so I’ve been looking at Yonsei, Hanyang, Korea U, SNU. Hopefully I am a competitive applicant for these places, I currently study electrical engineering at relatively good school with a ~3.2/4.0 GPA. I have a few thousand saved up from my internships and I am lucky enough to be graduating with zero debt, but still, the tuition/housing costs are intimidating. There’s a good chance a family member could financially assist me but how much is uncertain atm. I would also have to reach TOPIK 3 before I could start a master’s program (currently around TOPIK 1 level). I’ve been looking into scholarships but it’s hard to gauge how likely I am to qualify for these as there are virtually no statistics available. KGSP would be ideal of course (I will apply and see what happens), but I feel like there are bound to be way more competitive applicants than me applying from the US, so I am not banking on getting this.   
  
3. Self-teaching software engineering and looking for a job - I have a strong math background and some experience programming already, so I'm confident I could self-teach myself the CS concepts necessary for work as a software engineer. However, I am unsure of how long it would take for me to become a viable hire. At least a year of hard studying and projects probably, especially if I am studying Korean at the same time. I would ideally like to get to Seoul asap, so the downsides to this path are the year of amount of prep time and uncertain probability of employment (not sure how competitive the software job market is in Korea). I would probably be looking at western companies with branches in Seoul as I doubt my Korean would be good enough for anything else.   
  
4. Working in the US and coming to Korea later – I have a job offer from a major US telecom, so I could start working right after I graduate, save some money, continue to study Korean, and pray I can land a relevant job in Korea after I get some experience and acquire the language skills. The obvious downsides to this are the potential years I would have to wait before moving to Korea (although I could probably visit a couple times a year) and the uncertainty of finding a relevant job.   
  
Any thoughts are appreciated. Happy holidays

7lvlcv,16,2017-12-24,"Latest RSD Intel: Papa's current tactics against Todd, Max caught shit-talking Todd again",PickupTorrents,pickup,https://www.reddit.com/r/pickup/comments/7lvlcv/latest_rsd_intel_papas_current_tactics_against/,"Interns who work for Papa have it in their normal duties to defend him online. Recently, he made his interns post pictures of him and his wife to show her off, until she found out, and then she got PISSED, then Papa made his interns delete all the pictures. 

If you're curious, here's one of the places it was posted on one of the now deleted RSDnation threads

https://www.google.com/search?biw=1280&amp;bih=649&amp;tbs=qdr%3Aw&amp;ei=57k_Wpy0L8WM0gKu56aoDw&amp;q=%22papa+and+his+beautiful+wife%22%2C+site%3Arsdnation.com&amp;oq=%22papa+and+his+beautiful+wife%22%2C+site%3Arsdnation.com&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...8068.8794.0.9369.3.3.0.0.0.0.98.277.3.3.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.Ub8RQdzqIT4

If you're curious to know what she looks like. . . she's about as good looking as Papa is . . . that's all I'm going to say about that. 

I'm not going to release her picture into the public, because even I know that's going too far since she's not a public figure, unlike her stupid fucking idiot husband of hers. But if you're someone I trust you can PM and I'll send it to you if you're very curious to see it. 


--------

Papa is claiming that Todd embezzled a shit-ton of money from RSD, and that it was RSD who is suing Todd. Papa is linking this page as proof

https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/3YGZ3UA/VanDeHey_v_Real_Social_Dynamics_Inc_et_al__nvdce-17-02230__0023.25.pdf

This is actually 1 document from the lawsuit Todd initiated on RSD. Google the case number on the document, it leads this

https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20171005i22

The lawsuit Todd initiated. Fucking Papa. Did he not think people wouldn't google the case number?

I haven't read it all the way, but geeze a lot of it is garbage. He talks about 'Todd is living off the reputation he got from Vegas Immersion'. No, it was actually Todd who make Vegas Immersion so reputable, and it is RSD and Luke who are living off it is, by not doing any work on it, and letting their unqualified free interns do all the work, as mentioned in my previous posts. 

A lot of this contains new dirt on RSD. Like many major credit cards refusing to do business with RSD, probably because of all the scam bootcamps and immersions, and they had to create an front-LLC just to process payments. 

That being said, Papa has some strong points of his own, at least in the context he puts them it. Interested to see how Todd responded. This was filed on 9/6/17, so Todd probably responded a long time ago. There's probably a reason why Papa is releasing only this document, and nothing else. 

----

Max caught shit talking Todd again.

People are leaving comments about Todd and mass disliking all RSD videos in response to all the dislikes Papa purchased for Todd's channel. In response to one comment on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnYlzPf1rmg

Max replied with 

""I don't know what ""RSD"" did to Todd, I don't know what kind of argument there is between Todd, Nick and Owen. I'm just tryna pimp and give value. I'm not 100% familiar with the details and quite frankly I'm not interested in it.

I'm distancing myself from shittalking back and forth, I don't want to associate my channel with that kind of negative energy and prefer hustle and game over gossip and negativity. 

I personally wish **Todd all the best, apparently he had been involved in some illegal activity - but ey, I smoke weed, that's illegal too in some countries, so who gives a damn and hope to see him in a good mood next time our paths cross!**

For this channel: I will continue to post (hopefully) good shit on my Youtube, IG, Snap, FB and Twitter. I believe in value, fun and hot girls and hope you guys can profit from it!

That being said, take action and GG,
Max﻿

""

This is a hilariously weak attempt to shit-talk Todd without seemingly like he did. He's trying to use a tactic of insinuating something damming against Todd, then coming up with a justification of why it's not a big deal. Max is trying to manipulate his readers into making it look like he doesn't care and that he doesn't think lower of Todd's character, while disparaging Todd character. It's a poor-man's version of what Tyler did in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpwTmbd00VY&amp;t=284s . A very poor-man's version. 

And this all came after the line ""I'm distancing myself from shittalking back and forth, I don't want to associate my channel with that kind of negative energy and prefer hustle and game over gossip and negativity."" Directly after. 

Btw, he sure seems to know what Todd did in this video 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsLQpf6QcEc

Max seems to be in full lick-papa's-asshole mode. Max's character definitely dropped several notches after the first time he hung out with RSD-Derek. He's in 'being an evil is cool' mode, which happens to a lot of weak minded people when they hangout with RSDDerek for the first time. To his credit, Derek makes being evil seem really cool. 

Other strong minded people, like Manwhore (has criticized his garbage principles), do not fall into his frame.

For one, there's this internship application that I've been procrastinating on that I just turned in. It's for what is essentially an IT position, although I'm not really qualified for it. I'm really banking on getting the internship, and subsequently working there after I graduate. I don't really have any other direction at the moment in my professional career.
Also my mom asked me to work on her website for her organization, but I'm struggling to find the motivation to work on it. Anyway, at least I turned the application in. It's just hard to enjoy what should be off-time when I have all of this stuff to worry about. I've spent most of my break thus far ruminating and browsing reddit instead of doing things I might actually enjoy. "
7lvsf9,1,2017-12-24,Some questions about internships in China,all_thetime,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/7lvsf9/some_questions_about_internships_in_china/,"Some background information, I am an American Computer Science major trying to get an internship in China over the summer.  I've already studied abroad and China, and by the end of next semester will have taken three years of Chinese.  I also have worked a job in a Japanese restaurant in the US run by Chinese people who barely spoke English, so I would say although I am by no means fluent in Chinese, I can certainly get by in a work environment.

So I have been looking for internships in China, and for all the non English teaching internships, it seems like you have to pay to get one.  This is a scam right?  Why would I pay 3000$ to go to China and program for them?  

As for English teaching internships, I have heard from an alumni from my uni who lives in China that I can get a higher paying internship than the ones advertised for non Chinese speaking westerners, but how would I go about doing that?  Do you know of any non scam/fishy looking websites or connections for either English or other internships that expect you to know some Chinese and compensate you accordingly?  Or is that too unreasonable?"
7lwny0,142,2017-12-24,How I passed all 4 parts of CPA exam in 4 months with 90+ scores: my modified Becker strategy [USA],ldavis300a,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7lwny0/how_i_passed_all_4_parts_of_cpa_exam_in_4_months/,"From my post a few days ago I gathered there was a lot of interest in hearing my study strategy. Instead of replying to every comment and message individually, I thought it would just be easier to type out a new post and explain everything. This is going to be a bit long and I'm sure this won't work for everyone but I am going to explain how I studied and passed the CPA exam while in my senior year of college (if you just want my Becker strategy, read the bullet points).

Although I was a few points shy of the Elijah Watt Sells award, these were my scores (in the order I took the exams).

**FAR - 93**
**BEC - 96**
**AUD - 98**
**REG - 90** 

Just a little background to begin - I was a Big 4 busy season intern my third year of college. It ended in March 2017 and I realized I did not have school or work until the end of August 2017. I wanted to work on getting the CPA exam done in this time frame since I knew I wouldn't have nearly as much free time once I started working full-time. Although I am based out of PA, I applied through New York's state board since New York doesn't require a bachelor's degree to sit for the exam. New York only requires 120 credits and a few core classes in accounting to sit for the exam - to actually get licensed you need a degree and 150 credits. I registered for all 4 parts at once to save money on the application fee and began really studying around the beginning of June, and I will just transfer my license back to PA after I graduate.

I used Becker to study for the exam. Took some trial and error to figure out what worked for me, but to maximize my efficiency this was my study strategy:

* Watch the lecture at 1.5X speed and mark up my book accordingly
* Do the corresponding skills practice exercise, but I would skip the video lecture and explanation. I would only watch the explanation video if I was totally lost where the answer came from.
* Do the corresponding MC questions for the first time
* Do the SIMS at the end of each module
* Go to the next module and repeat

On a rare occasion I would skip a lecture altogether and go directly to the skills practice/MC but this was for topics in which I was extremely comfortable as I had just covered it in school (a few economics and cost accounting modules).

After I had gone through the entire book once, this was my review strategy:

* Quickly skim over a module in the actual textbook and look at my notes/key concepts, obviously spending more time in modules where I felt less comfortable. I did not watch the lectures a second time.
* Do the skills exercise a second time immediately after reading a module, skipping some of the skills exercise that were extremely long (some financial statement analysis skills practices just seemed too detailed to be worth practicing)
* Do **ALL** the MC questions a second time
* After I did a MC section for the second time, I would keep answering the incorrect questions until I had 100% correct for the module
* Answer the supplemental MC questions for the first time, continuing through until I had 100% correct
* Do the SIMS for a second time (skipping some extremely long SIMS to save time)

After I had done all the above, I would do the practice exams. I did not treat the practice exams as an actual exam - I would use my regular calculator as it helped me move faster and on occasion I would look up a topic in the book if I was totally lost. For me, guessing on a question and not knowing the correct answer until the exam was finished would just confuse me on test day as I struggled to remember which answer was correct. I would put down my best guess and then Google/look up the correct answer just so I had the immediate verification if my answer was correct or incorrect.

For the BEC exam, I did not actually do the writing prompts on the practice exam as they are not graded by Becker's software. I just read the question and then quickly thought about what I would say, then read Becker's solution to see how close I was. I am a skilled writer though so I just knew I didn't need to practice this.

Even though I had the flashcards, I never even opened them. I don't learn from flashcards and only got them because they were included for me. I also never used the progress tests.

A lot of people ask me how much time I spent studying - this is an area where I certainly had an advantage since I know many of you are working full-time or in school while studying. Since I had finished my internship and did not have class over the summer, I would go to the library from 11am-5pm every Monday-Thursday (obviously adjusting my schedule if something came up but on a normal week this is what I would do). I would take Friday-Sunday off to hang out with my friends, go out to the bars (first summer as a 21yo so gotta take advantage), and I would work Saturday &amp; Sunday mornings/afternoons at my previous summer job just to have some spending money. I tried to study 4 days a week for most of the day but I was quick to rearrange my schedule if something better appeared.

I took FAR in early July after studying for approximately 1.5 months. I took BEC in early August after a little over 3 weeks of studying - I actually moved up my exam by a week because I felt like I was ready sooner than expected. 
I took AUD in early September after approximately a month of studying (I had started school in this timeframe as well so I had to balance that too)
I took REG on the last possible day before my NTS expired in early October after a month of studying.

Since I had to study all of REG while also in school full-time, I would just study from when class ended until roughly 9:00 Monday-Thursday. I still gave myself weekends off as I just needed some time for myself and I wanted to enjoy my final year of college. I'm a bit disappointed as I would have got the EWS award (and a huge bonus) if I got a 95 on REG, but I'm still content that I passed with a 90 and didn't kill my social life in the process.

I think this covered my strategy and most of the questions/PMs that I received after my last post. If I missed anything or if someone wants a further explanation, please just comment here and I'll try to answer so that everyone can see (instead of answering a bunch of different PMs).

Best of luck to everyone working towards their CPA and it really isn't as scary as it seems if you can use your study time efficiently!!


Edit: I also had Becker's Final Review but I did not really use that. I would just do the MC questions from the review (I believe there are a few hundred) for additional practice and then on test day I would skim through the book at lightning speed just for a quick reminder of everything but I did not read the book or listen to the lectures or anything like that."

I did my first one of these internships last year, and moved 600+ miles and got my own apartment for the time I was there. During that time, my parents let me use their car. I’m about to start my second internship with a new company this time, and I will be working really close to home. My parents have decided that they can’t let me use their car again this time (which I don’t fault them for), and instead planned on me moving back home and using the money I will save to pay for a car. I don’t really want to move back in with them, our relationship has been strained since I first moved out, but I can’t afford my own place and a car right now. 

My parents are rather religious, and when they found out that my girlfriend (3 months) and I were having intimate relations, they were upset. They asked if we were willing to commit ourselves to eachother if she became pregnant, and we both answered yes. We are completely committed, and have both agreed we want to get married after I get my degree. 

My parents haven’t been willing to accept that we know we want to get married to eachother, We’ve had a number of arguments, where they keep insisting that I can’t know what I want, much less who I want to spend my life with. The problem is, now I’m supposed to move back in, I don’t have any other options financially right now, and things don’t seem to be improving. 

I’m not sure what I should do.

TL;DR Parents won’t accept my girlfriend and I want to spend our lives together, and I have to move back in.

My hobbies for the last 4 years have been programming, networking, and general other computer stuff. 

I have a reputation at my school because of this. 

One day a recruiter came in and was talking about the army to my class. She said something about computer science and everyone looked at me. She said she wanted to talk to me. So I did a little bit and I kind of want to join. 

If I don't join my plans are probably to go to college and get my degree, try and intern for IT and start my career after college.

Joining sounds like a great idea, but I love living by my family, and I kind of worry about the ASVAB. I'm really good with computers. That's kind of it. I'm decent at math and science. I'm not in the best physical shape either. I'm not fat, but cardio is for sure not my thing. 

Do you guys think I should join? Would it be worth it for me to join, and how likely would it be to score 105 (the minimum to be a cyber network defender) on the ASVAB?"

I’ve been involved with HCI research for two semesters now, and am also a UI/UX intern for the tech help department at my school. I’ve also taken an intro computing class, an upper level cs class for user experience design, human factors, engineering psychology and a lot of other coursework in anthropology and psychology (and have gotten only A’s and B’s in all those courses!). I’ve also secured letters from my research professor, another professor in HCI at a different institution that I collaborated with one summer, and my Human factors professor who got his PhD in HCI from Georgia Tech. I had a few severe personal issues that I will touch on in my personal statement to address my low GPA, but do you guys think I have a shot at a masters program??

7lxshg,5,2017-12-24,Snowfall (Prequel to Helltown Pt. V),blackfridayswitch13,DrCreepensVault,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/7lxshg/snowfall_prequel_to_helltown_pt_v/,"[Fiction] [Note: this is a stand alone creepypasta and also prequel to Helltown Experiments Part V] 

I, Louisa Mareno, had always been a ten. I stood wearing my best winter boots black with spiked heels and tight leather pants.  I wore a pink winter sweater and my long black hair hung down my back. I didn’t have a single dark hair out of place and my skin was freshly moisturized and contoured.  My long acrylic nails were painted in a little winter design to match my sweater.  It was crucial I looked above my very best.  Tonight, had meant so much to my friend. I stood watching the snow as it fell outside of the 3rd story window of the law firm I worked at downtown Cleveland.  I had so much to do and as of 2 months ago our secretary, Karen, had gone missing.


It was almost Christmas and as much as I wanted to enjoy the season I felt so guilty even thinking about enjoying any part of it with my friend out there somewhere.  I hoped she had just run off with a new guy.  We often joked in the office that we may someday win the lottery and move to the Caribbean complete with sexy cabana guys holding out drinks to us as we tanned on the beaches.  I knew something awful had happened to her.  It was the same gut instinct my grandma had when she knew a storm was coming when she grew up in Puerto Rico. I didn’t want to think about all the bad things that could have happened to Karen. Kidnapping, rape or worse. I shivered when my mind wandered.

  
The last time I had seen or heard from her was during our last salsa dancing class.  The instructor, Ramon, had kept Karen after class to talk to her about the last date they had gone on.  Karen was infatuated with Ramon, at least I thought she was.  Ramon also disappeared after Karen disappeared and for a while we thought they had run off together.  I spoke to the cops, but they didn’t want to get involved because Karen was 31 years old.  As an adult there was no reason to worry unless there was a reason.  A few weeks later Ramon was found in Miami after it was found he was out of town to take care of his mom who had become ill.  It was a dead end to me and I still had no idea where my friend was.


I watched as the snow fell softly and the lights from the city traffic below me glittered in what was left of the sunlight. I got a knock at the door and it was our intern, Rachel, with my basket of donations for a silent auction that was being held at the Greyson ballroom.  It was a silent auction and dinner with Santa, only the person I planned it with would not be there. It was originally Karen’s idea and I was totally against the idea, but she insisted it would be good to raise some money for new coats for needy children in the area.


I sighed and thanked Rachel for bringing me the basket.  I grabbed my coat and picked up the basket to take to the Greyson.  Just as I was leaving I got a call from an unknown number. I hit ignore and walked out the door. 


I got to my car and drove away hitting the highway on this afternoon faster than usual.  I jammed out to some hip-hop music and trying to relax as I sped down the highway.  I kept driving and then traffic slowed down to a dead stop.  I had to hit my breaks hard then as the cars in front of me all flashed their red break lights. 

 
There was a jack-knifed tractor trailer in the middle lane of the highway so in my typical fashion I had to find a faster way to get where I was going.  I turned on my GPS app on my phone and it directed me to get off at the next exit and to take the back road to my destination.  As I was turning off the highway I got another unknown call and again I hit ignore.  It had to be a wrong number either way I was too busy to care and in a bit of a hurry. 

 
The Greyson needed the items by 6 o’clock and it was already a quarter after five. I pulled off the highway and as I was sitting at the red light to turn left off the highway I checked my hair.  It was perfect as usual, and I didn’t want to have one hair out of place.  This silent auction meant the world to me and I was doing it to make Karen proud. I had to look perfect, not that it was hard. I had always been a bit high maintenance.  I was in beauty pageants from the time I was 4 years old up until I was a senior in college. 


I turned off the highway and began my long drive which I knew would now get me to the Greyson by five after 6. I kept driving and the sun was noticeably going out of the sky.  I crossed a lane and was near the edge of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.  I hated being anywhere near this place especially in winter when the leaves were all gone off the trees.  I hurried as fast as I could down the road speeding at around 60 miles per hour. If there were no cops, I was fine. 


Something suddenly moved near my car like a streak of white fur and then I suddenly felt a jolt as my car hit something that was crossed the road in front of me.  There was no one around and I panicked as soon as I realized what I had done.  What the hell was that thing? I heard a thud as well realizing my front left tire was flat.  Oh great the one thing I could never do, change a tire on my own and now especially as I was in a hurry. I looked at my phone to call road side assistance.  I was never getting to that damn auction at the rate I was going. I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of my vehicle.  My boots with spiked heels made it hard to walk around and as I approached the right side of my vehicle, I knew based on the angle and where you would have to be to change the tired I was also risking my life. It would be too easy for a motorist to just side swipe me and I would be gone.  


“Damn it!” I said kicking my tire and then grabbing my phone to call for help.

NO SERVICE it read at the top of the phone. Wasn’t this just great. Whatever I hit better be dead if I saw it would be.  I chose to never do any good deed for this very reason.  This was Karen’s idea and now she wasn’t here to finish it, but being the caring friend and co-worker felt obligated to on her behalf. In typical fashion no good deed would go unpunished for me. I looked in the trunk for the jack and spare and as I grabbed it my acrylic nail broke off. 

    
The wind had picked up blowing directly into my frozen cheeks.  I looked away from the direction in which it was blowing to try and see in front of me.  I looked down and when I did that is when I saw them.  There were large footprints in the snow near the side of my car.  I felt a chill run up my spine and it wasn’t the temperature outside. 
 
“Shit!” I said under my breath.  Just then I noticed the snow had begun to fall much harder.  I couldn’t even attempt to change my flat here with no visibility.  I thought I saw something move in the trees.  Maybe it was a large coyote or something I told myself. I swear I could sense something watching me. I got into my vehicle just sitting there with the engine on and heat on full blast.  I turned on my blinkers and peered out my driver side window hoping to see any passerby.   I was isolated which astonished me. 


I closed my eyes and leaned back trying to take a deep breath.  I slowly opened my eyes and I pulled down my visor to look in the mirror. The wind had blown something into my eye.   White fur jumped behind my car.  I looked out the back window and realized that it was quickly becoming covered with snow and I couldn’t see out of it.  Put back up my visor and looked around feeling unsure as if I had seen what I thought.  It had happened so fast I felt like I was going crazy.  I was scared now not knowing what it was, and I hit the lock button on my car door.  
How was there not one other motorist on the road? Not one single person had come down this road in nearly 25 minutes.  I wanted to peek and see if it was still there behind the car, but my anxiety turned to fear when I heard something outside the back window of my car.  


There were foot prints becoming visible on the back of my window as they appeared like perfectly shaped foot-prints as though a cookie cutter had been used on the window in the half an inch of snow that had quickly fallen within seconds. I felt the car shake and was now rocking back and forth at the weight of whatever was crawling on top of my roof moved up the back end to the roof of my car.  


I began to pant heavily and took out my phone.  I saw 10 missed calls from an Unknown number.  What the hell was going on? My phone still had no service the calls must have came from the phone when it was on.  I didn’t hear it ring that many times.  
What the hell is on top of my car? The shaking worsened and I felt it hit the top of my car with it’s paw.  It was far to heavy to be a coyote that much I knew.


It hit my roof over and over, then my wipers that were still going full blast stopped working.  I saw two white paws grab them in each paw holding them down to keep them from moving. A slowly a shadow slowly crept up from the roof of my car down over my windshield as though something large was blocking out what sun there was still left in the sky.  Two yellow eyes appeared to look at me as it hung upside down over the windshield.  I took a deep breath and began to pray.


“Querido Padre, por favor Protégeme de este mal.” I was in shock and could not move as it looked at me.  It was something dog like and I kept my eyes on it as I held onto the large gold cross around my neck.  I looked at it and stared into its yellow eyes. Then slowly it began to grin showing its large white teeth.  I continued to pray the way my grandmother did and how she had taught me.  I couldn’t look away no matter how hard I tried it was like staring into the eyes of the devil. 

 
Just then it bounced off my roof and onto the road in front of me.  I noticed there were headlights coming toward me from behind.  The large black Pilot slowed behind me as it must have seen my blinkers.  


“Thank you, God!” I said doing the sign of the cross.


A man was getting out of the vehicle and approaching my driver side window.

“Ma’am are you okay?”

“I have a flat tire. I couldn’t change it and I can’t get any reception out here.”

The man had red hair and dark eyes.  He smiled at me politely.
“Well, I can help you with that.  Do you have a spare?”

“Yes in the trunk.” I popped the trunk and he got out the tire and the jack and then went to work on my tire. I got out of the vehicle to see if I could help in anyway but the entire time looking around for that dog creature.  

Within a few moments the flat tire was off, and the spare was on.  He smiled at me and he looked at me for a long time. “You okay? You seem a little frightened.  I can assure you I am not going to hurt you. I’m Rob Randall, Doctor Randall to some. Do you have far to go?”

“Actually no.  I am almost to my destination.” I said to him.
He was beginning to give me the creeps as he just continued to stare at me.  I felt like he was undressing me, and I was wearing 3 layers of clothes.


“Well, that is good.  Do you need anything else?” he smiled at me.

“OH, no thank you! I really appreciate it.”

“Well be careful out here on your own.  You never know what you might find out here in the middle of nowhere.”

“You have a good point.  Well I better be going now.” I said to him.

He nodded still watching me as I got into my vehicle.  I slowly pulled away and when I looked in my rearview mirror I could still see him standing there watching me.  It was dark now, but I could see his outline in the headlights of his vehicle.  He was just standing there and soon to my relief I was far from where I had been.

Just then my phone’s reception returned, and I saw I had a voicemail.  I clicked my phone to listen to it.

“Hi Louisa, this is Mary Ann with the children’s foundation of Summit County.  I just wanted you to know that we had to reschedule the dinner with Santa auction.  There is a bad storm coming and they are calling for up to a foot of snow by 6 pm.  So we plan to reschedule it for the weekend.  So no need to come down this way.”

Well that figured I thought to myself.  I was still shaken up by what had happened that evening and there was something off about that doctor.  I couldn’t place it till months later I saw his face appeared on the 6 o’clock news after being wanted for the kidnap and rape of several local women.  

I couldn’t help but wonder if there was a connection to the dog man creature and that doctor.

A video game that you loved all your life, you always thought good of them, believed in them despite what others says but then reality hits you.... they hate you! Not the past company employees but the present does.... here is what I’d like to share.


I can’t get this off my mind and I need to share this. Please don’t take it as whining😒 but I want to share just how cruel and shitty the Sonic fandom is. Including how cruel Sega of America is when they side with bulliessinpmy cause they are superpopular on youtube &amp; friends with employees. Here’s the story::

I’m a brain cancer survivor since 93. During my recovery years I dealt with a lot of rejection, bullies, and hard times. Recovery was hard because I was dealing with bullies at the same time in jr high and high school. 
Fast forward to present time,bits the same type of bullies hiding behind a computer and abusing their connections to make me look like the bad guy or the losing failure.
Many Sonic fans and others in general think highly of a fanboy named TailsChannel Who simply did not like my brain tumor story and did not like me or others correcting him when he would to face his messages online. He would just go back and delete everything then play dumb. 

Well to make a long story short he and his friends made fun of my cancer story several times then he would deny it by deleting his post and acting like he didn’t do anything.
His friend Emily Jones aka TheEmuEmi popped up out of nowhere Copycatting my cosplay costume as well as contacting artist friends who had drawn previously for me Requesting the exact same picture to be drawn for her.
Because Matt was friends with her, everyone liked her and helped her out. Emily spent a good chunk of time writing a blog dedicated to slandering my name and character. 
She complained that I blocked her on Twitter and make sure to get as many people in bomb as she could to get revenge on me. 
This includes Sonic &amp; Sega FanJam banning me from their fan event, Ryan Drummond ( former voice of Sonic  breaking a promise to me anddoing voice over clips for Emily instead. 
To make it worse by trying to report this to Sager, but because tails channel wasn’t intern they didn’t listen to me because he is friends with their current PR, who also doesn’t like me.
In the past, at events like South x southwest, Aaron Webber was giving shout outs to TailsChannel favoring him as well as Emily.

Even the voice of dr. Eggman got involded, helped Matt out to get rid of me from attending the 25th anniversary party. Something stupid with said at the heat of the moment, Mike explain don’t say stuff like that, I apologize, he still reports in favor of getting me band to help his friends out.

Meanwhile a game called, Big’s Fishing Adventure 3, has voice actors Roger Craig smith and Mike pollock in the game, including Emily Jones. The girl who has been slandering my name, making up false stories about me, getting others to send me death threats, that’s OK because she is also friends with PR and employees at Sega. 
Heck Emily goes online telling others that I amHarassing her small child, claims her family doesn’t give her money to feed her kid, all the while sonic fans are sending her money for the kid. Guess how Emily spends it? On trips not to feed her kid. 
With the recent release of sonic mania, I was unable to speak to anybody who worked on again. Sega of America told everyone to block me or ignore me. They are not to speak to me.

Sega of America has made me out to be this crazy, dangerous fan who caused trouble first. But they do not address at all with their friends have done to me first. Heck an internet news reporter named Nathan Evans said he spoke to Sega of America employees and they told me to get offline and go away.    

Sega of America... you shattered my heart. You do not care what your friends do to your fans behind your back. You allow and accept bullies to harass your friends then you quickly hide the evidence or play dumb.

What a horrible company! This fandom is truly disgusting  "
7lyc7f,9,2017-12-24,Recently became a Christian. Considering dropping out of university. In need of advice.,UGDon,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/7lyc7f/recently_became_a_christian_considering_dropping/,"Hey Guys,

I recently read a blog post on how education can become an idol: https://theincompetentyouthworker.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/education-the-biggest-idol-of-our-age/#comment-391

I commented:

""Amazing post! This topic is particularly relevant to my current situation. I am prayerfully considering leaving my degree.

I’m (22/m) currently on a year-long Leave of Absence from my final year at a relatively good university. This is the second time I’ve had to take a break from uni and I’m gradually losing the motivation to study as I already know that I don’t want to work in my field of study. University has been a challenging experience for me, made harder because I chose to reject God, and I’m eager to put that chapter of my life behind me.

Since starting this second hiatus I’ve found God and have been blessed in finding a loving bible-teaching church locally. I see my church family at least twice a week and really enjoy serving our community with them.

I currently work part-time (2-3 days a week) with days off intended for study but I sometimes find myself preparing for Bible Study rather than reviewing content for my exams next May. I’m perfectly happy with this. As I begin to understand the scale of Jesus’ sacrifice for me and the opportunity I have been afforded to know God, all other ambitions pale in comparison.

The difficulties arise from two places: my own doubts and family.

Before facing personal challenges at university and taking my first break, I was doing relatively well academically. I had also spent my summers on rather competitive internship programmes at reputable companies. However, I soon realised that that wasn’t the path for me. Initially I pursued my own selfish ambitions but that left me unsatisfied and by God’s grace I’m beginning to see the importance of seeking him. When considering whether to drop out, I wonder: is my lack of motivation a sign that I’m lazy and wasting an opportunity? Is this an abuse of a God-given opportunity? There is also the fact that my younger sister (we are now in the same academic year at the same institution after my time off) would graduate at the same time as me. Inevitably, there would be comparisons and this does cause me some anxiety. I sometimes question whether this urge not to finish my degree stems from a fear of these comparisons.

Now to family. I’m a second generation African immigrant. Education as a priority was a given in our household and I identify with the idea that education, while a gift from God, can become an idol. Despite the majority of my family claiming to be Christians, I would find it hard to explain to them that I would rather work in a job that would allow me stay at home and serve my local church family. Being the oldest (and male) means there is an added weight on my shoulders. Our family was recently shaken by the loss of our mother and with an ill father all eyes are on me to be the breadwinner. Finishing my degree, though a pain, would open the door to higher paid opportunities that would allow me to support my family better financially. While to some this might seem selfless I can’t help but feel this would still be idolising comfort in this life over eternal dwelling with the Lord.

In a long-winded way (sorry) what I’m trying to say is:
– I’m considering leaving uni and getting more involved at church
– I don’t trust my perceptions
– I want to know that I’m making the decision for the right reasons
– Do you have any advice on how I can pray for this situation?
– Any tips on how I can approach this decision biblically ?

Thanks for reading this far and for speaking boldly on a an important issue.""

I wanted to open the question up to you guys.

Would really appreciate your advice. Thanks :)"
7lyjzm,2,2017-12-24,36M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7lyjzm/36m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - /r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Visitor to the porn set - Your friend is a well known porn star, and she travels the world for shoots to all sorts of glamorous places. She has taken you to a few shoots so you fully understand how in control of things she is. She surprises you with a trip to a luxurious mansion on an island where she is shooting, you have most of the time to relax but she has to work for a couple of days. On the set, one of the male performers starts chatting to you and you are finding it hard to resist.

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
7lyyrh,4,2017-12-24,My name is Jake Olson and I am running for Governor,Cakeolson,wisconsin,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/7lyyrh/my_name_is_jake_olson_and_i_am_running_for/,"Hello,

The title says it all does it not? I am new to Reddit and thought I should bring my campaign here and test the waters. My [twitter](https://twitter.com/cakeolson?lang=en) has been doing *decently* well, so I am hoping for the same here.

**Who are you?**

I am Jake Olson, a 21 year old from Madison Wisconsin. I graduated from Lafollette High School in 2015 and will be graduating from Indiana University in May of 2018 with a B.S. in Health Fitness.

I am a former Policy Intern for Governor Walker, and just a young man with a huge fascination for politics. I learned much about leading people and grew a passion for it during my time as president of my fraternity, Phi Kappa Sigma. With graduation on the horizon I decided it was time to throw my hat in the race!

**What are your takes on the issues?**

First and foremost I do not have the answer for everything, and I will be stumped sometimes. Sometimes I will need to be given time to research both sides before I can articulate a stance on a given issue. But I will always try to answer as best I can!

* Legalization of recreational marijuana  
I am not interested much in consuming the drug, it makes me too sleepy. However legalization would be a number 1 priority. Recreational Marijuana could increase tax revenue for the state, increase tourism, decrease the amount of users in jail for using a party drug, and the list goes on and on. 

* Age to consume alcohol/marijuana/tobacco  
I'm sure many of you already know, alcohol is consumed by college kids at very large amounts. And I am sure that you already know, that kids are hurting themselves because of it. Underage college students are simply drinking at house parties, woods parties, and frat houses. Instead of trying to prevent college kids from drinking all together, we should move it to more safe and regulated environments. I can promise you from experience that a college bar or restaurant is safer than my fraternity's basement. The solution I pose is we make the age to purchase and consume all of these substances 18 but also requiring a HS Diploma or GED. This would mean that you could be 30 years old, but without a HS diploma you would be unable to purchase tobacco. This would move drinking for young adults in to more regulated environments, would keep these substances out of the hands of high school students, and would require an education for you to consume. The only exception would be those without a diploma would be able to purchase marijuana for medical purposes only.

* Caloric Density tax and Nutrient Density tax  
Many state governments acknowledge that tobacco is bad for your health, but acknowledge that it is also your right as a citizen to consume that substance if you choose. To decrease tobacco use, but still allow you to use it if you choose, many states tax tobacco at a very high rate. Our government should be treating food the same way and taxing food based on how it can negativity impact your body and the health care costs of our state. Caloric density is a measurement of Calories/Volume. Lettuce is much less caloric dense than donuts. Nutrient Density is a measurement of nutrients/volume. Almonds are calorie dense but are also very nutrient dense. Foods that have low nutrient densities and have high caloric densities would be taxed higher than healthier counterparts. I love Oreo's and everyone in this state should have the right to consume them, but I also know the effect they have on my body and I should have to pay a little extra for them. This encourages people to have healthier diets, but allows you to have some treats if you wish.

* College Tuition  
College is very expensive. An easy way to allow an opportunity for cheaper tuition is requiring public universities to make personalized tuition for everyone. What a personalized tuition looks like is those students who have GPA's above average for their field of study would receive discounts from their university on their tuition, and those who are receiving below average grades for their respective fields of studies would receive surcharges on their tuition. This would encourage college students to take their studies more serious, would make Wisconsin a stronger choice for out of state students to come to school, and would reward our stronger students without hurting state financials.

**I am open to any comments or questions! I couldn't cover every issue, so those were a few that came to mind at the time.** Thank you!"
7lz33m,2,2017-12-24,My(23m) s/o(29F) was assaulted and it's causing all my doubts to bubble up,xmasadam,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7lz33m/my23m_so29f_was_assaulted_and_its_causing_all_my/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. We officially got back together on valentine's day after she broke up with me in December 2016. Before that, we'd been dating since July 2015. We've known each other for 2 and a half years. She worked at a physical therapists' office, and we met when I tore my ACL in 2015. We started dating after her internship ended. She is 29 and has finished grad school for physical therapy, I'm 23 and flunked out of college after 4 years of undergrad. I have my own room in a two-person apartment and am currently unemployed, I have been since November but I'm expecting to start working in January after a bunch of interviews. She works as a waitress and lives at home with her mom and sisters. She's told me that she doesn't have any plans to use her doctorate for a career or work in physical therapy, and part of me feel like she only got it because her mom wanted her to. 

When we broke up the first time, she was the one who broke it off, she was at school and told me she spent more time missing me than feeling happy, and I respectfully agreed with her wishes to not talk to her. At the time she was in school in St. Louis. (I live near Chicago) She started talking to me again when she was home on break and we saw each other a few times, including me staying at her apartment for a week during another internship. Both of us saw other people during our time apart but nothing serious. 

When we got back together, on valentine's day, I was the one who wanted to get back together. I told her that I loved her, something I'd previously refrained from saying at all because I had been struggling to get over someone else that I never officially dated. We kept seeing each other and talking and in March while we were on a camping trip to the beach, she asked me if I would be her boyfriend again. I said yes, I thought I'd been since February. 

We went on a little less than a week-long vacation in Tennessee with my parents this summer. We had a little bit of a fight at the end because she said she was sick of me. I've met her mom and sisters, several times, but never really had many conversations with any of them. Recently she told me that her mom has assumed that she's not dating me anymore and that she doesn't want to correct her because it's a pain to talk to her mom. In the past, she told me her mom liked me, especially compared to her previous boyfriends who have been, from what I've gathered, some pretty manipulative cheaters that just used her, and were disrespectful and dramatic.

I keep a photo of her in my wallet and photos on my bookshelf, she recently told me she got rid of the photo of me she used to have. She's told me she deletes my texts every couple days, I've never deleted her texts. She's shown me a propensity to only be completely honest with me about her feelings when she's a little drunk, and in one of those moments of honesty late this summer she ""gave me every out"" of our relationship, asking me multiple times if I wanted to just be friends that hook up. I told her frankly that wasn't what I wanted, I wanted to be her boyfriend. 

We've talked about kids and marriage, she's said she doesn't have any interest in marriage because she's skeptical about it, her mom's been married twice. She also isn't interested in having kids anytime soon. I'm interested in both of those things, although not soon, because of my own financial instability right now. She's met almost all of my closest friends and has told me that she likes them and gets along very well with them. She is introverted and I'm extroverted so sometimes I've exhausted her social battery because of wanting her to get to know my friends. I don't know any of her friends except about one guy she went to school with that really wants to date her and moved to Chicago from Tennessee just to be closer to her. 

The last few months I've seen very little of her, but we have talked about every other day. She works almost every day but only in the afternoons during the week, and gets off early at least once a weekend. It takes her about a half hour to get from work to my place, and she's always reluctant to come because she doesn't want to drive back late. But she doesn't need to drive back late, she can and usually stays here and the reason she wants to go back is so she doesn't have to explain to her mom where she was since her mom doesn't think we're together anymore. Her mom and family also use my Hulu account regularly, since I gave them the password when we started dating again in hopes she would watch more of the same shows. Her mom was out of town for a week earlier this month and I asked if I could come over and stay with her, and she was initially interested but didn't want her sister to see me, so that ended up not happening.

She's shown a puzzling refusal to accept gifts or allow me to lend her things, going as far as returning socks I lent her. When we first broke up, she threw out all the stuff of mine that she had(just clothes nbd) but now she basically refuses to let me give her anything, books, hoodies, video games, jewelry.

Yesterday she finally came over after I invited her over basically every other day for two weeks. From the beginning, she was being kind of cagey and unaffectionate, not what I expected after it'd been so long since we saw each other. We had a little wine, and I asked her if she wanted to smoke, she replied she'd just had a bad experience with smoking which surprised me because she doesn't really smoke much and has only done it a few times, with me most of those times. But I thought nothing of it and brushed it off, and we went to bed. She then decided she should go home because her family was in town and she didn't want to ignore them. She also mentioned that she'd done something bad. I didn't want her to go but also didn't want to keep her from her family. (my family lives about 600 miles away) I was curious about what bad thing she'd done and assured her she could tell me and I'd prefer she tell me especially after saying that because I could only worry more than whatever had actually happened. I said if she didn't tell me I was assuming she was pregnant somehow AND dying. She said, no, it wasn't anything crazy like that. But that she'd gone to a 21-year-old co-worker's house earlier that week. They'd started drinking, and he'd convinced her to smoke, then they drank some more, than they smoked some more, with him pressuring her to keep up. I could already tell where the story was going, having had a lot of female friends experience similar things in college, including the girl I had been in love with previously. She said that the next day she woke up with no memory of what happened and no pants or underwear, in bed with the guy. She didn't feel weird or sore but her IV birth control was gone as well. She left without finding her underwear or BC device before the guy woke up. She told me I'm the only person she's told.

I assured her that she hadn't done anything bad and that I wasn't upset with her. I told her that I know dozens of other friends male and female that have gone through similar things. I made it clear that if I was upset at all it was for her. I told her that the guy sounds like a real creep and that he should have been a better host and that what he'd done was taking advantage of her. She kept trying to justify his actions but I refused to let her, I made it clear that whatever happened, legally, was not her fault, she was definitely too cross-faded to give any kind of consent and whatever this guy did was not because of her actions, so I didn't blame her at all. Eventually, she felt better and we went back to bed, and I went down on her and she fell asleep afterward. 

Laying in bed next to her was the most excruciating three hours of my life in a long time. I was completely full of emotion and she was completely asleep, but anytime I went to move she would wake up enough to ask me not to leave. I wanted to go track this guy down and destroy him, or at least work out some of the adrenaline. She woke me up to say she was leaving early this morning after I finally fell asleep. It was snowing, and I've asked her numerous times to please let me know whenever she gets home because she makes such a big deal out of having to drive. But she almost never does and I always have to text her to ask her if she made it home. I haven't spoken to her since I asked her if she got home safe and she told me she did. When she left, she said ""See you next year, maybe""

I don't know what to do or think right now. I'm an emotional mess and I'm alone. I've seen first hand how this kind of trauma can hurt someone I care about and I'm so worried about the potential damage to her. I'm furious and want to go to her work and attack this guy. But I'm also profoundly hurt. It's one thing to not want to tell your mom details of your life but I feel like she probably doesn't tell anyone that we're dating. And she makes such a big fuss about coming to my place where I make her feel at home and cook for her and then she's happy to go to some fucking 21 year old's place to get fucked up with him.

I just... I don't know what I see in the future. I don't really see anything, and she definitely doesn't have any plans. Which would be fine if she didn't seem so ashamed or hesitant to be in the present with me, and she obviously doesn't think about the past much since she won't keep anything from texts to trinkets. Am I just freaking out her because my girlfriend got sexually assaulted and there are a few red flags in our relationship? How should can I talk to her about this without making her feel bad?

TL;DR After three years of on-again-off-again relationship, my GF(29) told me she was sexually assaulted, and the circumstances have served as a catalyst for my(23m) doubts about the relationship."
7lzn3o,18,2017-12-24,I fucked up really badly at UBC and now I need some advice,Sorietei,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/7lzn3o/i_fucked_up_really_badly_at_ubc_and_now_i_need/,"Honestly right now I'm in full blown panic mode and I need a bit of guidance, especially since arts advising is temporarily closed for the holidays.

To put it straight, I fucked up my undergrad. I'm currently a 5th year student majoring in an arts major with a 72% cumulative average (my major gpa is way over a 3.0 however) that was the result of me doing badly in some math intensive majors because before I was planning on going into Sauder or Science. I'm the exact person who shouldn't be in university at all. In fact I think employers would much rather hire serial killers over me based on how badly I did in uni. I had a major procrastination problem and the death of a person I was close to during my 4th year really started making matters worse.

Seriously if someone built a time machine in the future I would be the first in line to use it.

I know what you're all thinking: ""holy fuck this guy is a total loser."" And you know what, I agree with you. I am a total loser and probably should off myself. But I'm terrified of committing suicide. I've heard so many horror stories about people attempting suicide and absolutely failing at it, which often caused them to develop painful injuries or even landed them in a state of paralysis.

So suicide is out of the question. All I can do now, is go up. But I need some advice first.

So a little bit of background info about myself. As I said I'm in my 5th year finishing off a degree in geography and my cpga is a 2.95 (though my major one is above a 3.0). Originally I wanted to transfer into Sauder but got rejected and as a result I went with geography in an attempt to enter the GIS field and make that a career of mine (though that seems to have failed since I failed to maintain an internship in the field and with the one I did manage to secure, my supervisor had to leave within 2 weeks after it began). I do have some experience in the working world. Right now I'm doing an internship (for a non-profit organization so I'm not getting paid for it) and I've worked two part time jobs in the past (one during a winter term of my 4th year and the other during the summer of 2017). And I've got some volunteering experience too. In my 3rd and 4th years I actually did manage to get my gpa well over a 3.0 but sadly it all tumbled back down to a 2.95 after I found out what I got for comm 457 (I was planning to enroll in the Diploma of Accounting program after I graduated). I felt devastated in the end. To make matters worse I passed the course which means I cannot retake it to obtain a better grade. 

So I'm graduating in May 2018. However I was wondering if I should delay my graduation (to maybe November for instance) to pursue a higher gpa or should I just graduate? Frankly I still have time to raise my gpa next term and I'm taking 5 courses just in case. But I don't know how high it could go. I don't even know if its even possible to raise it to a 75%. At this point I don't even want to consider graduate school or working at some big 4 corporation. I just want a job that actually pays my bills so I could be independent in the future. I don't know how much employers value gpa but I've heard that if its below a 3.0 then they will always tend to screen you out. It turns out that gpa only doesn't matter after its above a 3.0 (which is a 73% in UBC).

That's pretty much all the advice I'm asking for. This isn't a pity thread and I merely created this to ask how I can climb out of this hellhole. I know there's an uphill battle ahead of me and I'm willing to fight through it.

As for why I'm a fifth year, the reason is because I changed majors and needed to take some classes to make up for it. 

TLDR: I was on track to getting a cgpa of over 3.0 but effed up during the first term of my fifth year in one of my courses that caused it to drop significantly. Now I need to know if its better to delay my graduation to raise my gpa or just graduate. "
7lzsur,14,2017-12-25,the truth,dextu,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7lzsur/the_truth/,"I've abused weed for 4 years, starting when I first moved into university in January 2014. I was always a quiet kid, and I kept to myself most of the time. I had difficulty fitting in anywhere in school up until this point, and was constantly hassled by my peers. I wasn't the best at interacting with other people, and had only a handful of close friends for most of my life. I was introduced to weed through one of those friends, and I was hooked instantly. Living at uni made the access easy and I could smoke whenever I wanted obviously. I don't think my newly un-sheltered self really understood the consequences as I quickly spent every dollar I had on weed. Short term it helped me with depression and social anxiety but as time went on I was seeing red flags but doing nothing about them. In my 2nd semester I had no money to buy weed and I had my first panic attack of my life (although at the time I didn't realize it) because I couldn't get high. All of the money I had up until that point was spent on weed. I had an extensive yugioh collection from playing competitively for 4 years before college and after selling it all I ended up with around 3K. I think I spent every cent of it on weed by &lt;2 years later. I kept using daily until I graduated with a degree in business administration. I have forgone everything else in my life for this drug up until this point. It's absolutely pathetic. I missed internship opportunities, relationships with others, and improving myself all while just numbing away 4 years of my life. I've been out of school 7 months and have yet to find a salaried job. I hate myself for going AWOL in a critical time of my life and not making the most of something I took for granted. So here I sit, 30 minutes into christmas, having just gotten high, writing about how much I hate getting high. I feel so fucked up I just want to sob."
7m169p,9,2017-12-25,[Spoiler](#s Tensei isn't what he seems and Iida is being built up to be a villain),Wotonker,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/7m169p/spoilers_tensei_isnt_what_he_seems_and_iida_is/,"Spoilers
Tensei may be involved in illegal activities.
I also reckon Iida is gonna be a villain and my reasons revolve around Midoriya and Iida himself. (and maybe Todoroki)

One thing you need to remember is that we've only really seen Tensei through the eyes of a biased younger brother that idolizes him. In any case, I'll start with Tensei and Stain. To me, Tensei seems like a pretty shady person. He runs his own hero agency and on top of that, he has a ton of personal sidekicks (way more than most pro heroes) which leads me to wonder how he manages to pay for all of it. He is also pretty lax about enforcing the law, which is shown in Vigilantes when he doesn't stop Koichi from using his powers in public. Tensei even invites Koichi to work at his agency even though he doesn't have a Hero Licence, which is illegal in the BNHA universe. Tensei also has a weird personality for a hero. When Tenya asks his brother his reason for wanting to be a hero, Tensei's first response is that he was pretty much forced into it by the expectations of those around him. Not a great reason to be a hero. And now comes Stain. From what has been seen of him, we can see that he can easily differentiate between a ""fake"" hero and a ""real"" one. It takes him no time at all to realise that Midoriya (a man recognized by All Might, the GREATEST hero) sticks to the true definition of the word 'hero', and that Iida is a selfish fake, acting purely on his own personal interests. Now why would a man like Stain, a man that clearly only kills people he thinks are unworthy of the title of hero, attack Ingenium, a famous hero praised by the media and civilians. My guess is that Stain discovered Tensei was involved in less than legal activities, leading Stain to add him to his hero hunt. 

Moving on to Iida. There is a bit of evidence to support my theory on this so bare with me. First of all, Iida has a personality that suits a villain more than a hero. His idolization of his brother and his brother's subsequent injury causes him to act on his rage and vengeance and he doesn't really act appropriately in situations that call for heroics (when he doesn't think twice about helping Midoriya in the entrance exam despite how shit-scared he looked, I'm pretty sure there's more but I can't remember right now). He is a stark contrast to Midoriya and Todoroki. Both of them have had pretty radical character/ personality changes throughout the manga whereas Iida, even after having nearly half an arc dedicated to him, has remained relatively the same in terms of personality and character development. What I base most of this theory around is a line we hear from future Midoriya. (who is at a point in time when he is considered the greatest hero) Midoriya and Uraraka attempt to get Iida to open up to them, which he refuses to do. Midoriya then says he regrets not doing more to help Iida that day, indicating that the interaction has had unforeseen and costly consequences. After the fight with Stain, Midoriya doesn't show the level of regret I expected in contrast to that the dire tone of his statement. He starts to have reservations about not acting earlier to help Iida but then dismisses those thoughts fairly quickly. I'm guessing Midoriya's earlier comment about his regret refers to something that takes place in the future, a part of the story we haven't gotten yet, namely Iida becoming a villian. 

Feel free to tear this theory to shreds if it interests you.

Also, this part is about Todoroki and a comment he made about Iida's family during the fight with Stain. Todoroki makes a passing comment about how Iidas FAMILY has a dark side, not just Iida himself. This comment seemed strange to me because it doesn't really apply to their current predicament. Now this is just a guess but maybe Todoroki knows something about the activities Iida's brother is involved in. How? Take a look at where he has been working for his internship. Who is most likely to know about illegal operations than the hero agency that is home to the number 2 hero in Japan, Endeavour. 
P.S. I know how far-fetched this last bit sounds which is why I put a maybe next to Todoroki at the beginning.
P.P.S These theories are all based on the assumption that this manga will span a few decades of Midoriya's life and that the manga itself will go on for a long while yet"

A little advice please 
So beginning of June I broke up with my girlfriend because we were both moving away. On great terms but was over.
At the time I was set to travel and had a dream internship lined up. That position fell through, as did some of my trip so instead of having a adventure to a new job I ended up unemployed and underemployed living at my parents house. I also injured myself and with the stress of finding a new permanent job, my body has been slow to recover. And with everything I got very depressed 
And I’ve been slow to improve my situation, while her position has given her the best time of her life

Not mentioning that for pity, but to point out that this was the worst time to try to get over an ex. Especially one who had always been there for me
Over the last few months, I’ve been depressed and talked to her a few times saying pretty stupid things and haven’t gotten much back.
I know I shouldn’t reach out and try to fully get over it, but even 6 months out I’m struggling.

Like I feel I should try everything to get her back even when it’s clear she has moved on

Any ideas for how to get over her?"

I'm currently studying ICAEW in college and I've just completed my certificate (CFAB) as well as a 3 month internship. My course completes in 4 more years starting from next month.

My course pathway:
Certificate - Full time study (Total cost $7.5k) - Completed

ICAEW: (starting next month)
Year 1 - Full time study (Total expected cost $8k)
Year 2 - Full time work (No longer needed to pay the course from now on, expected salary $600/month)
Year 3 &amp; 4 - Part time study and work (Employer pays for the studies, expected salary should increase to $800/month)

I've completed my internship and I realised I might not see myself working as an auditor for 5 years ( estimated 5 years to be a Audit Assistant Manager, including the 3 years - Year2 to 4 ) as I noticed the huge amount of stress and responsibilities faced by the seniors. Please note: I understand as our experience increase, our responsibilities increases as well to have a pay raise in the corporate world, I'm not against it. Just that I might not enjoy working in the corporate world to climb the ranks.

On the other hand I've learned Electronic Dance Music production for the past year and originally I wanted to pursue a career in being a famous DJ artist but then I thought about it and even though it's not easy to be famous but ultimately being famous is the goal and it will affect my privacy and my family members which I do not want. Hence I've changed my mind to be a Music Producer instead of an artist - helping artists create their songs.

I feel like quitting even though I'm halfway through the course because I do not want my family to pay the remaining $8k on a job which I will probably will not work as an auditor for a long time to be able to gain back the amount spent on college and focus on my health - losing weight and focus on doing music which doesn't feel like work to me and more on being happy - college was so negative as I've seen friends turn their backs on me so quickly and we're never supportive of me when I was for them (yeah I know, this is life).

My plan is to rest for the first 3-5 months and focus on being fit and once I'm fit I'll find a job as a personal trainer ( to improve my communication skills (expected salary $200/month). While on the side helping my mother startup a new business with selling her bakery goods (focusing online sales w/ delivery) to get business, advertising and marketing skills. And of course, work on my music production by planning to sell my music production service for only $1 for the first 6 months to gain experience as I do not have any experience producing music for other artists. This way even though I fail at making the track, I gain experience and the customer only losses $1 but if I succeed, the customer wins and get a track for $1 and I get credited on it as well. Ultimately, I want to be a music producer as I feel as long as I put in the hours in and complete jobs as a freelancer will get me far in the future.

My questions is should I incur the $8k and work a more stable job to have a stable life or take the risk and pursue my dreams? If to pursue my dreams, is my plan viable? If not - do provide constructive criticism if you wish, I'm open. Should I feel bad for still needing to stay in my family's house at the age of 20 ( as if I continued studying at 21 I could pay my own rent ) and potentially earn a lesser income than being an auditor? What backup plans could you suggest if I fail to achieve my dream job?

Extra Facts (if needed):
1. Groceries - $100/month
2. Petrol - $25/month ( I chip in this amount with my family members )
3. I have released 2 EDM tracks under a very small independent label when I had the famous DJ goal in my mind

Sorry for the long post, thank you in advance for reading and for your answers!

7m34su,0,2017-12-25,Need action plan for family to get out of debt. [CAN/IND/DXB/US],throwaway_3n33,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7m34su/need_action_plan_for_family_to_get_out_of_debt/,"Hi Personal finance,

This is a bit long story so buckle up. All my figures are in USD unless specified. TL;DR of all expenditures and assets without much breakdown is below.

Around recession (2007/2008), my dad got a small apartment which he sold for 30,000$. We have 3 other properties in our family which are worth  $75,000, $135,000 and $300,000. 

He got a LOAN for $60,000 which he decided to invest in futures (along with the $30,000 and some of his own savings, in total about 100,000$) back in 2007. He lost all of it. 

In Dubai, interest are usually higher than in Canada and US. Thus, he ended up with a huge interest. 

However, since we migrated to Canada, the banks are okay with just the principal amount back. (Lucky for us but this is horrible for our credit as a family, I agree).

Now, to cover the loan of $60,000, we sold the property valued at $75,000 but a bit below market price. Assume $0 profit from this transaction. 

Since the process of receiving money will take time due to the buyer, we took a loan of 15,000$ to meet some deadlines set by the banks.

Furthermore, he has $5,000 at 6% per annum on his credit card as debt.

Now remaining assets 2 properties for $135,000 and $300,000.

To recap:

Family members = 4 (Mom, dad, sis and me). 

**Assets:**

+ Property at  $135,000 and $300,000
+ $0 in my dad's bank account literally
+ 0.30 BTC my dad owns (5454.00 CAD at this point)
+ 5,000 CAD worth cryptocurrency I own. (Profitted shy of 1,000 CAD)
+ 15,000 CAD  my mom's account.
+ 20,000 CAD in my account. (through internships, after paying my tuition and living expenses)

**Loans:**

+ 15,000 CAD now reduced to 12,000 CAD(paid back some) with a monthly interest of $150.
+ 5,000 CAD CC debt in Canada with interest of 6% per annum
+ 16,000 CAD student loan which I took (would not be needing anymore, I covered everything else. Interest free till April, thank you Canada)

**Income before taxes:**

+ Mom and dad's combined: 60,000 CAD
+ Mine from next June (I can start in May if required) (currently a student till April):   72,000 CAD 


**Past expenditure:**

Upto 100,000 CAD as we immigrated. My mom had this money saved in her bank. Immigration fees + traveling cost+ both were unemployed for a whole year to 1.5 years  + my first university term expenditure ( dorm room, tuition, traveling back and forth, meal plan). We were bleeding dry and I didn't know. 
 

**Current expenditures (mom, dad and sister):**

+ 1050 CAD - Car, insurance, maintenance and gas combined (we have honda accord, we use car very often as Canada has harsh winters)
+ 1550 CAD - house rent
+ 1000 CAD - groceries
+ 200 CAD - phone bill
+ 125 CAD - internet bill
+ 500 CAD - sister's education-related expenses 
+ 200-300 - loan expenditure

**Total monthly's expenditure: 4300 CAD**

My parent's will literally give up all they own for our education so we cannot cut from that.


**My expenses monthly:**

+ Rent - 655$ (single room, I do not live with them)
+ Food - 100$  (parent's often give me food too, I do eat out a bit with my friends)
+ Travelling: ~100$ (back and forth from family's home, 15$ one way, 30$ for the weekend)

I saw my credit card history, in past 4 months, I've spent about 7,500 CAD (I had this in addition to my current balance about 4,000 CAD is on crypto. I made 1,000 CAD profit on it (it often varies between 1000 to 3000)). Meaning about 3,500 CAD for EVERYTHING for 4 months. I do not plan to spend more on crypto soon. 

**Total monthly expenditure: shy of 1000 CAD**



**Total family expenditure: 5300 CAD**


My dad wants about 15,000 CAD for arbitrage trading in cryptocurrency (in addition to his current job) and does not want to return our loan or pay back his 5,000 CAD CC debt as he thinks he will get profit.

My mom has 0 trust on my dad and not willing to finance him at all and told me do not help him out. They both own all assets 50/50 and she is not willing to spend anything on him as he lost 60,000 $ on his futures earlier.

I am trying to save up for my sister's first term on university (or more if required, I know its 4 years later), pay for my loans which will start in May.

Based on our current assets and loans, how do we make best out of our situation?


**Recap/ TL;DR:**

**Assets:**

+ Property at  $135,000 and $300,000
+ $0 in my dad's bank account literally
+ 0.30 BTC my dad owns (5454.00 CAD at this point)
+ 5,000 CAD worth cryptocurrency I own. (Profitted shy of 1,000 CAD)
+ 15,000 CAD  my mom's account.

+ 15,000 CAD now reduced to 12,000 CAD(paid back some) with a monthly interest of $150.
+ 5,000 CAD CC debt in Canada with interest of 6% per annum
+ 16,000 CAD student loan which I took (would not be needing anymore, I covered everything else. Interest-free till April, thank you Canada)

**Total family expenditure: 5000 CAD (breakdown above)**

**Income before taxes:**

+ Mom and dad's combined: 60,000 CAD
+ Mine from next June (I can start in May if required) (currently a student till April):   72,000 CAD (can start in May if required)

**Income after taxes:**

+ Mom and dad's combined based on google: About 52k.

**Net saving**

52,000 - 4300 * 12 = 400$ YEARLY. 

**Additional facts:**

+ They don't have a set retirement plan. 
+ Aim to buy a house in Canada someday once I earn. (with their expenditures, they probably won't get approved). + Have a sister going to university in 4 years, I haven't saved enough for her education yet. 
+ Cannot sell the assets until the loan is completely paid off (in process should be done by April overall, buyer is in process of giving money)
+ I need them out of debt (no questions) to get MY citizenship for Canada. I am just PR not Canadian and cause I love them too.

Help? I am in tears. I need to save my family.

________________________________________
TL;DR Is it because mind thinks logarithmically?
I would appreciate if you could give a ELI18 too.

I can pick up/understand things/concepts/languages fairly quickly but unable to get into the details of it with the same speed. And I have seen this pattern with almost everyone, some people are natural geniuses for breaking down seemingly impossible tasks into nothing to learn them while some don't give a fu*k to even put in the effort to learn anything. But most of us are able to achieve the medium level of proficiency in almost all tasks with almost no effort in comparison to the effort required to get to the ""expert"" level. I am not counting the things which come with experience, ofc if you never dealt with a real threat, you will be (most probably) valued less no matter the amount of training than someone who dealt with the actual stuff, ranging from Counter Terrorism to corporate offices, experience and solving things first hand works like amazing for your mind.

But that is not my point of asking this question, I want to ask about things which are more or less set in concrete, like learning a language like English/Russian/Spanish/Chinese/Japanese/Hindi/Urdu etc
Some of you might argue that if you don't practice speaking, or interact with locals, you don't really learn the language (i.e. ""expert"") Then what about things like Morse Code? It is easy to memorize the code but unless you have actually used it a lot, you won't be able to type a full sentence without looking up the documentation. Same goes for mathematics, easy to learn any concept in a few minutes, actually using it requires loads of practice. My point is why do we need to practice more and more as we get deeper into the subject?
Also there is difference between practice and experience, Morse Code will always stay the same *(there is no entropy/randomness everything will go as set in stone eg. E will always be (.) in Morse code)*, but your on ground experience of handling a crisis *(The guy may use a knife/gun, you are low on ammo, the intern deleted the whole database etc)* won't.

I always kinda knew this was the case by observation, but really started to think hard about it when trying to solve/learn NP-Hard/NP-Complete and some problems related to encryption.

Thank You and Merry Christmas!

7m4g3k,3,2017-12-25,One Year On - Christmas for Me,mineareworse,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7m4g3k/one_year_on_christmas_for_me/,"It’s been a hectic past few months, and this post is going to be a long one, but people of Reddit, I’m FREE!!!

I started today by going back to my old house to collect some important post when my NParents were away; my former house key didn’t work and I realised that they’d changed the locks on me. That’s the Christmas spirit!

-

About a year ago, I posted to this sub out of desperation, and sadness to find some sort of peace within my upbringing and boy did you guys deliver; the support was overwhelming and the actual knowledge that people out there, strangers I’ve never met before actually were rooting for me, that feeling was incredible. So I carried on.

-

Four/five months ago, I reached my absolute breaking point with my family; they’d found out about a relationship of mine* (interracial dating and Narcissism doesn’t mix) and they flipped (after going through my emails) and so fearing for my safety and well-being, I ran away from home. I grabbed the bare essentials, and used my little car to take me literally anywhere else. It’s an embarrassing thing to admit, but I lived out my car for a few days or so and do you know what? I’ve never been happier. 


*The relationship has since been ended because of a number of other reasons; despite everything, I wish them the absolute best.


I started to sofa surf with friends and acquaintances, literally anyone who’d take me in, until my cousins found out and took me into their home; I then realised that whilst they admitted that they weren’t “taking sides” in this family mess, information about me and my personal life was getting relayed back to my NParents through them and I left again due to safety concerns. But this time, I went to my best friends’ parents (who for all intents and purposes may as well be my parents) and they’ve taken me in, treated me like their own child (and I mean fed me, given me a bed, been there for me, talk to me, made me actually like Christmas again), and again, I’ve never been happier.


To sustain this move and being one step closer to absolute independence, I’ve had to work my fucking ass off at work; I also picked up a new job (and now I have three jobs!) and from September through till early December, I’ve consistently worked 30 hour weeks (alongside university and other interviews) - the money was much needed; however, I’ve became totally financially independent upon myself, paid off my car insurance (a MAJOR cost) and literally paid for everything I’ve needed over the past four months without relying on any loans and stuff.


My college grades have shot up (compared to last year) and even though I’ve only had to ask for one deadline extension (out of a possible five or six), I’m proud of myself as to how far I’ve came; I always joke that if I can get better grades and perform better in college without a home, what more can I do for myself?


-


I’m now in the process of trying to find a new place to live and a few opportunities have arisen this year with the hard-work I have put in to keep going; I have the possibility to move to Germany for a semester, and also take a year out to work in industry (a placement/year long internship sort of thing); I mentioned in my previous (and only) post that I applied to all these different placements and internships and had gotten nowhere/been rejected (except one) - this year, I’m getting interview offers from the likes of Intel, HP computing, Volkswagen Group and so many more! The dedication and commitment to work I have put myself through has been incredible and to yield results like this is brilliant; I have travelled to so many new places for interviews and assessments for these placements and the majority of them have had the company reimburse my travel, but it’s been a financial shitshow to maintain. I was down to my last few hundred $’s (which is seriously not a lot when that’s everything you have), but it’s been worth it.

With reference to the last post, I still admit that it is so hard keeping up a brave face and a “tough exterior”, but with the right support, its possible. And I said that I’m resigned to little else other than working and going to college, but honestly, all of this experience has taught me that there is so much more to life than just that.

I’m also in the process of getting all my mail rerouted to a different address so that I can access important letters, I have changed all my passwords and my university is in the process of reevaluating the tuition grant/bursary that I receive - we’re doing it guys!


Thank you to all the people who’ve helped me in this debacle, especially everyone who offered me a home, fed me,the University support staff and also especially my best friend and his family. 

Also thank you to all the users who commented their SUPER kind words of love and affection (and they probably won’t remember me, but I remember them); they are /u/auntgoat /u/entropys_child /u/RockyFlinstone /u/dracomax /u/wellnessinwaco /u/NorthOfUptownChi /u/corathus59 /u/leon_hearted /u/KeeperofAmmut7 /u/chinaducky - thank you to all of these and everyone else who’ve helped - you have one hell of a great support network on Reddit; I’m truly blessed.

There was one particular post from /u/RockyFlinstone that I saved and read for the past year (and will continue to for the rest of my life) and I’ll share it with you all here

“All of those thing you said you want? Love, support, affection, validation? You should have had them. Everyone should. You didn't get to and that sucks, it's unfair and it leaves scars all over. And yet despite all of that, here you are moving forward and doing all the work you need to in order to set yourself up for a good life when you get away. You CAN do this, you ARE doing it. You represent everything that Christmas is about, you are the light in the darkness, you are Rudolph's red nose leading the way for others to follow out of the fog. Shine on, and Merry Christmas to you.”

To everyone going through a rough time with their own situations - it will get better - trust me, I’ve been there - be patient. It won’t be easy, and some days you’ll feel more alone than you have ever done before, but you’ll be content with your life, and you can start to build a life for yourself. Don’t ever underestimate the power of strangers, or believe that family is constrained to blood relations only - fuck that, you can choose who your family are; Quality over quantity. Be kind to everyone and try and keep that up - you’ll know that no matter how shitty something is or a situation is, at least you know that you’re a kind person. Emotional intelligence is fucking priceless and sometimes, you do have to go through shit to learn this, but this will teach you things for the rest of your life. And most importantly, never underestimate the power of yourself - you can do so much more than what you think - the amount of emotional resolve is astounding and we all have it; some people discover this sooner than others, but to everyone going through a hard time with their own life, you can do it. And if no-one else believes in you, I fucking will. Merry Christmas everyone, and thank you for everything."
7m4o7o,12,2017-12-25,Can I prevent my housemate from returning?,fauxgratin,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7m4o7o/can_i_prevent_my_housemate_from_returning/,"I've posted here about my housemate, and at this point I'm tired of talking about her. 

My housemate caused trouble in October, when she tried to move her boyfriend in without telling anyone. We finally had to report her to the landlord when we got tired of telling her not to let him smoke in the house, and it was then that we found out why he'd been sleeping over for 6 nights in a row.

Since then, the situation at home has been way too tense. She refused to speak to me anymore because I was the one who reported her. She brings guys over to spend the night, and sometimes goes away and leaves them there, all without telling anyone. And then when the landlord met us to talk about the problems we were having, she made a big show of saying how she hated the tension and she wanted to be friends again... Before going back to the same old behaviour.

All she does is lie. When he had our first issue with her, she told the landlord that she would work things out with us, but told us that she was leaving by the end of the month (which obviously, she didn't).

Last week, she told me she was leaving an hour before her flight left, and said she wouldnt be coming back. She left her keys with a friend, and we still haven't gotten them back. We don't even know who has them. 

Today my sister asked her about the keys, and she said they're hers to keep because she has to come back to do an internship. She didn't think she could say anything to us. Her excuse is that she spoke to the landlord.

I know some people reading this might think I'm being petty, but I really don't like this girl, and I don't want her back. My mental health is not 100%, and I can't stand her irritating me all the time. So I'm asking for advice on asking our landlord not to allow her back. "
7m533i,8,2017-12-25,I think I’m my own problem.,ivylamp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7m533i/i_think_im_my_own_problem/,"Don’t get this wrong, I don’t mean for it to be a sappy post, nor do I loathe in self hatred or anything like that. I feel like I can live my life in the clouds and not pay attention to much around me other than my own business and thoughts. I’m genuinely trying to find the root of this stigma so I can actively work to improve. 

So, to get this started, I’m (21, F) not really happy. I’m not the happiest in my relationship but I genuinely love my boyfriend (23, M). I’m not really happy in my friendships or family relationships, either. But there’s no possible way that all of these wonderful people are actually the problem. See what I mean?

I feel neglected by just about everyone. My boyfriend hangs out with his friends (who have become my friends too, and their girlfriends come along which is nice) 4-5 nights a week. He always perks up and gets excited when they’re coming over, but when it’s just us, he stays on his phone or glued to the TV. If I ask a question, it’s a nod or a head shake to answer. Which is fine, because we’ve lived together and maybe we just don’t have that much to talk about. Maybe our alone time is when he’s most comfortable to relax and get some down time. I don’t know, we don’t fight much, but I don’t feel close anymore. So there’s that. We laugh and have fun and go do things together, we go on several vacations a year and always feel close and make good memories, but at home, it’s “meh” at best. And don’t get me started on our practically nonexistent intimate-life. 

My mom is obsessed with her husband and when I go visit, it’s all about him, she’s constantly checking up on him and will actually get up from our conversation to see what he’s doing and basically stands over him micromanaging almost his every move. It makes me feel second to him, which is fine, I’m grown and moved out, but I don’t go over there to visit much anymore because of this. 

I have a few friends who were mine independently from my mutual friends with my boyfriend, but we’ve been together so long it practically all merges together. One of my best friends is marrying my boyfriend’s best friend and is having his second child, and being childless, we don’t see eachother much or have much to talk about beyond about an hour in to a visit. 

My other close best friend is a social butterfly who seems to have it all together. She’s always going on adventures, just came back from an awesome internship out of the country, and is always so busy. I looooove to spend time with her and we always have things to talk about, but she is always so busy I hardly get my fill of our friendship. 

I also own my own business and work alone. So I don’t have any “work buddies” to make friends out of. The last one I had (worked next to me in her own business) moved away last month. 

I feel alone. All the time. I feel like I’ve spent so much time quietly sitting my my boyfriend in the living room or in bed, and while everyone’s over, quietly at work alone, quietly at my family’s house with no family my age and a mother who’s obsessed with her husband, quietly beside my best friend, and hardly around the other, I don’t even know what to do with myself. There’s no way all of these people are the problem. The last two weeks my confidence has deteriorated and I can hardly stand to look at myself in the mirror, or shower, or fix myself up, it doesn’t make a difference anyways. Is this all based on my weirdly distant relationship with my mom and boyfriend? Or is it weird and distant because of myself? Or is it not weird and distant at all, it’s all just in my head?  I constantly think I mean less to other people than they mean to me. I never feel loved and valued enough. I want to go out and do my own thing a day or two out of the week, a hobby or something, but I already feel so alone I don’t want to do something else by my lonesome. How can one person feel so lonely when they are constantly around other people? I’m scared I have unrealistic expectations for others or am narcissistic. At this rate I’ll never be pleased. I’m miserable and don’t know what to do. I don’t think new friends, a new boyfriend, a new life, etc. would do anything to help so I don’t really have those thoughts and if they come, I don’t entertain them. I feel like I constantly give and never get anything in return. I don’t know if that’s selfish, irrational thinking, just my perception of these relationships, or if I am legitimately surrounded by people who don’t care about me (this seems so impractical). I think my definition of “caring about me” may be unrealistic. I wasn’t spoiled as a child by any means so I don’t know if this would stem from my childhood. I just know I can’t go on like this forever. 


**tl;dr I feel like everyone hates me and all of my relationships are distant and lacking. I’m sure the people in my life don’t all suck, so I think it’s my fault. **"
7m53jt,2,2017-12-25,Should I [17/M] pursue a relationship with a friend [18/F] given college is soon?,notmymain324,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7m53jt/should_i_17m_pursue_a_relationship_with_a_friend/,"Okay, I am asking this question even though I already feel like I know the answer. I tend to think way to much about simple things and get stressed over small things, so I am hoping you that are older and wiser can help give me some perspective (It is like my brain is split). I am pretty sure it is best to just wait this out and let the feelings pass, but given hormones and the like, that is easier said than done.

**Some background on me:** i am sure a lot of 17 year olds say this, but i believe I am more mature than most people my age. Some sources: I am confident at public speaking and business relations and heavily invested into my future. I have some mutual funds (I do not think this is impressive, but it catches people off guard). I have a paid internship with an engineering firm which will likely lead into summer internship and turn into a job making good money after college. I am very confident in the somewhat unique hobbies I take part in (Keyboards, other geeky stuff) and embrace my uniqueness. I am generally uninterested in the drama that goes on at high school and am mostly not interested in girls my age. This sounds kinda cocky as I write it, but I am generally considered a kind person that does not brag too much. I just want to give you the straight rundown.

**So here is the rundown:**
i am a 17 year old male and for a little over the last year I have been attracted to one of my friends [18F]. At first, it was pretty easy to ignore because I figured she would go off to college and everything would be forgotten (I forget her, she forgets me, etc etc), but that really did not happen, I think of her more now than I ever have.

i am 95% sure she likes me as well (Where I think my main complication is). I have concluded this because of the way she talks with me compared to some of the others in the friend group, it is pretty obvious flirting and some of the other friends have noticed it. Honestly, being around her with the flirting is what always draws me back in.

**Reasons I would have for a relationship:**

She almost certainly would at least go out with me a few times to test the waters.

I have been attracted to girls in the past (Duh) but my mind is treating me different because of how comfortable I am around her and I believe I like her for the right reasons (Not physical attraction, though that is there - she's got pretty eyes - but mainly her personality). 

She is incredibly smart and is very passionate about certain things, which i really like seeing in people. She meshes well with my geekiness (Which most girls are not fond of), she is even part of a DND group with some mutual friends. She also comes to my lan parties!! (Though with some other mutual - girl friends - so it is not necessarily super exclusive to her)

She is interested in engineering, as am I, and we are both very passionate about helping STEM gender diversity (It is hard to be a woman in STEM). 

We share common ideals: religion (Both athiest), politics: both liberal with similar viewpoints, abortion, children, marriage, and generally agree on all big ideology issues.

We converse well. I know this is a bit sparse, but most times I do not converse well with others. She and I converse wonderfully, laugh at each others awkwardness and embrace the geekiness.

We have enough common interests but also have things that make us different. I do not have a lot of perspective on this, but I think we would be somewhere that could be a potentially good balance.


**Issues with relationship:**

-Her college is 1400 miles away from where I live. There is a possibility I will go to the same college (DO NOT worry, I am not going there for her and am trying my best to make sure that is not in my subconscious), which I would put at about 15%. The scary part is this is not my biggest concern. If you could seperate thoughts for if I go to local college (85% chance) or if I went to her college (15% chance), that would be awesome.

-Her communication skills not in person are truly atrocious and my *biggest concern*. She takes forever to reply to texts and is very difficult to get ahold of by any means. I know she is not ignoring me, in fact, I am the one who has the best of luck getting ahold of her. Her best friend (I am also friends with her) says this is something that has occurred in the last 1.5 years and the best way to get info about this girl (The one I like) is to contact her mother. An example of this is we often plan things to do as a group of friends (Usually 4-6 of us) and she never marks on the event (We use group me) if she will come or not, most of the time she just shows up. But it is impossible to tell sometimes).

Once again, she just does not check her phone often and when she does, she often acknowledges it by not responding (Unless it is a direct question, even then, 4-6 hours for a response). 

- (EDIT: ADDED) I do not want to loose her as a friend. She means a lot to me outside of just wanting to date her. She has been a great support and influence in my life, pushing me to do my best and go outside of my comfort zone. **Those who dated a close friend and broke up, how was the aftermath??**

She is really busy. She gets involved in everything (Which I hold in great importance and think is important). But this likely contributes to her lack of communication and would make long distance pretty much impossible in my mind.

**Summary/TLDR:** I have a girl-friend (As in a friend that happens to be a girl, gosh this is annoying to find a term for) where there is almost certainly mutual attraction. If we lived closer together for most of the year (not just over summer and breaks), I would certainly want to go for it. 

I realize I am 17 and there is plenty of time for this, but this is the only girl I have met in my life like this and am afraid to pass it up. I know the likely answer is to just let it go on, but part of me still needs some persuasion. I would just love for some people to provide some perspective for me.

If you have any general life advice/relationship advice that is appreciated as well. I do not fit in with my peer group at all and I sometimes am afraid that I will struggle with this for the rest of my life. Though this is also sometimes a strong point, I know within a few minutes of meeting people whether there is any chance for a relationship (Romantic, friendship, etc).

I do not want to loose her as a friend no matter what and if a relationship is not a possibility right now, could potentially pursue it after college if things stayed the same (though I know it likely will not, it will at least give me some closure)??????

Please just let me know your thoughts/advice, this issue causes an unreasonable level of stress.

THANKS so much for any help you can offer. I am ready to get older and get away from constant teenage emotion all the time."
7m5j1j,22,2017-12-25,Myers-Briggs types of the Boku no Hero Academia characters!,BoredPessimist,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/7m5j1j/myersbriggs_types_of_the_boku_no_hero_academia/,"One day in November, I ended up learning a lot about the MBTI, and figured I should apply it to the series I've been addicted to, My Hero Academia. 

A month has elapsed since then. During that time, /u/lofticried coincidentally also did [their take on the BNHA characters](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/7g3812/mbti_typing_of_the_characters/) and I am only just *barely* satisfied with mine enough to share them.

So keep in mind that this is mostly me teaching myself about typing, and I'm still unsure about Aoyama, Ojiro, Sato, Tokoyami, Todoroki, Tooru, and Yaoyorozu. Those 7 in particular are up for debate, so if you can convince me otherwise, I may change them.

* Aoyama - ESFP - he loves attention [License Exam](#s ""because he feels inferior"")

* Ashido - ENFP - airheaded like a few other members of her class

* Tsuyu - ISFJ - she's a feeler from Recovery Girl's description

* Iida - ESTJ - he's not great at picking up social cues, but for me that's not enough for him to be an Introvert

* Uraraka - ESFJ - doesn't come across as an airhead, definitely seems more grounded (S) and had a very focused goal in the Sports Festival (J)

* Ojiro - ISFP - definitely ISxx, but he's not like Tsuyu, Momo, or Tokoyami, so I said FP

* Kaminari - ENFP - I've seen Thinking for him a lot, but wasn't he paired with Ashido in the finals because they're the two dumbest in the class?

* Kirishima - ESFJ - still a party lover like ENFPs seem to be, but more grounded (even being insecure about his Quirk). /u/Xzcouter made a good point that he could be Judging, so I'll leave it at ESFx.

* Koda - INFP - [Chapter 98](#s ""his bedroom's filled with cute cuddly things"") which gives me the impression he lives in his own little world

* Sato - ISFP - wouldve stood out more if he were an extrovert and seems more grounded while having low self-esteem (SF)

* Shoji - ISFJ - seems to be the very quiet, very protective type

* Jiro - INTJ - being so scared of nudity hints at Thinking and her being really responsible in her internship shows Judging

* Sero - ENTP - seems close to ENFP but a bit more clever than them

* Tokoyami - ISTP - Perceiving because he ignores Iida's berating him for not following the rules

* Todoroki - INTJ - probably SJ but I just feel this is better. Loathed his father choosing his fate and argued against the law after the fight with Stain, but I still don't know if he's Perceiving. Split on T and F as well.

* Tooru - ENFP - considered S over N but ESFPs are bold and original and [Chapter 99](#s ""her room was called a 'normal girly room'"")

* Bakugo - ESTJ - a bit more introverted since coming to UA but regardless. According to 16personalities, ESTJs are strong-willed, dedicated, stubborn, judgemental, and difficult to relax.

* Midoriya - INFJ - because he's very similar to All Might (a textbook ENFJ)

* Mineta - ESTP who uses Thinking maliciously. He's an Extrovert because it requires a lot of extroversion to be that openly pervy.

* Yaoyorozu - ISTJ - definitely has Te as one of her dominant traits (could also be INTJ). People cite her breakdown after losing to Tokoyami as Feeling but I just see it as a thinker using their emotions

Expect me to be editing these, both for changing these characters' typings and adding more characters (though not as complete as doing the entire 1A since I can't do, say, all of the known UA teachers since we don't know much about all of them). Hope you enjoyed my month wasted.

And here's most of the sources I used (I deleted some to clear up space):

http://personalitycafe.com/

edit: I said I'd edit in some more characters and I'm finally following through with that promise! This time, some characters will be incomplete in typing and are far more up to debate than the 1A characters.

Here's the pro heroes that I could type:

* All Might - ENFJ - Like, the very definition of ENFJ. I still don’t quite buy that his true form is introverted. Comes pretty close tho.

* Eraserhead - ISTP - Definite IxTP. Wish he was a fellow INTP but he seems to be more realistic with his worldview and definitely uses Se.

* Endeavor - ESTJ - Doesn’t do well in the spotlight so maybe introverted, I think him and Shoto have more in common than Shoto would like to admit

* Gran Torino - xSTP - only thing I'm sure of is sensing. But reading through his wiki page, if you didn't know already (like me), everything about him was made to be an old mentor

* Nezu -  INTJ - villains tend to be this type (as you’ll see soon) and a running joke is how much pent up hatred he has towards humans (not saying he is a villain, just was made to have the personality of one)

* Present Mic - ESFP - Hey, I learned more MBTI stereotypes than just ENFP, so now everyone gets equally shit on! His quirk even builds into his loud, attention-loving personality.

* [Internship](#s ""Sir Nighteye - ISTJ - Definitely IxTJ. Hard to tell if he’s Si or Ni, but I’d say he’s ironically not the future-oriented Ni (given his quirk) since he’s so hung up on past predictions."")

* [Internship](#s ""Fatgum - ESFP - Unlike Kirishima (who’s a lot like Fat, but I’m split on P/J), Fat hasn’t shown signs of being stuck in the past"")

* Recovery Girl - ExFJ - She is very people-oriented and kind, but since we see more and more of her getting pissed off at All Might and Deku shows more of her Thinker side.

* Cementoss - ISTJ - seems to be the most scholastic of the teachers, who’d have strict schedules for everything and is always by the book

* Mt. Lady - ESFP - She’s that stereotypical attention-loving ESFP again.

RIP ENTJs and INTPs :(

edit 2: more students!

* Shinso - INTJ - Like I said with Nezu, INTJ tends to be the “villain type” and his concept is that he’s on the verge of becoming evil

* Kendo - ESFJ - Fe is high

* Monoma - ENTP - he probably considers himself very clever, so T. Would vouch that he’s an unhealthy ENTP.

* Tetsutetsutetsutetsu - ESFJ - Literally Kirishima lmao

* Hatsume - ENTP - NTs are inventive, particularly ENTPs. To back that a little more, she’s outgoing and doesn’t come off as the debate-loving ENTJ.

7m5mek,135,2017-12-25,Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee hands out nicknames .She addressed one of her employees as “you stupid motherfucker.” MUST READ !,Blue-Rain,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7m5mek/rep_sheila_jackson_lee_hands_out_nicknames_she/,"Congressional bosses from Hell: Sheila Jackson Lee

JONATHAN STRONG

 
""A lot of politicians give nicknames to their aides. George W. Bush famously referred to his attorney general, Alberto Gonzalez, as “Fredo.” Mitch Daniels, then head of the Office of Management and Budget, was known as “The Blade.” Barack Obama reportedly called Larry Summers, his chief economic advisor, “Dr. Kevorkian.”

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas also hands out nicknames to the people who work for her. The Houston Democrat addressed one of her employees as “you stupid motherfucker.” And not just once, but “constantly,” recalls the staffer, “like, all the time.”

Another Jackson Lee aide recounts the time her parents came to Washington to visit: “They were really excited to come to the congressional office. They’re small town people, so for them it was a huge deal. They were actually sitting in the main lobby waiting area….[Jackson Lee] came out screaming at me over a scheduling change. Called me a ‘stupid idiot. Don’t be a moron, you foolish girl’ and actually did this in front of my parents, of all things.”

Yet another staffer remembers requesting a meeting early on in her tenure to ask how best to serve the congresswoman. Jackson Lee’s response: “What? What did you say to me? Who are you, the Congresswoman? You haven’t been elected. You don’t set up meetings with me! I tell you! You know what? You are the most unprofessional person I have ever met in my life.” With that, Jackson Lee hung up the phone.

According to the same staffer, Jackson Lee “would always say, ‘What am I a prostitute? Am I your prostitute? You can’t prostitute me.’”

Capitol Hill is famous for its demanding, insensitive bosses. Yet even by the harsh standards of Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee stands out. She may be the worst boss in Washington. “It’s like being an Iraq War veteran,” says someone who worked for her. Strangers may say, “‘oh I know what you’ve been through.’ No, you really don’t. Because until you’ve experienced it…. People don’t tell the worst of the stories, because they’re really unbelievable.”

Do You Think Sheila Jackson Lee Is The Worst Member Of Congress?
  Yes         No       

For some, a job in Jackson Lee’s office proved not just emotionally but physically perilous. One staffer recalls a frank conversation with his doctor, who told him he needed to quit. “It’s your life or your job,” the doctor told him, warning that the stress and long hours were wreaking havoc on his body.
Only a few on staff fought back. One of Jackson Lee’s drivers became so frustrated with her abuse the person pulled the car over and demand she stop: “She’s screaming and swearing. ‘M.F.’ everything. Finally I slammed on the brakes and told her to get the hell out of my car. I’m like ‘I can’t drive with you like this. Either get out, or you can calm down.’ And she’s like ‘you need to go or get fired.’ I’m like, ‘that’s fine. But I’m either leaving without you or you can calm down,’” the staffer said.

Jackson Lee then threatened to call the police and claim she was being held hostage in the car. But she finally did calm down when the staffer called her bluff, offering to flag down a Capitol Police officer to explain the situation.

Former aide Michael McQueery said his experience with other “difficult” bosses on the Hill prepared him for how to handle Jackson Lee. “I’ve worked for two other members. They did the same thing,” he said.

“It was at first, I’m not going to lie to you, it was a rough patch with her and me. But I took her to the side and I let her know that, you know, ‘Congresswoman, I’m a man before anything else.’ And after that, we had no problems. We had no problems,” McQueery said.

Of the scores of Jackson Lee staffers contacted by The Daily Caller, only McQueery offered an affirmative defense of the congresswoman’s management techniques. “A lot of people just did not know how to go, and say, ‘hey, that’s inappropriate,’” McQueery said.

A congressional torture chamber

In 2007, on a quiet afternoon on the fourth floor of the Rayburn House Office building, Caroline Stephens, then a low-level staffer for California Republican Rep. Gary Miller, walked down the hall to her office, taking note of an open door that was normally closed.

Congress was in recess, and the 535 lawmakers who drive the frenetic pace on Capitol Hill were home in their districts glad-handing constituents. For that reason, the door to Jackson Lee’s office was open and the sounds emanating from inside were pleasant laughter and conversation.

“You could tell when she wasn’t there,” Stephens said. That was because on a day in which Congress was in session, a different set of sounds often came through closed doors to Jackson Lee’s office: screaming and, many times, crying.

Later that day, a skinny young black man with his hair pulled back in a ponytail walked into Miller’s office and asked Stephens for a favor. Could he borrow a knife to cut a birthday cake?

Stephens, who’d seen the man working in Jackson Lee’s office, was happy to help, with only the request to “make sure you bring it back, that’s our only one.”

He laughed. “We would never leave a knife around when the congresswoman was here,” he said. As Stephens put it, “that’s when it all clicked that they are really afraid of her.”

She’ll make you wait

“I am a queen, and I demand to be treated like a queen,” Jackson Lee once said, and apparently she wasn’t kidding. Her employees describe waiting for their boss for hours on end, sometimes late into the night, while she attends events or even sits in her office watching TV.

“You worked really, really, really late for her. When she was in town, you were in the office. So that meant, two, three, four o’clock in the morning – we were there,” one former staffer said.

“She liked to hold her staff meetings — she would individually pull in the deputy chief of staff, myself and some other people individually to go over different parts of her day. But she would literally wait until super late at night. None of us could go home, because she wouldn’t tell when she was coming back or if she wasn’t. And if she called and you didn’t answer, it was like World War III,” the source said.

Jackson Lee’s designated driver picks her up at her apartment one block from her office each morning and waits for her outside wherever she goes throughout the days and nights.

“Whatever time she told me to be there, I would always show up at least 20 minutes late, and expect to wait at least 45 minutes,” said one of Jackson Lee’s drivers. By the end of this person’s tenure, “She was making me wait in the car, sometimes upwards of five to seven hours per day.” With the car running for heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, it began to wear down the car’s engine. “My mechanic friend said, you know, your car looks like you’ve driven it twice the miles you have,” the source said.

One woman who interviewed for a job in Jackson Lee’s office arrived at 5:00 p.m. but ended up waiting for hours. “I sat there, no kidding, from 5:00 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. They had me waiting, and this was just for the interview. Her staffers there kept telling me to be patient, that she puts everyone through the ringer…She actually went out to dinner while I was sitting there waiting for an interview,” the woman said. A Lee staffer called the woman at 11:15 p.m. after she’d just arrived home to beg her to come back. The congresswoman was finally ready.

It wasn’t just staffers who have been made to wait. Ray LaHood, the secretary of transportation, cooled his heels for an hour and a half in her office before leaving. “He was there to address transportation issues – getting funding to Houston. So I was just shocked that she would let him leave,” a former staffer said. Jackson Lee was waiting for a chance to appear in front of the C-SPAN cameras on the House floor.

“I would have to wait for hours,” says Gladys Quinto, a former staffer whom Jackson Lee instructed to write a memo about why she was incompetent in front of other staffers. “I missed the last metro once. My roommate had to come pick me up.”

Nathan Williams, who quit his job when Jackson Lee threw a cell phone at him, told the Houston Chronicle in 2002, “I don’t think I ever got home before 11 o’clock at night.”

The ‘Queen’ doesn’t wait…for anything

Even though she delays others for hours, Jackson Lee won’t wait a second for her demands to be met. “She expected you to run – all the time,” says a former staffer. “There was no walking. Nobody could walk, you always had to run – everywhere. She viewed walking as being lazy, so everyone always had to run.”

Another former aide added that the congresswoman would clock her on how long it took her to run an updated schedule print-out from Jackson Lee’s office in the Rayburn building to the House floor. “She would actually physically time you in terms of from office to getting to the [House] floor and finding her, hunting her down,” the staffer said. Then Jackson Lee would demand, “what took you so long?”

Her former drivers say the congresswoman demanded they run red lights and drive on highway shoulders around traffic. This caused at least one accident. As Jackson Lee was yelling at a staffer to drive faster she turned too sharply, smashing the side of her car into a wall.

Jackson Lee’s requests don’t stop at the end of a normal working day. “In the middle of the night, people had to go get her garlic. She’ll call you at two in the morning for garlic because she takes them as supplements,” a former staffer said. Jackson Lee’s garlic runs were confirmed by other staffers, too, though no one could remember the exact brand of the supplement. The deputy chief of staff “would have to go get it, and he would have to go drop it off. It was some kind of a multi-vitamin,” another former staffer said.

On Christmas Eve, one staffer was at a midnight mass ceremony at her church. When the boss called, the staffer didn’t answer. “She got so irritated that I wasn’t answering her call on Christmas Eve. So she called me every minute for 56 minutes,” the source recalled.

Jackson Lee on race

Jackson Lee has always been quick to assign racism as a motive of her political opponents and others. In 1997, for example, The Hill reported that the newly-elected congresswoman asked NASA officials whether the Mars Pathfinder photographed the American flag astronaut Neil Armstrong had planted on the surface of Mars. When it was pointed out that the flag in question was on the moon, not Mars, Jackson Lee cited bigotry. “You thought you could have fun with a black woman member of the Science Committee,” her then chief of staff wrote in a letter to the editor.

Jackson Lee recently blasted a Pepsi advertisement shown during the Super Bowl in which a black woman throws a can of soda at her husband for ogling an attractive white woman next to them. “It was not humorous. It was demeaning — an African-American woman throwing something at an African-American male and winding up hitting a Caucasian woman,” she thundered from the House floor.

In 2009, she helped prevent Rush Limbaugh from becoming an NFL owner. “He does not represent the fullness of appreciation of athletes of all diverse backgrounds, no matter what he wants to pretend to say on his radio station,” Jackson Lee said.

In 2003, she demanded that more Hurricanes be named with African American-sounding names.

A former staffer recalls one revealing episode during the height of the financial crisis in the waning months of the Bush administration. Jackson Lee demanded a meeting with a top Treasury aide, even though she did not sit on any of the committees with jurisdiction over financial matters. As her car pulled up outside the Treasury, Jackson Lee told her driver to park directly outside the door.

Due to the proximity of the Treasury Department’s headquarters to the White House, Secret Service officers told the driver not to park there. After an argument with the agents, who kept telling the driver to back off, Jackson Lee finally emerged from the building.

As the car drove away, a Secret Service van flashed its lights behind them. “Keep driving,” Jackson Lee told her staffer. Ultimately, the driver pulled over in defiance of the boss’s wishes. At this point, Jackson Lee emerged from the car, screaming, “I’m Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee! Who do you think you are?” to a team of Secret Service agents.

Jackson Lee accused the “white” agent at the gate of racism, claiming she wouldn’t have to deal with “this stuff” when Barack Obama became president. She then filed a formal complaint with the Secret Service, which prompted an investigation. A Treasury official later explained that the accusation had been dismissed because the agent in question was Hispanic, not white.

Given Jackson Lee’s apparent touchiness on racial questions, there’s a certain irony in the fact that aides claim she is far harsher to the African Americans who work for her. “’You stupid mother-effer’ was like a constant,” says one. “Like, all the time. But the interesting thing is she would really project that behavior more towards her African American staffers. She would have other ethnic groups in the office, like interns or whatnot. But it was really her African American staffers who she felt comfortable enough to really curse out…. This is something we always talked about. We chalked it up to her just feeling more comfortable acting out her aggression toward a certain group of people versus others.”

“She is very strange in who she insults and how. For some reason, it seemed like she was racist against African Americans,” another said.

Why she would come down harder on black staff was one of many mysteries that provoked endless speculation from those subject to her abuse.

“We would sit around and try to analyze why she was so miserable,” a former staffer said, “We all kind of felt bad for her. She was such a lonely, miserable person. And it must suck to work on Capitol Hill and have all of your colleagues hate you, right?”

The good, the bad, and the zany

And yet for all the nastiness, Jackson Lee also exhibits a zany side. She regularly asks that documents be printed in different colors. She has staff drive her from the Rayburn building to the Cannon building to attend homeland security hearings. She sometimes demands two staffers in two cars pick her up from the airport, one for her, the other for her luggage. On one occasion, she demanded an aide wear a green hat when picking her up.

One day in March of 2004, Jackson Lee told colleagues on her hall in Rayburn that the corridor would be closed from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. to accommodate her visit from Michael Jackson. The House Administration Committee promptly informed her that she had no authority to close a public hallway.

Staffers describe Jackson Lee as a hoarder. For example, she keeps over twenty boxes of the book “Black Americans in Congress” in her office, hundreds of copies in all. From time to time, she adds new copies of the same book to her collection.

Aides who’ve worked for Jackson Lee for years will call her on her cell phone and, despite the caller ID on her blackberry, she invariably answers, “This is Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.” When getting into the car in the morning, she will give her aide directions to the Rayburn building one block away, even if the aide has been driving her there every morning for months or years.

Jackson Lee’s speeches are frequent and eccentric enough to have occasioned a game in other Capitol Hill offices. Every day, one staffer puts money into a Sheila Jackson Lee jar. If she speaks on the House floor, as she usually does, the jar moves to the next desk. On the rare day she doesn’t speak, the staffer holding the jar wins all the money.

It’s funny, but not really

Not surprisingly, Jackson Lee has one of the highest staff turnover rates in Washington. Over the last ten years, at least 39 staffers have left within one year. Over that time, Lee has employed at least nine chiefs of staff, eight legislative directors, and 18 schedulers or executive assistants, according to records of federal disclosure forms published by the website Legistorm. Nine staffers left within two months, 25 within 6 months.

The many veterans of Jackson Lee’s office meet regularly for drinks and stories. We “still get together to have a cathartic release,” says one. “We sit around and tell these stories and just work ourselves into a state of rage.”

Jackson Lee’s view

TheDC made several vigorous attempts to speak to Jackson Lee about her staff’s accounts of life in her office. Jackson Lee made an even more vigorous effort not to answer the questions.

This Monday, after 6:30 p.m. votes, Jackson Lee spoke to an empty House chamber in celebration of African American history month, veering off topic to blast Republicans for trying to cut spending. “Why do you have to have your way or the highway?” she asked.

Afterwards, she went into the Democratic cloakroom, a lobby alongside the House floor where lawmakers often congregate. After half an hour, I checked with the reliably helpful Capitol Hill police and other assorted staff to see if she’d left by another route, but apparently she had not. By this point, the lights in the House floor had been turned off, and every other lawmaker was gone. I knew from my reporting it could be hours. “She’s just sitting in there, forever!” I said to a group of policemen. They laughed knowingly. Finally, I left.

The following day during House votes, Jackson Lee briefly emerged from the House floor with her cell phone in hand. “Congresswoman, I need to interview you,” I said politely. She looked at me, scanning up from my waist to my face, said nothing and hurried back onto the House floor.

Later, she held two meetings in the wood-paneled Rayburn Room. The room has only two exits, one of them into a hallway, the other to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office. As the meeting ended and she got up to leave, a staffer whispered to her. Jackson Lee walked quickly toward Pelosi’s office. “Congresswoman! Congresswoman! Congresswoman Jackson Lee!” I said. She muttered something about a “meeting” and escaped into the office.

Finally, I went to Jackson Lee’s own office in the Rayburn building. Her press secretary was not available. I spoke instead to a woman at the front desk, explaining that I had spoken with many of the congresswoman’s former aides, most of whom had damning things to say about Jackson Lee. The woman laughed. She knew all about the article. I gave her my cell phone number, but Jackson Lee never called.""

Surprise 1 person at Lonely Lodge who had RPGs, barely survive. Attacked by 3 butt-shooters one after another in the middle of the 2HP storm, barely survive. Attacked by neighborhood watch and the coast guard at Loot Lake, barely survive. Climbed mountain, built fort, let people maul each other. Quick scoped a gas station attendant for a Victory Royale! I was up too late...

------------------------

It's 1:30 am, and I'm just trying to play some casual 50v50 for the night. I land in Pleasant Park, fight one guy, and then immediately get taken out by his comrade. I'm not interesting in him riding me like a pony, so I just leave the match early. Back at the lobby, I don't realize that 50v50 has reset to solo. This is where the fun (and swearing) begins.

I mark a waypoint for my fill squad in the hopes that someone will join their marker with mine at Lonely Lodge. No one does, which is typical of any fill game. That's when I notice... ""Oh fuck, I really wasn't in the mood for this..."" My win ratio (20.5% shameless brag) is too precious to me to just leave the match, so I decide to play it out.

I loot the main lodge, the south shacks, and the 2-story cabin when I notice the shack south of that just got its roof broken down. I immediately flank east, build up and wait for my prey to enter the cave to loot the next crate. ""Surprise mothafucka!"" I yell, Officer Doakes-style. I throw 2 grenades in and hit him with a bullet. He whips around and reverse-mothafuckas me with an RPG. I manage to kill him and survive thanks to all the shields I found.

""Shit!"" Storm's coming in, and I need to make it east of Tomato Town. I make it to the rock outcrop on the hill southeast of town just in time. Good, I'm saf-- WRONG! Queue MGS alert sound! I get shot in the buttcheek. Whipping around, I build a wall and see someone take one more shot before accidentally(?) falling down to the base of the tunnel. I go investigate the hillside by shooting into every bush I see like I'm in a 70s porno!

With only a minute left until the storm moves to the middle of Loot Lake, I decide he's too scared to advance on me while I have clear Obi-Wan Kenobi advantage of the hill. I build a ramp down the west side of the tunnel hill, cross the river past the cabin, and get into the CLUSTERFUCK THAT HISTORIANS DEEMED SO GRAPHIC, they had to rewrite social studies books so the past didn't seem so fucked up.

I simultaneously get hit from the north and southeast at the same time. I panic build. A lot. Everyone stops shooting for some reason, and I manage to reapply some shields while hiding under a shadowy wall and stairs Harry Potter would be proud of. With cover at my back, I quickly build some high ground and take out my south attacker that I can only assume was the person that fell down the hill earlier. You slippery snaaaaake!

Briefly looking north, don't see the other person, and I don't have time to give a single shit with the storm down my ass. But just as luck would have it, everyone would rather fight in a storm that could kill both of us instead of quietly making it to safety and then engaging. The north person rears his head over the hillside and opens fire. More panic building. I RPG him once, and then finish him off with a shotgun shot.

""I'll just quickly loot this guy for some bandages and the--""  MOTHAFUCKIN' WRONG AGAIN! A third person shows up to shoot-touch my butt, this time ELBOW-DEEP IN 2HP STORM DAMAGE! Fuck this, I'm mad now. ""My rockets will blot out the sun, you tooooool!"". I win...

...That fight. But I'm still in the storm that threatens to 2HP tickle me till I die from it. The last guy dropped a stack of 15 bandages, which will (hopefully) get me into the safe zone. The next zone has already been decided, and the Fortnite Gods have been merciful. But first... I must be tested...

Having to build over open water to not take massive storm damage, I exit Tickle Tempest by building brick to the Christmas tree island, stopping immediately so I'm not seen at the edge of the storm. I heal up with my last three bandages. Just as I finish, a player scuttling south along the east coast of the lake randomly turns to look at the lake... Right at me...

""Oooooohhhh fuuuudge!"" But I didn't say fudge. Panic build? Yup. I build two layers of brick stairs and start laying down floors to hopefully get over him and close the gap while he's shooting at me. All the shooting and building has now attracted the attention of the locals. The ones with snipers. Sniper rounds are ripping through the air past my outrageously handsome Asian face, none hitting their mark, much to the misfortune of my initial attacker that now has a new ventilation system installed in the top of his body, free of charge!

All is quiet for a while. The ADHD sniper has now erased all memories of my existence and set his gaze (and snowballs) towards other potential victims. Hiding north of the factories behind a ridge, I scavenge everything I can out of view of the sniper and plan my attack...

With 30 seconds left before the storm closes in, I build up to the north factory roof out of view. Someone (presumably the sniper) has already built a bridge between the roofs, which I use as an easy entrance to his perch. A few seconds of building and one shotgun shot was all I needed to reduce the sniper to pile of meat AND finish off the time I needed for my internship at the deli!

4 people left. I build up to the mountain just east of the gas station, south of Pleasant Park. All I quiet, until some explosions erupt from 2 people fighting behind the station. I watch and wait, because why stick my neck out when the others can maul themselves? In the frenzy, I see a 3rd person approach from the south. I take a potshot at him with my bolt-action, and body him. ""Impressive Star Fox!""

I lose sight of everyone for a brief moment. Silence ensues. Looking at the player count it's only... me and one other person! ""Oh fuck, I'm gonna win this! Don't call it a comeback!"" I see him! Peeking around the south wall of the station trying to snipe me... is victory. Sweet, sexy, finger-lickin' good accidental solo victory! My stairs are lined up parallel to his rifle. He expects me to peek at the closer end of the stairs. I dip out of sight, shift to the corner of the stairs furthest from him, line the shot up, stand and pull the trigger.

Headshot. VICTORY ROYALE! It's 3:20 am. Fuuuuuck...."
7m6ous,2,2017-12-26,"[Hiring] Full time multiple posts: Computer Hardware technician, technology enthusiast / technology inventory specialist &amp; shipping specialist / accounting &amp; management.",Artesian,SFBayJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayJobs/comments/7m6ous/hiring_full_time_multiple_posts_computer_hardware/,"My company has grown quite a bit in the past month and needs to expand rapidly to keep pace with an amazingly broad and billowing sales funnel which has quickly become a sales whirlpool. This is challenging work, sometimes physically and intellectually. Especially the technical parts. 

If you love computer technology, business management, custom service, hardware design, or anything related to those fields... this may be the perfect opportunity for you. More details available via PM. :) 

The teams/roles are as follows: 

_______

**Hardware/Build Team:** 

1.	You will report directly to the CEO and executive team and help on *day one hour one* to work through a massive log of orders for advanced technology equipment related to fin-tech computing / data management / cloud processing. This is a HARDWARE job, but if you have a particular penchant for installing and debugging Windows 10 Pro, then you will certainly love it here. [BuildaPC veterans please apply] 
2.	With massive sales happening every day, you need to be on your toes and able to handle high volume intake and processing of parts, occasional customer service, and minimal packing/shipping responsibilities as they arise. 

**Accounting/Management/Customer Responsiveness Team:** 

1.	Report directly to the CEO and CMO, your job is to keep orders coming in, processing existing orders into inventory, occasionally manage acquisitions of hardware components, and talk to customers every day to answer questions that I would judge as: 90% simple question/answer + 10% creative problem-solving in the computer hardware tech space. Again, BuildaPC veterans with a penchant for helping people, please apply! 
2.	If you'd like to focus more on the accounting, book-keeping, and management side of things, then your role will involve communicating with the CEO and CTO about funds management, tax information, filings, acquisitions, spending, payroll, and a larger focus on hiring (possible foray into the HR lead if this position goes well). 
3.	Casual attire. All supplies/tools provided. 

**Shipping/Receiving Specialist + Zen Master of Boxes:** 

1.	If you love packaging, wielding a box cutter (Safely), and you happen to own an SUV for transport (not required, but nice to have), then this position is for you. While not as specifically technical as some other roles at the company, you are the final voice when parcels go out to customers. Your role will quickly grow from working alongside the build team to managing some inventory and being fully responsible for packing and finishing products in a professional fashion, leading to a positive ""unboxing"" experience for the end-user. You can get full command of this workflow if you want. PRIOR packaging experience or high volume warehouse experience is desired but not required. You will be responsible for some sourcing of packing materials/boxes. 
2.	The transport portion of this job will see you being responsible for the safe delivery of critical merchandise to postal carriers or preparation of said merchandise for pickup. 
3.	Casual attire. All supplies/tools/etc. provided. 

**Management / Hand of the King:** 

1.	Experience required. References required. Join the management team early and gain a hand in shaping the future of the entire business. You will become the force that guides all processes smoothly and has a hand in anything they deem necessary. You will help the executive team make choices about future product launches, influence product design, parts acquisition, aesthetics, and future office/warehousing. You will have a leading role in future HR responsibilities, financial oversight, employee interviews/onboarding, and more. 
2.	If you like doing a lot of different things without focusing too deeply on any specific role in the hardware tech space, then this will be a great fit for you. With influence, care, and kindness you will be able to shape the ""voice"" and ""brand"" of the company in a major way. You may also be responsible for on-site client meetings and video conferencing with large-scale clients from time to time. 
3.	Business casual / Professional appearance may be required for these meetings, but most days you can remain casual. Basically: keep a change of nice clothes handy, but don't overthink it. 

_________________________

Fun/snacks/some meals provided. Self-starters highly desired.

Location: Glen Park, SF. *(3 mins from BART!)* 

PM for details, as before. For privacy, not much will be disclosed in public comments. Thanks so much for your interest! 

Internships with less responsibility ARE possible. Please inquire. No VISA sponsorship (yet). Must be a legal resident of the United States and generally enjoy the company of friends, advanced technology, and good sustainable food.

7m75fj,1,2017-12-26,Tips on a new Women Leadership Program,asociallyconstructed,womenleadership,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenleadership/comments/7m75fj/tips_on_a_new_women_leadership_program/,"Hello everyone! 

We are an incubation center, and currently we are working on a women leadership program. The program emerged as a result of a discussion with one of our startup teams. They stated that they need a female CXO, because 

*Their team consists of 4 men, and they need a new perspective to their project- preferably of a female's 

*They believe women are better in organizing, and multi-tasking, which they usually fail to perform 


 Thus, we have come up with an idea; why don't we start a program, where we will train newly graduated, or senior year female students with an aspiration to become leaders for 3 months, and start mentoring sessions for another 3 months, where they will also have a chance to intern at the startup, which they might be recruited in afterwards. Basically program looks like this: 

* We contact with our startups, especially the ones who require a CEO. 
* Perform a need assesment - what do they want in a leader? 
* Go headhunting for succesful senior year students, and newly graduates
* Prepare a curriculum based on the needs of the startups
* Assign women to the startups, and start internship process 
* Continue mentoring in the meantime 
* An orientation for the startups to eliminate gender biases 
* Eventual recruitment 

**Some notes:**  we will perform the trainings at our office, where they will be able to have a first hand experience in how a company works. We will provide the training to 5 women at max. (This will depend on how many startups are in need of a leader) We will provide scholarship to the women trainees during the program, and we will ask for 10% of their annual salary from the startup that will recruit them. 

We are very new to this area, and thus I wondered if you see any problems with this process, or would you have any recomendations to improve it? Any help will be extremely appreciated!

7m79au,19,2017-12-26,C++ Programmer,StalerHitlin,Project_Exodus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Project_Exodus/comments/7m79au/c_programmer/,"Hello!

I stumbled upon this sub when browsing /r/Paladins.
I'd like to contribute as a programmer. My skills in C++ include working with C++14 standards, Boost, also doing some low level stuff. 
My gamedev experience is sadly limited to just one month internship in a professional gamedev company, few small games made with use of SFML/Allegro5 libraries (including a 2D physics engine of my own), and I haven't tried the UE4 yet, but I do believe I can catch up with the missing knowledge if you give me few days.

I may not be available in a full time manner because of my university studies and other programming projects, but if you need someone who will be able to spend a few hours a week to do some programming chores, also help with solving problems and reviewing code, then I'm available.

7m7uj5,75,2017-12-26,"Me [27 M/F] with my GF [28 M/F] for 7 years, thinking of breaking up. Am I being selfish and unreasonable?",thrownewex,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7m7uj5/me_27_mf_with_my_gf_28_mf_for_7_years_thinking_of/,"We've been together for more than 7 years since we both were first-year university students. Our relationship began smoothly, we quickly developed a good understanding of each other and were highly intimate. As our relationship evolved over time we've also had some rough patches which we managed to resolve in an understanding and compassionate way. They were sometimes caused by immaturity, sometimes by bad judgment and lack of composure. The one thing none of us ever questioned was our mutual respect and care which remains until today.

We've both been doing many internships, summer jobs during our university years so every year we've been spending circa 4 months away from each other. This didn't affect the solidity of our relationship. We were both focusing primarily on our studies and future careers and not on our relationship. We were still spending time together, were intimate and supportive but didn't put too many expectations on each other. At least this is how I was feeling it back then.

After graduation, we started working and moved in together. This is when it became challenging, at least for me. She had a very stressful and unfulfilling job, so this started to affect her behavior because she was bringing all the stress back home with her. This resulted in her being very impulsive. The smallest misunderstandings were causing her to get angry. Our intimate life has also suffered from that. Of course, I was trying to look at the situation with a bit of a distance and be supportive as much as I could, but even after she found a new job and things got better for her, I was still noticing how she just couldn't deal with stress in a very convincing way. The way I felt our relationship at the time was as a one-way traffic. I have never bothered her with my struggles and anxieties and always dealt with them on my own, simply because I didn't feel she had the capacity to provide emotional support. Our relationship became tedious and frustrating for me, including our sex life.

She decided to pursue a Master's degree abroad. I fully supported her because I felt she needed that and it might be beneficial to our relationship. Things got better, although we were seeing each other only during holidays and semester vacations. We wanted to make the most out of our limited time together so each of us was giving his/her best. She's been struggling with the adaptation and the intensity of the life there and I was trying to be compassionate and support her as much as I could. I was also taking some weeks off in order to visit her and was helping with her assignments as I work in the field of her studies. She deliberated dropping off but I convinced her not to do it. She managed to take all of her exams and acknowledges that I played a significant part in her successful graduation.

A couple of weeks before she came back, I met another girl and we've gone out a couple of times. It might be the initial excitement or just being 2.5 years in long distance relationship takings its toll, but I was having a good time and was certainly feeling attracted to her. However, I've been always faithful and decided to cut my ties with this girl. My girlfriend was coming back I felt that the right thing to do was to give a chance to our relationship, although I wasn't feeling very excited about it. I was thinking that not being with someone had played into my mind and I wasn't being rational enough, also didn't want to leave her in such a difficult moment when she had no job and was feeling exhausted from her studies.

Now she's back and we're living together for 3 months. We get along pretty well and all seems to be ok. Needless to say, she brought up the topic of our long-term plans(marriage, home, kids etc.). I don't feel ready for that and cannot tell if it's me or her. I just don't feel ready to commit and would rather wait to see how things develop. She told me that I am the man she wants to spend her life with and would wait for me if she knows that I'm serious about it. The thing is that I do not feel convinced in our future. Personalitywise we get along pretty well, we respect and care for each other, but there are things that concern me. Also, our sex life is not great, because I don't feel she puts even half of the effort that I'm putting. She admittedly has a much lower sex drive than me, however, I don't want to neglect this because it is starting to cause serious incompatibility and frustration in my view. She knows how I'm feeling about this. I've always respected her limits and desires in terms of sex. I've never been and never will be pushy or be insisting in any way. 

Sometimes I ask myself why I stayed in this relationship for such a long time. Maybe I hoped that we'd be able to overcome the struggles together and everybody has ups and downs in life, people change and evolve. Being patient with people, including myself, has been rewarding for me so far but in this situation, I think I pretty much know what I'm getting and I don't feel very excited about it. It's good but not great. I think soon have to make my decision. I look after myself, have a good job and get a good amount of attention from other women so I've never been scared of breaking up. Maybe I was too concerned about her, I don't know. I want her to be happy, but if I'm not happy myself, then I won't be able to contribute to her happiness either. She is a committed and a loyal girl.

I'm posting this is because I wanted to get it off from my chest by writing it down. This, of course, is not everything but I tried to express the most important stuff. Let me know if I should clarify or add something. I'd very much appreciate your perspective on this matter because I might be missing something and thus being unreasonable and selfish.  
  ---   
  **TL;DR**:  I've been in a long-term relationship(7 years) and am thinking of breaking up. I feel that our relationship is good but not great. Am I being too selfish and unreasonable?

**Update:** Thank you for your answers so far. I forgot to mention that I told her about meeting the other girl. She had a similar experience(met another guy who was interested in her) a couple of years ago and decided to stay with me. We've always been clear about such things. This might not be the case for many people but we both consider being attracted to other people as normal, especially after a long time together."

I am a graduate student in a Computer Science related field. I am going to start my 2nd semester soon in the spring. I have done alright in my 1st semester, made a GPA of 3.5/4.0 but I feel like I could have done so much more if I tried harder. I feel like I wasted a lot of time and although I am currently making a lot of plans to study well for the next semester, **I do not trust myself to follow through** with them. I get distracted very easily and I never finish the things that I start. I keep looking for better materials, books or videos and I end up never really finishing at least one book or one video lesson completely.

I need to get an internship in the summer with a good company because I need to fulfill some credit hours but I feel like I do not have any practical knowledge. Also, I am planning to take difficult courses next semester and a MOOC, both of which require at least  4 hours of studying a day. How do I make myself actually do this? What are some things that work for you? What keeps you studying for long hours?

Please help! I really need some guidance. To sum it up, these are some of the things I wish to achieve in the next 4 months, and any advice specifically or generally related to them would be greatly appreciated : 
1. Revise everything that happened in classes by the end of the same day that it's been done 
2. Finish the coursework of a particular MOOC that I have been procrastinating a lot 
3. Work through all the problems from the reference books that we're following in class 
4. Permanently lose the habit of cramming just a couple days before midterms or finals 

Would meditation help? Or are there any study techniques that work for cases similar to mine?
 
Thank you in advance!

I actually had one say “I know you’re not my Mom’s age, and you seem closer to my age, but I know you’re older. It’s weird!” We all had a laugh about it after I said “yeah, it’s like I’m in my 30’s or something!” Since then, I’ve noticed a trend of millennials thinking we were older versions of them- and not putting us in the category of adults, like they would put their boomer parents.          

Its good in some respects- they listen to us and don’t immediately write us off as ‘old and clueless’ about the world, and share their views and interests with us which is very helpful, especially in business! But, it’s also bad because they don’t respect us as elders with more life experience than them, even if we’re 15-20 years older. At this point, gen xers are often managers/CEOs vs boomers holding these positions, but we seems to be thought of as perpetual older siblings to them, never actual authorities. 

I often wonder why- is it the fact that there’s relatively so few of us represented in the workforce, or is it because many of us “raised ourselves” so we didn’t have those authority figures telling us how to act, so we don’t know how to command respect as well as boomers? "
7m94rz,1,2017-12-26,I'm doing nofap AND taking viagra at the same time,FalseProphet90,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7m94rz/im_doing_nofap_and_taking_viagra_at_the_same_time/,"Hello dear nofapper buddies. Today I thought I'd share with you guys a strange yet interesting experiment I'm doing. But before any of that I believe I must give you guys some context. I'm a 27-year-old chronic masturbator, with around 15 years of strong addiction. I've tried nofap before, with some good results (I think my longest streak was about 60 days), but always ended up relapsing, mostly in those dangerous moments when I'm home alone, with nothing to do and an internet connection. I guess the story is not that much unusual? Anyway, the results of my MO addiction (I only started using porn later in my life) came soon and were, as expected, devastating. Let me tell you that I've never been very mentally *healthy* by any stretch of the imagination. I had problems with anxiety very early in my life and could easily be diagnosed with social phobia as early as at the age of 7 or 8. Then fapping came along when I was 12 and, obviously, I started pouring all of my anxiety on MOing. I struggled through my teens without any medical help but when college came at 23 I just couldn't function as a normal human being. So I was put on SSRIs for generalized anxiety, social anxiety and OCD. The first drug I took was Zoloft, which seemed to do the job when it came to my anxiety, but left me emotionless and, as most antidepressants do, with barely any sexual drive. You might think 'well, isn't that good? wouldn't it make your life easier in terms of quitting PMO?' Well no. I had pretty much no sex drive but never stopped fapping. My addiction was so strong that I just fapped through the SSRI side-effects. Vey nasty state of affairs.

Now at the age of 27 I've had about 4-5 years of antidepressant treatment, took some other pills like tricyclics, atypical ADs and benzos. Right now I have what I'd call a mixture of PIED and SSRI induced ED. Now, I'm as socially awkward as a person can possibly be and still **a virgin**. It may sound strange for a virgin guy to talk about erectile dysfunction, but the thing is, recently (well, for some years now, actually) even fapping has become increasingly hard and my erections are not as strong as they used to be. I'd like to make the rest of the post in the format of questions and answers, to make it somewhat more dynamic, if I may.

* **Do you think the years of antidepressants use helped you stay away from PMO in any way?** No, I had almost zero sex drive but never really even decreased the frequency of my PMOing.

* **Do you still take anxiety pills?** Right now I don't. I recently stopped taking my antidepressants and only take the occasional Xanax when needed.

* **What do you think made you develop the ED that you now have?** Well, I think both the years of antidepressant use and the constant use of pornography contributed, but I can't tell which one made the most damage.

* **What is this nonsense about taking Viagra and doing nofap at the same time?** Ok, so this is where the story gets interesting. I had a long history of daily masturbation and some years of using pills that made me lose, I believe, a good portion of my potence. Then I recently stumbled upon [this study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-7262.2007.00233.x/full) on the internet and the premises actually gave me some hope. I was a 27-year-old that was pretty much impotent, so what did I have to lose? Less than one week later I had bought a month worth of pills and started taking them. Basically the article says that a group of men took 50mg of sildenafil (the generic of viagra) for 12 months and a significant portion of them showed statistically relevant improvement in their erectile function and penile blood flow, resulting in the conclusion that sildenafil could be used as a daily treatment for ED as opposed to the more usual 'when necessary' traditional use.

* **Do you take the real viagra?** No, I take generic sildenafil. I'm not rich by any standards (well, maybe I am compared to some folks in Sudan or something) and my budget is quite limited.

* **How do you take it?** Exactly the way the subjects of the study did. I take one 50mg pill every night at bedtime.

* **Does it work?** Yes, I get hard easily pretty much all the time.

* **How the hell are you not relapsing all the time while taking sildenafil?** Well, it's only been about six days since I started this experiment, but the reason I'm staying strong so far or, *the reasons*, would be, first, because I'm spending money on this, so every time I think of relapsing I'm like 'ho ho, hell no. I'm trying to make this work and even taking pills to try to recover my sexual function, so I better stick to nofap very seriously'. Secondly, because I'm desperate. I've suffered for too long because of my PMO addiction and I've had enough. If someday I should find someone to have a relationship with, I think I should at least try to recover some of my sexual function.

* **Would you recomment this same experiment to other men in this subreddit?** *No*. This involves the use of medication and I'm not a doctor, so if you die I'll be fucked.

* **Do you have any authority in this subject whatsoever?** Well, although I said in the question above that I'm not a doctor, I'm actually in the fith year of medical school and have just finished my urology internship last month and, not trying to brag or anything, [this guy](http://www.issm.info/who-we-are/member-profiles/luiz-otavio-torres) was my preceptor. The man has just been elected to be the chairman of the international society for sexual medicine for the next two years. I can say that I've learned a thing or two from him. Let me repeat so that there's no confusion: **I'm not a doctor (yet), so I'm not making any formal recommendations, ok? ok.**

* **For how long do you plan on taking sildenafil?** I've set my mind on taking it for a year, like the researchers had their patients in the aforementioned study.

* **How long do you plan on continuing nofap?** I don't have any plans of ever quitting.

* **If anyone reads this, what should they take from it?** First of all, PIED is real. Masturbation is a waste of time and energy, and you should keep your virility healthy for a happy relationship with a woman (or man, whatever you like). Now, I feel like it's my obligation to say this, although I don't have much any reference to give you: If you see yourself in need of taking antidepressants for whatever reason, try talking to your doctor and see if you can work out something other than SSRIs. I'm not saying this as an expert or anything, I'm saying this as a fellow nofapper who would be happy to at least try and make a positive difference in the lives of his comrades. Maybe you could try mirtazapine or wellbutrin (both known for having pretty much no sexual side effects) or maybe trazodone. I myself recently took mirtazapine and actually had a significant **increase** in my libido, which of course wasn't any good for nofap purposes. Now, some of you may argue that SSRIs don't cause any persistent sexual dysfunction after you stop taking them. Well, in my case they did, and there are some studies that attest that it could happen.

I know this was a long-ass text, but I hope it may help some of you in your journey. 

Stay strong.

We have just published an article on Failory written by Amir Rajan, in which he tells the story behind his mobile game, called “A Dark Room”, which hit #1 on the App Store and grossed over $800,000. Sit down and read his success story. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions, I will happily answer them below.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

Sit back. This is gonna be a long one.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

Did the whole ""get a degree, get a job"" thing. Ended up being incredibly well paid, but horribly empty because of corporate America. Decided to rage quit, downsize (sell pretty much everything I own), and take a sabbatical. After binge coding on random crap, I partnered with a guy in Canada and ported a web based, incremental, text based game to iOS (A Dark Room iOS). Welp. It went viral and hit the #1 spot. That let me extend my sabbatical for another three years. I built four more games, none of which succeeded. Now I'm back in Corporate America (luckily only part time now... I make enough off my games and other assets to not have to work all year).

&amp;nbsp;

**The Long Version:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Frustration:**

There is such a heavy dose of luck in success. There are those that will give one thousand percent, and because the roll of the dice wasn't perfect, nothing materializes. They have as much love for the game development as I have... they've worked as hard as I have... but just didn't get a kiss from Lady Luck. And it sucks. It just isn't fair that they want to create more than their next breathe, but can't catch a good break to devote time to it. They have to look over at those that have the privaledge to take multiple rolls of the dice, eat their cake and have it too, and if everything still fails, they get bailed out by mommy and daddy.

I was one of the lucky ones. I saved up for ten years, and was able to role _once_. I hit lucky number eleven. And even then, I still find myself having to grind in a 9 to 5 yet again. Sometimes it's fine. Other times I feel like I should have never taken that sabbatical and remained ignorant of the pure joy that comes from putting yourself in a creation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Before Sabbatical:**

I did what you were supposed to do. Did well (really well) in school. Went to college. Got a degree in Software Engineering and Computer Science. Did internships and landed a job as a developer for an insurance company right out of college. I did that for three years (two years of internships, one year as a full time employee). I then went to work for a company that build veterinary software. Did that for a couple of years. I really really loved coding. Lived and breathed it. I interviewed at a prestigious consulting company and got in on the ground floor. Spent three years there only to be scooped up by another consulting powerhouse. So here I am with a disgusting $140,000 in total compensation. A sea of cubicals, souless sheep that want nothing more than to do their time and go home. I didn't belong cause I actually cared about my craft. I tried to compensate for my unfulfilling corporate work with open source development after hours. This put a toll on my familial relationships (spending 45 hours a week working, then trying to get another 30 hours on nights and weekends, doesn't leave much time for anything else). I was at the brink of collapse. Lose my sanity, my wife, or my job. I decided to get rid of the job. I liquidated my 401k savings (took all the tax penalties up front), and said ""alright, gonna live off of this for as long as I can until I figure something out"".

&amp;nbsp;

**During Sabbatical:**

It was great to breathe. I was 178 pounds at 5'8 (a little portly). That changed during the sabbatical. It took me three months just to _figure out_ what my routine looked like. I'd code on whatever my heart desired. It was wonderful. I didn't even know what day it was. I didn't miss my stuff. I didn't miss the anxiety attacks I got Sunday nights before having to go to work. All of that gone. By month four I came across the web based version of A Dark Room. I immediately connected with its sparse presentation. I reached out the Michael and asked his permission to port it to mobile. That night I lost track of time. I blinked and it was 3am. I had never felt that kind of loss of time before. Nothing around me existed, it was just me and my creation. After another four months, A Dark Room was done and released to the App Store. It got a whopping thirty downloads the first day. I didn't care. Cause it was my creation and it was awesome. I redesigned so much of the original game. So much of me went into it. Oh and I dropped 30 pounds too. Best shape of my life.

I still remember one of my happiest days. It was early January. I was working on a stupid little multiplayer fighting game written in JavaScript and Pixi.js. I didn't care that ADR was barely getting 10 downloads a day, I didn't care that my savings was dwindling away. I found what I was supposed to do (build digital, evocative experiences).

&amp;nbsp;

**Savings Dwindling:**

The party was over at this point. My savings was dwindling down. A Dark Room was making its meager two thousand downloads a month (after Apple's cut, taxes, and splits, that's not a lot of take home). I started interviewing again for a job. I was better mentally, physically. And I never want my wife's quality of live to suffer (she was still in college at the time). Being the main bread winner of the home, I knew I had to suck it up and go back to work. I wasn't okay with it, but I knew it was my responsibility. I was interviewing again for those big salaries. I would save as much as possible given my now humble lifestyle. After I had enough cash tucked away, I'd quit and try again. Then. A Dark Room went viral. Out of nowhere it made $800 in one day. Then it made $1,200 in one day. Then it made $5,000. Then it made $8,000. Then it hit the #1 spot and I woke up to a $20,000 sales report.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Dark Room at #1:**

A Dark Room stayed at the number one spot. I was elated the first day. I was on cloud nine the second day. Then reality reared its ugly face with a sobering message: ""this will come to an end.""

So I waited for it to come to an end. I didn't sleep for 18 days. My life: was hitting the refresh button on the App Store, seeing if I had fallen. I'd do it every 3 hours on the hour, day or night. I did it for eighteen days. I read every review that came through. I'd refresh the page again and see if I had dropped. This was my life. I was waiting for all this success to end. 250,000 downloads later, A Dark Room finally fell from the #1 spot. It was over. From there sales dwindled. After another four months, I was down to 100 downloads a day. I had recouped what I had ""spent"" taking the sabbatical (and then some). My wife was tired of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment. So, we put a huge down payment on a house.

&amp;nbsp;

**After A Dark Room Fell:**

I built a prequel to A Dark Room called The Ensign. It did okay (nowhere near as successful.. but not bad... this was around the time I did my interview with Indie Hackers). I wrote a book about Surviving the App Store too. I put my heart and soul into a game inspired by Edwin Abbot's ""Flatland: Romance of Many Dimensions"" called A Noble Circle. I created a digital Go board after binge watching Hikaru no Go. I built a touched based mobile RTS called Mildly Interesting RTS (MIRTS for short). Every game had ""me"" in it. I didn't do ads, I didn't do micro-transactions, scummy energy bars, and all those other bullshit monetization tactics. I ported A Dark Room to Android (which was almost not worth it). I did everything to keep building games. I wrote about all of my journey, presented, did podcasts, hoping to inspire others. And yet revenue kept dwindling. The writing was on the wall. Everything I did after ADR wasn't enough. And I got a job.

&amp;nbsp;

**Now:**

So here I am. Updating all my games to work well on iPhone X. Because I love them. I try to build what I can in my free time. But I'm back in Corporate America (it's been ten months so far). Two months in, everything became too real. My journey as a game dev was really over. I got so frustrated. I purged everything online. Took the book down, deleted all of my Reddit entries, my developer logs, my open source games. I removed all of it. All the content I created felt like a lie. Cause even with all this ""success"", I couldn't keep my dream going. I felt so much worse off because I got a taste of a fulfilling life that I wish I had been ignorant to. It has been eight months since ""The Purge"". I'm _much_ better now. Mostly invisible outside of already established relationships. I stream occasionally on Twitch, keep my games maintained, and work on new ones as time allows.

I no longer deal with anxiety attacks Sunday nights at the thought of ""clocking in"" Monday morning. I'm at peace with it. The people I once called sheep, aren't that. They just didn't have the means to roll the dice. All code I see is beautiful in its own way. It tells a story of the resonable programmers put in unresonable situations. Again, I'm one of the lucky ones. Because maybe in another year, I'll have enough _play money_ saved up to role the dice again.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Silver Lining:**

My games provide a stable passive income (and I have a _decade_ worth of an emergency funds in the bank). A Dark Room recently hit the #2 spot _overall_ on Google Play (pro tip: stick to iOS, the revenue is almost an order of magnitude better). More importantly, I've very recently acquired the platform that helped me create my labors of love: RubyMotion. So between my games, subscription revenue, and my well paying contract gigs, I do alright for myself. Thank you Lady Luck. And my sincerest, deepest apologies for the 99.9999% that will never see the ""failure"" I've seen. I really do empathize with you. And I wish I had a better story.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Numbers?**

I'm sure some of you are asking about numbers. Do you remember the title of this post? Do you remember what I said about the 99.9999% failure rate? Do your remember what I said about privaledge, and eating your cake and having it too? What's the point of talking about the numbers I'm making now? So you can dream about one day making these numbers too? You wont. Start with that and work from there.

But if you really want numbers, here are some of the numeric sacrifices I made to role the dice _once_:

- Have a 4.0 GPA through High School.

- Graduate #36 out of a class of 800+.

- Go to a community college cause it's cheap.

- Work two jobs in the summer to pay for college and save up.

- Go to university in 2001 when it was still possible to pay out of  pocket and graduate without crippling debt.

- Get a degree in something that is valued. Even better if you  actually like what you got a degree in.

- Land a job right out of school that makes you $55k a year.

- Live off of $15k a year. Don't buy a house. Don't buy a fancy  car. Just save.

- Do this for a year.

- Land a job that makes you $100k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution.

- Celebrate by living off of $30k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Land a job that makes you $140k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution. Get a Roth, put $5k a year into that.

- Celebrate by living off of $60k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Don't have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic  events that leave you bankrupt. Probably best to just not leave the house.

- Quit your job. Sell everything. Liquidate your 401k. Pay all the tax  penaties.

- Live without insurance cause COBRA costs $2000 a month. Still Don't  have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic events that  leave you bankrupt.

- Now you can take a year and a half off and roll the dice _once_. Now  you can read all the success stories online and dream that you'll  get that too.

But you probably wont. And that's okay.

A Dark Room was making its meager two thousand downloads a month (after Apple's cut, taxes, and splits, that's not a lot of take home). I started interviewing again for a job. I was better mentally, physically. And I never want my wife's quality of live to suffer (she was still in college at the time). Being the main bread winner of the home, I knew I had to suck it up and go back to work. I wasn't okay with it, but I knew it was my responsibility. I was interviewing again for those big salaries. I would save as much as possible given my now humble lifestyle. After I had enough cash tucked away, I'd quit and try again. Then. A Dark Room went viral. Out of nowhere it made $800 in one day. Then it made $1,200 in one day. Then it made $5,000. Then it made $8,000. Then it hit the #1 spot and I woke up to a $20,000 sales report.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Dark Room at #1:**

A Dark Room stayed at the number one spot. I was elated the first day. I was on cloud nine the second day. Then reality reared its ugly face with a sobering message: ""this will come to an end.""

So I waited for it to come to an end. I didn't sleep for 18 days. My life: was hitting the refresh button on the App Store, seeing if I had fallen. I'd do it every 3 hours on the hour, day or night. I did it for eighteen days. I read every review that came through. I'd refresh the page again and see if I had dropped. This was my life. I was waiting for all this success to end. 250,000 downloads later, A Dark Room finally fell from the #1 spot. It was over. From there sales dwindled. After another four months, I was down to 100 downloads a day. I had recouped what I had ""spent"" taking the sabbatical (and then some). My wife was tired of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment. So, we put a huge down payment on a house.

&amp;nbsp;

**After A Dark Room Fell:**

I built a prequel to A Dark Room called The Ensign. It did okay (nowhere near as successful.. but not bad... this was around the time I did my interview with Indie Hackers). I wrote a book about Surviving the App Store too. I put my heart and soul into a game inspired by Edwin Abbot's ""Flatland: Romance of Many Dimensions"" called A Noble Circle. I created a digital Go board after binge watching Hikaru no Go. I built a touched based mobile RTS called Mildly Interesting RTS (MIRTS for short). Every game had ""me"" in it. I didn't do ads, I didn't do micro-transactions, scummy energy bars, and all those other bullshit monetization tactics. I ported A Dark Room to Android (which was almost not worth it). I did everything to keep building games. I wrote about all of my journey, presented, did podcasts, hoping to inspire others. And yet revenue kept dwindling. The writing was on the wall. Everything I did after ADR wasn't enough. And I got a job.

&amp;nbsp;

**Now:**

So here I am. Updating all my games to work well on iPhone X. Because I love them. I try to build what I can in my free time. But I'm back in Corporate America (it's been ten months so far). Two months in, everything became too real. My journey as a game dev was really over. I got so frustrated. I purged everything online. Took the book down, deleted all of my Reddit entries, my developer logs, my open source games. I removed all of it. All the content I created felt like a lie. Cause even with all this ""success"", I couldn't keep my dream going. I felt so much worse off because I got a taste of a fulfilling life that I wish I had been ignorant to. It has been eight months since ""The Purge"". I'm _much_ better now. Mostly invisible outside of already established relationships. I stream occasionally on Twitch, keep my games maintained, and work on new ones as time allows.

I no longer deal with anxiety attacks Sunday nights at the thought of ""clocking in"" Monday morning. I'm at peace with it. The people I once called sheep, aren't that. They just didn't have the means to roll the dice. All code I see is beautiful in its own way. It tells a story of the resonable programmers put in unresonable situations. Again, I'm one of the lucky ones. Because maybe in another year, I'll have enough _play money_ saved up to role the dice again.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Silver Lining:**

My games provide a stable passive income (and I have a _decade_ worth of an emergency funds in the bank). A Dark Room recently hit the #2 spot _overall_ on Google Play (pro tip: stick to iOS, the revenue is almost an order of magnitude better). More importantly, I've very recently acquired the platform that helped me create my labors of love: RubyMotion. So between my games, subscription revenue, and my well paying contract gigs, I do alright for myself. Thank you Lady Luck. And my sincerest, deepest apologies for the 99.9999% that will never see the ""failure"" I've seen. I really do empathize with you. And I wish I had a better story.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Numbers?**

I'm sure some of you are asking about numbers. Do you remember the title of this post? Do you remember what I said about the 99.9999% failure rate? Do your remember what I said about privaledge, and eating your cake and having it too? What's the point of talking about the numbers I'm making now? So you can dream about one day making these numbers too? You wont. Start with that and work from there.

But if you really want numbers, here are some of the numeric sacrifices I made to role the dice _once_:

- Have a 4.0 GPA through High School.

- Graduate #36 out of a class of 800+.

- Go to a community college cause it's cheap.

- Work two jobs in the summer to pay for college and save up.

- Go to university in 2001 when it was still possible to pay out of  pocket and graduate without crippling debt.

- Get a degree in something that is valued. Even better if you  actually like what you got a degree in.

- Land a job right out of school that makes you $55k a year.

- Live off of $15k a year. Don't buy a house. Don't buy a fancy  car. Just save.

- Do this for a year.

- Land a job that makes you $100k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution.

- Celebrate by living off of $30k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Land a job that makes you $140k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution. Get a Roth, put $5k a year into that.

- Celebrate by living off of $60k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Don't have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic  events that leave you bankrupt. Probably best to just not leave the house.

- Quit your job. Sell everything. Liquidate your 401k. Pay all the tax  penaties.

- Live without insurance cause COBRA costs $2000 a month. Still Don't  have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic events that  leave you bankrupt.

- Now you can take a year and a half off and roll the dice _once_. Now  you can read all the success stories online and dream that you'll  get that too.

But you probably wont. And that's okay.

I have posted a similar topic a few months ago on r/Switzerland, but I think now that the date is closer to that of my departure and more information has been finalized, I feel like this warrants a thread to clarify certain questions.

Background information: I am a 24 year old undergraduate from Singapore (I'm Singaporean Chinese), whom will be going for a 6-months intern in Rapperswil (I'm staying in Rapperswil as well), Switzerland as part of my curriculum to attain my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

1. A friend suggested that I should buy the tickets early (I plan to travel within Switzerland during the weekends before exploring out to the nearby European countries) because it would be cheaper. Is the price difference very big as compared to booking the train tickets nearer to the departure date itself?
2. Do the prices in Asian Supermarkets tend to be expensive? And would there be a interested demographic if I were to whip up food from my home country and then sell it? 
3. I used a cost of living comparing website (numbeo.com) to get a gauge of the cost of living in Zurich. I noticed that the price listed for eggs are CHF 6 for a carton of 12, CHF 28 for 1 kg of boneless and skinless chicken breasts, etc. Are these prices reflective of the groceries sold in chains like Migros and Coop or even Lidl and Aldi?
4. I play basketball, so I was just wondering if there are any demographics over there (or even in Zurich) for basketball? More specifically, is it easy to find a pick up game, and are there any sort of amateur leagues? Especially in winter!
5. Would there be ice hockey games in Rapperswil? It has long been on my bucket list to watch an ice hockey game after somehow being enamored with it from watching too much HIMYM. 
6. More of a packing question - would I be silly to pack shorts for my trip? (I'm male!)
7. I plan to purchase a watch for myself as a gift and good luck on arrival as I've heard that the Swiss are world renowned for their watches, so I was wondering where would be the best place to purchase 1 - at a boutique shop, or from bigger brands like Tissot, and also, are there places where I should not shop from as the prices are marked up for tourists? 
8. Pretty silly question but rosti is one of my favorite foods - how common can it be found in Switzerland and how expensive is it? Also, bratwursts and currywursts.
9. It would also be the first time in my life that I am spending Chinese New Year away from my family and my friends (whom are going for exchange programmes in different parts of Europe, think France, Czech, Scotland, etc) might want to have a meet up somewhere to have a feeling of home. Does Switzerland have Chinese food (like steamboats or hotpots) and does it celebrate Chinese New Year? Or would somewhere else in Europe be more monetary-friendly for us students on a budget?
10. Last but not least, as I have only the weekends to travel bar holidays and long weekends, I think I have to travel out by domestic flights or regional flights should I want to venture out of Switzerland... As such, do the flight prices vary a lot from the train ticket prices? 

If you have taken the time to read my questions or even answered them, I am really thankful! I know maybe a couple of questions can be easily answered online but the answers I got were either generic or might be outdated and I just feel more secure if I can get a updated human response in real time. Otherwise, hope you guys have had a belated Merry Christmas! 

It's about 3 weeks before I embark on this journey and I honestly can't wait to embrace your culture and scenery over there! :)"

We have just published an article on Failory written by Amir Rajan, in which he tells the story behind his mobile game, called “A Dark Room”, which hit #1 on the App Store and grossed over $800,000. Sit down and read his success story. I hope you enjoy it and if you have any questions, I will happily answer them below.

&amp;nbsp;

*****

Sit back. This is gonna be a long one.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

Did the whole ""get a degree, get a job"" thing. Ended up being incredibly well paid, but horribly empty because of corporate America. Decided to rage quit, downsize (sell pretty much everything I own), and take a sabbatical. After binge coding on random crap, I partnered with a guy in Canada and ported a web based, incremental, text based game to iOS (A Dark Room iOS). Welp. It went viral and hit the #1 spot. That let me extend my sabbatical for another three years. I built four more games, none of which succeeded. Now I'm back in Corporate America (luckily only part time now... I make enough off my games and other assets to not have to work all year).

&amp;nbsp;

**The Long Version:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Frustration:**

There is such a heavy dose of luck in success. There are those that will give one thousand percent, and because the roll of the dice wasn't perfect, nothing materializes. They have as much love for the game development as I have... they've worked as hard as I have... but just didn't get a kiss from Lady Luck. And it sucks. It just isn't fair that they want to create more than their next breathe, but can't catch a good break to devote time to it. They have to look over at those that have the privaledge to take multiple rolls of the dice, eat their cake and have it too, and if everything still fails, they get bailed out by mommy and daddy.

I was one of the lucky ones. I saved up for ten years, and was able to role _once_. I hit lucky number eleven. And even then, I still find myself having to grind in a 9 to 5 yet again. Sometimes it's fine. Other times I feel like I should have never taken that sabbatical and remained ignorant of the pure joy that comes from putting yourself in a creation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Before Sabbatical:**

I did what you were supposed to do. Did well (really well) in school. Went to college. Got a degree in Software Engineering and Computer Science. Did internships and landed a job as a developer for an insurance company right out of college. I did that for three years (two years of internships, one year as a full time employee). I then went to work for a company that build veterinary software. Did that for a couple of years. I really really loved coding. Lived and breathed it. I interviewed at a prestigious consulting company and got in on the ground floor. Spent three years there only to be scooped up by another consulting powerhouse. So here I am with a disgusting $140,000 in total compensation. A sea of cubicals, souless sheep that want nothing more than to do their time and go home. I didn't belong cause I actually cared about my craft. I tried to compensate for my unfulfilling corporate work with open source development after hours. This put a toll on my familial relationships (spending 45 hours a week working, then trying to get another 30 hours on nights and weekends, doesn't leave much time for anything else). I was at the brink of collapse. Lose my sanity, my wife, or my job. I decided to get rid of the job. I liquidated my 401k savings (took all the tax penalties up front), and said ""alright, gonna live off of this for as long as I can until I figure something out"".

&amp;nbsp;

**During Sabbatical:**

It was great to breathe. I was 178 pounds at 5'8 (a little portly). That changed during the sabbatical. It took me three months just to _figure out_ what my routine looked like. I'd code on whatever my heart desired. It was wonderful. I didn't even know what day it was. I didn't miss my stuff. I didn't miss the anxiety attacks I got Sunday nights before having to go to work. All of that gone. By month four I came across the web based version of A Dark Room. I immediately connected with its sparse presentation. I reached out the Michael and asked his permission to port it to mobile. That night I lost track of time. I blinked and it was 3am. I had never felt that kind of loss of time before. Nothing around me existed, it was just me and my creation. After another four months, A Dark Room was done and released to the App Store. It got a whopping thirty downloads the first day. I didn't care. Cause it was my creation and it was awesome. I redesigned so much of the original game. So much of me went into it. Oh and I dropped 30 pounds too. Best shape of my life.

I still remember one of my happiest days. It was early January. I was working on a stupid little multiplayer fighting game written in JavaScript and Pixi.js. I didn't care that ADR was barely getting 10 downloads a day, I didn't care that my savings was dwindling away. I found what I was supposed to do (build digital, evocative experiences).

&amp;nbsp;

**Savings Dwindling:**

The party was over at this point. My savings was dwindling down. A Dark Room was making its meager two thousand downloads a month (after Apple's cut, taxes, and splits, that's not a lot of take home). I started interviewing again for a job. I was better mentally, physically. And I never want my wife's quality of live to suffer (she was still in college at the time). Being the main bread winner of the home, I knew I had to suck it up and go back to work. I wasn't okay with it, but I knew it was my responsibility. I was interviewing again for those big salaries. I would save as much as possible given my now humble lifestyle. After I had enough cash tucked away, I'd quit and try again. Then. A Dark Room went viral. Out of nowhere it made $800 in one day. Then it made $1,200 in one day. Then it made $5,000. Then it made $8,000. Then it hit the #1 spot and I woke up to a $20,000 sales report.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Dark Room at #1:**

A Dark Room stayed at the number one spot. I was elated the first day. I was on cloud nine the second day. Then reality reared its ugly face with a sobering message: ""this will come to an end.""

So I waited for it to come to an end. I didn't sleep for 18 days. My life: was hitting the refresh button on the App Store, seeing if I had fallen. I'd do it every 3 hours on the hour, day or night. I did it for eighteen days. I read every review that came through. I'd refresh the page again and see if I had dropped. This was my life.

After another four months, I was down to 100 downloads a day. I had recouped what I had ""spent"" taking the sabbatical (and then some). My wife was tired of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment. So, we put a huge down payment on a house.

&amp;nbsp;

I wrote a book about Surviving the App Store too. I put my heart and soul into a game inspired by Edwin Abbot's ""Flatland: Romance of Many Dimensions"" called A Noble Circle. I created a digital Go board after binge watching Hikaru no Go. I built a touched based mobile RTS called Mildly Interesting RTS (MIRTS for short). Every game had ""me"" in it.

I'm a mediocre machinist. I know you can think ""well if you sell yourself short no wonder you're unemployed"". Let me tell you about me, but if you only care about my specific question without a long context, you can go to the last paragraph. 

I'm a mechanical engineering student, but my school has a weird system. Here in Colombia (where I'm from and live), most bachelors take 5 years. And in my school, when you complete the courses assigned up to 3rd year, you have to apply for an associates degree before you can continue to the engineering. So with my associates courses finished and while working on my graduation project, I did an internship as maintenance assistant in a rebar production plant; the work environment was very hostile and when it ended they had no interest in hiring me. So it was time to look for my first real job. After a couple months I was called for an interview with a defence contractor that does maintenance for the Colombian government and armed forces. It was to work on a small production workshop they have, programming/operating both CNC and traditional machinery. And I pretty much got that job out of dumb luck. 

You'll see, back in the associates courses, despite that system, the courses aren't really structured so you learn something that would land you in a job when you get the associates. They simply cut mechanical engineering in third year and call it a day. I had one course on basic workshop manual work, next one on lathe and milling, disappointingly basic, and then one on CNC, with only two machine practices in the whole semester. Those curses were never planned to prepare us to work as machinists, more like a general knowledge thing for mechanical engineers. With that extremely basic knowledge, and the certification of working as lab assistant in my university, I went and lied my ass off in the interview, claiming to have much more experience than I actually did. But I basically got the job because it was only me and some other guy applying for it, and the other guy got super nervous because the HR interviewer was very pretty

I learned a lot in that first job, but since I knew next to nothing when I begun, it didn't make me a great machinist. I was there 8 months while they needed an extra operator for a big project they had. What I mostly learned about was operating a lathe and milling machine with Haas controllers, but didn't have much time to learn about actual programming. Back in school, we were only taught G1, G2 and 3, make the machine and spindle move and that was it, not a thing on cycles, tool compensation, mirroring dr other tricks. 

After that gig, my next job was with a company that repairs oil equipment. There I was in charge of programming a big ass 5 axis boring machine, fitted with a Fanuc control, but which apparently hadn't received any maintenance since that control was fitted in 1996, because the damn thing would't move smoothly as any CNC machine is supposed to move, but moved in jumps of several cents of a millimetre. With that machine I became well versed in working with macros because its small memory didn't allow for long programs and there wasn't a computer to link to it. But beyond that I didn't learn much else because most of the time my job was make rough passes to fix threads in blowout preventers, which later were finished by hand O_o (ikr?).

When I went back to school to finish the engineering I had to quit that job because besides weekday nights I had classes all Saturday, but my employed need complete availability. Then I kept my trend of not being unemployed for long and got a job with a small factory that does parts for semi truck suspensions and maintenance for machines from bigger factories. But I happened to be who knew most about mechanics there, so while I learned more on operation and programming while being there, I could've use the experience of someone who knew better than me. A big problem was that the bastards were very unreliable with salaries, and when I quite due to that, I learned that they set all up so I couldn't legally charge them what they owed me...

Once again I found a job soon, but this time I crashed with the reality that despite working almost three years as a machinist, my experience and knowledge where nowhere on the level most serious companies require. In that last place they focus on moulds, which of course demand very small tolerances. And I realised that in the previous job I also learned bad habits: I was too slow at mounting the parts in the machines, there were plenty of tools I didn't even knew that existed, and my programming wasn't efficient. I was ruining parts and tools every couple days. and after a month they decided to fire me; The manager told me that since I was only pending of my thesis to be an engineer, I should forget about a career as a machinist, and just look on one of the many other brands of mechanical engineering. That was back in July, and I'm still unemployed. Nearly all job openings for engineers demand at least two years of experience in super specific applications like HVAC designing, or international business. Unless you're the child of some rich businessman applying for a CEO job, employers here couldn't care less about your level of English. In part because of what the manager told me, in part because those 12 or more hour shifts 6 days a week are exhausting, most job offers are with weekly diurnal-nocturnal changing shifts, and mostly because the highest salary the majority of companies offer is $2.08 an hour for a machinist with at least two years of experience, when minimum wage here is $1.28 ah hour, I am not looking forward continuing a career as a machinist. But I seem to have no option, because is the only thing I have experience at. 

My confidence got a huge blow after being fired for incompetence. I've never received real formal training in machining and programming, and while I can program well at the machine's control board, or with a text processor, I am utterly ignorant about proper programming of 3D operations in mastercam. Sure, I can google tutorials on how to use specific functions, but those tutorials don't really instruct about what operations are better for which surfaces. But by far my worst shortcoming is my ignorance about feeds and speeds .I ignore how it works in Europe and the US, but here they're very zealous with tools so one rarely has access to the boxes and hence the stickers to identify the material and recommended feeds and speeds. And the tables I find online are limited and often contradictory. I can't afford a proper course on the matter, so I don't really know what can I do to improve, or if I even should try, and instead keep trying to change the focus of my career despite the severely limited opportunities...  Some have suggested me to look for a job abroad, but that just makes me wonder why would any employer bother hiring a mediocre machinist who requires a lot of paperwork to be hired, while they can get a local person more skilled than me. Any suggestions? "

That let me extend my sabbatical for another three years. I built four more games, none of which succeeded. Now I'm back in Corporate America (luckily only part time now... I make enough off my games and other assets to not have to work all year).

&amp;nbsp;

**The Long Version:**

&amp;nbsp;

**Frustration:**

There is such a heavy dose of luck in success. There are those that will give one thousand percent, and because the roll of the dice wasn't perfect, nothing materializes. They have as much love for the game development as I have... they've worked as hard as I have... but just didn't get a kiss from Lady Luck. And it sucks. It just isn't fair that they want to create more than their next breathe, but can't catch a good break to devote time to it. They have to look over at those that have the privaledge to take multiple rolls of the dice, eat their cake and have it too, and if everything still fails, they get bailed out by mommy and daddy.

I was one of the lucky ones. I saved up for ten years, and was able to role _once_. I hit lucky number eleven. And even then, I still find myself having to grind in a 9 to 5 yet again. Sometimes it's fine. Other times I feel like I should have never taken that sabbatical and remained ignorant of the pure joy that comes from putting yourself in a creation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Before Sabbatical:**

I did what you were supposed to do. Did well (really well) in school. Went to college. Got a degree in Software Engineering and Computer Science. Did internships and landed a job as a developer for an insurance company right out of college. I did that for three years (two years of internships, one year as a full time employee). I then went to work for a company that build veterinary software. Did that for a couple of years. I really really loved coding. Lived and breathed it. I interviewed at a prestigious consulting company and got in on the ground floor. Spent three years there only to be scooped up by another consulting powerhouse. So here I am with a disgusting $140,000 in total compensation. A sea of cubicals, souless sheep that want nothing more than to do their time and go home. I didn't belong cause I actually cared about my craft. I tried to compensate for my unfulfilling corporate work with open source development after hours. This put a toll on my familial relationships (spending 45 hours a week working, then trying to get another 30 hours on nights and weekends, doesn't leave much time for anything else). I was at the brink of collapse. Lose my sanity, my wife, or my job. I decided to get rid of the job. I liquidated my 401k savings (took all the tax penalties up front), and said ""alright, gonna live off of this for as long as I can until I figure something out"".

&amp;nbsp;

**During Sabbatical:**

It was great to breathe. I was 178 pounds at 5'8 (a little portly). That changed during the sabbatical. It took me three months just to _figure out_ what my routine looked like. I'd code on whatever my heart desired. It was wonderful. I didn't even know what day it was. I didn't miss my stuff. I didn't miss the anxiety attacks I got Sunday nights before having to go to work. All of that gone. By month four I came across the web based version of A Dark Room. I immediately connected with its sparse presentation. I reached out the Michael and asked his permission to port it to mobile. That night I lost track of time. I blinked and it was 3am. I had never felt that kind of loss of time before. Nothing around me existed, it was just me and my creation. After another four months, A Dark Room was done and released to the App Store. It got a whopping thirty downloads the first day. I didn't care. Cause it was my creation and it was awesome. I redesigned so much of the original game. So much of me went into it. Oh and I dropped 30 pounds too. Best shape of my life.

I still remember one of my happiest days. It was early January. I was working on a stupid little multiplayer fighting game written in JavaScript and Pixi.js. I didn't care that ADR was barely getting 10 downloads a day, I didn't care that my savings was dwindling away. I found what I was supposed to do (build digital, evocative experiences).

&amp;nbsp;

**Savings Dwindling:**

The party was over at this point. My savings was dwindling down. A Dark Room was making its meager two thousand downloads a month (after Apple's cut, taxes, and splits, that's not a lot of take home). I started interviewing again for a job. I was better mentally, physically. And I never want my wife's quality of live to suffer (she was still in college at the time). Being the main bread winner of the home, I knew I had to suck it up and go back to work. I wasn't okay with it, but I knew it was my responsibility. I was interviewing again for those big salaries. I would save as much as possible given my now humble lifestyle. After I had enough cash tucked away, I'd quit and try again. Then. A Dark Room went viral. Out of nowhere it made $800 in one day. Then it made $1,200 in one day. Then it made $5,000. Then it made $8,000. Then it hit the #1 spot and I woke up to a $20,000 sales report.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Dark Room at #1:**

A Dark Room stayed at the number one spot. I was elated the first day. I was on cloud nine the second day. Then reality reared its ugly face with a sobering message: ""this will come to an end.""

So I waited for it to come to an end. I didn't sleep for 18 days. My life: was hitting the refresh button on the App Store, seeing if I had fallen. I'd do it every 3 hours on the hour, day or night. I did it for eighteen days. I read every review that came through. I'd refresh the page again and see if I had dropped. This was my life. I was waiting for all this success to end. 250,000 downloads later, A Dark Room finally fell from the #1 spot. It was over. From there sales dwindled. After another four months, I was down to 100 downloads a day. I had recouped what I had ""spent"" taking the sabbatical (and then some). My wife was tired of living in a cramped one bedroom apartment. So, we put a huge down payment on a house.

&amp;nbsp;

**After A Dark Room Fell:**

I built a prequel to A Dark Room called The Ensign. It did okay (nowhere near as successful.. but not bad... this was around the time I did my interview with Indie Hackers). I wrote a book about Surviving the App Store too. I put my heart and soul into a game inspired by Edwin Abbot's ""Flatland: Romance of Many Dimensions"" called A Noble Circle. I created a digital Go board after binge watching Hikaru no Go. I built a touched based mobile RTS called Mildly Interesting RTS (MIRTS for short). Every game had ""me"" in it. I didn't do ads, I didn't do micro-transactions, scummy energy bars, and all those other bullshit monetization tactics. I ported A Dark Room to Android (which was almost not worth it). I did everything to keep building games. I wrote about all of my journey, presented, did podcasts, hoping to inspire others. And yet revenue kept dwindling. The writing was on the wall. Everything I did after ADR wasn't enough. And I got a job.

&amp;nbsp;

**Now:**

So here I am. Updating all my games to work well on iPhone X. Because I love them. I try to build what I can in my free time. But I'm back in Corporate America (it's been ten months so far). Two months in, everything became too real. My journey as a game dev was really over. I got so frustrated. I purged everything online. Took the book down, deleted all of my Reddit entries, my developer logs, my open source games. I removed all of it. All the content I created felt like a lie. Cause even with all this ""success"", I couldn't keep my dream going. I felt so much worse off because I got a taste of a fulfilling life that I wish I had been ignorant to. It has been eight months since ""The Purge"". I'm _much_ better now. Mostly invisible outside of already established relationships. I stream occasionally on Twitch, keep my games maintained, and work on new ones as time allows.

I no longer deal with anxiety attacks Sunday nights at the thought of ""clocking in"" Monday morning. I'm at peace with it. The people I once called sheep, aren't that. They just didn't have the means to roll the dice. All code I see is beautiful in its own way. It tells a story of the resonable programmers put in unresonable situations. Again, I'm one of the lucky ones. Because maybe in another year, I'll have enough _play money_ saved up to role the dice again.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Silver Lining:**

My games provide a stable passive income (and I have a _decade_ worth of an emergency funds in the bank). A Dark Room recently hit the #2 spot _overall_ on Google Play (pro tip: stick to iOS, the revenue is almost an order of magnitude better). More importantly, I've very recently acquired the platform that helped me create my labors of love: RubyMotion. So between my games, subscription revenue, and my well paying contract gigs, I do alright for myself. Thank you Lady Luck. And my sincerest, deepest apologies for the 99.9999% that will never see the ""failure"" I've seen. I really do empathize with you. And I wish I had a better story.

&amp;nbsp;‍

**Numbers?**

I'm sure some of you are asking about numbers. Do you remember the title of this post? Do you remember what I said about the 99.9999% failure rate? Do your remember what I said about privaledge, and eating your cake and having it too? What's the point of talking about the numbers I'm making now? So you can dream about one day making these numbers too? You wont. Start with that and work from there.

But if you really want numbers, here are some of the numeric sacrifices I made to role the dice _once_:

- Have a 4.0 GPA through High School.

- Graduate #36 out of a class of 800+.

- Go to a community college cause it's cheap.

- Work two jobs in the summer to pay for college and save up.

- Go to university in 2001 when it was still possible to pay out of  pocket and graduate without crippling debt.

- Get a degree in something that is valued. Even better if you  actually like what you got a degree in.

- Land a job right out of school that makes you $55k a year.

- Live off of $15k a year. Don't buy a house. Don't buy a fancy  car. Just save.

- Do this for a year.

- Land a job that makes you $100k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution.

- Celebrate by living off of $30k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Land a job that makes you $140k a year. Save the rest. Max out your 401k contribution. Get a Roth, put $5k a year into that.

- Celebrate by living off of $60k a year.

- Do this for three years.

- Don't have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic  events that leave you bankrupt. Probably best to just not leave the house.

- Quit your job. Sell everything. Liquidate your 401k. Pay all the tax  penaties.

- Live without insurance cause COBRA costs $2000 a month. Still Don't  have kids. Don't get sick. Don't have any catastrophic events that  leave you bankrupt.

- Now you can take a year and a half off and roll the dice _once_. Now  you can read all the success stories online and dream that you'll  get that too.

But you probably wont. And that's okay.

I am here seeking advice/help on how and where to start developing an ""enterprise application store"" like appPortal or appDeploy.

First off, im a fresh college graduate and currently an intern at my company and i am tasked to develop the above using ASP.NET,C#,PowerShell and MySQL.

I have a basic understanding and very little practical experience in asp.net and c#. I need resources/links/tutorials/case study/projects which are related to the mentioned project which i can go through and begin in a direction.

PS - They aren't expecting me to  develop a full fledged replica of appPortal but must include main components like software licence management, different user roles(admin,usergroup1, 2, so on..), authorization etc."

Charli XCX-mass or Charliheads, call it what you want as she dominates most of the top 10 this week. Carly Rae Jepsen unofficially gets her first #1 with 'Backseat' debuting at the top of the charts. Meanwhile, the songs from Pop2 that came out before the release of the mixtape charts at #2, #3 and #5 with 'Out of My Head', 'I Got It' and 'Unlock It' charting at those ranks respectively. Meanwhile, the newer songs 'Femmebot', 'Porsche' and 'Delicious' and 'Tears ' charts at #4, #7, #8 and #10. In an ironic placing, 'Track 10' debuts at #9.

The only other artist in the top 10 is BROCKHAMPTON as 'BOOGIE' peaks at #6 on its second week, making it the group's highest peak in the Hot 50 so far.

Charli XCX is the fourth artist to dominate the top 5 of the Hot 50. She would have been the third artist to dominate the entire top 10 if it weren't for BROCKHAMPTON blocking Charli's opportunity. Is hip-hop is cancelled for blocking Popheads' queen? Discuss.

Lemon increases 24 spots to #16, making it the song with the biggest gain this week. Unfortunately, not a good way to end Christmas as Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas is You decreases 34 spots to the bottom of the Hot 50. Maybe Mariah will have her revenge next week as the next tracking period is around Christmas time? 

* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #1. Charli XCX - Backseat (feat. Carly Rae Jepsen)	
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** N/A
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #16. N.E.R.D. &amp; Rihanna - Lemon (+24)  
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #50. Mariah Carey - All I Want For Christmas is You (-34)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs:

The Charli dominance has reached beyond the top ten as two of her other songs are in the Hot 50. Her collaboration with David Guetta, Afrojack and French Montana 'Dirty Sexy Money' charts at #34 on its seventh week while 'Boys' charts at #46.

With so much new music that was released last week, most of the Hot 50 is crowded with new releases from Charli, BROCKHAMPTON, N.E.R.D. and Eminem, on top with most of *reputation* still charting in the Hot 50.

Speaking of *reputation*, the lead single 'Look What You Made Me Do' lost 28 spots to #49. Will the song see itself out of the chart next week or this overwhelming quantity of new music has perverted LWYMMD to chart higher temporarily?

7ma0jj,2,2017-12-26,Grad School Internship,NobleProgeny,acting,https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/7ma0jj/grad_school_internship/,"I am currently in grad school getting my MFA in Acting. This is my second year and our third year is a year long internship. I’m trying to figure out what to do for it since it’s something we put together on our own. I eventually want to end up doing film and tv so LA is one of the places I’m looking at, along with Atlanta.

So I was wondering what kind of advice you had. Some questions I had were:

How did you go about getting your agent?

Do you only act or do you have another job to pay the bills? And if so how much time does that leave you to audition and such?

What are some affordable places to look for housing in LA/Atlanta?

Did you go straight to LA or did you start in a smaller market and work your way out there?"
7ma9qz,1,2017-12-26,M4A - TV Comedies (and Other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7ma9qz/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7maxlf,0,2017-12-26,Me [21 F] and my boyfriend [26 M] are having a ton of trouble with his baby mama and I just want opinions on whether I'm doing the right thing or if I should be doing more.,Aniimaru,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7maxlf/me_21_f_and_my_boyfriend_26_m_are_having_a_ton_of/,"  My boyfriend, J, and I have only been dating a couple of months. We currently live together and he has a four year old ( Z ) with baby mama.  Yes, I know, it is extremely uncommon for us to be living together so soon but please don't let that factor belittle your opinions for this situation.  This is going to be kind of a chronological thing from even before I started dating J just so you guys get a good background.  PLEASE NOTE: I MAY NOT GET ALL THE DETAILS RIGHT TO THE LAST DETAIL BUT THE GIST OF WHAT I'M TYPING IS CORRECT

  Baby mama (BM) and J were dating for a few months before Z was conceived.  When J asked her to take plan B before he was even conceived, she refused to.  Fast forward to when Z is born.  J and BM are living together in a apartment and she is on maternity leave.  J is working 2 jobs and is going to school at this time so he comes home and is on his computer doing homework before just going to bed.  She cheats on him with the excuse that he doesn't pay enough attention to her; she ends up sleeping with a classmate in their bed.

  He apparently forgives her.  He has an opportunity to go to an off-island internship (please note that we live in Hawaii so this is an extremely rare and very appealing offer to any of us locals) so he does.  He leaves a credit card for her to use for Z which he later finds that she's spending hundreds at Macys and other stores like that.  He also paid for a semesters worth of tuition and two cars for her only for her to cheat AGAIN.

  The first time she cheated, she was actually caught by J's sister since they went to the same school.  She was confronted by J's sister demanding to know who the guy that she had gotten so close to was; they'd have lunch together and be obviously close.  When the truth came out about BM cheating, an argument ensued which J stepped out for.  It ended with BM threatening to not let J's family see Z anymore.  Her excuse for cheating a second time was that she didn't realize they were in a monogamous relationship; she thought that they were just seeing each other for the sake of their son.   

  After all this, they decided not to be together anymore but J continued to be as good of a father as she would let him be.  The reason for this wording is that she made it a bit difficult.  Whenever she asked him for anything and he tried to say no, she would say she was keeping Z from J for a longer period of time and has actually kept to her word about it (I will go into detail later).  She also doesn't really prove to be a befitting mother to Z anyways.   Examples:

  Beginning of this year, BM is living with her grandmother.  She would keep Z in her room while she was at home and when she'd leave, he would come out and be so hungry that BM's grandmother would catch him trying to get into the pantry saying he's hungry.  Whenever BM would go out for work or school at night, BM's grandmother would have to call her to tell her to come home and take care of Z because she would just stay out doing whatever she wants instead of coming straight home.  BM's grandmother was also not even notified when BM was moving out; she just started packing up and leaving which prompted the grandmother to reach out to J to let us know all of this.

  Fast forward to the start of me and J's relationship; October.  More than often she would just tell J that she was either too sick; busy; or wanted to go shopping or on a date so we would watch him most of the time.  Their schedule is supposed to be that they each had him every 2-3 nights then switch off.  She rarely stuck to this schedule UNTIL she realized I lived with J and how close I was getting to Z.  Before I get into that stuff however, I'll go over some stuff that I've written in a little journal to track down what she's done in case I ever need evidence.

_______________________
  Halloween week:  Z had a little Halloween event at school where he needed a costume.  J and I spent two days straight working on said costume last minute and BM did not help at all.  She has him the night before Halloween so J and I can finish his costume.  Come Halloween, she shows up to record him in his little costume whilst I wait in the car because I had not met her yet and did not know how she would react to meeting me.  She's friendly enough when she decides to come say hi to me and meet me, compliments our work.  Fast forward a bit; we have him the rest of the week but have plans on that Friday.  So we ask her if she could pick him up from school so we can go do our business (we were trading something, no it was not going to be a romantic outing for us) and she flips out.  She basically accuses J of not caring about her or Z anymore; tries to say that she was the one who had Z all week so she shouldn't have to be the one to get him; and says that J has become a different person ever since he and I had started dating.

  We still go do our business and the whole time, she decides to bombard us with texts and phone calls.  Her car battery apparently died at the time and she needed J to take her to get a new battery.  She calls us on our way to our trading destination; trying to get us to hurry even though J let her know that O'Reillys would do it for her no charge in installing it just for the battery.  We tell her that we're still going to our destination and continued to tell her that she could just go by herself but she insists that her battery is too dead and that she needed J to bring her to Wal-Mart for the new battery and wanted him to install it himself.

  We get to our trading destination, and do our trade before going to (his surprise romantic date for his) the beach.  We sit in his car, listening to romantic songs and just have a really nice time before she starts calling again [we told her before heading to the beach that we were still on the road there] demanding that we take her already because she's done waiting.  J is tired of being bothered by her so we just start heading back to pick BM and Z up to take them to Wal-Mart for the battery.  However, she didn't realize I was in the car and got extremely upset when she saw me.  (How she did not know I was there is beyond me because J told her I was with him - I was right next to him listening to what he was saying so yes I know this is true)

  Well, at first she was making a sour face and putting Z into the cars eat in the back but then decided to make J jump her car so they could drive separately.  She even took Z out and put her in her own car, complaining that it was only supposed to be the 3 of them.  We go to Wal-Mart to try to see if we can actually replace the battery ourselves only to find it's too rusty so we go to O'Reillys anyways (something we told her multiple times to do by herself anyways).  The whole time I'm waiting in the car, she prances around with Z making sure I see them all happy like a family.  And it worked; it actually really hurt to see them like that because I didn't understand at the time that if J didn't appease her, she would threaten to keep Z from him.  Well, that's all for Halloween week.
________________________

  During November, it wasn't too bad.  The more time I spent with Z, the more he grew fond of me and the more I helped him ditch some bad habits.  For example, when I was first introduced to Z I noticed that he would screech his little head off if he went to school, brushed his teeth or took a bath.  Using a few tricks (I showed him some pics of what would happen if he didnt brush his teeth or bathe) he stopped complaining about baths and actually asks to brush his teeth.  [We found out later that he had 6 cavities though because when he asked BM to help him brush his teeth she would ignore him.  We were not to blame for the cavities because we make sure to brush his teeth every time we have him]

  In order for me to help him stop having tantrums when going to school; I got up earlier and cooked him breakfast so he would be fed and ready while J got himself ready.  [Due to J having class as well, he would not have time to feed him and get both of them ready unfortunately].  After I started this routine, we found that Z actually stopped having tantrums at school.  His behavior improved so much that even his teachers commented on how much more behaved he was.

  The only memorable things I can think of about November that BM did were:
 1) It would be her turn to watch him only for him to be handed over to some other person instead of her actually watching him.  It got to the point where J's sister would call and ask why BM would just use them as babysitters every time.
  2) On Thanksgiving, she only let him stay with J and I for a couple hours before she came to grab him for her own party.  I would understand that but to my best knowledge, J is the one who usually takes him to HER side of the family's parties.  She usually does not go as she is on bad terms with her family since they learned what she did to J.

______________________

  For December I actually started a journal to write down anything that happens so I have specific dates and details:

  December 11, 2017 7:30 AM
  BM overslept after telling us that she was coming to pick up Z for school.  She tells us to just bring him because she won't be able to make it in time to take him before he needs to be at school.  Causes us to get ready in a big rush; J is not ready at all and has his own classes at 9.

  December 13, 2017  3:45 PM
  BM says Z caught a fever overnight and that he did not attend school.  Z was absolutely fine when we had him late last night since she picked him up at 10:30 - 11.  Why did he get sick overnight with her?
    7:17 PM
  We just learned that BM has dropped Z off at J's mom's house.  Why drop him off there if he is sick?  Why not drop him off to us?  We are closer to her and have all this medicine.

  December 15, 2017  10:14 AM
  BM has had a field trip form of Z's since the beginning of the week.  Form is due today but she has not given it to us to turn in nor has turned it in herself.  Asked her to drop it off this morning and she did not respond after telling us she was passing by the hospital that was near us.  In order to attempt to get it in today, we will have to go to her workplace to grab it before we pick up Z.  She also has his book bag which was due at the beginning of the week that we need in order for him to trade books for this weekend's homework.  She also keeps taking Z's water bottles and has not returned it to us so he doesn't have water at school.

  December 15, 2017  4:30 PM
  Waited outside BM's work for half hour - had to leave to pick up Z on time so he doesn't get pulled out of the program.  BM calls us and basically cusses us out for not waiting for her.  We arrive at Z's school a little bit late, she gets the close to 5 call saying we haven't picked Z up yet so she spam calls us.  She's irritated that we were late even though we were the ones waiting on her to give the form (she told us she was done at 4 and we waited for half an hour before speeding to get Z on time).

  December 16, 2017  4:38 PM
  J's mom called to say she had Z again.  BM dropped him off to go shopping.  J's mom needs to go shopping as well so she was asking if we could go get him but J's brother decides to watch him for us since it was not our turn to have him.  Find out later that BM claims that her foot was run over by a cart while shopping so she needs to go to the ER which means she wont get getting him; foot seems fine though considering she is going to class/work.

  December 18, 2017  9:00 AM
  Z's school Christmas pageant/performance/potluck is today. Plan was supposed to be that BM comes since she is off today, J will be watching for a bit before we have to go to his 10 o'clock interview while I wait in the car so I don't intrude on their family time.
  However, BM did not show up for the performance.  At 8:50 I decided that I would come in since she was still sleeping.  Z was aware that BM was supposed to come but after scanning the crowd, noticed she was not there which caused him to start crying.  He cried throughout most of the performance then came up to us and cried more saying he wanted to go home.  After calming him down a little bit, J decided to call his interview and say that he was going to be late so that we could do some activities with Z before we left.  We did a few activities before BM finally came and we left to go to the interview.

  December 18, 2017  7:00 PM
  J's sister called saying that they're frustrated that BM always uses them as baby sitters as much as she can.  Also let us know that BM was complaining about the fact that I was at Z's pageant earlier.  She was saying that it was supposed to be family; I had no right to be there.  Prior to the pageant, I told J to ask Z's teacher if I could be there since I knew I was not actually family.

  December 19, 2017  7:30 PM
  J's brother's birthday is today.  BM asked J's mom if she could tag along to the birthday dinner since she knew it was his birthday.  Mom gives the OK since she doesn't want BM to threaten to keep Z from them again.  BM finds out that I'm going to the dinner and becomes upset and ends up calling to say she is no longer attending.  Also is getting on J's butt about me going to the pageant.  Direct quote from messages ""I'm pretty pissed that you brought her to OUR son's Christmas pageant.  But I guess you didn't think of that.""  Why be upset when you yourself didn't show up in the first place?

  December 20, 2017  7:30 PM
  Went to pick Z up from J's mom only to find out that Z is sick again after being with BM.  Why does he always contract a fever when he's with her?  She also took off work to pick him up when we could have just taken him.  Is she really still upset about the whole pageant incident that she's being this childish?

  December 23, 2017  3:15 PM
  While J was grabbing some of Z's last minute Christmas gifts, I was talking to Z about stuff to distract him so he wouldn't find out what his gifts were.  The basic points that came up in the convo was:
 1) BM so often tosses him off to J's mom when it's her turn to watch him that when I told him he's going to be with his mom instead of us he automatically went ""Yay Mimi's"" (what he calls J's mom).
 2) If it came down to it, he would rather have me at his upcoming birthday party than BM.  Z is well aware that I would never try to start anything with BM but she is the one who would try to cause trouble.

  December 24, 2017  8:30 PM
  BM's half sister had a party earlier today.  BM told us that the party was at 1 but did not show up herself until after 3.  J left the party to come get me at 5:30 and she tells J that she will be at J's mom's Christmas Eve dinner at 6.  We get to the house a little after 6 and wait until 7:30 before calling her to ask where she's at.  She lets us know that she's not coming until 9 now.  We wait until 9 and call to see where she is and she still had not left the party.  We find out later that she was waiting for us to leave because not soon after we told her we were leaving did she show up.  (I also found out later that BM found out I was going to the dinner and she reacted by calling me his little puppy since I ""needed to follow him everywhere"" then asked him if she could tell him how she felt about our relationship which he told him he did not want to hear.

  December 25, 2017  5:10 PM
  BM is planning on leaving to go to her family party at 5:30 with Z.  Which means J and Z only get to spend 20 minutes together ON CHRISTMAS.  She had him all day yesterday, why can't we get him?  I can't even go inside to at least hug him and say Merry Christmas because I just know she's going to say something [I am writing this in the car while I wait].

____________

Other related notes that I forgot to mention earlier:
-BM has asked him to buy her groceries claiming its for Z.  How can it be for Z when she doesn't watch him and when she does pick him up its well into the night where he is definitely already fed?  **was also revealed that Z was not fed the mornings she has him and that she even let him sleep really late at 1 in the morning**

-There was an incident where J showed me the joint account they share for Z. It was over $500 in debt.  She accused him of taking money out but when J looked through the account history, it was revealed that she just forgot about an auto payment.  She expected J to give her $600 to help her remedy it.  We did not give her any money.

-She came into the apartment once when she knew I wasn't home in order to try to convince him to get back together with her again.  She tried to claim that her family told her they should be getting back together.  J told her it was never going to happen.  (this was in the beginning of Nov, which also might explain some of her actions after that)

  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend's baby mama is extremely manipulative and is causing so much pain to my boyfriend and his family.  She's proven again and again that she's also an unfit mother but my boyfriend is too scared to try to fight for custody since she claims that she would just automatically get custody because she's the mother.  My question is; am I doing the right thing by just being here and helping raise his son while he does his thing and I hold my tongue towards baby mama until he's ready for the custody battle; or should I be doing something else?"
7mb2li,98,2017-12-26,The first time I (20F) decided to let myself loose,[deleted],stupidslutsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidslutsclub/comments/7mb2li/the_first_time_i_20f_decided_to_let_myself_loose/,"I am in my sophomore year at a university in mid-west. Throughout my life I lived in the mid-west. I am your average high schooler. I got good grades, was responsible and focused. No regrets as I got into a good college, studying computer science. I had friends who had way better social life than me in high school but I did not regret it as I wanted to get into a good college. Also, I remained a virgin and did not get much action though I fooled around a few times.

In college I did not date anyone seriously in the first year though I had a fling in the fist semester and dated a guy not exclusively (to him) for the entire spring semester. He used to initiate most of the time and I was happy with the love making. I am a brunette, 5'5"", C-cups, wide hips and thick in very good shape. For some reason, I remained sort of nerdy and wasn't too outgoing.

I did an internship in the summer of this year in the same college town. I worked in the engineering department of a small software company. I was in a team of six and first week went by well, socializing with colleagues, getting to know the product etc. One of the tech leads I worked with was probably in his late thirties, with a nice beard and had a dad bod. He took some interest in me as I could notice him glancing at me and asking me about my work, college etc. In our conversations I came to know that he had two kids, divorced and went to the same college as me.

Every Tuesday we used to go over the tasks that I will be working on in that week. This is kind of a standard practice in software. I had a recurring meeting with him every Tuesday. Usually I wear jeans and tees to work but that day I also had a meeting with the VP and I decided to wear a nice fit and flare dress with a blazer. 

During the meeting I was setting up my laptop so that we can project the screen to go over the tasks. As I was setting up, standing and adjusting the hardware options to select the right output for the projector, I looked at Max (pseudonym for the tech lead). He was staring at my ample cleavage that I was accidentally displaying for him. He grinned having caught off guard and looked at the screen.

That night I was thinking about the incident and I thought may be I should hookup with him. I did not have casual sex until then and it was all pretty new to me. But, what made me take this route was that I had this feeling that I did not address but knew deep down that I was not having much fun like others. Things were some what eased by the fact that this company had happy hours every Friday 4-5. I hung out with the team and had drinks and snacks. 

Three weeks into the internship, I decided its time. In the next Tuesday meeting, I wore a similar dress that I wore before, but this time without the blazer. Then I put up a show intentionally this time. When our eyes met, I bit my lower lip, adjusted my hair and smiled. His face was like a thousand watt bulb when he smiled back his full self. A new bug was opened by the tester in the feature I worked on. He said, I was a ""bad girl"" which was definitely and innuendo. I smiled back and bit my lip dropping him enough hints. He was some what convinced that I was game. He got up from the other side, came to my side, sat beside me and said he will teach me how to fix it if I know how to use ""these"". He said ""these"" as he held my cheek in his hand running his thumb on my lips. I was horny and only bit my lip and looked into his eyes as I nodded my head.

At 4:30 he stopped by my desk and asked me to not leave until 6. At 5:45 the receptionist who usually leaves last left. He immediately stopped by and asked me to come into the team room. He sat on the chair and ordered me to get on my knees. I followed his orders as he made me suck his cock for ten minutes holding my hair and head in his both hands as my mouth worked his cock back and forth. I was already wet when he stopped, laid me on the table, spread my legs and fucked me with hard and deep thrusts. He said probably the first slutty comment I received, ""Godd! you have such a nice child bearing hips!"". I orgasmed when he said that! He was squeezing my tits as he emptied his cock deep inside me after checking that I was on pill. 

Thanks and hope you liked my first time being a slut."
7mb2sp,9,2017-12-26,Textbook movie style love story with sad ending. Depressed gf flipped 180 on me and suddenly became a different person.,RoastPork1,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/7mb2sp/textbook_movie_style_love_story_with_sad_ending/,"This is going to be a long story, but I promise you it’s worth the read

I need advice on how to proceed from here, cause I truly believe I might have just found (and lost) my soul mate. We were each other’s, first love. She always felt insecure that she was not the first woman I fell in love with, but she's still the only woman i ever truly loved with all i had.

We met during summer of last year, and immediately we had talked about art and architecture, and for some reason, we instantly clicked. We had so many commonalities that at this point; I was a bit freaked out. Dating was in neither of our minds at this time, but there was a mutual attraction (she was 17(legal in my state), and I was 4 years older, so I didn’t think much about dating her). I find out a few months later that we were both attracted to one another, and as much as we wanted to not be together, the chemistry and compatibility just didn’t let it be this way.

When I found out that we were both INTP (MBTI types), I knew immediately that we’d be great friends; this is a good description: “INTP's are complex, private, need undisturbed thinking time, rely upon shared understanding more than overt communication, and yet love stimulating intellectual conversation. They love non-conformity and hate routine or social norms”. Being both INTP personality types, each other’s quirkiness didn’t come off as weird anymore for once, and it was for the first time that I felt that I could be completely myself and didn’t have to put up an act.

It helped a lot that we both had the same personality types, but with the amount of overlapping common interests also, it seemed almost too good to be true. She was an architect (student), artist, exceptional DIYer, photographer, and dance choreography enthusiast. I was an engineer (student), artist, martial artist, and break-dancer.

At this point however, I had stopped making art of any type for 3 years already (still not sure why) and I legitimately couldn’t pick up a pencil or brush to make anything—so I admired her very dearly not only because of her skills, but because she was the muse that I needed. There was a piece of myself that I felt was missing all these years (I had been an artist all my life up until college, but engineering logic took over), and it seemed that she was the trigger that brought it all back together.

We both had very different mentalities, however. She was pessimistic, had anxiety and minor depression, and I was the carefree guy who took things as they come, cause I thought it was inefficient to stress over problems if there’s a possible solution (engineering mindset).

She had a lot of insecurities also, like how I was going to leave or stop loving her. She’d always repeat this, and so I always believed that she committed more than I did. At home, she had parents that neglected her, and at school, she had no close friends that have lasted long enough. I stayed with her when she was at her lowest--when she had close friends abandon her and family neglect her, so I made a promise to be there for her always.

What intrigued me, was that she never gave me the benefit of the doubt when I did things that benefitted her and completely out of love, cause it seemed that she always had this thought at the back of her head that it’s easier to not see my effort so that when I left her, the pain would be easier to bear. So I tried harder to show her my love, by coming back from university on valentines, and every weekend to show her that she was worth my time. I even took a part time instead of full-time internship during last summer because I didn’t want her to be lonely, and I was scared that this might be the last summer we spent together (prophecy came true).

It took us 6 months into the relationship to say those magic words of “I love you” because we wanted to be sure that what we felt was love, and not lust, or infatuation. I’ll never forget this day though.

I gave a little speech, while we sat on our bed before I told her I loved her, and when it was her turn, she started crying. She said she was overwhelmed by her emotions, and we hugged it out after. This was the same day that she told me I was beautiful (ikr), and also the day I told myself I’d commit to this woman 100%. I always told her how beautiful she was, but i don't think she believed me most the time, cause she said i was just being biased.

I did a lot of things from here out of fear that I might lose her someday. I bought her a lot of random gifts. The only thing she was really mad about was overspending on our anniversary gift ($175) necklace. My reason was that I didn’t know if I ‘d another chance (prophecies fulfilling themselves) She had spent a year making my anniversary gift (so at this point I was pretty sure she was in this 100%). Sad part is, we never got to exchange the gifts, cause she said she was almost done, but tragedy struck within that time.

Our dates included cooking together, packing for picnics, fooling around at my house. Everyone who didn’t know of our relationship kept asking repeatedly if we were together. Everyone else, who knew, told us that we should get married. We never really spent money on materialistic things, cause we only really cared for each other’s company. It’s only been 1.5 years, but we felt like an old couple who dropped all formalities, and for some reason it’s felt like a freaken lifetime. Our love life was never lacking. We turned each other on as fast as humanly possible.

I’m pretty sure we shared the same love languages also.

Fast forward to end of October. She gets diagnosed with depression, gets put into a psych ward, and spends the entire November in the hospital staring at a wall every day. This probably drove her to the verge of craziness, even though she was allowed to play badminton during that time also. During this month, there was no physical contact of any sort, but instead, she called me for 10 minutes a day, twice a day; this was the highlight of my everyday life. We told each other that the cliché “I miss you and I love you” thing, twice a day a day, every day. Still the happiest guy alive at this point.

When she came back out of the psych ward, she seemed to have a very positive mentality, which lasted for another 4 days before schoolwork stressed her out and that went out the window.

It was here, that she requested space from me--almost a month of it-- and told me how her friends and family didn’t give her the connection that I gave her (still don’t understand what this means), and so I went on a rant about how she’s a different person and that she doesn’t seem to love me any more. At this point, I knew I fucked up, but she didn’t know how she feels about me anymore. She told me she doesn’t lust for me anymore (not a problem since we knew this might happen), but she was fangirling about how hot I was with my new haircut only a few days ago.

She knew she had feelings for me, and the day after this, she told me she still loved me, but said she needed time to sort those feelings out. She didn’t want me to drag me into depression with her, but I told her that only one could be depressed, so I have to stay strong. This made her tear up, but didn’t change much. This was the start of our break.

This is where the shit show starts. I request that I meet up with her mom so that we can sort things out (her mom hates me because I have Korean eyes and I’m not rich, both families are Asian). I send her a text in like the most formal and nicest way that I can, and for some reason, because of language barriers, she sends me a super aggressive one back about how I stole and badly influenced her daughter (she never lied to her parents about where she was before she met me, so I guess it was fair).

Around this time, my ex-girlfriend tells me I wasn’t aggressive enough in telling her friends to shut up about us getting married, but I was just trying to be as polite as possible. This was also the point, after I showed her the follow-up text message I sent her mom that she completely stopped talking to me. She saved our chats on snap chat though, for the first time ever. So for the next 2 weeks, I’d message her once a day to remind her of our memories (doesn’t seem like it worked). She doesn’t reply a single time, nor agreed to take my final letter to her so that I can have closure to this whole “break”. Our parents meet up, but all her mom does is blackmail me to call the police, and makes sure that her daughter doesn’t contact me in any form. Mom is basically manipulative as shit about not hating me. She didn’t come to negotiate; she came to warn my family.

Around last week, she tells her friends that she feels “free”, which I’m guessing it’s because she’s stopped having to bother with figuring out what to do with me, and that she’s not the feeling the relationship no more. This was the same time her personality flipped 180. Her parents are nice and spoils her again like during childhood, and she’s found new friends (who are also depressed) to spam. She forgave her friend that she was mad at. I’m the only one left behind. I didn’t give her the space she needed, but this doesn’t make it right for not saying a word to me.

She cuts+dyes her hair, and somehow becomes friends again with that one friend who she hated for the past year. She’s basically like a completely different person. She deleted me on snapchat, deleted her instagram, but we’re still friends on facebook. It’s like she’s trying to wipe out everything that happened this past year.

Friends tell me to move on and just forget that it happened, but I sent her my anniversary letter along with a short goodbye thing, and packed all our memories (pictures, gifts) into a box and threw it in my basement. I never imagined that she would do this to me, cause it always seemed like she loved me more. I didn’t make her feel confident about her skills cause it seemed like I was always better, and so that added to her insecurity when she was around me.

The saddest part is that she dropped all of her passions that she once had, and decided to focus on architecture only. Somehow, I can do art again. It’s like I took kept a piece of her that she decided to leave behind her completely. She’s been an artist all her life. But what is an artist who doesn’t make art anymore? She was the happiest when she was around me, and everyone saw it. She’d brag about how great of a guy I was even when during her psych ward stay. How does all this happen so quickly?

The question is, how do I proceed from here? Will we ever get back together? Should I just move on and forget this happened? Is she still thinking about me? Is she having an identity crisis because of the depression? Was she at her best when she was with me?"
7mbdbd,0,2017-12-26,Job searching as recent computer science graduate with JLPT N2 and terrible resume,Lrdwhyt,movingtojapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/7mbdbd/job_searching_as_recent_computer_science_graduate/,"I'm living in the US and recently graduated from university with a B.A. in computer science. I've been searching online for software development jobs in Japan, specifically in the Tokyo and Osaka areas. I did pass the JLPT N2 and also did a foreign exchange with a well-known Japanese university for one semester, but that’s all I have going for me. I have no internships or relevant work experience, nor am I particularly proficient in any technologies, so jobs that require any amount of experience seem to be out. I do have some side projects on my resume, but they're fairly basic and not likely to impress anyone.

Questions:

I’ve been searching using LinkedIn, GaijinPot, indeed.jp, CareerCross, and Daijob. Wantedly and Forkwell seem interesting, but don’t seem to have any jobs that I would be qualified for. (1) Are there any other good sites I am missing? (2) Also, how strict are the requirements on online job listings? I'm not going to apply for jobs that I'm obviously underqualified for, but do I need to fulfill every bullet?

My idea is to send Japanese-style 履歴書 for job listings in Japanese and Western-style resumes for job listings in English. (3) Would that be a good idea?

So far I've only been looking at online postings. I don't entirely understand how recruiters work, but my impression is that they're more for people mid-career, not for people looking for entry-level jobs. (4) Given my qualifications/career level, would contacting a recruiter just be a waste of time?

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/61egqb/average_entry_level_salary_at_foreign_companies/dfdwmyf/) suggests that recent grads should aim for a salary of 4-5m but given my qualifications I’m wondering (5) if I should instead be looking at jobs in the 2-3m range.

I'm continuing to search for and apply for jobs online, but if I'm not having any luck, here are my other options as I see it:

1\. I could find a job as an Eikaiwa teacher or something, get a work visa, move to Japan, and then search for software jobs while working there.

* Problem: Mildly unethical, might not find any software jobs, might negatively affect my career, and I’m not white.

2\. I can apply for a working holiday visa in Taiwan.

* Problem: The application period opens in May, so it’d be a good half year before I’d even make it to Japan and start looking for jobs. Also, it seems like any company I work for would need to be willing to sponsor a work visa anyways. (6) Would being in Japan in person really make a significant difference in the job search?

3\. I can search for work in Taiwan and live there indefinitely until I either find a job in Japan or give up on the idea of living in Japan.

* Problem: I would have to be conscripted for ~4 months before I could live in Taiwan, which is a lot of time for a new graduate.

4\. Theoretically, I could find work in the United States and work here before leaving for Japan or elsewhere in East Asia.

* Problem: I could only do this for 1 year max maybe as I don't really feel happy here. Also, any job that I could find would probably be mediocre as well, so I'm doubtful that this would make me that much more desirable. This is really a desperate last resort, I'd much rather do any of the above.

Any feedback or just general advice on the job search would be immensely helpful. Thanks for reading."
7mbfqz,1,2017-12-26,"21 [M4A] For F: Older female/Younger male, Buying Your New Toy at Auction, Tied up, Worshipping the Fertility Gods, Rule 34. For M: Looking for ""Straight"" Guys Who Love Big Cock.",out_and_kinda_about,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7mbfqz/21_m4a_for_f_older_femaleyounger_male_buying_your/,"Working on a few new prompts. These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

_____________________________________________________________

For F: A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.

___________________________________________________________

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.

Here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

Earlier December my dog got ill and my brother took him to a vet. He really liked the clinic and veterinarian there and After the appointment was over asked on my behalf if she would be willing to have a summer intern (I'm away in school). According to him she was very enthusiastic about the idea and told him to have me  email her. I did on December 9 and she never emailed me back. So this past Sunday I sent a follow up and still have not gotten a response. I know it's the holiday so the clinic might be busy especially around this time and that's why she hasn't responded to my second email but it's a bit disheartening that she never responded to the first too. I don't know if I should go in.  I don't want to appear pushy or stalker like plus I know there very busy. If anyone's been through a similar situation or is currently a veterinarian what have you done or what would you do in my shoes? "
7mbtfm,40,2017-12-26,How do I overcome my anger/resentment towards my parents?,ActuaryASA,ABCDesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/7mbtfm/how_do_i_overcome_my_angerresentment_towards_my/,"I recently turned 32, am single and realize that I have a lot of unresolved issues.

I had a repressed upbringing. Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I lived in a perpetual state of fear of my mother. We had a language and communication barrier. I never ever talked to my mom about anything personal – just school and work and current events. She didn’t know any of my friends – I never invited them to our place. She would threaten me if I ever dared to mention girls. Looking back now I realize it was because she was afraid that girls would interfere with my studies – never mind that the vast majority graduate having been in a relationship at some point.

In college, I took an internship out of state and was staying in a hostel. It was the only internship offer I received in my field. My mom asked if was the only student doing an internship at the firm. I lied and said *“yes”*. The truth was there was one other girl from my school and she was staying at the same hostel one floor above me. Yet I was afraid to reveal this to my mom for fear that she’d lash out angrily and accuse of me of taking this internship illicitly to only be closer to this girl, which was not true at all.

I didn’t have my first kiss until I was 23 and lose my virginity until I was 24. After hitting the gym and improving my style and grooming I began to get more attention. Almost all were casual hookups with no emotion involved. In my late 20s, I used to be proud of these hookups and boast about them, but now I feel kinda lame and loserish for still overcompensating for everything I missed out on during the celibacy of my youth.

It took a long time to overcome my psychological baggage. Even when I was dating, I felt pangs of guilt, like I was doing something dirty and shameful, that I was disobeying and betraying my mom somehow by going behind her back. Even today, I have a hard time with displays of affection or having sex while sober – part of me still feels like it’s wrong, even though I know women desire romance. Which is why I’ve never told my mom anything. To her knowledge, I’ve never had a girlfriend.

Yet the fact that I went dateless all through high school and university still eats away at me, particularly when I look at the relative success I’ve had upon breaking free and “deprogramming” myself. I never got to experience the joys of love with beautiful young girls, when one is youthful and innocent and carefree - no dances, no proms, no corsages. When I saw other desi couples in high school and university holding hands, I always thought to myself *“Wow, how can they go against their parents like that? Isn’t that wrong? Don't they feel guilty or afraid?* Of course, all of them are married now.

If I'd only had a normal upbringing with supportive parents, I could’ve been plugged into a circle of desi cool kids, had a girlfriend in college, be married by now and maybe my mom would have grandkids today. I know that all this time it wasn’t my looks or my social skills holding me back - it was my “goody two shoes” fear and guilt-ridden mental state, to not make my mom mad or sad.

Two years ago, my mom set me up with a family friend’s daughter. My mom was very adamant and pushy. Because I didn’t want to go against my mother’s wishes, I gave it a sincere try. Unfortunately, after a few months our relationship didn’t work out – I didn't have any real relationship experience and she'd had an ex of 7 years whom she was constantly comparing me to. She wasn’t over him. 

When I told my mom this, she said *“So what? School love happens.”* 

It was like a knife through the heart. When my mother said this, I felt betrayed. Here I was, having lived all my life being the good son, avoiding girls because I didn’t want to go against my parents' wishes. I seethed with anger, betrayal, self-loathing and resentment.

This was the turning point of my relationship with my mother. When my mom tried to set me up again, I firmly said no. I stopped caring about pleasing my parents. I was going to do my own thing. It only took 31 years.

Today, even though I have a degree and a professional designation and a career, my relationship with my parents is in shambles. Most times when my mom calls I don’t answer. Earlier this year, I moved out to a penthouse in the same city. I still have not invited my folks to my apartment, despite their insistence. What if she snoops through my stuff and discovers the box of condoms in my nightstand drawer? The prospect mortifies me. I hate confrontation, hate arguing, hate shouting. I've only raised my voice towards my mother a handful of times even though she shouted at me constantly. Most times I would stay silent and not say anything back. 

I’ve become withdrawn and detached and shut down. I realize now that this is not healthy as our communication is severely lacking. Perhaps these fights should have happened decades ago, in my teens in early 20s. But I was a timid acquiescent kid who just wanted peace, content with books and chatrooms.

I know deep down my mom wishes I was married and she had grandkids. It would make her happy and good look on her amongst our extended family and friend circle. Yet I lived the first 30 years of my life trying to make my mom happy, forsaking my own happiness and personal fulfillment in the process. She is in her 60s now and truthfully I don't know if she'll ever understand now.

A *schaudenfraude* side of me wants to wreak vengeance upon my mom. For almost all my life she told me to avoid girls and *""DON'T GO FOR LOVE""*, even wagging her finger and intimating to cut my tongue off if I said I loved someone in my teens. And now she is the one with the unmarried, childless son in his 30s. This is her karmic revenge. 

Yet a part of me knows that I shouldn’t live my life in my 30s acting rebellious and trying to “get back” at my parents. It’s silly and childish.

Today, I watched *The Namesake* and wished I had a progressive minded mother whom I could be open with like Kal Penn’s mother in the film.

For the desis who’ve had a similar repressed upbringing, how did you improve your relationship with your parents?"
7mc2jm,5,2017-12-26,Looking for programming/IT internship,fameman100,nova,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/7mc2jm/looking_for_programmingit_internship/,"Cutting a long story short, my first semester at uni went poorly, and I realize that in the process of forcing myself to try so hard I lost my love/drive for Computer Science. In order to reinvigorate that love, and maybe to gain a sense of progress amidst everything happening around me, I am looking for an internship or part time position during the second semester.

As stated above, I've only been in University for one semester, so I don't have much college experience or a degree, but I am willing do verify any skills I state with a demo or in conversation. I've been programming for courses, my robotics team, and personal projects since I've started high school. My main points of interest are in AI, virtual reality, and computer vision, but i have basic experience coding for each (Tensorflow, Leap Motion, and OpenCV respectively), which I am hoping to expand. I also have some experience  with Git from my time in  the robotics team in high school. Python was my first programming language and I have recently been using Java for my classes. 

I also know basic IT support, and have an A+ basic cert, and helped start a non profit volunteer organization called Reboot for youth, which refurbishes donated computers and gives them to low-income families both locally and internationally.

I live in Centreville along Lee hwy, and I can commute up to a 30 min distance. 

Any help or point in the right place to look is greatly appreciated!

7mdj0w,6,2017-12-27,Lived with an abusive household my whole life. I want to move out.,ThomasGalbridge,DysfunctionalFamily,https://www.reddit.com/r/DysfunctionalFamily/comments/7mdj0w/lived_with_an_abusive_household_my_whole_life_i/,"It's a bit complex to explain, but I'll keep it as brief as possible. I'm a 19-year-old college student who's lived with in an abusive household his whole life. My father was abusive to me, physically and sexually and my grandmother exposed me to him in the first place. My mother neglected me so I had to live with my grandparents, where my dad free-loaded off of them. My grandmother is also verbally abusive to me, and I've pented up so much anger for years while wanting to tell her to ""shut the **** up."" I'm not a violent person in any way, but today I felt like I've had the last straw with all of it. My uncle and aunt think I will become just like my father who was a convicted felon that is doing nothing with his life besides being a complete man-child. He has done unspeakable things to me as a kid. I have a hard time with trust issues with other people, and my therapist had diagnosed with me post-traumatic stress disorder.

I can't consider this people to be my family, and my church has been there with me through these harsh times. I'm in school for Computer Science and I work a paid internship as a web developer. It's underpaid ($10.25 an hour), but my job is offering me an A+ certification to work part-time as a computer tech. I want to get out of the house, because I'm sick of the constant abuse I have gone through my whole childhood. Family counselors haven't helped, I don't go to my personal therapist anymore.

Some people think I should stay while I'm finishing up my AA, that won't be in more than a year. Anger has just pent up with me, and I've tried to avoid them as much as possible in the house. My grandfather is the only one who was ever understanding and kind with me, and he thinks I should stay until I finish college.

I'm perfectly aware of the harsh obstacles I will face if I were to move out and live on my own (apartment rent, utilities, my grandfather has my insurance covered for a couple of years), and I was planning to get that IT job as soon as possible.

What do you think I should do?"
7mds11,2,2017-12-27,"How is the marketing industry in terms of stability, salary, mobility etc",SOCKS_AND_SLIDES,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/7mds11/how_is_the_marketing_industry_in_terms_of/,"Hello everyone,

I'm an economics major with a minor in marketing from a relatively well-known school in Canada with a good reputation.

I'm in my second year out of four, and I have a 3.6/4.0 GPA and I've just begun applying to as many internships as I can, although I've hit a bit of a mental crossroad.

I'm not really sure if I want to work in the finance or marketing industry once I graduate, nor what type of internships I want to gravitate towards to. I've always loved business and entrepreneurship, I just can't really focus on any career that I specifically am interested in more than everything else. One thing is that I'd love to work abroad in a foreign country once I graduate, or perhaps in the US. Travelling for work seems exciting to me.

For those who are graduated and working in the industry, does marketing pay well typically? It's hard to not be enticed by the lucrative finance salaries I hear my friends gushing about, but I don't know enough about the finance industry to conclusively say that I want to begin a career path there.

Is the marketing industry stable as well? I don't want to focus on a career path that is threatened by automation (not that I can think of any ways to automate marketing off the top of my head)

How is the work-life balance? Is there good upward mobility if you're good at your job?

My dream job would be demanding and require a lot of mental capacity on the job with reasonable hours to enjoy life outside of work. Anything that is challenging is enticing to me.

Thank you.

7me6ni,3,2017-12-27,I’m [22F] not sure if my friend [20F] and I are dating or not and if she wants to start a relationship together.,karolynjar,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7me6ni/im_22f_not_sure_if_my_friend_20f_and_i_are_dating/,"We knew about each other for two years, but became friends when we were appointed to board for a club. We have been close friends for about a year. During this year, a lot has happened which I’ll explain in EXTREME detail by month below (I hope y’all bear with me): 


BEFORE NOV 2016 

* Became friends cause we were added to board. Most interactions were solely club related.  


NOV 2016

* Started developing a crush on her. 

* We were around each other for most of this weekend training conference. The crush gets worse.
  
* We also began talking about things outside board.


DEC 2016

* Helped her A LOT with her board responsibilities for a big event she’s in charge of, even staying out late just to spend more time with her. 

* We talk more about stuff more often, almost everyday. 


JAN 2017

* The big event for our club happens and I run around to help despite pulling my achilles tendon on both feet 

*  **I TELL HER I LIKE HER.** She’s very surprised, but she took it well. Still wants to be friends 

* Awkward for about a week after. We don't really talk unless it’s for club related topics.  

* After that week passes, things are good again. We actually become much closer friends and basically talk everyday. 



FEB 2017

* A big event at an outside school happens and during said event, a guy (i’ll call him J) basically admits to liking her by giving her the last rose. EVERYBODY AT THE EVENT FREAKS OUT, ESPECIALLY ME FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. 

* This is also the time she starts liking someone else on board (a mutual friend of ours which i’ll call M) but I don’t know about it.



MAR 2017

* She and M start dating (I don’t know about it yet) 

* I leave for an internship program in D.C., but we still talk every day. 


APR 2017

* Her and M friend are still dating. I begin to have suspicions that they are together. 

* DESPITE THAT we talk constantly, to the point where we say good morning and good night almost every day. 


MAY 2017

* They break up and she tells me about the two of them. This is my first time learning about this. Suspicion confirmed.  


JUN 2017

* I ask M about the two of them. He goes into detail about everything. Especially the reason why they broke up. 

* Turns out the she has a hard time getting over her last breakup with her ex-best friend (i’ll call him D). M always felt second best to D. BUT D and her broke off communication in March. 

* I come back from DC. The first person I see besides  immediate family is her and her sister.


JUL 2017

* We had a fight about not hanging out with her too much. Takes about a week or two for things to cool down 


AUG 2017

* Things are good again. We start talking again  like normal.

* On my birthday, she was the first to greet me saying “HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU BAD BINCH!!!!!!!! IT'S YOUR DAY WOOHOO I HOPE IM FIRST AHAHAHA”

* First trip to LA together, just the two of us. 


SEPT 2017 

* We hang out again, this time another friend comes with us 

* We go on another LA trip using solely public transportation, just the two of us again

* School begins for her. We still talk. She sends me tweets every morning, tumblr posts every night  


OCT 2017

* Hang out more one-on-one about one a week or once every other week 

* One time when we were eating out, we sat on the same side of the table. We were sharing fries, but i still thought it was very weird for both of us to sit on the same side of the table still. 

* We’re comfortable enough to rant to each other about things. 


NOV 2017

* We don't talk constantly as much anymore, but we still talk every day.   

* I had a breakdown and talked to her to feel better. She venmoed me $5 to get boba and said “I just want you to know I’m here for you even if I can’t always be there physically”.


* She tells me about something a friend of hers once said and how it bothered her. It bothers me too cause it was something about gender and sexuality. I rant to her about my personal struggles being a lesbian. She asks the usual questions about being LGBT (e.g. ‘have you always known or was there a period of realization”, “did you reject your feelings”, etc.). I answer her questions while telling her about how i came out. 
She says “thank you for telling me, this helps more than you know” 
I rant to her about more personal struggles. After talking about that she tells me **“I’ve actually wanted to talk to you about something, but I don’t think I’m ready yet”.**  
* I tell her that she can tell me whenever she feels ready and that i’ll be there. And so the waiting begins...


DEC 2017 

* We return to talking/hanging out one-on-one like that convo didn’t happen. 

* Christmas Eve: D, the ex-best friend, messages again for the first time in 6 months and he attaches a written letter “apologizing” for whatever he did before. She tells me very shortly after the fact and is very shaken about it. She asks me what his intentions are and i give her my honest opinion 

* The next time we hang out i ask her about what she did since seeing the letter. She typed a letter in response to his letter, erased it, and made a pro/con list. She told me there were more cons. 

* To this day, she hasn’t said what she wanted to talk to me about. I'm not sure whether or not she likes me in THAT WAY or not.  



TL;DR: We have been close friends for about a year and I’m not sure if she has shown signals of her liking me as more than friends or not. While talking about my personal struggles about being a lesbian she tells me “Thank you for telling me. This helps out more than you know. I’ve actually wanted to talk to you about something, but I don’t think I’m ready yet”. I THINK THIS IS A BIG SIGN OF SOMETHING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT. "

My dream school is KAIST and I've been thinking of having Yonsei as a second choice - both probably very difficult to get into. Any recommendations for the third option? Should I aim for something with lower bar? Would Ewha seem too cocky?

I have a 4.63 GPA on 5.0 scale (that is 94 on 100 point scale), I have no publications but I did a cool internship and have some work experience as a software engineer after that and a lot of hackathon experience. I also briefly worked as a teaching assistant in my old university. I've done exchange semesters abroad in both US and Europe. 

Considering this, do you have any recommendations on schools I should add to my application. I still want to keep KAIST in even if you consider it out of my reach, but maybe I should switch out Yonsei for some mid tier university? Gwangju seems interesting. Any other recommendations? I would like to specialize in computational intelligence - neural networks and such. "

I need help with the topic mentioned above.
I'm in a really tight financial spot, because I'm a student with a loan, and I'm obligated to have an internship for the time being. That makes it impossible for me to find a full time job, even though I do have some offers.

I have more than a year of working experience with Linux, and I have setup a couple of video streaming/restreaming servers, typical web servers, mail servers and dev servers.

I would love to hear your advices on what you think would be a good course of action, and I thank you in advance!

7mfwje,2,2017-12-27,Workers at five-star hotels in Harbin exposed for nasty cleaning habits,vilekangaree,harmonyist,https://www.reddit.com/r/harmonyist/comments/7mfwje/workers_at_fivestar_hotels_in_harbin_exposed_for/,"Surprise, surprise!

If you’re reading this article while lounging inside your five-star hotel room in China, drinking a nice warm glass of water, you might want to just go ahead and spit that water out now, because it turns out that cleanliness standards at luxury Chinese hotels might be somewhat lacking. Shocking, we know.

On Tuesday, Pear Video published footage online exposing a variety of violations at three well-known and highly-rated hotels in the Heilongjiang capital of Harbin. To get the footage, one of the media outlet’s workers posed as an intern and was given some lessons in “five-star” hotel hygiene.

In one clip, a Kempinski cleaner is seen using a brush to clean water glasses before using that same brush to clean the toilet. The cleaner also uses toilet water to wet a bath towel before wiping down the floor.

Meanwhile, at the Shangri-La, an employee cleans the bathtub with a toilet brush, before telling the intern, “When a customer is around, don’t clean like this.”

Finally, at the Sheraton, a cleaner folds up a quilt on the floor. Gasp!

You can watch the footage below:
&lt;a href=""https://medium.com/media/f452244e77a0458452a01a6124ed0b0c/href""&gt;https://medium.com/media/f452244e77a0458452a01a6124ed0b0c/href&lt;/a&gt;

On Wednesday, Harbin officials confirmed that the infractions shown in the Pear Video piece had taken place and warned the hotels to ensure that they would not occur again. At this time, it’s not clear if the hotels have been punished in any way.

All three hotels have since apologized and have said that they are taking steps to make sure that all employees strictly follow hygiene standards in the future.

The video has caused quite the sensation online. Because hotels are not allowed to stick cameras in guest rooms, it’s not clear how common these kinds of practices are or how long they have been going on.

“It’s a good thing that I’m too poor to have ever stayed in one of these hotels,” joked one Weibo user.

However, net users have argued that these kind of hygiene problems are in fact systemic among luxury hotels in China, which typically cheap out when it comes to hiring professional cleaning staffers and then give poorly trained and unqualified workers too little time to clean too many rooms.

“I bet that if you performed similar investigations at every other five-star hotel in the country, not a one would pass the test,” argued another Weibo user.

7mgbs2,1,2017-12-27,Me [24F] with my fiancé [36 M] 3.5 years. Broke up with me on Christmas because he chose hoarding over a future with me.,Motherfuckerjonesyo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mgbs2/me_24f_with_my_fiancé_36_m_35_years_broke_up_with/,"Hi, relationships. This is not a throwaway because fuck it, I don’t care anymore. I also forgot my Reddit password and don’t want to not be able to access this account. YES, there is an age difference and I am aware of the ramifications. 


I first met KP when I was 19, he was my tattooer for my first tiny wrist tattoo. I was at the tail end of an abusive relationship and getting the tattoo for myself was the last straw. My interaction with KP was so limited/professional that I didn’t even remember his name. When I called the shop a year later to make another appointment, I referred to him as “the Chinese guy”. Over the course of January to June, I had gotten a couple of pieces from him and it was all very professional. I never even realized I had a crush on him or he had one on me. After I had tipped him on my last session, he asked to repay me for my large tips (I can’t do math very well, so everyone gets a big tip) by taking me out for tea and a cupcake sometime. 


A couple of weeks later, I realized he had taken me out on a few dates and I realized we were dating (dense, I know). He was absolutely wonderful, very thoughtful, but a bit emotionally walled down and secretive. One night I got locked out of my friend’s house and was faced with either driving two hours back home or staying with KP. He paused momentarily, then warned me about how messy it was. I didn’t think anything of it until we went inside. 


There was the tiniest of walkways to get to each room. Otherwise, piles and piles of antiques, magazines, car parts, motorcycle parts, trash, paper, broken pieces of furniture etc were stacked and piled EVERYWHERE. I knew right then and there he had a problem. 


Some backstory on me. I grew up in an extremely sexually and emotionally abusive environment. My parents make raised by narcissists look like child’s play. My mom is a well known psychologist and my dad is a very well accredited attorney. My parents watched me get sexually abused for 8 years as a child by a very close family friend. I was a very sad child and acted accordingly. Instead of getting me help or stopping the situation, my parents would beat me and hold me to the ground. My mom would perform “exorcisms” on me while my dad sat on me. When I tried to beg a teacher for help at my public school, they sent me away to a psychiatric institution for children with schizophrenia etc. I didn’t have an appetite because my mom had me on an obscenely large dose of Ritalin/adderall to the point where I was thirty points underweight as a naturally slight child. They instructed the teachers to tie me down every day at lunch time in front of the other kids and force feed me. Later on in highschool and following into my freshman year of college, I stayed in a very abusive relationship with my HS “sweetheart” who repeatedly raped and humiliated me for almost 3 years. I eventually broke up with him and started therapy and was single for a year before I dated KP. 


But KP was the most kind, otherwise healthy, and understanding relationship I ever had. He accepted the things I didn’t want to do in bed that made me scared of the things that triggered me, without question. We continued our relationship for 8 months when I broke up with him because any time I brought up that he was distancing himself from me (would not text/call me/see me for days to weeks at a time), he would say that it was my fault that I was so high maintenance. He would say he couldn’t handle everything he had to do, couldn’t handle the apartment (the hoarding) and having a girlfriend. From growing up with my parents, I knew what gas lighting looked like so I told him that as much as I loved him, I wasn’t willing to be second place and I definitely wasn’t willing to be someone’s girlfriend out of convenience. If he ever found his balls in the deep dark hole he left them in, he could call me. 


So that was that and we didn’t talk for five months. Meanwhile, my career was budding. I work in the top levels of the horse industry (I’m sure I’ll get recognized by someone for this, it’s a small sick world). I made the decision to leave home state to intern under someone in Germany and when I came back, I would leave to another state to work for and be a working student for people.  (International Epicentre State for Horse Industry).  


I posted about this on my Instagram, KP saw, and texted me out of the blue. Long story short, spanning the course of several weeks, he wanted to get back together and I did not, despite still loving him, because I did not want to repeat the same course. He promised that he had changed, some a lot of introspective work, realized he needed to grow up and that while he was a workaholic (so am I), he needed to be better about time management. 


When we got back together, he knew I was going to be in Other State. He knew I would be gone for the foreseeable future. He knew there was nothing left for me in Home State. He knew my industry was a lot of backbreaking, soul destroying work for little pay - very unlike his industry. And he still wanted to get back together. So we did. 


He would come visit me for a few days at a time maybe 2-3 times a year in 2016, and I went home for TG &amp; Xmas. He had promised he was going to sell his things, downsize, so that he could see me more often. However, unbeknownst to me for a good portion of 2016, the real reason he bought his mother’s house (took a 40k loan to do it) is because she could not sell it without him moving more of his crap out of the garage, and he didn’t want to move it. So he bought the house. He hadn’t moved into the house out of his apartment because he had so much crap in the apartment that it was overwhelming for him to deal with it. So he slept on an air mattress in his house, while paying mortgage &amp; everything, as well as rent and utilities on an apartment filled with crap. This put a huge strain on our relationship and whenever I would try to bring it up, he said that he couldn’t make me happy and I didn’t realize how overwhelmed he was.


At the beginning of 2017, my work had paid off. My career was taking off despite all of this crazy shit (seriously, that’s another 30 posts or a book) I had managed to work my way through. There are very few women in the horse industry at the international levels that genuinely worked their way to the top without being independently wealthy or fucking their way to the top. I took off a few weeks in May to get my affairs in order to prepare for what was supposed to be the beginning of the great year of my life. 


When I came back to get my horse, I found that my mentor (who treated me very badly but he made me into an incredible rider so there is that) had starved my horse to near death and sold nearly all of my equipment that was priceless and irreplaceable to me. My world was flipped upside down and what followed that was the worst year of my life, despite me trying to keep my head up and find my feet again. During this time, I lived and worked in another state, which was part of the original plan minus the part where my life fell apart. 


The whole time, KP kept exasperatingly telling me, “Why don’t you just come home, find a job here, you can live in the house. It is basically our house.” I felt hurt because I knew this was not a solution in my best interest and also, the House was now filled from floor to ceiling with crap. It’s not my house. That could never be my home. 


Still trying to work my way back, I was hit by another blow regarding my parents. I am now mostly NC with them, and will be going completely NC at the end of January 2018. I stayed with KP in Home State for a few weeks and while he was accommodating enough to the point where I could sit in front of the TV and apply for jobs all day long and cry, I knew I definitely still had to leave. I lived out of a suitcase in the house otherwise my clothes would get lost in the house.


I got a job in epicentre state and have been here for almost 2 months. My birthday is right next to Christmas and holiday season has always been rough for me. I really need support. I really need someone here with me. It clicked for me as I spent Christmas alone, sobbing, that all of the promises KP made about the hoarding had been a lie and that whether he meant to or not, had strung me along for the past couple of years. The promises of being together, him staying with me and guest spotting or picking up a gig wherever I was a few months out of the year - was a lie. 


I tried to bring this up in a way that demonstrated that while I am very hurt, please, can we come to some sort of compromise. How can I help, how can I help fix this.  When I called him yesterday over the phone he leapt right into screaming at me and saying that dating me is really hard and why can’t I just give up horses, the industry is too hard, etc. I told him I couldn’t give up my career and he screamed that I was telling him to give up his. I tried to stress that I didn’t want him to give up his career and that he didn’t have to move, he just needed to stop hoarding because it was killing both of us. Then he just point blank said he wasn’t willing to give up the hoarding and that my problem with it was my problem, and that he couldn’t be with me.
 

This is all the nutshell version. But I feel pretty ripped apart. I’ve lost everything I’ve ever worked for my entire life, lost everything I loved, he was the only family I had. I begged him that if I pay for couples counseling, will he try it. I don’t have much hope for it me I feel a little resentful that again, I feel like the only person carrying this relationship. I am in a lot of pain and while my rational thought process is sound, everything else is not and I want to die. 


He hasn’t spoken to me since early yesterday. I have to drive back to Home State to pick up my remaining horse from my family farm (hence the low contact with abusive family to keep my horse safe) as well as my dog from KP’s house and my important documents. 


I would appreciate anecdotal advice. I want to cross post at some point to hoarders but they also look like a support group so I’m not sure. 

Edit to say: He has agreed to counseling and I arranged all of it so we have our first session tomorrow. Deep down I know that I’m probably going to have to break up with him for good but I’m in a lot of pain emotionally so I’m grasping at straws here. 


Tl;dr: The pathological strings that go along with hoarding are ruining our relationship/ended it. He claims he has money issues but has thousands upon thousands of dollars of crap in his house and won’t stop collecting and buying antiques when he could be investing in himself and our relationship. I need help/support/anecdotal advice/a hug. I don’t want to lose him but I also respect myself. "

A couple years ago, she and my stepdad starting using a tax accountant, so I allowed them to handle my taxes and just signed off when they asked me to. I ended up getting a small portion of my return, which I think was just state tax return, but not the federal. Either way, it was far less than what I calculated it should have been.

This past year, I earned far more than previously due to an internship, and am expecting a tax return of around $1000, so I want to make sure I actually see this one. Is it possible that they had set something up with their accountant to absorb my tax returns or have it made out to them? I don't understand how it would be possible. I looked through the forms before signing them and saw nothing unusual. Either way, I intend to do my own taxes this year, but I was wondering if this was even possible or legal. "

7mhpl2,1,2017-12-27,Heartbroken over my long distance boyfriend,Naked_Hedgehog,realtionship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/realtionship_advice/comments/7mhpl2/heartbroken_over_my_long_distance_boyfriend/,"So I'm from Germany and he is from India. We met seven years ago online. We fell in love through emails, started calling and doing video Skype daily. Overall we were pretty communicative and he was very loving. He and I met first in 2014 and last in august-september 2017 after two years of not meeting. He is a student (me too), and he would have been done with his finals by now but he failed. He doesn't call me anymore, I beg for a normal call, but he had maximum five minutes for me. In the only video call we did (only ten mins) yesterday he didn't even look at me but only laptop. He says he wants to concentrate on his career but he has time for his cousins and family. I also have to study but what is the problem in calling me every day even with the studies? I believe if you love someone, you miss them so much you have to call them. When we call, I'm the only one talking and he usually stays quiet. He hasn't told me he loves me for over a month. He only says ""he cares for me"" yet he hardly messages (2 sentences a day while I write novels) and keeps on finding excuses not to call me (I'm also having finals but I wouldn't waive on a daily call for the person I love). Top of that, he promised me to come to Germany for his further education. When I was there we even talked about him doing a German course here, so he could do his Masters on German. But now he says that he thinks it would be  a waste of time (he is only 24) and he would not want to lose half a year in a language course so he even thinks about continuing in India or even in America. I cried a lot when he told me, for me it would be a reason to break up if he doesn't come close to me. I feel so heartbroken that I want to only vomit or start self harming and I am on antidepressants because of lovesickness. The only reason I could live this long in a ldr was because I thought he also wanted to close the distance as much as me but he doesn't seem to want to! If I was him and really loved my gf, I'd do anything to be with her. It seems he changed a lot after we last met, and even more than since I got to know him. I got to know a very communicative guy that could talk about Everything with me and we would never stop talking. When I was in India this summer I truly was happy and he made me so nice promises. Not just he promised to do his internship in Germany (which didn't work out because he applied too late although I even had searched for internships for him, but he never liked them much enough) but he also promised to go to Germany for his Masters next summer 2018. We even talked about marriage. Going to the office so it would be easier for him to travel and us to meet. I was ready for it. I still love him but I keep on crying every day. It pains that he seems to have lost interest in me. He always talks about the ""best"" universities in India he applied to although he knew I wouldn't want him to stay back there. I told him I hoped he would only apply for Germany. After seven years long distance I thought it was enough. I'm not used to this cold, egoistic guy. I hardly recognize him anymore. I know he doesn't have another girl but the distance he even built up between us mentally  kills me. He knows I'm crying but doesn't call me up, he quits the chats all of a sudden. He leaves me in agony and pain, I cannot concentrate or think about anything else. I feel so abandoned by him. I even was ready to come there for my internship but now I'm thinking that he destroys everything that is left from our relationship. I know I'm failing if I don't study but I can't study if I don't feel mentally good. It were his calls that were like medicine for me and kept me sane back then, I experienced everything with him and I had always wanted us to stay together whole life. I remember him saying he wanted it the same. He keeps on saying he is a loser and that is why he doesn't call me, altho I told him he is not. I feel miserable and poorly left alone. I don't know how to continue, I can't forget him. He is making me more single than on a relationship and I feel cheated because he told me all these plans that he doesn't want to accomplish now.  He was such a good guy. He still means a lot to me and that is why it pains  so much. He says he doesn't break up but just his ignorance feels more broken up than in a relationship . What can I do? I don't know how to continue. "

7mid3z,2,2017-12-27,26 [M4F] - Home Wife Meets my Work Wife (Cheating/Cuckquean),SimbaOakwood,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7mid3z/26_m4f_home_wife_meets_my_work_wife/,"We had always had a great chemistry. You were able to basically read my mind and make decisions knowing I would agree. When you were my intern, I told you that everyone applying for the job had the same qualifications as you so you need to differentiate yourself. You took that to heart and you worked closely with me to pick up on my tendencies and figure out what makes me tick. You also started to flaunt that perfect body. I wasn’t trying to imply that with my comments but I definitely wasn’t complaining. It was nice that when I was working ungodly hours I had someone attractive and intelligent to be with. By the time your internship was over I had spent more time with you than my family. 

After 5 years of marriage and two kids, my wife had let herself go. The baby weight just didn’t go away and she lost her drive to try lose it. The spark we used to have was all but gone. Partly my fault because I was never home and when I was I wasn’t there mentally. My mind was back at the office with you.

After you graduated, I hired you on full time and you quickly were the top performer on my team. Recently, with all the time we had spent together, some tension was starting to build. It started with the playful flirting when we would order in dinner for the long nights of work. At the office Christmas party I made physical contact with the aid of alcohol. I put a hand on the small of your back while we waited for a drink and grazed your hand after I hugged you goodbye. 

This week was the holiday party for the entire company. This one the families were invited. I had a nervousness about the event. First, I was wary of my wife noticing the tension between you and me. Second, I was embarrassed to bring my wife along. I didn’t want to be seen with her.

Hello DPP! I am looking for someone to continue this RP with me! I want to involve first cheating and then move towards cuckquean. I am pretty much open for any kink so let me know yours! I want this to be a long term thing. 

Message me if this interests you and we can brainstorm some things first. "
7mihc6,2,2017-12-27,"This is a story of how my best friend from the last decade became my wife and then after 2 years betrayed me, cheated on me, lie to me, and left me for a 2-month-old romance, and now she is expecting his child and its only been 4 months since they met.",Oreuglas,cheating_stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/7mihc6/this_is_a_story_of_how_my_best_friend_from_the/,"This is a story of how my best friend from the last decade became my wife and then after 2 years betrayed me, cheated on me, lie to me, and left me for a 2-month-old romance, and now she is expecting his child and its only been 4 months since they met.

I met my friend (Thea) back in high school in 2006 and sometime after that became very close, just never passed the threshold of being a couple. I was always there for her, when she was feeling depressed that her brother was in jail and I try to convince her to go see him, when she had an abortion because she was seeing a man that was about 7 years older than her and had a family of his on. All I ever wanted is to protect her and see her happy, but one day I confessed to her that I loved her, to which she didn’t respond well, and she slowly walked away from my life. A year later I found out Thea had a baby (Felicity) with her then boyfriend and I had mix emotions about it. Thea said she never wanted to get married or have kids, I was happy that she was going to experience motherhood, just sad that it wasn’t with me.

After high school I continued my education and try my best to become what I always wanted to be, a biomechanical engineer; which to this very day I’m still struggling to accomplish (senior year).  About 2 years later after Thea and I stop talking I was reached by her current boyfriend/baby daddy that Thea wanted to talk to me and we spoke. She said that I was someone so special to her and that the biggest regret she had was pushing me away and loosing me. So we reconnected and try to work things out to be what we were before (or as near as possible without interfering with her relationship) and that same day I met felicity. Thea went through that relationship and 3 more, until we finally decided to give it a try and shortly after we got married. During that time a lot of things happened to Thea: her car was stolen, and she filed for bankruptcy (among other things); Nevertheless, we got married and started our life together. She started a 2-year college that same year and I decided to work full time to support her while still working towards my carrier. She complained every now and then when I had to stay late at the university, which I had to do because of laboratories and team projects; but she always quickly said that she was sorry and that she knew that I was working hard for a better future for our family. 

My job is very physical and thanks to school I didn’t sleep much, but regardless I always try to give her time. I always try to plan trips to other states, write her cards, leave her notes, bring her flowers for no reason, wake up at 5 am to make her at least a PBJ sandwich and open the gate when she left to her internship, and try to give her things that I thought had more meaning than just jewels and gems. I got us a new limited-edition car which I basically gave to her, I told her to just work 1 or 2 days and ill takeover the family finances, I took care of Felicity every morning taking her to school, I took care of her when she was sick (I rarely get sick, so I never found out if she ever would do the same for me), whenever she wanted something I gave try my best to get it for her. 

This August she had he final state exam and passed it; what was supposed to be a time of celebration turn out to be limbo for he, she started to say that she didn’t know what to do next if to try to get a job on her field (she needed experience, but no one wanted to give it to her) or continue her education. By this time Thea got a new job with her dad and she met people at her work, new friends that we spend time with. One of which was a “gay friend”; now she being my best friend I didn’t mind her “gay” friend what is the point of a relationship if you can’t trust them? Trust is the most important thing in a relationship. The trouble started during a party we had at home during which she was laying her head on his shoulder, it bothered me and I told her to which shed apologized and I forgave her so we moved on. On the next party I had to study for 2 tests and it was my brother-in-law’s birthday, so I didn’t mind the noise or the party, not until I went to the bathroom and found her laying on his lap watching a movie.  I dint say that it killed me to see that, but I try to hold it in and went back to studying (which didn’t happen). After the party was over (around 3am) we started to clean the house and then I went back to work with no sleep (I’m sure she doesn’t remember that now). I did eventually tell her that what I saw bothered and angered me and she again apologized; however, they started a rotting to go to drink coffee every Sunday morning which also meant she came to see me at work (his house is near my work place) so I liked that because she usually never came by to see me. But slowly they started spending more and more time together, entire days, which I told her that bothered me.
We became the godparents of her brother’s youngest son Malcolm in mid-October and it was a great and special moment because he is an angel I just love playing with him. We always talked about having another child, but we decided to wait until she was out of school and had sometime in her new job, not to jump the gun and just go for it, to be prepared. But this is the moment when everything went downhill, this same day we went to a wedding and another party (I rarely get weekends off, so we try to enjoy it the most we could) and throughout the day she was acting off, weird, just not there enjoying the moment. She finally got a job in her profession, good paying job may I add (just not many hours) and to celebrate I let her go to Vegas with her brother, his wife, and her gay friend (which I now regret so much), I couldn’t go because of work. She didn’t call me during her trip to Vegas, no pictures, only some texts, and the day she came back home she was 5 hours later than she had promised.  It came to the point that when Felicity was dropped off (she was with her dad for the weekend) she kept asking for her mom and we called her to ask how long until she was home, to which she responded that she made a pit stop, a 2-hour pitstop and instead of being home at 4pm she got home at 9pm when Felicity was already sleeping. 

Then Halloween came, and I spend a whole night sawing and gluing hour costumes together and went out for candy with Felicity and Malcolm (we got first place in a costume contest), but the whole day she was so distant and lost in thought. The day after I asked he why was she so off last night, not saying much, and if we were okay. Her response was that she felt that the “spark” between us was running very low and that she started to have feelings for her gay friend, we talked about it and decided to work thing out by me stepping down to part time work and spending more time together and her staying away from her gay friend. Nevertheless, Thea and her gay friend spend Friday and Saturday together, she didn’t want to tell him that they needed to keep their distance. So at this point I confronted her and talked to her face to face; she tells me that she actually has strong feelings for him and that in Vegas she thought about kissing him, but didn’t go through with it.  She asked me to not ask her to give up her friendship wither gay friend, I told her that “she knew what she needed to do” and I don’t have to tell her. On Sunday she dropped me off at work and went to see her friend at her brother house for a Star Wars marathon; she was going to talk to her gay friend about ending her relationship. She didn’t.

On Monday after dropping off Felicity at her school (first year, she is 4) I broke down in my car and called the only person I could talk to, my sister. She told me to pack my things and go because he is not gay and she either cheated on me already or she is going too because by trying to keep them away from each other I make the situation taboo and that will push her to cheat on me. So I did, and that same night I told her how I felt and that gay or not her relationship with her friend was wrong, and on the wake of me leaving she confessed that she had been cheating on me for the last two months with him and that she was sorry. I love this girl to death; I seriously do, and I forgave her that same night.  We had sex that night, but it felt so wrong and empty (biggest regret of this ordeal), I shouldn’t have allowed it to happen for the both of use (it wasn’t forced, but it feels like it now) and we decided to work it out and for her to stop talking to her gay friend, well not really gay so I’ll call him Damien. We try out for a couple of days and then she started to “miss him” and she accidently talk to him and started to go back and forth about or marriage. Then she again decided to stay with me and completely braking up with him, well until she changed her mind again and decided to go with Damien. I didn’t want to lose her and she wanted things between us to stay the same as much as possible so we decided to be roommates and I could still be Felicity’s dad. But it was so hurtful to see her come home late and ignoring me, actively telling me that she is going out with Damien, and asking my opinion on what she should wear. She only went out when I went out to school, so no one would question her random disappearance.

 It was so painful to see that the woman I love, my best friend, my wife was doing this to me and she didn’t care or it didn’t bother her that I was hurting; I was like her dog waiting for her to get home to get some kind of love. Her graduation was on mid-November and the day before I had to work, and she spend the entire day with Damien and I couldn’t take it anymore, that night I drink one too many beers and I told her everything that was in my mind (refraining from screaming or swearing). I told her how can she treat me like that after everything I have done for her, how can she stab me in the back like that; to which she responded by saying that I should have noticed that she wasn’t happy and that with Damien she found out that she loves me but isn’t in love with me. The day of her graduation I left home and moved back in with my parents (I still attended her graduation, I was there from the start and she wanted me to be there at the end because I went though it with her); we still hangout every now and then because I want to make sure she is okay, safe, and happy; and it was fun to watch shows like old times and just talk, but inside I was slowly dying.  I even met with Damian and talked to him man to man; I wanted to hit him and tell him all the shit that was in my mind, but instead I told him to take care my wife, to make her and Felicity happy, I shook his hand and said that I wish we can all grab drink in the future while watching the world cup. I  was dying in the inside, a part screaming to stop this, that this is stupid, that I am stupid… that I’m handing the love of my life to someone else. 

I still was taking care of her after all this, I let her use the new car even after I left (they are both under my name), helped Thea paid for rent (even If I don’t live with her), I picked up and took care of Felicity whenever she needed and I was available, I listen to her problems with her new man; I always put her wellbeing before my own. One of the last emotional moments I had with her was when she kicked me out of her works holiday party; we had plan to go to the party then go out clubbing and stay at an hotel to not drive home. Then I week before she told me that I shouldn’t go because he is going to be there and she won’t give me attention, and if I wanted to go we were going in separate cars, we were not going clubbing together, and the room was hers (yeah you can imagen what I imagined and she basically told me that they did have sex that night). But things got a lot worse when I went to visit Thea and she told me that she thought that she was pregnant, and that she had unprotected sex with Damien the morning of the day before I left (the day I got drunk). We checked and yes, she is pregnant, and it is not 100% sure but everything points out that it isn’t my (the only time she said I’m sorry for everything and I can tell she does mean it). This decimated me, it was our dream, we even had names picked for each gender; how can she let this happened. The last couple of day have been hell for me: I screwed up in one of my classes and I got to repeat it (and I pay out of my own pocket), I don’t sleep much ( like 2 maybe 3 hours per night), I lost a lot of weight, ( like 15 pounds), I don’t have much money and I have to pay for the car (which she still uses) and regular expenses but worst of all I can’t afford to go to school next semester so I can’t graduate until 2019 now (which is funny because I sacrificed myself for her, her studies, and her future; and now I’m on a horrible spot but she graduated). 

I lost mi wife, my home, my pillar of support (every day I needed to be reminded why I was putting myself through this hell of work and school I just saw them, and I kept pushing through), my family, my dream of parenthood, and last night I lost my daughter, I lost Felicity. She texted me saying that maybe I shouldn’t see her because she asks for me and she needs to understand that Im not her father anymore just a friend. Her exact text was as follows:
 “ Hi, I’m sorry for not talking yesterday 
But I just think it’s better to give Felicity some time to understand that we are friends and that she can be your friend but that you aren’t her dad... 
right now I feel like that’s what she sees you as... especially when her own dad doesn’t even look for her like you do... 
But I think my dads been trying to say this with out really saying it that maybe you shouldn’t come around as much especially if I’m with someone and having a baby with him...”

	It is true but that I don’t want to confuse Felicity and I don’t want to hurt her in any way, shape, or form; but it isn’t fare for me, what about me? I love them to death both Thea and Felicity, but now I’m being pushed out so fast and the last two years I been for nothing. I’m afraid that Felicity won’t remember me or that she will think that I abandon her when the exact opposite is true, I miss her so much I can’t stop crying.  Thea keeps telling me that I’m such a catch, that I give out so much and that whoever ends up with me will be the happiest person in the world and she hopes that whoever she is, she can see what an amazing guy I am. Why didn’t Thea see that, why did she let all of this happened? The only thing I asked of her when we got married was that she never betrayed me, lei to me, or cheat on me; that if she wanted to move on to just tell me and we walk away under the best of terms.  Her parents are mad at her but are being supportive because of her pregnancy (and they love her so she will get their unconditional support and love) and Damien’s mom is incredibly happy (she doesn’t know about me or the entire situation, she think that she is single and now they are together expecting a baby), she had 2 great jobs, everything is working out for Thea. 

But what about me? What is my place in all this? Why am I the only one that sacrificed it all and now I’m the only one the lost it all? Why do I keep loving her after all this? Why can’t I move on? Why do I deserve this? Is this all my fault? Why am I so miserable but she is so happy and doesn’t care about me? How can she do this to me? Me, I been there for her and sacrifice it all for her and our family, why am I the only one in pain… what can I do? How do I move on? Should we stay friends like she wants? (even if I’ll probably always love her). Why the hell can’t I just hate her and move on? … why do I still love her? Can anyone help me? Explain to me why I’m I like this (good hearted) ? Why can’t I hate her? What is funny is that instead of hating her, I’m hating myself more and more every day… I feel so depressed, sad, alone, but most of all used and worthless.

Any input will be welcomed. And thank you for reading my story.

7miomc,1,2017-12-27,"21 [M4A] For F: Older female/Younger male, Buying Your New Toy at Auction, Tied up, Worshipping the Fertility Gods, Rule 34. For M: Looking for ""Straight"" Guys Who Love Big Cock.",out_and_kinda_about,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7miomc/21_m4a_for_f_older_femaleyounger_male_buying_your/,"Working on a few new prompts. These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

_____________________________________________________________

For F: A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.

___________________________________________________________

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.

Here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

I met my friend (Thea) back in high school in 2006 and sometime after that became very close, just never passed the threshold of being a couple. I was always there for her, when she was feeling depressed that her brother was in jail and I try to convince her to go see him, when she had an abortion because she was seeing a man that was about 7 years older than her and had a family of his on. All I ever wanted is to protect her and see her happy, but one day I confessed to her that I loved her, to which she didn’t respond well, and she slowly walked away from my life. A year later I found out Thea had a baby (Felicity) with her then boyfriend and I had mix emotions about it. Thea said she never wanted to get married or have kids, I was happy that she was going to experience motherhood, just sad that it wasn’t with me.

After high school I continued my education and try my best to become what I always wanted to be, a biomechanical engineer; which to this very day I’m still struggling to accomplish (senior year).  About 2 years later after Thea and I stop talking I was reached by her current boyfriend/baby daddy that Thea wanted to talk to me and we spoke. She said that I was someone so special to her and that the biggest regret she had was pushing me away and loosing me. So we reconnected and try to work things out to be what we were before (or as near as possible without interfering with her relationship) and that same day I met felicity. Thea went through that relationship and 3 more, until we finally decided to give it a try and shortly after we got married. During that time a lot of things happened to Thea: her car was stolen, and she filed for bankruptcy (among other things); Nevertheless, we got married and started our life together. She started a 2-year college that same year and I decided to work full time to support her while still working towards my carrier. She complained every now and then when I had to stay late at the university, which I had to do because of laboratories and team projects; but she always quickly said that she was sorry and that she knew that I was working hard for a better future for our family. 

My job is very physical and thanks to school I didn’t sleep much, but regardless I always try to give her time. I always try to plan trips to other states, write her cards, leave her notes, bring her flowers for no reason, wake up at 5 am to make her at least a PBJ sandwich and open the gate when she left to her internship, and try to give her things that I thought had more meaning than just jewels and gems. I got us a new limited-edition car which I basically gave to her, I told her to just work 1 or 2 days and ill takeover the family finances, I took care of Felicity every morning taking her to school, I took care of her when she was sick (I rarely get sick, so I never found out if she ever would do the same for me), whenever she wanted something I gave try my best to get it for her. 

This August she had he final state exam and passed it; what was supposed to be a time of celebration turn out to be limbo for he, she started to say that she didn’t know what to do next if to try to get a job on her field (she needed experience, but no one wanted to give it to her) or continue her education. By this time Thea got a new job with her dad and she met people at her work, new friends that we spend time with. One of which was a “gay friend”; now she being my best friend I didn’t mind her “gay” friend what is the point of a relationship if you can’t trust them? Trust is the most important thing in a relationship. The trouble started during a party we had at home during which she was laying her head on his shoulder, it bothered me and I told her to which shed apologized and I forgave her so we moved on. On the next party I had to study for 2 tests and it was my brother-in-law’s birthday, so I didn’t mind the noise or the party, not until I went to the bathroom and found her laying on his lap watching a movie.  I dint say that it killed me to see that, but I try to hold it in and went back to studying (which didn’t happen). After the party was over (around 3am) we started to clean the house and then I went back to work with no sleep (I’m sure she doesn’t remember that now). I did eventually tell her that what I saw bothered and angered me and she again apologized; however, they started a rotting to go to drink coffee every Sunday morning which also meant she came to see me at work (his house is near my work place) so I liked that because she usually never came by to see me. But slowly they started spending more and more time together, entire days, which I told her that bothered me.
We became the godparents of her brother’s youngest son Malcolm in mid-October and it was a great and special moment because he is an angel I just love playing with him. We always talked about having another child, but we decided to wait until she was out of school and had sometime in her new job, not to jump the gun and just go for it, to be prepared. But this is the moment when everything went downhill, this same day we went to a wedding and another party (I rarely get weekends off, so we try to enjoy it the most we could) and throughout the day she was acting off, weird, just not there enjoying the moment. She finally got a job in her profession, good paying job may I add (just not many hours) and to celebrate I let her go to Vegas with her brother, his wife, and her gay friend (which I now regret so much), I couldn’t go because of work. She didn’t call me during her trip to Vegas, no pictures, only some texts, and the day she came back home she was 5 hours later than she had promised.  It came to the point that when Felicity was dropped off (she was with her dad for the weekend) she kept asking for her mom and we called her to ask how long until she was home, to which she responded that she made a pit stop, a 2-hour pitstop and instead of being home at 4pm she got home at 9pm when Felicity was already sleeping. 

Then Halloween came, and I spend a whole night sawing and gluing hour costumes together and went out for candy with Felicity and Malcolm (we got first place in a costume contest), but the whole day she was so distant and lost in thought. The day after I asked he why was she so off last night, not saying much, and if we were okay. Her response was that she felt that the “spark” between us was running very low and that she started to have feelings for her gay friend, we talked about it and decided to work thing out by me stepping down to part time work and spending more time together and her staying away from her gay friend. Nevertheless, Thea and her gay friend spend Friday and Saturday together, she didn’t want to tell him that they needed to keep their distance. So at this point I confronted her and talked to her face to face; she tells me that she actually has strong feelings for him and that in Vegas she thought about kissing him, but didn’t go through with it.  She asked me to not ask her to give up her friendship wither gay friend, I told her that “she knew what she needed to do” and I don’t have to tell her. On Sunday she dropped me off at work and went to see her friend at her brother house for a Star Wars marathon; she was going to talk to her gay friend about ending her relationship. She didn’t.

On Monday after dropping off Felicity at her school (first year, she is 4) I broke down in my car and called the only person I could talk to, my sister. She told me to pack my things and go because he is not gay and she either cheated on me already or she is going too because by trying to keep them away from each other I make the situation taboo and that will push her to cheat on me. So I did, and that same night I told her how I felt and that gay or not her relationship with her friend was wrong, and on the wake of me leaving she confessed that she had been cheating on me for the last two months with him and that she was sorry. I love this girl to death; I seriously do, and I forgave her that same night.  We had sex that night, but it felt so wrong and empty (biggest regret of this ordeal), I shouldn’t have allowed it to happen for the both of use (it wasn’t forced, but it feels like it now) and we decided to work it out and for her to stop talking to her gay friend, well not really gay so I’ll call him Damien. We try out for a couple of days and then she started to “miss him” and she accidently talk to him and started to go back and forth about or marriage. Then she again decided to stay with me and completely braking up with him, well until she changed her mind again and decided to go with Damien. I didn’t want to lose her and she wanted things between us to stay the same as much as possible so we decided to be roommates and I could still be Felicity’s dad. But it was so hurtful to see her come home late and ignoring me, actively telling me that she is going out with Damien, and asking my opinion on what she should wear. She only went out when I went out to school, so no one would question her random disappearance.

 It was so painful to see that the woman I love, my best friend, my wife was doing this to me and she didn’t care or it didn’t bother her that I was hurting; I was like her dog waiting for her to get home to get some kind of love. Her graduation was on mid-November and the day before I had to work, and she spend the entire day with Damien and I couldn’t take it anymore, that night I drink one too many beers and I told her everything that was in my mind (refraining from screaming or swearing). I told her how can she treat me like that after everything I have done for her, how can she stab me in the back like that; to which she responded by saying that I should have noticed that she wasn’t happy and that with Damien she found out that she loves me but isn’t in love with me. The day of her graduation I left home and moved back in with my parents (I still attended her graduation, I was there from the start and she wanted me to be there at the end because I went though it with her); we still hangout every now and then because I want to make sure she is okay, safe, and happy; and it was fun to watch shows like old times and just talk, but inside I was slowly dying.  I even met with Damian and talked to him man to man; I wanted to hit him and tell him all the shit that was in my mind, but instead I told him to take care my wife, to make her and Felicity happy, I shook his hand and said that I wish we can all grab drink in the future while watching the world cup. I  was dying in the inside, a part screaming to stop this, that this is stupid, that I am stupid… that I’m handing the love of my life to someone else. 

I still was taking care of her after all this, I let her use the new car even after I left (they are both under my name), helped Thea paid for rent (even If I don’t live with her), I picked up and took care of Felicity whenever she needed and I was available, I listen to her problems with her new man; I always put her wellbeing before my own. One of the last emotional moments I had with her was when she kicked me out of her works holiday party; we had plan to go to the party then go out clubbing and stay at an hotel to not drive home. Then I week before she told me that I shouldn’t go because he is going to be there and she won’t give me attention, and if I wanted to go we were going in separate cars, we were not going clubbing together, and the room was hers (yeah you can imagen what I imagined and she basically told me that they did have sex that night). But things got a lot worse when I went to visit Thea and she told me that she thought that she was pregnant, and that she had unprotected sex with Damien the morning of the day before I left (the day I got drunk). We checked and yes, she is pregnant, and it is not 100% sure but everything points out that it isn’t my (the only time she said I’m sorry for everything and I can tell she does mean it). This decimated me, it was our dream, we even had names picked for each gender; how can she let this happened. The last couple of day have been hell for me: I screwed up in one of my classes and I got to repeat it (and I pay out of my own pocket), I don’t sleep much ( like 2 maybe 3 hours per night), I lost a lot of weight, ( like 15 pounds), I don’t have much money and I have to pay for the car (which she still uses) and regular expenses but worst of all I can’t afford to go to school next semester so I can’t graduate until 2019 now (which is funny because I sacrificed myself for her, her studies, and her future; and now I’m on a horrible spot but she graduated). 

I lost mi wife, my home, my pillar of support (every day I needed to be reminded why I was putting myself through this hell of work and school I just saw them, and I kept pushing through), my family, my dream of parenthood, and last night I lost my daughter, I lost Felicity. She texted me saying that maybe I shouldn’t see her because she asks for me and she needs to understand that Im not her father anymore just a friend. Her exact text was as follows:
 “ Hi, I’m sorry for not talking yesterday 
But I just think it’s better to give Felicity some time to understand that we are friends and that she can be your friend but that you aren’t her dad... 
right now I feel like that’s what she sees you as... especially when her own dad doesn’t even look for her like you do... 
But I think my dads been trying to say this with out really saying it that maybe you shouldn’t come around as much especially if I’m with someone and having a baby with him...”

	It is true but that I don’t want to confuse Felicity and I don’t want to hurt her in any way, shape, or form; but it isn’t fare for me, what about me? I love them to death both Thea and Felicity, but now I’m being pushed out so fast and the last two years I been for nothing. I’m afraid that Felicity won’t remember me or that she will think that I abandon her when the exact opposite is true, I miss her so much I can’t stop crying.  Thea keeps telling me that I’m such a catch, that I give out so much and that whoever ends up with me will be the happiest person in the world and she hopes that whoever she is, she can see what an amazing guy I am. Why didn’t Thea see that, why did she let all of this happened? The only thing I asked of her when we got married was that she never betrayed me, lei to me, or cheat on me; that if she wanted to move on to just tell me and we walk away under the best of terms.  Her parents are mad at her but are being supportive because of her pregnancy (and they love her so she will get their unconditional support and love) and Damien’s mom is incredibly happy (she doesn’t know about me or the entire situation, she think that she is single and now they are together expecting a baby), she had 2 great jobs, everything is working out for Thea. 

But what about me? What is my place in all this? Why am I the only one that sacrificed it all and now I’m the only one the lost it all? Why do I keep loving her after all this? Why can’t I move on? Why do I deserve this? Is this all my fault? Why am I so miserable but she is so happy and doesn’t care about me? How can she do this to me? Me, I been there for her and sacrifice it all for her and our family, why am I the only one in pain… what can I do? How do I move on? Should we stay friends like she wants? (even if I’ll probably always love her). Why the hell can’t I just hate her and move on? … why do I still love her? Can anyone help me? Explain to me why I’m I like this (good hearted) ? Why can’t I hate her? What is funny is that instead of hating her, I’m hating myself more and more every day… I feel so depressed, sad, alone, but most of all used and worthless.

Any input will be welcomed. And thank you for reading my story."
7mj7q7,31,2017-12-27,"Advertising, mind control, and the battle for your thoughts, money, and votes.",monopoly_man_pass_go,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mj7q7/advertising_mind_control_and_the_battle_for_your/,"I've been on a little bit of a rant in comments so I figured I would consolidate my recent thoughts into a PSA kind of post.

I'm not going to dox myself so I will not provide any credentials.  What I will tell you is I have been in board rooms of multiple advertising, internet marketing, and media companies.  Including those for political campaigns.  I have seen how the sausage is made.  I am not special, there are many many like me.  It is a huge industry.  I'm not providing anything that isn't already out there - it's somewhat hard to find and to difficult to synthesize the big picture.

This isn't the movies and these people don't sit in dimly lit smoke-filled rooms and openly concoct schemes to influence your actions.  They speak in industry terms like impressions, eCPMs, click-through rates, targeted audiences, segmented demographics, ROI, retargeting, etc.  It's compartmentalized.  Different entities play different roles and no single person really oversees everything from start to finish.

When people think of mind control, they think of an MKUltra-like scene with a subject's eyelids taped open, strapped to a chair, watching a barrage of video clips, with heavy industrial music blaring.  Sure, some of that exists in the form of government experiments (MKUltra = proven conspiracy), but it sounds pretty expensive and you have to literally kidnap people.  It's much easier, cheaper, and more effective to run an advertising campaign (i.e. propaganda).

Again, the people in this industry don't think they are doing anything wrong.  And I wouldn't necessarily say they are doing anything wrong - just exercising their free speech.  But everyone needs to understand how this works and how this is evolving.  In the past few years, many many people are being used as pawns in this game unknowingly.

The components (some entities do a combination of the below - most are compartmentalized):

Advertisers:

* Companies, political campaigns, interest groups, governments, anyone with motive and means to control your actions
* Regardless on how you feel about their products/message/etc at the end of the day they are trying to get someone to do something (buy a product, vote a certain way, have a view on a topic).

Creative/Strategy Agencies:

* These are the highly-paid creatively-minded people that develop the content, concepts, outreach strategies, etc that will work to achieve the campaign goals (i.e. mind control) - they sometimes direct all of the components below but most of the time more focused on specific channels (TV, print, internet ads vs. what the PR agencies focus on).
* This can be a really expensive component for a broad-reach campaign that spans multiple channels (think Mad Men type people - yes, they do exist)
* This can be relatively cheap for a more narrowly defined campaign (i.e. hire a designer to develop a banner ad for a mobile game)
* This can be really really cheap (free) when your neighbor creates the content / creative! Successful campaign! (more on this later)
* Content creation is still the bottle-neck in the process - most everything else is automated and creating campaign creatives that work needs a human touch

PR/Social Media Agencies (people and tech):

* These have rapidly evolved.  In the past, they would respond to feedback in the market or a crisis situation and engage the community with a meticulously crafted lawyer-reviewed PR statement (still do).  Can sometimes look like news - factual, but highly crafted and one-sided.
* These are now engaging the community real time to drive the narrative and make it look organic
* These are where the shills live (social media engagement professionals - such a nice term!) - working of a script most of the time
* These are where the bots live (social media uplift tools - such a nice term!) - used for upvoting/sharing/etc but mostly dumb I/O programs - can be sophisticated
* Shills are way more expensive than bots - shit-wage hourly payroll
* Some of these can be good-natured, some are pure scum of the earth
* A lot of times these are black-boxes - advertisers and creative agencies literally do not know how these firms achieve their goals (proprietary tech!) nor do they want to
* Sometime your neighbor may be fulfilling this function! For free! Success!
* Think about what AI could do...
* Influencers also play a role here (and in media below) - how do you think these twitch/YT personalities make money?

Ad Tech / Big Data:

* You could spend a lifetime trying to catalogue these tools.  There are many that pop up and die all the time.  The big media companies have some of these tools internally that they developed/acquired.
* There are a ton of different functions these companies preform.  Good luck trying to decipher what they actually do on their website.
* These players are largely tech driven firms without a lot of human oversight / interaction
* The relevant ones here for this discussion are the ones that collect different data points about you (web history, netflix viewing, online comments, likes/shares, etc.) to profile you and segment you into a different groups that are relevant to advertisers.  There are also firms that monitor and evaluate campaign reach / effectiveness.

Media Platforms:

* This is the platform to deliver the mind control message - TV, print, radio, facebook, twitter, reddit, etc.
* A lot of the advertising that is sold by these companies is automated and aggregated/moderated by third parties.  Yes, the full page takeover on ESPN.com is a result of a phone call negotiated campaign but most of digital advertising is bought on an exchange where advertisers just type in a budget and click on some checkboxes for demographic targeting (think zip codes, interests, etc.).  The only people monitoring the advertising content are low-paid interns and bots that just scan for porn/obscene shit.
* Selling this advertising space and user data is what pays for all of the internet that we enjoy for free.  We are not the customer.
* Media platforms are also advertisers, can, and absolutely influence their users to achieve their goals.
* Segmenting and cataloguing users is valuable to media platforms - advertisers pay more to reach specific users with specific interests.   

Sharing Economy:

* You know what has been a fantastic development for this ecosystem?  User generated content!  Media platforms don't have to push news or create recreational content.  Users will do it for free!  Users create content en masse and the advertisers pick up what sticks and blast it to relevant audiences that get re-shared!
* You know what is the high mark for a successful mind control campaign?  Sharing!  Free advertising!

Regarding politics, all of these firms salivate every four years at the juicy juicy campaign budgets.  What do you think Google's position is on Citizens United?

Now that you know how the sausage is made and the landscape, I'd like to revisit a handful of topics that come up often on this sub in this context:

(1) The well-known and not-so-known firms in the 2016 election.  Cambridge Analytica has made the news.

* Correct the Record (now retracted back into Media Matters / Shareblue) is a ""social media agency"" that was literally using low paid wage workers to respond to social media comments off a script.  Easy to spot and highly ineffective since they were mostly reactive and blanketing the internet with scripted responses that every audience saw.  Expensive and doesn't scale.
* Cambridge Analytica is a UK ""big data"" firm that enabled the Trump campaign to segment, catalogue, target, and deliver different messages to different groups of people across multiple platforms.  Virtually impossible to spot and extremely effective.  For example delivering ""drain the swamp"" to the conspiracy minded and delivering ""build the wall"" to blue collar workers on FB.  Inexpensive and scales immensely.  You just develop single-issue creatives (risky if it doesnt resonate), the rules on what audiences see what creative (with the help of CA), and pump dollars in for internet media buys (free flowing thanks Citizens United).  But who created the content?  Was it the campaign/SuperPACs?  Was it crowdsourced on 4chan?
* Little known to most, Bernie had an impactful ""social media agency"" called Revolution Messaging.  They were the ones that coordinated the online grassroots fundraising.  These were still shills but had a proactive, targeted, well-crafted message delivered to hand-picked audiences.  They probably did this pro bono or on contingency.  Otherwise they would be really expensive.  Doesn't scale.

(2) Collusion and campaign finance

* As you can see in the landscape above, it's all compartmentalized.  So much plausible deniability at every fucking level.
* Is it illegal for the DNC to pick up the tab after the RNC to pay for Fusion GPS' hiring of an ex-UK spy?
* Is it illegal for Russia to get data and analytics from the same UK firm that the Trump campaign did?  Is it illegal for Cambridge Analytica to ""independently"" help their clients achieve their goals?
* Should internet political campaigns be regulated in a similar way as TV, print, and radio?
* Does any politician or group above have a motive to promote campaign finance reform?

(3) Reddit censorship and echo chambers

* Does Reddit have a business interest to create echo chambers?  Do they give a flying fuck about open discussion or would much rather have similar-minded users neatly packaged into catalogued subreddits?  
* Would they really ever ban r/T D? - Are raking in the cash from Fox News and the like who advertise to that group?  
* Do they censor subreddits and discussion if it hurts their bottom line or impairs their advertising goals?

(4) Q

* I've curiously followed Q from the beginning and still do.  I find his questions interesting.  Q's legit-ness (straight-legit, GOAT LARP, nefarious) is a polarizing topic and already heavily discussed but it's not relevant.
* The actual stated goal of Q's questions (as interpreted by those researching / meming) is ""To explain the chaos of our times to our loved ones and friends. We have been chosen to spread the word and to ease and assist the transition of our world"".  
* If that is the case, this means to literally create advertising content and share it to targeted audiences.  Psy-op.  Mind control.  For better or worse depending on how you feel about Q.


Happy to answer any questions about my experience in the advertising world to a limited extent (without doxing myself or violating NDAs)."
7mjhmf,20,2017-12-27,I'm Quitting Residency (Surgical Subspecialty). Do I need to finish intern year? Or quit without a medical license?,newschooldr,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/7mjhmf/im_quitting_residency_surgical_subspecialty_do_i/,"Current PGY1 in a surgical subspecialty but have realized that my heart is not in clinical medicine. Leaving a specialty I worked so hard to get into is obviously scary and I was hesitant at first. Two months ago I made the decision that I am quitting. That day I felt a sense of relief and I have continuously checked in with myself on a daily basis and my decision holds true.

Prior to residency, I started two businesses, both of which were thriving prior to residency, and have continued to stay profitable since. I find much more excitement and reward in my business ventures and am hopeful that I will make a larger impact in the world through these passions. In clinical medicine, I feel limited in multiple ways – I can only treat/help one patient at a time, my time is exchanged for money (active income), the lifestyle of an attending surgeon is not what I desire, etc. In entrepreneurship and innovation, a wider reach to help thousands or even millions is possible, passive income is much easier, and the lifestyle has greater flexibility.

My question is regarding the pros and cons of having a medical license. I am deciding whether I want to finish intern year (another 6 months) or quit sooner (January 2018). I initially planned to finish intern year as it is ""safer"" to have a medical license, however a promising business opportunity has landed in my lap that would benefit from me being able to work on it full time ASAP.

I have no intention to practice in urgent care, nor do I anticipate ever working in a medi-spa or similar. I see my future in business/entrepreneurship and would like to use my MD, but do not intend to interact with patients. How beneficial is a medical license in my case? Would a medical license help me in any way outside of direct contact with patients and in the business world – does it hold any weight?"

7mk01u,1,2017-12-27,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7mk01u/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7mkdze,5,2017-12-27,Career Guidance,ThePetroEngineer,oilandgasworkers,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgasworkers/comments/7mkdze/career_guidance/,"Ill be graduating this upcoming spring with a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering with a 3.5+ gpa. Originally, when I started off the program, the plan was to either go into reservoir or production engineering. Unfortunately, this was also the time when the market was at its lowest. Therefore, it was difficult for me and other people around me to obtain any internships (maybe it was because I put in my full effort).

Right now, I am currently planning on learning Python and taking the FE which will hopefully boost my resume. I cannot see myself starting off as a field engineer. (yes, I understand I do not have experience yet). I prefer an office job for the most part and my long term goal is to get an MBA from a good b-school and transition into the management side of a company. If there are any reservoir or production engineers here who can give me suggestions on what to do, I'd greatly appreciate it. Also what can potentially be my other options? Im located in Houston, TX."
7mkg19,3,2017-12-27,10 Tips To Face An Interview For The First Time,realtopjobs,interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/7mkg19/10_tips_to_face_an_interview_for_the_first_time/,"Appearing for a job interview for the very first time can be a nerve racking experience, to say the least! You are a novice, fresh in the industry with no substantial experience other than a few internships that may not count at all. Face-to-face interaction with your employer is your only chance to make a lasting impression and get you hired for your first job.
But how can one do this? What we have here for you are the 10 tips that will help you face and successfully crack your first job interview.
1. Know The Company - Know About The Business
This goes without saying! This is what any employer expects from you and they aren’t wrong! Research well about the company you are applying for and know their aim, mission, vision, values and functions. Using this information in your answers will create the right impression in front of your employer. The research is the first and foremost task that you need to do before appearing in any interview.
2. The Introduction - Watch What You Say!
‘Tell me about yourself’ is every employers favorite question! So be confident in your approach while you tell them about yourself. 
3. What Can You Offer?
Thoroughly know the job title you are applying for, the responsibilities and why you are fit for the job. Remember a wide specturm of opportunities awaits you. so, for every point that you make, try to have an instance where you have used that quality.
4. Act Confident Without Hesitation
This can be quite a task considering it’s the first time you are sitting for an interview but you have to pull off this lie. You have to act confident and make the employer feel that you have it all together and perfectly fit the job. Only confidence can get you there without much hassle.
5. Never Lie In Your Resume 
Lying can backfire! The person sitting in front of you has ample experience of interviews and can easily know when you are faking it. So keep it real and only write in your CV, what you have actually achieved.
6. Dress Well 
""Job interview prepration"" is not as formidable as it sounds. No one can stress enough on the fact that in case of an interview, ‘The first impression is the last impression.’ Put on your best clothes (formal of course!) and look neat when going for an interview for the first time or otherwise.
7. Have Your Questions Ready
Be observant and notice what’s going around you. Once the interviewer is done asking you questions, it is going to be your turn. Return the favor! Ask if you have any questions about the company and the role they are offering you. Just make sure they don’t come across as offensive or rude.
8. Be Eager To Learn
It’s okay to not know everything! If you get stuck on some questions and don’t know what to say, politely let the interviewer know. But also make it a point to ask what the answer was once they are done with all the questions. This shows your eagerness to learn, which is often considered useful from an employer point of view.
9. Deep Breathe 
More than anything else, it’s the anxiety that ruins most interviews. Just before entering the room, take a few deep breaths and relax your nerves. Trust me, It always helps!
10. Thank You Mail 
Whether or not you are hired, make sure you send the employer a thank you mail after the interview telling them how glad you are to get this opportunity and how you hope to get selected for the same.
So get going and all the best for your job interview preparation!"
7ml6h4,5,2017-12-28,Would you rather do a semester abroad in Hong Kong or Singapore (or possibly Seoul)? Why?,uwoooo,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/7ml6h4/would_you_rather_do_a_semester_abroad_in_hong/,"Hi! I'm a Canadian student who is set on doing a 4-month semester abroad at either HKU in Hong Kong, NUS in Singapore, or one of three top universities in Seoul. I'll be going at the beginning of 2019 but I need to get my application submitted in a couple of weeks.

Going on exchange in Asia alone pretty much guarantees a lot of hopping around to different nearby destinations, which is why I'd love for your guys' opinions!

I've been to Hong Kong and loved it. I didn't have nearly enough time to explore it (is there ever?) as I was just visiting in transit. I'd love to go back for longer and get a deeper appreciation for it.

My concern with Singapore is that from what I've read it sounds quite boring, especially if I'm spending 4 months there. However, Singapore's central location and English language makes it appealing as a 'base' from which to operate out of, since I intend to spend many of my weekends traveling to nearby countries. Flights from Singapore to the rest of SEA are quite a bit cheaper than from HKG from what I've seen.

I'd also really love to go to Seoul, but the reason I say ""possibly Seoul"" is that the Korean second semester begins in March and ends in June. Being from Canada, this really messes with my ability to get a summer internship as normally internships are from May-August.

I'm a very open-minded person and I don't think I can go wrong any way, which is why I'm having a hard time making the decision!

What do you think? Where would you go? Why?"

Pied Piper* is the hot company in the Valley right now. Nobody's really sure what we do, but we're really good at it. We are a young, hard-charging, painfully trendy, tech firm. As such, we live up to all the stereotypes. Ping pong tables in the office, bean bags, a snack bar, ... and a ""unique"" corporate culture ... of which you're going to be a key part....

So who are you? The older buttoned-down corporate lawyer / office Mom who just wants to fit in? A young intern, who'll do what she's told? A useless programmer we can't fire but are determined to get our money's worth from? The HR person who has happiness as their only KPI?

How should I advise my mom as she moves forward? How should I navigate my own financial situation?",theecozoic,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7mn0u0/my_family_is_homeless_lost_our_house_to/,"My mom makes approximately $40k per year. My grandma no longer works. Uncle lives in the same house and makes around the same as my mom, so *I'm estimating combined household income is around $80k.* I think they keep pulling money out of the equity to 'live large' because they don't perceive any hope for the situation.
_______ 
Grandma ""loaned"" (in good will but with no contract) over $150k to my aunt, and I don't believe she makes enough money to pay that back. Aunt's house is wrecked. 2 of her 3 'boys' (24 - 29) don't work. 

My mom and dad (69) are separated but still married. My dad totaled his van a few months ago and was charged with DUI #2, now living in sober living and scored a handyman/carpet cleaning position with the recovery organization in exchange for housing and pay. 

Family unit across the board is fairly dysfunctional; it's never been functional as far back as I can remember, but things are starting to get better. Everyone has grown up quite a bit, but there's no one in the family that's trying to 'turn over a new leaf' or whatever, and I (24) am barely starting to establish myself in the educational field. My mom can barely stand being in the house with my uncle and grandma because of prevalent addictions, and I feel pretty much out of place while I'm here for the holidays.

I'm getting a vibe that people are using my grandma for the equity still in the house, she's getting old in age, and I'm getting the feeling that when she dies the whole family is gonna implode via the house.

_____________________

Rent where we live (OC) is $1k - $2k per month for a single room, so I think saving the house is the last, best chance that my mom has to live and share ownership of a place until I'm pulling in decent income. I think rent is essentially burning money just to live in a place and I feel stuck because it's gonna be difficult for my family to get anywhere when over half our monthly income goes straight to rent alone. 

I know how to navigate food stamps and other social services out there; I think my mom and dad have avoided applying for affordable housing and food stamps out of pride, to their own detriment.

______________

I feel like this is a big conversation because of the complexity. I'm looking after myself first and foremost. I'm going into the educational field; I'm currently doing an internship out-of-county until June 2018. I don't have any student loan debt and my credit is great.

**I understand almost none of this is my responsibility and I should not take the burdens from my family's mistakes upon myself. I do recognize the dire straits we are in, I'm trying to figure out my role, how I can best advise my mom moving forward, and what we [I] can or should do.**"

(NEED HELP)",meesterlamko,afinil,https://www.reddit.com/r/afinil/comments/7mn1s3/my_story_modafinil_anxiety_and_5htp_need_help/,"I have been searching the internet for a long period and haven't found the answer to many of the issues I have been facing lately with modafinil. Here is my story: 

I discovered modafinil exactly one year ago and I took it during exams (1 month). During this period I didn't have any negative side effects. I was feeling very happy, focused and calm. I did very well on my exams and I was overall VERRY happy with it. 

After my exams ended, I began to take it sporadically during the semester when I really needed to focus. Come exam-period, I took it again but experienced some anxiety. I had never felt this anxiety before from taking moda. This ultimately went away and again I did very well on my exams. However this time, after quitting, I experienced symptoms of depression and burnout. I then stopped taking the drug for a month. 

I had this very demanding summer-internship at a prestigious law firm, so I decided to try it again. This time I again experienced anxiety but it got heavier. It even ruined most of my time at this firm. 

After my internship, I had this week of studying to do, so I kept using the modafinil and during this week I didn't feel any anxiety and passed with flying colours on my exam. 

After this I stopped using the modafinil and again experienced feelings of depression and lethargy, I took 5 HTP and this somewhat helped me get out it and become ""the old me"". 

I am now in exam-period and I am taking modafinil again. I am experiencing extreme mood swings and anxiety. Deep down I just want to quit taking it. But as this is my last exam period I will ever have to take I really want to get good grades. I just don't know what to do. I can keep taking it and hope that the irritability and anxiety will fade away after some time. I can start taking 5 HTP together with the modafinil to boos my seratonin, but I am a bit worried about any negative effects this can have on my brain. 

I hope to find someone with similar experience and good advise. My dose: 100-200 mg"

I'm 20 and second year in a computer science degree. I love programming and I feel I could easily do this for a living. I'm having a 10/12 weeks internship this summer and as I always try to aim big, I applied for Google's STEP in Ireland. I'm usually optimistic but I think its the fist time I can only keep the optimism to a low level and face the reality. It took me around two or three weeks to man the fuck up and make a resume. So I started, a little bit about myself, some goals, some education, and when I got to experience, I stopped. And I stared so long at that title, while being angry at myself. The only jobs I've ever had were as dishwasher, and I felt like losing potential there but needing money, a job is a job as long as its fair. 
And here comes my dilemma. I'm somewhat confident in my abilities, and if I put something in my mind that I want to do in a program most of the time I end up doing it. But the thought of actually going professional, as in a CUSTOMER using something that I MADE scares me so bad. Doing something for myself is easy, if any errors appear along the way, I fix them, but thinking that someone else payed money and due to some little error that I didn't observe they end up having issues all because of me, makes me really uneasy.

I was a pretty slim kid, but after 3 years of chemo for leukemia and subsequent steroids and activity restrictions I began my struggle with my weight. I lost a bit of weight in high school, but regained that and more in college. I was able to lose about 60 pounds my senior year of college due to phentermine and a perfect storm of exercise and food options. Unfortunately that rapid weight loss caused me to have gallstones. After my gallbladder was removed i slowly regained because of the slow recovery and sudden ability to eat fatty foods that used to make me sick. Since then I have slowly regained and last night, at a study for my hip pain, my 5 feet frame was up to 240 pounds. Up until now I hadn't really had any symptoms or issues related to my weight, but now I'm noticing the drag on my body and I feel like my upper body shifts to making it harder to breathe when I lay down at night. What's worse is I know my shit. My M.A. is in Clinical Psychology with an emphasis in Health Psychology and behavior change. My thesis was on gender differences in weight loss motivation (Spoiler: age is a better predictor than gender of what motivators you endorse). My internship was as a behavioral specialist at one of the top 15 weight loss clinics in the USA. So... I'm frustrated with myself and feel like a failure before I've even started. This time there's the added pressure of wanting to do well so my husband also stays on track, whose father died from diabetes related complications. I desperately want this for him, and myself. I'm hoping for the best but I can't help but already feel defeated. Sorry for the rambling, I think I'm just hoping for some ""You can do it!"" momentum to break free from this learned helplessness.

Tonight we're doing our initial consultation with Jenny Craig (they have the best short term outcomes and my husband needs the structure. Then we'll transition to weight watchers, who have the best long term outcomes of commercially available weight loss programs). If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! "
7mo8ks,4,2017-12-28,My boyfriend [21M] and I [22F] seem to have different priorities with how we approach life. Is that a deal breaker?,kittymeowme0ws,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mo8ks/my_boyfriend_21m_and_i_22f_seem_to_have_different/,"Let me provide some context: We have been dating for almost two years and love each other and have talked about our future together, pertaining to kids, marriage, what would happen if I couldn't have kids/what if we had to do long distance, yadda yadda. The whole shebang. 

However, besides this complete adoration and compatibility with one another, there are issues with how we approach life that make me wonder if we'll last for another ten years or so. 

I come from a poor family. Food stamps and ""immigrant parents who worked 60 hours a week to provide for their kids"" poor. Naturally, as I grow older, I seek out financial stability.
I have a very pessimistic outlook on life where I believe that tomorrow is never guaranteed so today is when you should take action. This makes me want to do things right away and leads me to act very sporadically and doing things without much planning in fear that I may not be able to do things in the future. I'd rather deal with issues now than later. 

Some of the critiques of my boyfriend is that he's not taking his future seriously. He's very.... apathetic? I will have about $20k or so of student loans after college but they're all federal loans and after calculating the interests, there's no point in me trying to pay them off sooner than 10 years so it'll only save me a few hundred bucks if I paid them off in say, 7 or 8.
Whereas my boyfriend pays for college at full sticker price. His student loan debt will be somewhere around $70k or so and that's undergrad alone. He has yet to look at his payments and when I tell him he should put away $10 a month or so towards his loans to help even a little bit, he brushes my advice off. 
Now don't get me wrong, my boyfriend isn't financially reckless or anything. If anything, I'm the more irresponsible one as I went money crazy with two credit cards and now most of my money goes towards them while he now supports the both of us with his limited income on top of a dog we co-own. It just bugs me that he doesn't want to think or address his student loans until later. On top of that, he's a business student who is about to be a senior and has a 2.9 GPA, has held no internships or relevant experience to his major, and hasn't networked whatsoever. His school boasts a 96% job placement after graduation but I fear he'll be one of the 4% or have a low paying entry level job where I'll be left with supporting us AND his student loans after we graduate.

As I had mentioned, I am pretty pessimistic with life. I don't like to wait doing things because I've had many family members die where I ultimately regret not doing more for them when they're alive which has really guided my mindset. My boyfriend is the opposite. He prefers to do things later in the week. I'll tell him to call his 93 year old Grandpa and say hi and although doing nothing at that moment, he says he'll do it later that week which stresses me out. 

Another issue we have is that we don't see eye to eye on how to approach miscellaneous issues. Another example of this is that one night at 1am, it had snowed earlier and I had found a broken shovel that still worked so I thought it'd be for the best to clear off the steps and sidewalk to our building before it ices over. My boyfriend comes out and tells me to stop and asks why I'm doing this. I tell him why. He tells me that if I'm concerned about ice, to just be more careful. We get into a little argument about this because I'd rather just deal with now than later. 
My boyfriend always assumes he's right which can be frustrating as he's only right 50% of the time and will brush off what I say. 

These are minor issues but I fear they'll grow into something bigger and I'm wondering if these are qualms that can be solved through talking and or counseling or should I reconsider the relationship.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I approach life differently. I am pessimistic about life overall so I try to live it to the fullest and more financially aware of my post-undergrad future whereas my boyfriend is content with figuring things out as they happen and is more apathetic about the future.

7mojvz,6,2017-12-28,Transportation to internship on East Side,elephant86,madisonwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/7mojvz/transportation_to_internship_on_east_side/,"Hey folks! I'm a student who was lucky enough to land an internship at a certain insurance company whose office is located just north of the I-90/Hwy 151 interchange on the east side.  I will be living near Camp Randall this summer and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to get to and from work this summer.  I currently don't have a car.  So far my options are:

1. Take the bus. It's about an hour bus ride each way, but there's really only one bus that runs between my house and the office, so I would need to leave at 7am every morning.  Not the end of the world, but I would prefer to sleep in and have a little more flexibility.

2. Takeover a car lease.  I was able to find a nice Buick SUV on a lease takeover website. It would cost about $3000 and I'd have the car from January until September.  I only need the car from the end of May until the end of August, but that was the shortest lease I could find.

3. Buy a beat-up car for $2-3000 and hope it lasts the summer without any major mechanical issues popping up.

4. Uber every day?  I did the math and if I work about 65 days this summer, Ubering each way would end up costing about $3000 - same as the car lease but I wouldn't need to worry about parking, gas, or driving.

Does anyone else have any other suggestions or options that I might be forgetting about?"
7moutq,1291,2017-12-28,This great patient I had,deepbreathnow,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7moutq/this_great_patient_i_had/,"Jim and I met a few years ago, when he was transferred to our hospital in the middle of the night for no acute reason whatsoever. It was the third week of my PGY2 year, so the term ""neurologist"" applied to me only loosely at best. So I barely knew what to do when I got the call that this gentleman and his wife had shown up on our floor, at 3am, with ""like 5 lbs of documentation (1).""

This is known to happen at this particular hospital from time to time. We're a tertiary referral facility, and there's often a backlog of weird cases awaiting transport once some logistical issues or other gets ironed out. I only learned this later, though; when I asked him what had changed or compelled the transfer, he just shrugged and said ""Nothing. Nothing's changed. That's the problem, man."" 

Fair enough.

Between what he and his wife told me, and also the forest-killing amount of paperwork he'd arrived with, I gathered that Jim had been having an increasingly rough time for the last 2 years. He showed me pictures of himself on his phone: he'd been tall, with close cropped, grey hair and softail Harley. His first symptom had been a bit of foot weakness, which he'd happily ignored until he wasn't able to upshift anymore. His last ride had been a puzzled, pissed off, 50 yard idle. His wife hadn't minded much, as she'd been a lukewarm fan of the bike at best, even before they got married. But his problems progressed, and since then, he'd been sliding slowly downhill despite regular IVIG infusions for his ""refractory CIDP.""

You know where this is going: when I met him, he was a flaccid mess of mixed reflexes and twitches you could spot from the doorway. His voice was only a little slurred and he wasn't having too much trouble with chewing or swallowing. Limb-onset ALS is like that. Luckily, his left arm was still working fairly well at the time, and so he used it to put on a pair of sunglasses at the end of the exam.

""Is it, um, too bright in here?"" I asked. 

""Yeah."" So I flicked off the lights for him. When I turned around, though, he was still wearing them. 

""Is it *still* too bright?"" I asked. It was the wee hours of the am, and his blinds were shut to boot.


After a long beat, he replied, ""Nah, man. I just like to look cool."" He was grinning his ass off. 

Maybe he caught me by surprise, or it was his delivery, or it was just the 4 am giggles, but I laughed long and hard. I couldn't help it, I liked him - which clinched the diagnosis, of course. I'd learned early in my intern year that niceness is something of a risk factor. In fact, I was reasonably sure that it was ALS at the end of our first encounter, but I didn't say anything. I was just starting my training, after all, and barely knew what the hell I was talking about half the time (2). It didn't seem appropriate to give him a diagnosis like that, on my own, in the middle of the night. There were lots of good reasons not to say anything right then. But if I'm being honest now, part of my hesitation also stemmed just a bit from fear of telling *that* on my own - which is understandable, but it's not something I'm especially proud of. 

We told him the next morning, my attending and I. Or, rather, my attending did an excellent job of laying everything out, while I stood behind and slightly to the right, still floating in that peculiar, nigh-hungover, post-call limbo that all younger residents live in for a little while before they get the hang of things. Towards the end of the conversation, Jim asked me directly, ""Is that what you think, too? ALS?""

""That's what I think,"" I told him, which just made him sigh heavily. 

Out of all the ways he could have handled the news - screaming, wailing, a stoic ""I see,"" - his response was to look at his wife, and to tell her that he loved her. I still remember it. I'd find out later that they'd been married for 18 years at the time of his diagnosis. We did the only useful thing you can do at a time like that, and quietly stepped out.

****

He wasn't a patient that I followed regularly. He wasn't in my clinic or anything, and so it was a little surprising how often we ran into one another. I caught up with him perhaps half a year later, while doing a neuromuscular clinic rotation. Right off the bat, he asked me how I was doing and whether I'd cried after diagnosing him. He had his son with him that time, and they had a good laugh about it/me.

""He looked like a girl after watching one of that guy's movies. You know, that guy?"" he asked.

""Nick Sparks,"" his son said, a little too quickly.

""Yeah, like a Nick Sparks movie!""

I tried to interject here, but nobody wanted to hear that I hadn't cried. He did, however, want me to help him appeal to insurance to cover a hand-controlled, electric shifter so that he could ride again. Which I couldn't, of course. Shifter or not, he wouldn't have been able to balance to save his life, and he only had one working arm. 

After hearing me out, he gave me that same, heavy sigh.""All right then, Nick. What else you got for me?"" 

Obviously, I didn't have much. With a diagnosis like ALS, nobody does. And I can tell you, going from handicapped motorcycle aids to talking about advanced directives is.... not the easiest transition. But he was very reasonable, and answered all my questions. He let my medical students examine him, to see what relatively advanced ALS looked like.

But he very gleefully called me Nick the whole time. Which isn't my name, as it turns out. It doesn't even share any of the same letters. So as you can imagine, he kept it up for the next few years, and it never failed to confuse the hell out of any students or attendings I happened to be with.

****

It carried on like that: random, unscheduled encounters as his symptoms slowly progressed. 

I'd see him again in our multidisciplinary ALS clinic from time to time. I saw him once in the hospital, when he came in for a wound on his leg that had become infected; his primary team consulted us and we didn't have much to offer. 

Towards the beginning of my PGY4 year, I actually ran into him and his wife in our hospital's cafeteria. His voice was much more slurred by that point. He had a PEG in place, and he was reclining in a powerchair. His wife and I split a turkey burger while he slowly worked on a massive milkshake ""with a doubleshot of Boost."" At one point, I stole his sunglasses out of his shirt pocket, which left him mildly outraged.

Putting them on, I asked him ""Who's cool now, Jim? *I'm* cool. I'm David Bowie. I'm Freddie Mercury when he had a mustache (3).""

He laughed. He told me they looked terrible, and that I deserved to get run over by his wheelchair. He asked me when I - Nick Sparks, mind you - was going to produce my next chick flick. But I didn't take them off until I had to, when my pager sounded a stroke alert, and I had to leave in a rush.

****

That's the last time I saw Jim, but it wasn't the last time we were in touch. The front desk at our clinic got in touch with me a little while ago, and told me that I had a package. In my fellowship, I float between a few different sites. I don't have a dedicated clinic of my own, so there's no single place to keep things addressed to me. Unfortunately, in this case, it meant that my package had floated around for a few weeks, until a) somebody remembered/rediscovered it and b) I was back on service.

The note, which he'd dictated, read:

*Dear Nick,*

*I hope you're doing well. I heard you had a little girl, which is great news! This is for her. If you don't have a name yet, name her Jim. Not James, that's too formal.*

*I'm off to hospice like we talked about. I think it's time. It's going to be ok so don't worry about me. Thanks for everything!*

*Best of luck,*

*Jim*

Included was a small bear, with a pink ribbon around it's neck and a paisely pattern on all four paws. My daughter hadn't even been born the last time I'd seen him. I think he knew my wife was pregnant, but that was about it. He must have asked around about me.

Maybe this time I *did* cry, though I really tried not to. I found a quiet corner, and I probably looked very ugly, which I think Jim would have liked (4). 

****

I called his wife a few days ago, who's doing well enough, and who I think was happy to hear from me. He hadn't lasted very long after going to hospice. I guess he knew. I gave the bear to my daughter, and it's just another one of her stuffed animals now. She's 19 months, after all. 

I know patients die, but this one's different. This wasn't a medical mystery, or a cautionary tale. I didn't lose him. And it's not neccessarily tragic - it's just the story of this funny, great guy who managed to stay funny and stay great, even after he was handed a death sentence. He loved his wife and he missed the road. From the beginning of my PGY2 year, he saw me grow up, in a way. He became part of my personal history and we shared some laughs.

He was the patient that did at least as much for me as I did for him. Sometimes, people are amazing.




(1) As it turned out, everything had been printed out in triplicate. Obviously, someone had gotten impatient, hit 'print' repeatedly, and then left.

(2) This has not changed appreciably, but I know more vocabulary now.

(3) While there's no point at which Freddie Mercury *wasn't* cool, scientists generally agree that his early, mustachioed years were the apex.

7mp41n,11,2017-12-28,F4M My son wont stop fucking me!,DazedConfusedAroused,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7mp41n/f4m_my_son_wont_stop_fucking_me/,"We always looked like a perfect family. 


My husband is old money--we're practically the Kennedys of this town, and everyone knows it. We're always perfectly put together, right down to the last hair. My husband, Anthony, is the named partner at his law firm that was founded by his grandfather, and he's running for a senate seat this fall. I know he has affairs, it hurts me, but he always have, and I've learned to accept it. Our daughter, Allison, is fifteen years old and the perfect blonde beauty queen that I always hoped she would be. She's on the cheerleading team, she takes ballet, and she's an excellent student. I'm the perfect wife--I never have a hair out of place, I'm always running charities, hosting galas, attending fundraising events on my husband's arm. I'm the woman everyone looks to and wonders how I *do* it. 


But I'm more proud of you than I am of anything else. You've always been my perfect, sweet boy. You're seventeen years old, the top of your class, and student body president. You're already so tall, I can't believe it! All of the girls adore you, all of the boys want to *be* you. You're the captain of your football team, you're dating the cheerleading squad captain, and you've been applying to ivy league colleges for next year. You have my dark hair and your father's blue eyes--and you look so much like him when he was your age. I couldn't adore you more! 

Which is why all of this came as such a shock for me. 


You had been moody lately, I knew that--your father was having another affair, but this time with an intern from his campaign, one only a year older than you were. I was so apologetic when you found out, but you were *so* angry, I thought it was best to let you work it out on your own. 


Now I realize that was a mistake. A few weeks later, when my husband was out of town for a fundraising event, I woke up to the strangest feeling of someone pulling my panties down. Anthony must have been home early! I was so relieved that he had come home to *me* instead of his mistress that I didn't even complain as he pulled me up by the waist. I thought it was *weird* when he started licking my pussy, since he'd never liked going down on me before, but I was too busy groaning and squirming with pleasure to care.

And when he started *fucking* me, oh my god, it was so amazing! For some reason his cock felt so much BIGGER than usual, and--well, my husband had never been very good in bed before, but now I was whimpering and moaning with pleasure as he pounded my pussy into the mattress. 

It wasn't until I came around your cock screaming for more that I realized that it was *you*, my *son*, how had just spurted his load into my pussy. I was humiliated and horrified--I couldn't understand why you would want to *do* this to our family, what what happen if anyone ever found out? 


But now you won't stop. You think I deserve better than your father--you think I deserve you. 

-----

SO I want someone to play my son who starts an affair with me! The fun part is that we're so big in the community, and everyone looks up to us, they have no idea how corrupt we are on the inside. 


I want you to be in love with me, but I also want you to be a rough dom. I love the idea of you eventually getting me pregnant, too! "
7mpcuq,2,2017-12-28,My (22F) Girlfriend Wants To Break Up With Me (22M) Because She Has Anxiety About Our Relationship. I need some help.,B3llooonmann,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7mpcuq/my_22f_girlfriend_wants_to_break_up_with_me_22m/,"So first I'll give some backstory to our relationship. Me and my girlfriend have been happily dating for 3 and a half years, with no really big problems. We met at the beginning of our college lives and we are both our first loves. We also are studying the same thing. The biggest issue prior to what happens that she has with me is that I don't get a long with all her friends too well and not all of her family. I'm a rather quiet individual and it takes time for me to grow close to people. She feels like some times I'm not trying and that she feels caught between her friends asking ""why does he not talk to me?"" and my personality. Things were looking great going into 2017 until she went for her internship during the summer.

For the most part the summer was not that different from previous, we enjoyed ourselves and hungout quite a bit. Then when mid August rolled around, she was acting a little different and I could sense it. I would ask her if she was okay and she would say that she was fine despite seeming quieter than usual. She just seemed off. Then one day she came over and told me she really wanted to go for a walk with me. On that walk she admitted to me that she felt she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to move on. This was a complete shock to me because we were so happy prior. I think her main reason for breaking up was that she wanted to try and date other people. We talked for a while, but after seeing how I reacted to it she wanted to take it back immediately. We talked about it for a while and I gave her a few days to collect herself. She said she didn't mean it and wanted to take everything back. She told me that she shouldn't be so heartbroken over breaking up with me if it was the right thing to do. So she took it back. We went back to normal for around 2 months. For those 2 months I could really sense that she conquered her anxiety and was letting herself love me again.

I thought it was all in the past, but then it started again late november. To give more insight into other things happening in our lives; she is in her final year of college, she had a trip planned for her christmas vacation, and our college went on strike for 5 weeks and screwed our semester up. We seemed fine going into the strike, but then I felt like she was getting more distant from me again. My assumptions were correct and she admitted to me that she was feeling anxious again about our relationship. She told me that she was feeling this way on and off during the strike. She admitted all of this 3 days before our big 4 year anniversary. After talking for a while I made her feel comfortable again and she yet again took what she said back. This time she came at me with a few things she wanted me to change. She wanted me to be more independent and make more of an effort with her friends/family. She said she was finding it harder to picture herself with me in the future, marrying me, moving in with me, etc. I calmed her down again and reassured her that I was in fact trying to improve in all of these areas. She started acting like normal again, we went for our anniversary and had a good time with each other. We couldn't make the most of it because she has to do all this homework so she can go on her trip. 

Unfortunately her anxiety came back early december and one day after hanging out she told me she was feeling anxious again. Just the previous day she felt normal and were having fun. I could sense that something was up just by how she acted. She wouldn't have told me had I not broke down in the car just before she dropped me off. She didn't know how to respond but she tried to make me feel better. I went in and 10mins later without me knowing she followed. We sat down and talked for a bit. She said that she was finding it harder to see herself with me again and that she wouldn't miss me if we didn't get married. Like every other time I calmed her down and comforted her about everything. This was 5 days before her trip that she would be on for 3 weeks. Again we were back to normal for the days leading up to the trip, I even helped her pack and said goodbye. 

Now we are more up to date with what's happening. I feel myself now developing my own anxieties about her and whether she's okay and if anything she says is true. I keep wanting her to be open with me no matter how hard it is for her to say what she's feeling. We have been chatting over her whole trip and it was pretty normal talk but as more days went past she started seeming different again. One day I asked how she was feeling and she admitted to me that she was feeling anxious again about our relationship and wanted to break it off, she felt she couldn't wait until she returned. She said she wanted to be open with me. She told me it was getting harder and harder for her to bring herself to message me, say I love you, say I miss you. Every time she tries to break up with me she says it's not you, it's me. She tells me that I'm the greatest boyfriend she could have ever asked for and that she doesn't deserve me. She says she can't get over this feeling of wanting to date other people. She says she has fantasies about a perfect boyfriend that could be out there for her that will drive her around, bring her parents gifts, connect with her family and friends. The thing is I have a good relationship with her family and some of her friends, so it doesn't make too much sense. I've also been making an effort with driving but I'm moving pretty slow. After calming her down and making her feel unsure about her decision again she gave it a day to think more about it. She said that she will think about it over her remaining days there and on her way home. She did admit to me what caused all of this anxiety about our relationship, it was because she met someone when she was on her internship. She thought that he had some qualities that she was looking for and it would be nice to date him. She said that he asked her out and that she declined because of her commitment to me. 

That's what brings us to now. She feels like this will just continue being a endless cycle if we don't break up. I keep telling her that we need better communication when it comes to these anxities she's feeling but she keeps it bottled up too much of the time. She says the main feeling she feels now when she thinks of our relationship is guilt. She feels guilty that she can't say she loves me, that we might break up and leave me alone, guilty that she doesn't miss me as much as she should. I told her that I think it would be a good idea for her to go see a therapist about this anxiety she's feeling. Is going to a therapist worth it? Is this a lost cause? What would you guys do? What do you think I could do to help the situation?

Sorry for how complex this seems."
7mqjc4,1,2017-12-28,36M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7mqjc4/36m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - /r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Visitor to the porn set - Your friend is a well known porn star, and she travels the world for shoots to all sorts of glamorous places. She has taken you to a few shoots so you fully understand how in control of things she is. She surprises you with a trip to a luxurious mansion on an island where she is shooting, you have most of the time to relax but she has to work for a couple of days. On the set, one of the male performers starts chatting to you and you are finding it hard to resist.

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
7mqy9z,1,2017-12-28,"Me [29F] with my friend [30M] of ~2 years, am I reading too much into this, or should I go for it?",JinQuiGon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mqy9z/me_29f_with_my_friend_30m_of_2_years_am_i_reading/,"(Some details changed for anonymity) 


I met this guy (we'll call him JB) at a martial arts club I go to a little over two years ago. He was a higher-ranked belt then I was, and so our paths in the dojo during class didn't cross too much, but after I started going more frequently we started to spend time talking about the martial art and laughing over stupid jokes here and there before/after class.  I didn't think it was anything more then him being friendly, nothing that I wouldn't do with any of the other guys at the dojo. Yes, I did sneak glances at him when he was lifting before/after class, but you know, a girl can look... In addition, we both were dating other people (or at least, I was- he never talked about a girlfriend as far as I can remember).  


About 7 months ago my Ex and I broke up (rather painfully), and I started training more frequently at the gym and subsequently hanging out with JB more frequently, and we became closer friends. Somewhere along the way he broke up with his girlfriend too (not quite sure of the time, but it was for reasons unrelated to me). Our gym traveled to a big competition in another state, and we hung out pretty much 24/7 (with the group, anyway). He even helped me ringside at the match and gave me a nickname that the rest of the crew picked up and started calling me by. It was nice to have a safe guy friend who was smart, who I admired, and who shared my sense of humor... And who I had solidly put in the friendzone. Even though I knew he was single, I just assumed that he saw me as a teammate first, not as a datable-woman-person. 


When we came back from the event I decided to give dating another shot, downloaded a few dating apps, and through sheer coincidence got matched up with JB's brother. I told my friend, TA (who trains at the same dojo and knows both myself and JB) about it, and she told me to go for it, as it would finally send a message to JB that I'm available. I was completely shocked that she would think that he had a crush on me, and she was shocked that I didn't see the (to her) obvious signs. After thinking about it a bit, I could see where she got the idea, and I realized I had been crushing on him even while dating my Ex. (Remember the glances while he was lifting/working out? Yeah, that was happening a lot.)


And then JB promptly got accepted to a grad school in another state. (Cause fuck me, right?) We hung out a few times before he left, some initiated by me (to ask for school/travel advice... yeah, I know, flimsy excuse but it worked) and some by him/with the crew from the dojo. I kept in touch with him while he was at school, and since the summer we have met up for drinks twice. Once with people from the dojo (He asked to hang out alone together before meeting up with everyone else) and once just the two of us. This last time, with just the both of us, he kept on bringing up the subject of people that were dating at the dojo, or dating in general, and I never took the bait. (Okay, didn't see the bait until after I got home and promptly commenced kicking myself for not taking the bait). He even drove me home after we'd been at the bar for almost 2 hours, and high-fived me good night. (kill me). 


Since we started hanging out outside of the dojo, I started noticing that  when we are in class together he keeps on shooting glances at me, moving that we're close to each other in warmups, and sparring with me even though I'm a lower rank (not altogether uncommon, but still). It's driving me nuts, cause I'm definitely into him but he's not initiating much of anything outside of the dojo, and I don't want to make a fool out of myself or make it awkward at the dojo. 


SO- my question to you, good people of Reddit- am I reading too much into this, or do you, as impartial observers, think that my friend TA is right and I just have to be more obvious about asking him out? He leaves for school again in less than a week, though has an internship that will bring him to town more frequently this semester, so if I was going to go for it... this might be a good time.

She received a full ride scholarship which was a great opportunity for us since my income covers our living expenses. We took out loans to cover the additional $8000 a year in child care expenses, and another $8000 to cover school expenses we weren't able to pay from my income. It was a bit of a sacrifice, but our plan was to complete her grad degree for about $32,000.   

The twist came a few weeks ago when her loan statements came through. My heart sunk when I discovered she had taken out two additional loans bringing the total to just over $65,000. Then I found out she maxed out two credit cards for another $10,000. She also earned $12,000 or so in summer internships that was supposed to go towards school expenses. Overall we are looking at about $75k-$85k+ of which as much as $50k is unaccounted for.   

We haven't talked about it in depth yet, and honestly I need a sanity check. I feel like I cannot trust her as a financial partner. Is it out of line to ask for her bank statements to see where the $40,000+ went? I feel like complete transparency about our mutual finances is an acceptable request if we are going to be financially successful. Or am I being a controlling ass who needs to chill out? Where do we even begin to address this?

7mrm3g,1,2017-12-28,"my girlfriend wants to break up because of her relationship anxiety, which is now giving me anxiety.",B3llooonmann,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7mrm3g/my_girlfriend_wants_to_break_up_because_of_her/,"So first I'll give some backstory to our relationship. Me and my girlfriend have been happily dating for 3 and a half years, with no really big problems. We met at the beginning of our college lives and we are both our first loves. We also are studying the same thing. The biggest issue prior to what happens that she has with me is that I don't get a long with all her friends too well and not all of her family. I'm a rather quiet individual and it takes time for me to grow close to people. She feels like some times I'm not trying and that she feels caught between her friends asking ""why does he not talk to me?"" and my personality. Things were looking great going into 2017 until she went for her internship during the summer. For the most part the summer was not that different from previous, we enjoyed ourselves and hungout quite a bit. Then when mid August rolled around, she was acting a little different and I could sense it. I would ask her if she was okay and she would say that she was fine despite seeming quieter than usual. She just seemed off. Then one day she came over and told me she really wanted to go for a walk with me. On that walk she admitted to me that she felt she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to move on. This was a complete shock to me because we were so happy prior. I think her main reason for breaking up was that she wanted to try and date other people. We talked for a while, but after seeing how I reacted to it she wanted to take it back immediately. We talked about it for a while and I gave her a few days to collect herself. She said she didn't mean it and wanted to take everything back. She told me that she shouldn't be so heartbroken over breaking up with me if it was the right thing to do. So she took it back. We went back to normal for around 2 months. For those 2 months I could really sense that she concurred her anxiety and was letting herself love me again.

I thought it was all in the past, but then it started again late november. To give more insight into other things happening in our lives; she is in her final year of college, she had a trip planned for her christmas vacation, and our college went on strike for 5 weeks and screwed our semester up. We seemed fine going into the strike, but then I felt like she was getting more distant from me again. My assumptions were correct and she admitted to me that she was feeling anxious again about our relationship. She told me that she was feeling this way on and off during the strike. She admitted all of this 3 days before our big 4 year anniversary. After talking for a while I made her feel comfortable again and she yet again took what she said back. This time she came at me with a few things she wanted me to change. She wanted me to be more independent and make more of an effort with her friends/family. She said she was finding it harder to picture herself with me in the future, marrying me, moving in with me, etc. I calmed her down again and reassured her that I was in fact trying to improve in all of these areas. She started acting like normal again, we went for our anniversary and had a good time with each other. We couldn't make the most of it because she has to do all this homework so she can go on her trip. 

Unfortunately her anxiety came back early december and one day after hanging out she told me she was feeling anxious again. Just the previous day she felt normal and were having fun. I could sense that something was up just by how she acted. She wouldn't have told me had I not broke down in the car just before she dropped me off. She didn't know how to respond but she tried to make me feel better. I went in and 10mins later without me knowing she followed. We sat down and talked for a bit. She said that she was finding it harder to see herself with me again and that she wouldn't miss me if we didn't get married. Like every other time I calmed her down and comforted her about everything. This was 5 days before her trip that she would be on for 3 weeks. Again we were back to normal for the days leading up to the trip, I even helped her pack and said goodbye. 

Now we are more up to date with what's happening. I feel myself now developing my own anxieties about her and whether she's okay and if anything she says is true. I keep wanting her to be open with me no matter how hard it is for her to say what she's feeling. We have been chatting over her whole trip and it was pretty normal talk but as more days went past she started seeming different again. One day I asked how she was feeling and she admitted to me that she was feeling anxious again about our relationship and wanted to break it off, she felt she couldn't wait until she returned. She said she wanted to be open with me. She told me it was getting harder and harder for her to bring herself to message me, say I love you, say I miss you. Every time she tries to break up with me she says it's not you, it's me. She tells me that I'm the greatest boyfriend she could have ever asked for and that she doesn't deserve me. She says she can't get over this feeling of wanting to date other people. She says she has fantasies about a perfect boyfriend that could be out there for her that will drive her around, bring her parents gifts, connect with her family and friends. The thing is I have a good relationship with her family and some of her friends, so it doesn't make too much sense. I've also been making an effort with driving but I'm moving pretty slow. After calming her down and making her feel unsure about her decision again she gave it a day to think more about it. She said that she will think about it over her remaining days there and on her way home. She did admit to me what caused all of this anxiety about our relationship, it was because she met someone when she was on her internship. She thought that he had some qualities that she was looking for and it would be nice to date him. She said that he asked her out and that she declined because of her commitment to me. 

That's what brings us to now. She feels like this will just continue being a endless cycle if we don't break up. I keep telling her that we need better communication when it comes to these anxities she's feeling but she keeps it bottled up too much of the time. I told her that I think it would be a good idea for her to go see a therapist about this anxiety she's feeling. Is going to a therapist worth it? Is this a lost cause? What would you guys do? What do you think I could do to help the situation?

I'm a CS major approaching my last summer in college and have applied to a number of internships, some related to security and some not. Assuming I'm not accepted into a security-related internship, would it be a better career move to pursue a more general internship (eg software development, database engineer) or work in IT support services at my university? 

I feel like the IT position *might* provide me with a more valuable experience, but I'm unsure of what employers will prefer to see on a resume. Any insight is greatly appreciated! "
7mslpl,140,2017-12-29,Net Present Value Ranking of the T20 Law Schools,jyoung35789,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/7mslpl/net_present_value_ranking_of_the_t20_law_schools/,"Now that some of us are starting to think seriously about where to attend, I decided to create a tool to help inform that decision based on a few quantitative characteristics. I posted a comment here a while back using some very basic Net Present Value analysis to compare the monetary value of attending two different law schools, and some people seemed interested in the idea, so I decided to take that a little further and create a spreadsheet to rank all the T20 schools based on the Net Present Value model and using some simple assumptions about salary and cost of attendance information. 

The main benefit of the spreadsheet is that it will allow you to input your own scholarship offers to compare, for example, how you should weigh a full-tuition offer from a low T20 against paying sticker at a T14, or a partial scholarship at CCN against paying sticker at HYS by boiling it down to a single number. **This spreadsheet is specifically tailored to individuals who, like me, are attempting to get a job in BigLaw after graduation.**

**Here are the instructions:**

First, [click this link to access the spreadsheet on Google Sheets.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N1emhswNtiEUAgxB2RTZvcg3rEA3uwIyB3SsElmL7So/edit?usp=sharing)

Click File &gt; Download As &gt; Microsoft Excel

When you open the file, you will see the NPV rankings without any scholarship offers

Enable editing, then click on the 'NPV Calculation' tab.

You will see the list of schools in order of the current USNWR rankings. Enter your scholarship offers in the highlighted cells, and then indicate whether or not you will be using loans to pay for the cost of living (leave it as 'Yes' if you will, change to no if not).

If you feel you need to make any changes to the assumptions of the model, do so according to your own preferences (see the end of this post for more information).

Once you are finished, return to the 'NPV Ranking' tab and highlight both columns in the list.

In the toolbar, select 'Sort and Filter' and then 'Custom Sort.'

From left to right, select ""Sort by: Column B, Sort on: Values, Order: Largest to Smallest.""

Select OK, and you will now be viewing a ranking of the T20 schools according to your own personal Net Present Value of attendance.

**More Information About the Model**

What is Net Present Value?

First, present value is the current worth of an amount of money-reflecting the idea that money has time value, or in other words, that individuals would prefer consumption now to consumption later (other things being equal). Money is therefore discounted at some interest rate reflecting the opportunity cost of your capital. For this model, I use an interest rate of 2.5% for all discounting. Net Present Value is simply the difference between the present value of cash inflows minus the present value of cash outflows. If the problem is set up properly, you can interpret the Net Present Value of a decision as the amount that making that decision will add to your wealth.

How is Net Present Value Calculated?

For this model, several key assumptions are required. The most important involves the concept of Expected Value. Expected Value is the anticipated value of an investment or decision. It is calculated as the probability of an event occurring multiplied by the value to the individual if it does occur. In this case, we are interested in the expected value of attending a particular law school as it relates to getting a job at a BigLaw firm. 

There is no way of knowing your personal odds of obtaining one of these jobs at any school. I used the proportion of graduates who obtained a BigLaw job + those who obtained a Federal Clerkship as a proxy for your likelihood of getting hired at one of these firms. However, these numbers probably don't accurately reflect the odds at HYS, since many students are not BigLaw focused there and intend to do academia, PI, or something other than corporate, private sector work. I have read before that graduates of these schools can pretty much walk into BigLaw if that's what they want to do, so I decided to just use 100% as the probability for these schools. Feel free to change this to whatever you think is most accurate.

The model assumes that you will work five years in BigLaw and then transition to something with a better lifestyle, like in-house work, that pays a lower salary. I used the Cravath pay scale to input salary information for the first five years, and also assumed a paid internship at roughly the first-year associate rate between the 2L and 3L year. After that, pay information is totally impossible to determine, so I just decided on a salary of $100,000 and treated that as a perpetuity, or a cash flow that occurs indefinitely. I found the terminal value of this cash flow using the formula for the present value of a perpetuity (PMT/Interest Rate). Expected Value is then the probability figure above multiplied by this salary figure for each year.

I also included the opportunity cost of working right out of college (since I am coming straight from my undergrad), which means that my forgone salary is treated as a cash outflow. I assumed that a starting salary of $50,000/yr and a yearly increase of 2.5% was reasonable for myself, but you should input numbers that make sense for your degree and region of the country. If you are currently working, input your current salary. This way, the model will not only compare schools, but give you an idea of how much the decision to attend law school at all is worth to you. 

As far as the cost of attendance goes, I used data from LST Reports for tuition, COL, and average growth rate of tuition and fees. I assumed a 2% rate of inflation on cost of living for all areas, which is probably unrealistic. Feel free to change this if you have a better sense of what to expect. I also included the option to finance your living expenses or pay them out of pocket. For example, if you are married and your spouse will work to pay the bills while you are in law school, you may not need to take out loans to pay for rent, food, etc. Change the 'Financing COL?' option to 'No' and the cash outflows and student loan balances and payments will automatically reflect this.

For the student loans, I calculated balances and payments based on a 7% interest rate and a 10 year repayment plan. 

Finally, I calculated the net cash flow from 1L year to the terminal values discussed above. The NPV of these series of cash flows is the final figure that represents the worth of a law degree from each of these schools.

I hope this model is useful or at least interesting to some of you. Keep in mind that it has limitations and is only as good as the assumptions upon which it is built, but I think it can be a helpful tool to weigh different options as you receive scholarship offers or a lack thereof.

7mswl4,0,2017-12-29,I need help getting published (HEEEEAAAAALLLLP),GhondorIRL,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/7mswl4/i_need_help_getting_published_heeeeaaaaallllp/,"Okay so basically, here's my story. 

A couple of years ago I wrote a complete manuscript after writing several short stories of increasing length. I finish it and write out a crappy first draft of a query letter. I start submitting it to every agent I can find while monotonously editing the manuscript (it's in a pretty good state, no major editing really needs to be done, just fixing typos, editing grammar, slight tweaks in the writing).

A couple of problems, though. Before any of the official issues, I want to mention that I basically put the book on the backburner and haven't really tinkered with it in the last year and a half or so. I ended up moving across the country last November, and the book hasn't really been in my head much since then. It's just been sitting around, completed and in a semi-complete state. But anyways;

1.) I wrote this book as a Young Adult novel, but it stars two adult (20+ old) men. The tone of the entire novel is something more akin to Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl or whatever. I've been told by no less than three different agents that my book was good (one even responded telling me I was an amazing writer) but, unfortunately, because my book doesn't star kids/teenagers, it's ""not young adult"". I had no idea while I was writing that the difference between young adult and adult is, apparently, the age of the characters, but here we are. My question is: Is this actually that big of a deal? What can I do to convince agents that this can work as a Young Adult book? Do I just try marketing it as an adult book? Do I delete the entire manuscript off my computer and jump in front of a bus? Help.

2.) I could really use more beta reading feedback, but I can not for the life of me find good feedback. Even if I can find someone to give it a quick attempt at beta reading, they usually just give me some unhelpful feedback like 'I don't think this verb should be used here' or 'Maybe this comma shouldn't be here'. Just kind of tedious things that cut hairs over personal opinions. Do any online communities exist where people more readily beta read things?

3.) As I return back to trying to query agents, exactly how ""edited"" should my work be? Are agents expecting my stuff to be perfect? What are they looking for? As far as I'm concerned, my work isn't 100% perfect but it's in a very good state. Just how good are they expecting a manuscript to be?

And, ultimately, the final question is 4.) If I choose to do so, what is the best way of having my work professionally edited by an editor so I can prepare the manuscript for self-publishment? I've learned the hard reality of getting traditionally published is pretty much one big crap shoot where 'the next Harry Potter' might get passed up because some bored intern passed on it absent mindedly in a slush mountain, or your query letter might get tossed because an agent didn't like an adjective you used.

And generally any other help or tips or advice would be appreciated. I've been sitting on this thing for almost two years now, and I want to try getting it published one way or the other."

7msywa,2,2017-12-29,Drowning in stress,WestieGiraffe,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7msywa/drowning_in_stress/,"My problem might not be as serious as a lot of folks here, but it is still taking a big toll on my mental health.

I am a senior in a pretty good university in California. I am currently working 3 internships at the same time while studying full-time. My income is definitely higher than a lot of my peers, but a good 80% of that goes back to my family.

My family is in a super unstable financial situation. My mom is an immigrant and does not know English. She used to do a lot of different jobs to support us. However, she quit her only job in September because they did not let her take a day off to go out with her friends. Before that, she lost thousands of dollars because a dude scammed her on Facebook. Then, she took care for a seemingly happy old man for some extra money, but that man committed suicide, and my mom was the first one to discover his body. It terrified her.

I know she has been under a lot of stress, and she has been running away from it. She hasn't attempted to find a new job ever since, even when I manage to find her some good leads. She says she wants to stay and watch over my two little sisters, but all she does is staying in her room talking to her friends (who really don't have any intention of helping our family whatsoever, and I totally can't blame them for that).

I have been trying to support her, but it never seems to be enough. Even though I made some good money, I cannot support a 4 people family. I barely have any to fund my own expenses, and have been taking extra loans just to cover my ass. 

I work 50 hours a week, going to school, maintaining my 3.9 GPA in a trending engineering major, and yet I am still on the verge of homelessness. I don't have much budget for meals, and has been snacking on the unhealthy stuffs in my company's pantry to save food expenses. Not enough time to sleep nor nutrition to function properly, I feel absolutely tired and hopeless. It's as if all of my efforts are getting wasted down a drain. 

Sometimes I just want to pack up all of my stuffs and run, but my two sisters will be helpless without me. They both struggle with school on their own, and my mom's constant nagging and complaining about money struck them way harder than me. Both of them confessed their suicidal thoughts to me, saying that since my mom was complaining too much, maybe one of them should just die off. And though I am trying to keep them optimistic, I too have similar suicidal thoughts every single day. 

My mom however does not believe in depression. She openly mocks other depressed people, calling them cowards and that they will go to hell. Thus, we never try to talk about our problems with her.

I have spent a lot of time analyzing my situation. I know it is not a helpless cause. I know all hopes aren't lost. I keep telling myself that all of my problems will disappear once I graduate and find a stable job, but it is getting harder and harder every waking moment. I have a good thinking capacity, but it is so negative, I just can't find any way out. My brain can be too cold and logical, I don't believe in hope or miracles at all. All I can see are dead-ends.

The worse thing is, if I do commit suicide, I am afraid my sisters will soon follow me. Plus, from a logical point of view, my committing suicide does not make any financial sense. I don't even have enough savings to fund my own funeral.

I attempted suicide once when I was in 12th grade. About a month ago, I tried buying an exit bag, but changed my mind (and the dude selling me the bag happily cancelled my order).

Sorry for a long post. I just need to write down to relieve my mind off a bit. Thank you for reading this. I don't have intention to kill myself any time soon (not until I can save for my funeral), but the thought has been getting stronger than ever, occupying all of my alone moment. I am just afraid one day I will actually do it."

I am also happy to provide additional information or posters to anyone willing to help with my search and get the information spread. I am desperate to find him. He is honestly my best friend and any help is so appreciated.

Last Seen: December 16, 2017. I was in a serious car accident on 75 South at Exit 153, Sardis Church Drive Exit, after which Oliver became frightened and ran away. He ran across 75 North, the median, the exit, and into the woods beyond the fence to the right of the 75 North 153 Exit not far from Nowell Road from my understanding. I attempted to chase and catch him, however, I was unable to and then had to go to the hospital. Following the accident he was unharmed and scared. We are not from the Georgia area, I had just completed a two month internship at Coliseum Medical Centers and was returning home when the accident occurred.

Description: His name is Oliver. He is a 3 year-old, black male cat with a small tuff of white fur on his chest and stomach, only a few white hairs at either spot. He has a very slight ""kink"" at the end of his tail that can only be felt when running your hands along it. He has round, bright green eyes. Very friendly but very timid. He is neutered and microchipped. When lost he was wearing a black collar with white skulls and crossbones but it may have come off as it is a breakaway collar and he ran into woods and brush.

I'm currently doing internship as a software engineer at a really awesome company. As thanks for all the things I learned I wanted to gift my instructor/colleague with some IT goodies.

First thing that popped in mind is with some Linux goodies because he's a Linux user and a pretty hardcore geek like me.

He already has enough stickers, so that's not an option. I was thinking of maybe a shirt..? I'm unsure, any awesome ideas?"
7mtn1l,1,2017-12-29,A tale of two towns,nolifenightaudit,moving,https://www.reddit.com/r/moving/comments/7mtn1l/a_tale_of_two_towns/,"So this is my first time posting so I apologize if I mess up somehow. The past four years I have been working seasonally and moving about every six months. I am now ready to settle down and am a bit torn on where to go. There are pros and cons to both cities so I was hoping I could get some advice from unbiased parties. 

So the first city is in Michigan near the town where I grew up, I have a large family that lives less than an hour away and two small nephews that I adore that would be less than twenty minutes away, not to mention countless friends that I've kept in touch with over the years of moving. With the addition of my Dad's friends offering me a management position,  I've thought a lot about moving back there over the years.

The second city is in Ohio. While I have family that lives a few hours from there I don't technically know anyone in that state and there's no promise of a good job. The reason I am considering it is because the company that would be my dream job is located there. I am currently in school and while I still have a couple years left the company offers an internship so living there while I finish my degree would give me a possible advantage and if I was able to get my dream job I would need to move there eventually anyway.

So I guess I'm kinda stuck between the past and the future. It's been a long time since I've seen most of my family and despite having raised him for two years my older nephew barely knows me at all anymore. While I'd love to be near them all again I can't forget about my dream job. I've even gone so far as to pick my school based on what would give me an advantage with this company. "
7mtuft,3,2017-12-29,"Just came across this thread today, can someone tell me if my parents are narcissists?",randomquestions234,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7mtuft/just_came_across_this_thread_today_can_someone/,"Hey everyone, I came across the raisedbynarcissists subreddit a few hours ago and could not stop looking at all of the posts because I realized this might be the explanation I've been searching for in my childhood. I've always felt like something was off, as my friends seemed to have completely different types of families and upbringings than I have, and I wanted to know if I truly do have narcissistic parents.

So to understand the household dynamic a little, I can't say that my mom was an EMom because I do feel she might have had some NMom characteristics, but I also feel a lot of her actions had to do with her not really being able to connect with people (Low emotional intelligence maybe? I really don't want to disrespect my parents so I don't know what to call it). I have tried lots of times to have good conversations with her and try to connect with her because she's my mom and I do love her, but it just seems like no matter how hard I try I can't. My dad is the aggressive and intimidating type, and my mom basically does everything he says and agrees with everything he thinks. I also have a way older brother (When I was born he basically finished high school and moved out of the house old).

The Bad:
Growing up, my dad was basically never proud of me for anything. To him, I was either the best at whatever I was doing or I sucked at it. I played a sport in elementary - middle school mostly due to being scared of his reaction to me telling him I didn't want to play it. I don't remember much from this time, just that I finally ended up working up the courage to tell him I couldn't do it anymore. If I didn't play a sport he would complain about it and call me lazy, but whenever I took on a sport he would basically crush my confidence because in his mind the harder he 'pushes' me the harder I would try to do it, when it always did the opposite. No matter how many times I told him that it doesn't and it just makes me not want to do it, nothing changes. I distinctly remember after practicing for a couple of years in a new sport I had fun in, him randomly going off at the dinner table about not seeing the point in it because I'm not going to be a professional athlete in the sport or in the olympics. Also to get a feel for what growing up in the house was like, my parents argued every day. Basically 90% of arguments would be my mom doing something that made my dad mad, and then a huge argument happening and of course a lot of it being taken out on me. If I ever tried to get involved if I'm not on my dad's side it would just build him up and make him more mad (usually with some belittling to me), and if he ever saw he was losing an argument he would always get  mad and reply with ""this argument's over"", sometimes storming up to his room. This daily arguing made me constantly anxious at home because I was always expecting the next argument to erupt. If he was ever in the wrong he would never say sorry or admit that he was wrong, he would just take me to eat my favorite food or buy me something and never talk about it again. If I ever brought it up he would never admit he's wrong or apologize ever, even if some stuff he said really hurt. Also drilling into me that I have to beat everyone else at everything but crushing my confidence at the same time made me disinterested in a lot of things, and I didn't try that much at school. Anytime I would try to pick up a new activity his response would be something similar to ""lets see how long it takes before you quit"". Any experience I got from previous sports he would basically say was nothing, even if he never touched that sport in his life. Once I left high school and went to college, a mix of seeing my older brother doing amazing with his education and career and a girlfriend that really built a lot of confidence in me led me to study insanely hard and achieve an amazing gpa first semester. After that I realized I could do it and did the same thing next semester. During the next semester I remember racking up tolls from driving to college daily (looking back at it now I know the tolls weren't that big of a deal for him, it was more he didn't believe I really went to college to study every day). I don't understand why but during this fight I just broke down because I felt no matter how hard I try nothing was good enough and he never believed in me, and it basically took me having a breakdown for the fight to end and to never talk about it again. The following semester I was off from school and thanks to my ridiculously hard work was able to land an internship at basically the best and most competitive company in my chosen major right off the bat freshman year (not going to discount the fact that luck definitely played a role too). Whenever my dad talks about this first life-changing internship, the explanation is either my grandma in heaven did something and got me it or he doesn't understand what happened because I didn't have anything crazy that I did (he can't just say I worked my ass off and deserved it). Also anytime I was mad about something growing up he never really seemed to care, in fact its pretty obvious he says things to make me mad pretty often. He's admitted that he enjoys pissing people off. No matter how many arguments we get in over it, please and thank you just doesn't seem to be in his vocabulary either, whenever he wants me to do something it feels more like an order. If I don't do it even if he doesn't really need me to do it as he could do it himself I usually get ""You wouldn't do a favor for your dad?"" Followed by ""okay now you're making me mad, do it"" followed by him flipping out and hanging up to never talk about it again and forget it ever happened. Ever since I've been working really hard in college and have luckily gotten some nice internships after that first one, and anytime he tries to say something that makes me feel like he's putting me down I can't explain it but I instantly just snap. The first time he was ever really proud of me was that first internship, and it almost felt like that was what I had to do in order for him to somewhat care. In arguments when he gets mad, he tends to use personal attacks and make me feel like shit thinking that counts as victory or ending it if he sees himself losing. This is just some of the big stuff off the top of my head right now, sorry if it seems spread out. He has also said things like ""you're gonna stay with us for a while"" and ""just live with us when your career begins you won't have to pay rent"" but I will do everything I can not to because I get anxiety in the house. Although he immigrated here with almost nothing, he got to a six figure salary and we're middle class (not poor, not rich). Yet throughout my childhood he would get mad over ridiculous stuff like using one too many paper plates when we had 100+ or using one extra sheet of a paper towel roll at dinner. He would also micro manage everything I did if I ever tried to cook, and would cause arguments over the kitchen utensils we use for certain tasks. It was a he's always right everyone else is always wrong type of thing with him no matter how much you argue. During my most recent internships I found whatever I could to brag to him about because in a weird way I felt like I got addicted to making him proud, although there was always something that he was able to pick out that got to me.


The Good (Why I'm not sure if he is an NDad):
-He cares about my education and is helping me pay for college 
-He brags about my (and my brother's) achievements to his friends and family and when he talks to them he's proud of us
-We really do have a lot of great and fun conversations, but it seems the tempo is always an up and down rollercoaster 
-He hasn't had a problem with me moving out and he was an ""At 18 you either need to join the military or go to college"" kinda guy

Traits I think I've developed because of this (and am trying to work on):
-I compare myself to everyone, and if I see someone better than me at anything that I care about it makes me depressed
-In groups and talking to some people I tend to keep quiet because I'm worried they won't care about what I say (confidence issue maybe)
-I'm a very heavy night person, and I realized this might be because my dad is a very big early bird and I might have developed this as a defense mechanism to spend less time in the day as him? Not sure if that could be a factor
-Looking back at my first real relationship I realized I made a lot of stuff about me and am kind of disgusted with myself with how narcissistic some of the things I did was, and I constantly make things about me but I'm trying to work on that as best as I can because I acknowledge it's a problem

Also I'm leaving my brother out of this obviously but he talks to my parents very limited, like one to two half hour phone calls a month and one visit a year(maybe he realized this too)
Can anyone tell me if I have an NDad/NMom? And if I do and that's where how I act comes from can anyone please give me tips to help fix it? I'm realizing it can be a huge problem and I'm really trying to do as much as I can.

Edit: Also to add, my dad has said things like because of our background (nationality) were naturally better than others etc (I obviously don't buy into that stuff) 

Edit #2: Also another thing that sticks out to me, I have had nasal problems my whole life. After having a ct scan done per request from an ENT, he called me a couple of times over the next couple of months wanting to schedule an appointment to go over it and me not thinking much of it, I just went about my studies until I finally set something up with him a couple of months later. Turns out something in the scan made him worried I might have meningioma (A brain tumor - thank god this turned out to be false I just knocked on wood). Hearing this and what it was, I was understandably stressed out the entire day. That night I walked into my dad's room to try to get some comfort, and that resulted in him flipping out on me saying it's my fault I didn't get back to the doctor in time and everything until I just left the room because it was making me feel 10x worse. The next day it was obvious how upset I was and that he crossed the line, and he actually apologized (which rarely rarely rarely happens) but the damage was still done. Not sure if this helps anything"

:-:|
It wasn't pretty, but at the end of the day a win is a win and the Eagles were able to pull one out against the Oakland Raiders in week 16 to secure home field advantage throughout the playoffs to ensure the road to the Super Bowl comes through the City of Brotherly Love. The Eagles will look to stay undefeated at home and against the NFCE in a meaningless game against the division rival Dallas Cowboys as the roles are reversed from last season. On the the flip side the Cowboys will be playing for pride and possibly Jason Garrett's job as in the season finale. The Cowboys were eliminated from playoff contention last week with a loss to the Seahawks as frustration boiled over between second year QB and veteran WR Dez Bryant after Dak's second INT of the game. Prescott has struggled recently throwing 4 INTs and zero TDs in his last two starts. The Eagles are expected to rest many starters on Sunday, but QB Nick Foles is expected to see the field in hopes of getting himself right after his extremely poor outing last week against Oakland. The team hopes to end the season on a strong note in the meaningless game as they will have a bye to start the first week of the playoffs and await their opponent.|

Recap from Last Week’s Games.|
:-
**Eagles** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000898686/Raiders-vs-Eagles-highlights-Week-16) – It was like a great Christmas present that was terribly wrapped. Nick Foles looked dreadful and the Eagles defense made some key mistakes in the first half, however they came up huge in the second half causing 5 turnovers including a key one late that led to a Jake Elliott 48-yard field goal with 22 seconds left to give the Eagles a 3 point lead. The Eagles defense added another late TD as Derek Barnett scooped up a fumble on a late ditch lateral and the Philadelphia Eagles clinched the No. 1 seed for the NFC playoffs with a sloppy 19-10 victory over the Oakland Raiders on Monday night.|
**Cowboys** - [Video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000898182/Seahawks-vs-Cowboys-highlights-Week-16) – Dak Prescott's struggles finally caught up with him as the Cowboys as their 3 game winning streak and playoff hopes ended in a loss to Seattle Sunday. Dak Prescott threw two interceptions and the Dallas offense didn't score a touchdown despite the reunion with his backfield mate. Coleman gave Seattle a 14-9 lead in the third quarter when he reached down to catch Prescott's badly overthrown pass to Elliott and ran untouched 30 yards for a touchdown. The TD put Seattle in front for good and the Seahawks won a playoff elimination game against Dallas, beating the Cowboys 21-12 on Sunday in Ezekiel Elliott's return from a six-game suspension.|

**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Nick Foles vs. Competency**|
Just as we all expected the defense carried Nick Foles in a great defensive show down with the Raiders. Last weeks performance was largely the opposite of Week 15 leaving fans of the other NFC playoff teams salivating at the chance to play Nick Foles. If there is one word used to describe Foles in his career it would be inconsistent. The Giants and Raiders games are the two games you could point to when you want to describe what Nick Foles is capable of since there is usually no in between. The starters will play in this meaningless game against the Sean Lee led Dallas Sean Lee's and this is a good thing - at least for the offense. Foles needs all of the live reps he can get to be ready for the postseason. No one expects him to go out on the field and look like Carson Wentz. All we need Foles to do is to go out on the field in the post season and not look like Dak Prescott. Fact is, there were several plays open all game to different receivers for Foles to hit against the Raiders and he missed nearly all of them. No one wants to pile on a poor performance, but if Foles plays like he did against the Raiders in the playoffs the Eagles will be one and done faster than the 2016 Cowboys. This is the matchup to watch in this game. Continuity and familiarity will help Foles. Being used to the elements will help Foles. Sunday's game against Dallas will be very cold. While that is an effective equalizer for the Eagles moving forward it doesn't help if their own QB doesn't handle the elements well either.|
**Eagles Snap Counts vs. Necessity**|
There isn't really much to watch for in this game other than Nick Foles and the offense, but Pederson has come out and said that the starters will play in this game. Obviously, if the Eagles lose this nothing changes but we should be watching how the team plays, who plays, the amount of snaps they play, and if they make it through the game cleanly. I wouldn't expect the defensive line to see the full workload they are used to but we will see them play snaps. I think it'll be important for guys like Ellerbe and Darby to continue to get snaps and make sure they are still in game shape. There is also the possibility Sidney Jones will play. If there is a situation where you can get him meaningful snaps without having to worry about a games consequences this is it. Maybe the Eagles give some snaps to reserve tackle Will Beatty to ensure that he has some work under his belt in the event it is needed. Wisniewski could certainly use some snaps since he has missed the last two and a half games. All there is to watch is how long the usual cast of characters plays.|
**Doug Pederson vs The Future**|
Jimmy Kempski struggled with his key matchups in this game but did mention that it'll be interesting to see how Pederson calls this game. He's playing the starters; do you call a game to win? I think he'll need to be smart and not reveal anything too deep in the game plan that he'll use for Foles in the playoffs. This is really a stretch since there is no silver lining to Foles starting moving forward. Pederson should be smart about what he does Sunday so as to not tip their hand when the games count again.|
**Eagles vs. Expectations**|
This has been a magical roller coaster season for the Eagles. Many fans expected the team to improve and challenge for a playoff spot despite the more pessimistic projections from national writers and worthless redditors alike. Carson Wentz took the next leap to greatness this season and established himself as one of the upper tier QBs in the league. Doug Pederson proved he knew what he was doing despite a lot of skepticism from fans and writers alike. Dak Prescott stinks. There was room for optimism after last season. The Eagles went 7-9 with their most difficult schedule since NFL realignment. This doesn't take into account the number of teams the Eagles faced coming off a bye - consecutively - then playing a Falcons team coming off 10 days rest. That strength of schedule percentage doesn't take into account naming Wentz starter a week before the start of the season after trading Bradford. It doesn't take into account he was a rookie with a rookie head coach and a new staff and scheme. Yet, here the Eagles are. Through all the adversity this team has faced this season they sit 13-2 and the number 1 seed in the East. There is a chance that the Eagles could set the franchise record for wins if they beat the Cowboys on Sunday. The postseason was always going to be a challenge even with Wentz given the depth of the NFC but has become even more difficult to navigate without him. I would imagine there is less expected of this Eagles team from the outside since Wentz's injury than from before. The team should be used to that by now. The Eagles still have everything to play for and will need its best players to raise their level of play moving forward. The coaching staff will need to bring its very best in order to win moving forward. Week 17 is meaningless... but how the team prepares and carries itself isn't.|

Do you guys have any options on where I can start looking? I'm trying to use all of my options available so I can make the best decision! 

Thanks in advance! "

7mvmzm,241,2017-12-29,..and it checks out,magnificent18,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7mvmzm/and_it_checks_out/,"When learning something new it’s always best to verify to see if the it holds up. 

And as you can tell from my title, I only bring you more proof to you readers that redpill holds true!

So here’s an example that literally just happened 5 minutes ago. (10:47 CST)

I was taking to this girl that I’ve gotten to know at work (aged 20). She is an intern at my company and came back for the winter break. At breaktime we were talking and she told me that she recently broke up with her bf (aged 30) as we were talking about our plans for the New Years.

She smilingly said she was going to see this new guy (from her class) that she will be seeing this weekend.

In the back of my mind I already knew where this was going I and decided to find out why she left her now ex bf.

So I calmly asked her “what happened?”, -acting aloof (Its funny because when she was here for the summer she would always talk highly of him).

She started laughing and said it was because he got upset and become controlling over the fact this guy (who she is now seeing lol) didn’t like the fact he would walk her to her car at night from campus. 

In her defense she justifies her actions by saying being a woman, she is a target at night, and that a group of woman is even a bigger target,
so this guy is just “helping” her get to her car safely. 

I purposely ignored the fact that her ex was actually on to something and I then asked “I’m sure that wasn’t the reason why you broke up with him, this stuff doesn’t happen overnight ya know”

And she’s like “Oh no, there was this other time when my gay best friend invited me and him out and he had made some homophobic comments, that I didn’t appreciate. There was also this one time where he playfully pushed me to the ground and he started laughing.”

Lastly she smiled as she said “for the past 5 months I’ve been trying to get out of this relationship but I was stuck”

In the back of my mind I started laughing hilariously saying “those mfkers at redpill were so right”

So then I smiled and asked her “but I’m still sure  even after all of that, it really wasn’t the reason you two broke up, sometimes guys can be can guys.”

And then she gets a bit quiet and leans in and tells me “You know what it really is, he is a 30 year old blue collar machinist making 50K and he will never be promoted to make more. On top of that I realized I want to get married and have 3 kids and have a family, and he doesn’t want any kids or even get married!” 

“Fair enough” I say.

So I then ask, “Is this new guy atleast better than him”? (According to redpill he must be in order for her to swing to the next branch)

Her face lit up with happiness and said “yeah! He is studying engineering just like me so he will be making more money than my ex and he said he also wanted 3 kids, so yeah he is better”.

I replied “Damn, nice....” 


And that’s all I needed to know, and then she started talking about how she was going to wear a full face of makeup and was aiming to be the cutest girl in the town her now bf is from. The town he is from is supposedly small so she wants to make an impression. 

Anyways I found this whole thing to be hillarious  (since I’m only 24 not married and luckily found trp before anything serious happened in my life ) and I felt the need to share. I’ll be honest  I was a bit skeptical of redpill, but now I’m not.

That’s it! 

Edit: grammar 
Edit2: haha, yes another thing to point out is the guy was 30 and got with a 20 year old! "

After that encounter on Tuesday, Max and I talked casually a few times, shared our sexual experiences. Max was divorced, wasn't seeing any one for 3 months. I told him that I didn't have a boyfriend. He asked me why I teased him. I didn't want to be seen as an easy slut, which I was of course not, so I told him I was attracted to him, saw him ogle at me, so tried to tease him.

That Friday, we drank together at the happy hours. Max took me home with my car still in the company parking lot. We made out while having wine and watching a TV show on his couch. He bent me over with my hands on the couch arm as he fucked me hard and deep until he grunted and came deep inside me and we both fell on the couch.

Then we had dinner, Max is a good cook and cooks as a hobby. He made prawns and mashed potato. We had dinner, watched the TV show for some more time with me essentially in my undies. Then he went inside his bedroom, came back and said its time to go to bed. As I entered the bedroom, I was surprised and some what shocked. He had restraints on all the four corners nicely arranged on the bed. 

I told him this is all very new to me, but having known him for some time I trusted him. Then started my night after which I was never a good girl. He fucked me for two hours, first eating me out and playing with my boobies and body slowly and licking my body all over. Then he fucked me missionary style for another half hour. I came 4 times that night.

It was also the first time I got a hickey on my left boob and Max's fine hand print on my right butt cheek.

This year (2017) is hands down one of the best years I’ve had in quite some time. I actually enjoyed my time at college because I met a few people who are now close friends, earned all A’s and B’s in my classes, enjoyed my last days of summer work at my seasonal job on the boardwalk, scored an internship for next summer, and met a wonderful girl who actually likes me. And that’s just a short list. What I’m saying is I’ve had such a great and wonderful year, but realize it’s coming to an end. I don’t want 2018 to be a shitty year. Who knows how long it will be until I have another year like I did in 2017. I plan on making 2018 just as good, if not better. I just don’t know how yet.

7mwq7n,178,2017-12-29,[MF] The first time I (20F) decided to let myself loose,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/7mwq7n/mf_the_first_time_i_20f_decided_to_let_myself/,"Cross post. Was asked to post here.

I am in my sophomore year at a university in mid-west. Throughout my life I lived in the mid-west. I am your average high schooler. I got good grades, was responsible and focused. No regrets as I got into a good college, studying computer science. I had friends who had way better social life than me in high school but I did not regret it as I wanted to get into a good college. Also, I remained a virgin and did not get much action though I fooled around a few times.

In college I did not date anyone seriously in the first year though I had a fling in the fist semester and dated a guy not exclusively (to him) for the entire spring semester. He used to initiate most of the time and I was happy with the love making. I am a brunette, 5'5"", C-cups, wide hips and thick in very good shape. For some reason, I remained sort of nerdy and wasn't too outgoing.

I did an internship in the summer of this year in the same college town. I worked in the engineering department of a small software company. I was in a team of six and first week went by well, socializing with colleagues, getting to know the product etc. One of the tech leads I worked with was probably in his late thirties, with a nice beard and had a dad bod. He took some interest in me as I could notice him glancing at me and asking me about my work, college etc. In our conversations I came to know that he had two kids, divorced and went to the same college as me.

Every Tuesday we used to go over the tasks that I will be working on in that week. This is kind of a standard practice in software. I had a recurring meeting with him every Tuesday. Usually I wear jeans and tees to work but that day I also had a meeting with the VP and I decided to wear a nice fit and flare dress with a blazer. 

During the meeting I was setting up my laptop so that we can project the screen to go over the tasks. As I was setting up, standing and adjusting the hardware options to select the right output for the projector, I looked at Max (pseudonym for the tech lead). He was staring at my ample cleavage that I was accidentally displaying for him. He grinned having caught off guard and looked at the screen.

That night I was thinking about the incident and I thought may be I should hookup with him. I did not have casual sex until then and it was all pretty new to me. But, what made me take this route was that I had this feeling that I did not address but knew deep down that I was not having much fun like others. Things were some what eased by the fact that this company had happy hours every Friday 4-5. I hung out with the team and had drinks and snacks. 

Three weeks into the internship, I decided its time. In the next Tuesday meeting, I wore a similar dress that I wore before, but this time without the blazer. Then I put up a show intentionally this time. When our eyes met, I bit my lower lip, adjusted my hair and smiled. His face was like a thousand watt bulb when he smiled back his full self. A new bug was opened by the tester in the feature I worked on. He said, I was a ""bad girl"" which was definitely and innuendo. I smiled back and bit my lip dropping him enough hints. He was some what convinced that I was game. He got up from the other side, came to my side, sat beside me and said he will teach me how to fix it if I know how to use ""these"". He said ""these"" as he held my cheek in his hand running his thumb on my lips. I was horny and only bit my lip and looked into his eyes as I nodded my head.

At 4:30 he stopped by my desk and asked me to not leave until 6. At 5:45 the receptionist who usually leaves last left. He immediately stopped by and asked me to come into the team room. He sat on the chair and ordered me to get on my knees. I followed his orders as he made me suck his cock for ten minutes holding my hair and head in his both hands as my mouth worked his cock back and forth. I was already wet when he stopped, laid me on the table, spread my legs and fucked me with hard and deep thrusts. He said probably the first slutty comment I received, ""Godd! you have such a nice child bearing hips!"". I orgasmed when he said that! He was squeezing my tits as he emptied his cock deep inside me after checking that I was on pill. 

After that encounter on Tuesday, Max and I talked casually a few times, shared our sexual experiences. Max was divorced, wasn't seeing any one for 3 months. I told him that I didn't have a boyfriend. He asked me why I teased him. I didn't want to be seen as an easy slut, which I was of course not, so I told him I was attracted to him, saw him ogle at me, so tried to tease him.

2017 has been a weird year. As with all years, there were ups and downs They started in their all too famous house and were suddenly thrown out. The stay in the barn, albeit relatively brief, did not deter our boys from giving us the best content they could make. Earlier in the year, our good friend and veteran Aron made the decision to leave. Many months later, the intern Jacob left as well after a brief, but very eventful stay. The last loss of 2017 would be Joe, the longest serving member of the cowchop team. He'll always be a chicken boy in our hearts!

The void they left has been expertly filled by a new generation of degenerate minds, in the form of Jakob and Lindsey. They helped tremendously in making the transition to California a comedic success! I have personally loved the content the guys put out in 2017 and cannot wait to see what they have in store for us in 2018!

Thank you James, Aleks, Trevor, Brett, Asher, Anna, Lindsey and Jakob! Special thanks goes out to RoosterTeeth and the LetsPlay family!

7mxamc,8,2017-12-29,How can I [M21] break this unhealthy family cycle of arguing? Specifically with my dad [M49]?,BioluminescentHooch,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7mxamc/how_can_i_m21_break_this_unhealthy_family_cycle/,"I apologize in advance if this becomes a long read as I am currently pretty worked up over this. Thanks to all who read.

So a little background to my family situation as it is now. In October, my grandma (dad's mom) passed away suddenly. Since then, it has uncovered a lot of family issues.


Before my grandma passed, she and my grandpa would argue constantly (never violent, just harmful words). Some of my earliest memories are of my grandparents fighting at family events, holiday dinners, really just all of the time. It was so bad that a lot of other family members began describing their arguing as ""their way"" of communicating. Which has always made me sad. I spent a lot of time growing up in their house and at a certain point, as bad as it sounds, I just began to tune it out. 


Sometime in his life, my dad picked this up too. I guess growing up seeing the same thing I saw (maybe even worse), he took on the role of ""like father, like son."" The resemblance between my grandpa and my dad is staggering and not in a good way. He joined in on the fight (arguing with my grandparents, arguing with my mom, storming out of the house when he didn't get his way).


I feel bad saying it because I do love my family and my dad, but one of my biggest fears has always been becoming like my dad. It scares me because of how aware I am of the tendency for children to become their parents. It has caused extreme self-awareness where I feel the need to nitpick every aspect of my social life. I want everyone to like me and I most certainly want to break this family tradition of arguing for the sake of arguing. 


And as I grow now, I realize that in my efforts I may have made some bad decisions. I chose the path of avoidance to deal with my family problem. Whenever I went away to college, I really went away to college. I sought to change my life and as a senior now, rarely ever come home and absolutely dread it. Every time I come home, I know that I can expect the same thing. My grandpa and dad will argue, throw things and make asses of themselves until I eventually get sucked into it. When I come home, I feel like I am a different person than the one I like to be at school. And it seems like in the process, my family has missed out on that growth and believes that I am still the old person I was in high school.


I don't have a lot in common with my dad and we do share similar beliefs nor see eye to eye on most everything. He has this signature really loud tone of voice (same as grandpa) where he starts out yelling and it seems really aggressive. I'm not even entirely sure he realizes it, even though I have pointed it out to him numerous times. What this leads to is, even while doing the simplest of things, is arguing. I feel like I am being yelled at and then have to defend myself. Offering a suggestion of how to do something better, leads to me getting yelled and thus rejected and angry. It gradually becomes worse until I feel like I too am now am on the path of this self-fulfilling prophecy so long as I stay at home.


Now I have confronted my father before and often. It does not seem to get anywhere, even when I make progress. It seems at times like he is unwilling to change. I have listened to him, his problems and how he feels while offering ideas of how to change or suggesting maybe he (or we as a family) seek therapy. He rejects it and has over time developed this mantra of: ""why am I always wrong?""


It hurts me because he rarely apologizes for his outbursts of anger and it manifests itself as manipulation. I have actually seen him get his way out of this behavior and it boils my blood. I just do not understand, because at times, he can be so kind. Spending money on others thoughtlessly and being nice for periods of time. But it just seems like it is then a matter of time until the arguing makes its way back. 



Is there anything I can do to break this cycle? I feel so helpless and alone. My mom has dealt with this behavior so amazingly and deserves to be sainted. Her passiveness however is not the answer as she is just then easily manipulated. I just want ever so badly to be in the stage of my life, where I can have my own wife and break this damn cycle, but not if he carries on to become my grandpa.


I graduate college this Spring and I cannot emphasize enough my plans to move out on my own. I just worry that perhaps I will not be financially dependent enough to live on my own. I work an internship right now and just do not make enough money to get a car, maybe if I get hired right out of school. And being an only child only makes it worse. At times, I have refused gifts because I feel like it validates his behavior. At other times like Christmas, he has spent enough money on random gifts that could be used to buy me a cheap car. He very much wants me to live at home for a few years after college and never wanted me to leave in the first place. It has made me depressingly dependent on others, when I have proven myself to be more than capable of independence. 



I just don't know if I can handle a few more years of living at home if things continue the way they are and I cannot handle a holiday break. It depressed me to see my grandparents argue and fight until the very end. It depresses me to see family members not want to see my grandpa or comfort him after the passing of my grandma because of his behavior. It depresses me to see my dad blindly follow in his footsteps. And most of all, it depresses me to seem prophetically bound to the same vicious cycle of arguing or lose closeness with my family.


I am sorry if this post was abnormally long or hard to read. I needed a place to vent my situation. I never feel comfortable doing this with my friends, despite their wonderful support, because I feel as if I am placing my burdens upon them. Thank you so much.






  
  ---   
 TL;DR: Family has an unhealthy history of arguing that now seems destined to be my burden unless I can somehow be the change. Is there a way I can breakthrough to my dad and make him see this?"

I’ve had a high GPA, got accepted into my desired university, received several scholarships in the process, had an amazing internship at a cutting-edge startup, and have stayed out of trouble my entire life. 

This summer, I got to know the son of one of my dad’s former co-workers via Instagram. He had been following my big page dedicated to the industry I’ll be going into and saw my intent to apply at my desired university, which he would also be attending. He is a freshman in college and I am a senior in high school. 

We’ve gotten to know each other and come from very similar familial, religious, and political backgrounds. He treats me right, isn’t interested in having sex with me like my previous ex, and we both have a ton of fun when we hang out. He’s been smitten with me since autumn, but I’m just now starting to develop feelings. We’ve been on 2 dates thus far.

In 8 months time we’ll be going to school in the same place. I might add that I had no idea he existed until long after I had my sights set on this particular university, which was recommended to me by a former co-worker at the internship I had. I would never apply at a university based on whether or not a romantic interest would or wouldn’t be attending. 

I have an extremely narcissistic mother who has been watching this friendship unfold. The guy I’ve been seeing dealt with some harassment from former roommates, which was further complicated by his high-functioning autism. She attempted to victim-blame him for the situation and I called her out for it. She erupted in one of her typical rage-fits. 

Now that she has nothing against him or to vilify him with, she has taken to embarrassing me and guilting me at every chance. She makes a scene and begs me not to get in a relationship to “focus on school” and not be like my cousin (who nearly chased a boy to college). She gets extremely weird whenever I ask her for permission to hang out with him, so I merely ask over text now. One would expect my dad to behave this way being protective of his daughter, but he doesn’t. He’s far more rational about it. 

I don’t tell my mom anything anymore about our friendship, because it’s just ammunition. She doesn’t know we’ve kissed, she doesn’t know we’ve been to dinner, and she doesn’t know the status of our friendship. She makes me feel bad about having a male friend and the idea of dating. 

She may appear to be a concerned mother, but I know this isn’t the case. She doesn’t want me to tarnish my image of being too successful to want to date. She lives for gloating about me and thrives off of my achievements. Me dating cheapens my image in her eyes, I strongly suspect. 

I in part needed to vent, but I also need advice on confronting her about this. The guy I’ve been seeing is aware of how my mom behaves and agreed that we’d wait things out so I could sort the problem. Our relationship can’t move into being something more if my mom is in the way.  

TL;DR: Narcissistic mother (nmom) hates the idea of me dating and won’t stop guilting me out of it. She has tried everything to vilify this perfectly decent guy and embarrass me about our friendship. I’m sick of it and it needs to end. "
7mxqge,3,2017-12-29,quick introduction,Grach32,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/7mxqge/quick_introduction/,"**(EDIT: i just wanted to introduce myself, but i ended up writing this year summary about myself) 
**

hey guys, i just felt like i want to speak out:

im 20 yrs old male and ive played DotA for more then 8 years (hard to remember). Only the game because its so complex: i can talk for hours about it, about all micro and macro decision you have to make and think of, of how complex this game is and how many people actually realise the BEAUTY of it.  (it really is beautiful on multiple levels)

i was trying to go professional, even played in a couple of teams and against a couple of pros (Prodota Gaming, Liquid, many semi-pros), but i guess i just lack talent. even though i was really commited to it and playing DotA 24/7 and thinking about it all day long. 

it was really hard to grind mmr back then when i was playing. i did a crazy amount of dota, watched, studied, trained to get better. i would get mad at my team, at my ex-gf (i think it was one of the reasons we eventually broke up), at myself because i felt like such a GOOD player in such a toxic environment.
i was getting this feelings, when you just want to meet this kid irl and smash his face. feelings, when you ask yourself HOW IS THIS GUY EVEN ALIVE? HOW DOES HE EVEN BREATH?
excuse me, im getting mad even now just thinking about it. i would be pretty tilted by the end of the day and it all resulted in various problems with my grades, my look, my gf. but i couldnt break the addicition. this unique mix or AMPLITUDE you go through by playing (from -100 to +100 in 2 minutes) is just not achievable irl. irl live its always +5 or -5 to me. and its also very boring :D 

**what actually helped me to stop playing was really easy** - my mouse broke and im just not buying a replacement. (you cant play DotA on laptop). yes, thats easy - the only problem is that i dont really know what to do in my free time. so im still watching streams movies, eating, working out, idk. i still feel like its a huge step forward - from using free time wrong to not knowing how to use free time.

and you know guys, i feel lonely. i moved to out to another country, alone on my own when i was 17, i immediately met my ex-gf and we just spent all 2,5 yrs together 24/7. it was enjoyable time. life gifted me invaluable lessons.

the problem is that now i moved out and i dont have any family or any friends over here, but im trying to overcome the obstacles. i feel like im in a reflection chamber 

(watch this, its actually a term used in masonry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY8IS0ssnXQ)


**sidenote**: i hate to use three words but i have to use them because they describe my sturggles very fast : **ADHD DEPRESSION and AUTISM** because i dont want to associate myself with it, even though someone else on my place would be whining about how he struggles. fuck all this shit. i just want to pour out how i feel. 

**ADHD**:

idk, its hard for me to stay focused on one thing, concentrate and stuff IF its not interesting. i listen to music everyday 24/7, my first action when i wake up is to crank up the volume on my phone because i hate to have nothing to think about. when im in public transport, im playing weird mind games, everyone would consider autistic :) i count steps, cars, buildings, everything, just because its SO BORING. yeah i guess, its kinda like ADHD but not really. thats one of the reasons i play DotA, its so complicated....(big rant on how complex the game is and that i could theorycraft about it all day long)

**DEPRESSION**:

you know guys, back then i would wake up, coming from the dream getting this GOOD feeling of JUST waking up - when you forget about your life and just feel the happiness i guess? after this moment i would realise who i am, where i am, and that im utter piece of shit. i would just lie there and ask myself - why am i even alive? whats the point of living? cant i just stop breathing? no motivation, no power, no lust, nothing. even now i struggle with feeling basic emotions. i jsut feel so dull i even started to kinda cut myself a little bit (dont worry im fine) jsut to feel something. 
i actually know that this depression is bullshit, its going to be away at some point and i would like to say that i actually overcame it. 
Guys, just know, that its OK to have a bad day and you just need to accept this. you dont need to push your limits day by day. Sometimes youve got to lay and chill all day long in your bed if you feel like it. And its perfectly fine. 

(matching video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mngtcfcaVrI  read the description)

**AUTISM**:

well, im not autistic in any way - its just foreign country and me hardly having any social interactions with people besides some random people and my coworkers. but i struggle with reading people, what they expect from me and how i should behave myself. and i noticed that i tend to get really personal really fast. because ive thought about my problems so many times, its not really personal, you know? everyone has similar problems, im not unique in any way, so why i would bother thinking about my problems as REALLY PERSONAL and PRIVATE? I dont really care i guess, im just pouring out how i feel. But i understand how some people might react to it lol. but also, sometimes you just click with people using this method. i had ONS and we kinda clicked similarly, she told me ""its like i know you years"" just because of this. its really weird thinking about it. i jsut admire people who are naturally really good at smalltalk and stuff like this (emotional intellect)   

so yeah, its 29.12., im all alone in a city i dont know. i have no friends, and thats TOTALLY FINE guys. to climb a new mountain you first have to get from the peak of your old one and climb all the way up again. thats life.
and i totally relate to this picture: https://i.redd.it/don1vhwuz1wz.png

i hit the gym, started to run and it feels really GREAT. i lost some weight, but i gained more power. i finally started to make rap again. i even made cover for my incoming EP. 
(Please dont freak out NSFW, i rap about pretty gnarly stuff liek battling inner demons and torturing kids inside of me because thats how i work with all the shit i have inside of me. i dont want it to be here, i just write lyrics and pour it all out of me.  https://pp.userapi.com/c841239/v841239895/516d4/Z4uULvKQLTI.jpg)

how does this relate to gaming? after all this subreddit is about it, right?

well, i feel like **my priorities start to switch**. ive never really payed attention to the real world before. i was always seeking for escape in games. seeking for some bullshit to feed my mind with while im AFKing in public transport and stuff.

 Now i feel like ive gotten enough of toxic community, dumb people, and stuf flike this. I have had enough of being socially weird and strugggling to interact with people irl. 

**i want to achieve something REAL, in REAL world.** I started to work on designing my own clothing. (want to begin with t-shirts at first) and maybe if its going to work out, ill look into setting up my own small shop and advertising it on social networks. 

ive found an internship (the reason i moved out). 

**im really grateful to my ex-gf** and wish her all the best. you rock! and i want to say sorry for my various addictions and the negative impact i made on you. even though you wont read it and i did it in person, i still think about my experience with you every day to learn from my mistakes and be ready for the future.

**im really grateful to my ""destiny""** which made us broke up (wont go into details, we broke up a few years sooner then it would be without outer influence). i will try to put up with all the shit you will pour on me and i will try to get stonger. ill do my best to imrove, to be in a better place in 1 year - not in my reflection chamber alone by myself. 

**this year i learned how to manage my depression, how its ok to feel bad sometimes. i plan on doing nofap (it works guys, i guarantee you) and going to gym. my gym result already outgrew my ""before"" phase results even though i lost like 8 kg. 
i also learned more about recording rap, mastering and working with vocals. i got better at writing lyrics! i got better at singing, know i can even hit some notes lol :D 
im excited to continue with university in the next year - i expect my grades to get better too! (even though im hella anxious just thinking about it)**

and as i was sitting, thinking when was the last time i played DotA i understood - i want to stop playing too. lets hope i wont get new mouse any time soon :) because i know that ill start play the day i get it! :( "
7myp0v,5,2017-12-29,"Coterm vs regular masters admissions with a poor transcript, mechE",fjellvandrer,stanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/7myp0v/coterm_vs_regular_masters_admissions_with_a_poor/,"Hey all - I was wondering if anyone could advise me on whether pursuing coterm admission is a worthwhile effort for me, or if I might have a better chance finding a job and then applying to regular masters programs later.

Background - I'm an undergrad (senior, but still w/ three quarters left b/c time off) in ME with a pretty terrible GPA. (I know this already makes my chance of getting into any masters program @stanford very slim.) I credit my bad grades mostly to me not trying hard enough, plus I was doing varsity sports most of my first 2 years and come from a high school background that was less rigorous than most of my peers and didn't prepare me well for Stanford, because I don't want to think that I'm not smart enough for decent grades.

The thing is, I took a long time to really start to love engineering but my attitude really changed my junior year.  I'm now really passionate about learning more within the field of mechanical engineering and I'm really kicking myself for not setting myself up better for grad study because I've realized that I love this field, I've barely begun to touch the surface of the things I could learn, and I desperately want to stay longer and study more.  Unfortunately the only things I have going for me right now, I feel, are good STEM extracurriculars (started after I quit sports). 

so - what could I do to give myself even a whisper of a chance? if anything? Would finding a research position vs a tech internship for next summer help? (I don't finish undergrad til next year so I have that time left). Is it worth it to retake classes to raise my GPA by 0.1 - 0.15? Would my chances improve at all if I left after undergrad and worked in industry until I really fleshed out where my further academic interests would be, and then applied to the regular masters? 

I apologize for the length but really appreciate anyone who reads/could give advice. This has just been really weighing on my mind because I've been so upset at myself &amp; feeling as if I wasted my earlier time at this place."
7mz6v8,1,2017-12-29,I hope that one day my parents will understand why I did what I did today and that it is what I needed to do for myself.,kevin129795,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/7mz6v8/i_hope_that_one_day_my_parents_will_understand/,"Four weeks ago exactly, I went to DC for an internship only to be kicked out of my apartment on the 6th day that I was there, having gastritis and having been in the hospital the weekend before. I took the news that I was being kicked out personally, without knowing that it was because there was an age difference between my roommates and I (I'm 22, they're 32 and 38), but that always kind of being a flimsy reason to ask me to leave in the first place. I had a breakdown at work the next day by yelling at the receptionist at my new internship because I was still upset about what happened last night.and getting fired, and having to return home the same day. It really sucked, and I still have a lot of pain to resolve it regarding why I did what I did, and what should I do next. 

I decided to lie to my parents that I was going to see family friends, when in fact I was going to trip on acid to resolve this issues, and others, in my mind. I have been taking a whole slew of SSRIs since I was like 8, and have been to, and am continuing to go to, therapists for chronic depression, anxiety, and possibly borderline personality disorder. 

I hope that my parents will see the benefits of why I close to do what I did today, why I lied to them, and that it was for self-discovery purposes only. However, my mom freaks out at me smoking pot, because I had an alcohol problem for about 8 months, a year and a half ago, after which, I have been on a good path with drinking. She might not see my experience as beneficial, or think that I am some hippie druggie. She grew up with two alcoholic uncles in Communist Poland, so life was rough on her.

What should I do in this situation? I already told her that I lied to her, that it wasn't ok, and that I'm really sorry, but that's I feel like I can do at this point. How can I get her to accept what I did today as an ok thing?"
7mzfil,4,2017-12-29,Seeking counseling as a grad student in a counseling program,lotuschii,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/7mzfil/seeking_counseling_as_a_grad_student_in_a/,"I just completed my first semester as a graduate student, working towards my masters in clinical mental health counseling. 

I saw a counselor in undergrad on my college campus, and would like to continue seeing one now as a grad student. However, I have some hesitations I hope some folks can give some general advice on. 

I have an assistantship on campus that is split between Residence Life and the Counseling Center, and because it’s a fairly small school there are only two counselor’s in the center I could see. Also, because my assistantship is within the Counseling Center, I view these two counselors as coworkers more than anything else, and feel slightly uncomfortable with the idea of going to one of them in search of counseling. I see them every work day, work with them on different projects, and sometimes attend the same social events as them (things like staff parties and potlucks). 

I’ve looked into off-campus counseling, and there are not very many options. My grad school is in South Dakota (I’m from California) so while I’m not very familiar with the community, the rural-ness limits my options. Also, there are only so many places where I can choose to eventually do my practicum and internship, and am unsure if seeking counseling from one of these places may hinder my choices in any way. 

There are other centers and clinics within the state that I’ve looked at, but the main issue there is distance (most are 2+ hours away). However, I don’t know if that might be the best or only option I can use. 

I have health insurance through Kaiser Permanente, so unfortunately it is only of any use to me if I saw one of their counselors - and there are no Kaiser facilities in South Dakota. I can’t afford to see any of the private practitioners in the area because of this - I’ve looked into it. 

Should I just seek out the services on my college campus, or is it more advisable to seek services off-campus?"

7mzw22,1,2017-12-30,M4A - TV Comedies (and Other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7mzw22/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Peep Show*, *Arrested Development* and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7n0c35,16,2017-12-30,Reflecting over the past few years with my journey in recovery. This is a long post but I'd recommend newcomers read it.,Bum_In_The_Park,OpiatesRecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/7n0c35/reflecting_over_the_past_few_years_with_my/,"I've been doing a lot of thinking about my experience with addiction lately, as I'm sure we all do, especially as the year closes. January 7th, 2014 was the day my mother heard me collapse in the living room as I was going out for a smoke. I had just shot up. It was my routine. Prep, shoot, smoke in the cold. I remember my legs giving out. I tried to get up and I couldn't. I just remember my legs and arms weren't strong enough to hold me up - every time I tried I fell back down, weak as if I were half-paralyzed. It was real hazy. My mother called 911 as I struggled to move. She had no idea about my secret - she assumed I was having a seizure or something. It seemed like seconds later I was being assessed by an EMT. She pulled up my sleeves and asked what the marks were in the crook of my elbow. I said they were bug bites. Real smooth, Steve, you have bug bites in an especially frigid winter. They immediately administered a dose of narcan. All the warmth in my body left me - I felt so cold. The cops showed up in less the a minute because my neighborhood was across the street from the station. Asked to search my room and my car and I said no. Asked if I shot up in my home and I said no. The doors of the ambulance shut, and we were on our way.

On the trip to the ER I was being interrogated by the ambulance crew. I felt like they were rude but really I know they were just concerned, or at least, they pitied me, or maybe they were just tired of dealing with middle class kids ODing in their parents house. My heart rate was exceptionally high. I was told I had experienced atrial fibrillation in the ER, which explains the weakness in my limbs and the incredibly high heart rate. My family was devastated. The car ride home was silent. The first chance I got I shot up the remaining three bags I had in a safe in my room and they did nothing. I didn't just feel nothing from the drug, I felt emotionally dead at this point. Isn't it fucked up how we can almost die and immediately, and in this case I really mean immediately, do the same thing that had really devastated us physically and our family members mentally?

I went to rehab for 28 days. I sort of had a way with dealing with these things by going with the flow and not thinking too much. I smoked a lot, told war stories, and glorified the thing I was told to quit. None the less, I had vowed to never use an opiate again. It seemed like such a monumental thing to agree to at 20 years old. I still couldn't see a life without heroin. I had only been using for 2 years at this point and felt that it wasn't enough - I didn't put in enough time. See, my plan was to use while I was young and quit once I got a degree or when I met the love of my life. Now that seems tragically funny, because I know it doesn't work that way. 

I spent the next 8 months or so incredibly miserable. I was sober, sure, but fuck you if you are happy around me. I didn't do anything for myself. I felt that something had been unfairly taken away from me. I wanted to use every day. I lashed out at people. I built up resentments. I made some people hate me more than they ever did when I was in active addiction. See, I expected a parade, an award, praise, and a perfect life without dope. That was the plan, right? Be the guy who got his jollies in, got good, and told war stories at the bar 20 years later. That's another tragically funny thing in retrospect, but I'll save the alcohol discussion for /r/stopdrinking.

In Fall of that year I decided I had to get it in. I knew my dealer's stomping grounds, one of the local Wawas, and waited in my car. Sure enough he came around to fulfill all of the orders he had gotten, and I said my hellos and made a purchase. See, my plan was to just use once, and we all know how that goes. I shot up, and...? I felt good? I mean, I felt good, but there was something else. This was a powerful lesson. See, if you feel self-pity in sobriety, you don't want to know how magnified it becomes after you relapse. No rush could block the immediate depression I felt. The next 6 weeks was filled with a charade trying to keep my shit together. I would put together a few days and relapse. A few days and relapse. A few days and relapse. 

I found /r/OpiatesRecovery. I was under a different handle back then, and unfortunately it wouldn't be wise to share it because it was simply my last name (very distinguishable at that), but I remember names like alividlife, DJ FML, Leslie_Knope0 (who unfortunately I presume has passed), and many others whose names escape me. I've gone through a few accounts - the first, Steve_is_very_cool, and now this one. This subreddit was my rock for the first year or so. 

I remember being content at the time but knowing the life I have now I am glad I kept going through recovery. I don't have a monumental list of accomplishments during 2015 and 2016. I stayed in school, worked when I could, and kept my head down. Truth be told, I had no social life, and not much to show for those years. I had sought out romantic relationships but much to my chagrin I wasn't much of a charmer, and I don't exactly shine on those dating apps. I switched my major, from Psychology to Accounting, and really found my groove. But though I felt content, something was still missing.

We get to 2017. I spent the first 6 months of the year binge drinking - this was my new solution. Like I said, the alcohol stuff is more suited for /r/stopdrinking, but I hit an emotional low, and that's what is relevant. I quit drinking on June 7th, and I started going to therapy and meetings immediately after. I don't know which to credit for the incredible change in my life, to be honest. The past 6 months of my life have seen more joy than any of the years preceding it. I am in a great (and healthy!!) relationship with a wonderful woman, I start an accounting internship on Thursday, I am back in the gym with a healthier mindset than was seen earlier in the year, I passed four of what are some of the most difficult accounting courses in the program, and most of all, I am *actually happy.* When I wake up in the morning, I am *actually happy to be alive.* I have great friends. I don't run into a situation that I feel would be better if I were high. See, I lived life over the past few years, but it was nothing like this.

I know not many will read my story, but I really just wanted to write this out to reflect. I read the posts on this subreddit and talk to newcomers in meetings and *I wish I could share with you all what I have.* Not like this, this short story. I wish you could experience what I experience. A few years ago I thought I'd find salvation in the barrel of a needle or even more recently, the bottom of a bottle. It's all a facade. This life I'm living is more fulfilling than any drunk or high ever was. It is possible for all of you. If you come on this subreddit, or end up in a rehab or a meeting, **that is an opportunity.** Please, please, please...take the opportunity. "
7n0e0e,1,2017-12-30,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7n0e0e/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."

I'm a Belgian Graduate Student in business (management) and I'm currently debating my options to land a long term job in Seoul. I've fell in love with the place while visiting a friend that lives there a few years back and since then I've had the chance to come back a few times. But now the track i've been following for years are coming to an end and i must decide how to shape my future in a meaningful way.

I've looked a bit through this subreddit and read the FAQ and from what I've gathered it seems pretty hard to find a job if you are not looking to teach English which I'm not.

My questions are the following:

1) When working for one of the big international consulting companies in Korea (Deloitte, PWC, EY, ...) What level of korean is generally required knowing that i can speak 4 other languages?

2) Would it be easier to work a few years in Belgium then ask for opportunies in one of their subsidiaries rather then directly applying in Korea ?

3) Is there any websites except LinkedIn that has job offering for foreigner in the business sector ?

I now have around seven months to gather informations and decide on the best course of action. Indeed, I have to finish my exchange at the Peking University and i have a 6 months internship planned at Accenture in Business to IT alignement. And anyone willing to share their story and/or tips is welcome."

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; From a written constitution to a system of radically devolved power to the replacement of monarchy with an elected head of state, it was time for us to bring home the revolution that we had made in America.

&gt; With impeccable timing, my hymn of praise for the US constitution appeared a matter of months before what looked a lot like a US constitutional crisis, with the impeachment of Bill Clinton over perjury charges arising from his denials of a relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.

&gt; For this first year of the Donald Trump presidency has exposed two flaws in the model that I cannot brush aside so easily.

&gt; The first is that Trump has vividly demonstrated that much of what keeps a democracy intact is not enshrined in the written letter of a constitution, but resides instead in customs and conventions - norms - that are essential to civic wellbeing.

&gt; This year of Trump has also shown the extent to which the US has an unwritten constitution that - just like ours - relies on the self-restraint of the key political players, a self-restraint usually insisted upon by a free press.

&gt; Scholars are clear that Trump has already provided sufficient legal grounds for such a move - the case against him is far more compelling than the one against Bill Clinton.

7n1rw9,1,2017-12-30,My (22F) Girlfriend Wants To Break Up With Me (22M) Because She Has Anxiety About Our Relationship. I need some help.,B3llooonmann,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7n1rw9/my_22f_girlfriend_wants_to_break_up_with_me_22m/,"So first I'll give some backstory to our relationship. Me and my girlfriend have been happily dating for 3 and a half years, with no really big problems. We met at the beginning of our college lives and we are both our first loves. We also are studying the same thing. 

The biggest issue prior to what happens that she has with me is that I don't get a long with all her friends too well and not all of her family. I'm a rather quiet individual and it takes time for me to grow close to people. She feels like some times I'm not trying and that she feels caught between her friends asking ""why does he not talk to me?"" and my personality. 

Things were looking great going into 2017 until she went for her internship during the summer. For the most part the summer was not that different from previous, we enjoyed ourselves and hungout quite a bit. Then when mid August rolled around, she was acting a little different and I could sense it. I would ask her if she was okay and she would say that she was fine despite seeming quieter than usual. She just seemed off. Then one day she came over and told me she really wanted to go for a walk with me. On that walk she admitted to me that she felt she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to move on. This was a complete shock to me because we were so happy prior. I think her main reason for breaking up was that she wanted to try and date other people. We talked for a while, but after seeing how I reacted to it she wanted to take it back immediately. We talked about it for a while and I gave her a few days to collect herself. She said she didn't mean it and wanted to take everything back. She told me that she shouldn't be so heartbroken over breaking up with me if it was the right thing to do. So she took it back. We went back to normal for around 2 months. For those 2 months I could really sense that she conquered her anxiety and was letting herself love me again.

I thought it was all in the past, but then it started again late november. To give more insight into other things happening in our lives; she is in her final year of college, she had a trip planned for her christmas vacation, and our college went on strike for 5 weeks and screwed our semester up. We seemed fine going into the strike, but then I felt like she was getting more distant from me again. My assumptions were correct and she admitted to me that she was feeling anxious again about our relationship. She told me that she was feeling this way on and off during the strike. She admitted all of this 3 days before our big 4 year anniversary. After talking for a while I made her feel comfortable again and she yet again took what she said back. This time she came at me with a few things she wanted me to change. She wanted me to be more independent and make more of an effort with her friends/family. She said she was finding it harder to picture herself with me in the future, marrying me, moving in with me, etc. I calmed her down again and reassured her that I was in fact trying to improve in all of these areas. She started acting like normal again, we went for our anniversary and had a good time with each other. We couldn't make the most of it because she has to do all this homework so she can go on her trip.

Unfortunately her anxiety came back early december and one day after hanging out she told me she was feeling anxious again. Just the previous day she felt normal and were having fun. I could sense that something was up just by how she acted. She wouldn't have told me had I not broke down in the car just before she dropped me off. She didn't know how to respond but she tried to make me feel better. I went in and 10mins later without me knowing she followed. We sat down and talked for a bit. She said that she was finding it harder to see herself with me again and that she wouldn't miss me if we didn't get married. Like every other time I calmed her down and comforted her about everything. This was 5 days before her trip that she would be on for 3 weeks. Again we were back to normal for the days leading up to the trip, I even helped her pack and said goodbye.

Now we are more up to date with what's happening. I feel myself now developing my own anxieties about her and whether she's okay and if anything she says is true. I keep wanting her to be open with me no matter how hard it is for her to say what she's feeling. We have been chatting over her whole trip and it was pretty normal talk but as more days went past she started seeming different again. One day I asked how she was feeling and she admitted to me that she was feeling anxious again about our relationship and wanted to break it off, she felt she couldn't wait until she returned. She said she wanted to be open with me. She told me it was getting harder and harder for her to bring herself to message me, say I love you, say I miss you. Every time she tries to break up with me she says it's not you, it's me. She tells me that I'm the greatest boyfriend she could have ever asked for and that she doesn't deserve me. She says she can't get over this feeling of wanting to date other people. She says she has fantasies about a perfect boyfriend that could be out there for her that will drive her around, bring her parents gifts, connect with her family and friends. The thing is I have a good relationship with her family and some of her friends, so it doesn't make too much sense. I've also been making an effort with driving but I'm moving pretty slow. After calming her down and making her feel unsure about her decision again she gave it a day to think more about it. She said that she will think about it over her remaining days there and on her way home. She did admit to me what caused all of this anxiety about our relationship, it was because she met someone when she was on her internship. She thought that he had some qualities that she was looking for and it would be nice to date him. She said that he asked her out and that she declined because of her commitment to me.

That's what brings us to now. She feels like this will just continue being a endless cycle if we don't break up. I keep telling her that we need better communication when it comes to these anxities she's feeling but she keeps it bottled up too much of the time. She says the main feeling she feels now when she thinks of our relationship is guilt. She feels guilty that she can't say she loves me, that we might break up and leave me alone, guilty that she doesn't miss me as much as she should. I told her that I think it would be a good idea for her to go see a therapist about this anxiety she's feeling. Is going to a therapist worth it? Is this a lost cause? What would you guys do? What do you think I could do to help the situation?

tldr: My girlfriend says she feels uneasy about our relationship and whether it will have a future. This all happened because she is thinking of other people. "
7n1whb,1,2017-12-30,Me [24/M] and my ex [22/F] broke up because of me moving away from home combined with her anxiety/depression. She’s messaged me but I’m not sure what to do,lelpd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7n1whb/me_24m_and_my_ex_22f_broke_up_because_of_me/,"We dated for 8 months, the time we met I had finished university and was unemployed with no real prospects and just living at home with my mom. We spoke on the phone 3-5 times a week for hours at a time and saw each other every couple of weeks (I was unemployed and she was at university).

Then I tried to turn my life around to impress her, ended up getting a grad job with an extremely prestigious firm to start September 2018 and got a retail job to work and earn money until that start date.

Then in August I get a call from my firm, asking me to start in a month instead of 2018... I initially turn it down because me and my girlfriend had made plans to spend the year together, go travelling etc and then see what place we were at together for me to move away in a year. but after talking to my mom etc I realised I had to take the job now.

After that she went on holiday with her family for a week and I went on holiday with my family for a week, our normal nightly chats didn’t happen for 2-3 weeks and one day when she is texting me the most blunt messages I basically tell her “I feel like we’ve been drifting apart recently, this feels more like friendship than an actual relationship and I’m moving away in a few weeks and I’m not really sure how I feel”.

So we chat on the phone and she says she’s sorry for making me feel that way, she was really anxious about me moving away and I’d just kind of ignored the whole situation instead of reassuring her, so after that message she thinks it’s best to end things now while the relationship is still fresh rather than let it get even deeper and hurt more. Because the last long distance relationship she had was with an emotionally abusive ex who used to stalk her etc.

At this point I’m second guessing myself and tell her we should give things a go and see how they work. She is adamant not to, she then brings up how she’s clinically depressed and I’ve been the only thing keeping her happy the past few months, she needs to learn how to deal with her emotions herself so she can be happy without using me as a crutch. I tell her I disagree and me making her happy isn’t a bad thing and forcing me away won’t help her(I’ve been depressed in the past but I’m in a good place currently, so I do know how she feels).

As we end the call she asks if we can still chat and be friends, I say no, it’s done and I never see the point in trying to be friends with someone you have feelings for, she was in tears and it was genuinely the most upset I’ve been in my life.

Ever since it ended I’ve not been able to do anything with another girl without thinking back to how much better it was.

Fast forward 4 months to last week. 

So I get a message “Hey, how are you doing? Are you ok?”. It’s off her.

We text back and forth a bit, she basically talks about how stressed she is doing her degree, how down she’s still been feeling. I’ll be honest the chat has been pretty boring. Sometimes she takes a day to reply to me. We spoke on the phone 2 days ago for 2 hours, just about random stuff like we used to, but it kind of felt off, like something was missing. During the chat I mentioned being free every weekend being a perk of my job, she then spoke about how even her weekends aren’t free because she has so much work to do and has an internship on top of uni - I felt this was a major indicator from her that she doesn’t want a relationship again, but I don’t know if she was just talking about how busy she is and I read too deep into things.

I just don’t know what step to take, I would personally like to try and start chatting again like we used to, but I don’t know how to bring it up. Especially after we spoke on the phone for 2 hours 2 days ago and literally haven’t messaged each other a word since. 

I just don’t know what she wants. Why would she message me after 4 months? My initial thought was she wants to see if chatting to me can cheer her up a bit because she’s in such a dark place, but why take this long to do it.

If I’m honest it’s thrown my head a bit, because I’ve started chatting to a girl I like where I currently am. But this has made me realise I don’t care about her compared to my ex... And if all she wants is to message me every few months to cheer herself up I’d rather just not talk at all.

TLDR; relationship ended because of moving away from home and ex having anxiety/depression and a bad history with long distance relationships. Messaged me after 4 months, miss her loads still even though the spark didn’t feel like it was the same after we chatted on the phone. Unsure of what to do because I don’t know what she wants and feel uncomfortable asking her because of her current depression"

A friend of mine asked me a while ago to make their old laptop run a bit better so I hooked them up with Lubuntu, a dear OS for me which gave a second chance for my much underpowered PC.

7n2bqh,11,2017-12-30,Me [26F] unsure if I should leave my [28M] husband of 3.5 years,NotaTherapist21,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7n2bqh/me_26f_unsure_if_i_should_leave_my_28m_husband_of/,"So, we've been together for 7 years total about 3 1/2 years married. I know what you're thinking, the 7 year itch. It's more than that. Also let me apologize in advance for the insane amount of text.

We got together when I was 19, I had thought he was cute, he had just broken up with a long term gf of 20 months. We moved quickly, I hadn't felt a connection like this in a while, and on the advice of a friend, I jumped and fell in deep. I was a virgin when we met, not for religious reasons, just for trust/personal issue reasons. And I slept with him about a month into our relationship. Shortly after this, I met his best friend, and his friend talked about they wanted to be neighbors as adults and have their kids grow up together. About 2 weeks after that conversation, I had a miscarriage, and freaked out, because I did not want kids, but I felt conflicted because I loved him, so I knew I could love it. It was weirdly devastating and we've never  spoken about it since.
We moved in together after 6 months, because I had to move and I found a really cheap place, and it would be cheaper if we moved in together. A month later we got a cat, 6 months after that we got another cat. Everything was going well, we had sex if not daily then at least 3-4x a week. We were happy, our roommates were great, school was going great. 

We took a vacation to go to a festival in another state about 8-10 hours away with some friends, and we drove all through the night, hadn't slept, chain smoked cigarettes and joints, and drank so many energy drinks. After our first day at the festival, he proposed, and we went to find food, and smoked a celebratory joint on the way: I had a psychotic break. Turns out I had undiagnosed Bipolar 2 and not sleeping/too many stimulants will cause some issues. Went back to the hotel, and I slept for 14 hours and still had a ring on my finger, go figure! Shortly after this, I found out that I couldn't have kids thanks to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. We got married in a beautiful ceremony about a 1.5 years later. 

During this time, we had done pretty well. We had our issues, but for the most part we could resolve them easily, or at least with respect.

After getting married, we moved into our first apartment where we lived alone. I still had undiagnosed Bipolar 2, and we were both in school, and working. My last semester ended up being hell for a multitude of reasons: undiagnosed, working 60-90 hours a week, going to school full time with an internship on top of that. Also I was having other health problems. My husband asked if I could go on birth control (previously we only used condoms), we're married, we're not having kids, it would be awesome. 

Due to a prior history of eating disorders I did some research on what could be the best birth control for me, and landed on the implant. Turns out this was a terrible idea. I bled for 3 months, and around October I got very suicidal, to the point that I attempted suicide. We also had numerous fights over the depression, and how I couldn't connect with him, physically or emotionally. At one point he suggested a divorce, or a break. I never asked him to be my caretaker during this time, and I said that the first year is the hardest, let's give it a shot.

I was finally able to get the implant out after having to wait 5 months, and having consistent nightly panic attacks for 2 hours. He couldn't touch me, I didn't want to have sex, I couldn't explain to him that there was nothing he could do for me at this point as I needed to just let the anxiety pass. That anxiety got better after removing the implant but I still had regular panic attacks that would last for hours. I went to my PCP, she prescribed me Zoloft which put me into full blown mania. He didn't understand, I stopped the meds, and continued with the panic attacks and not sleeping.

I finally found a job that had consistent hours and pay and insurance that covered mental health problems, was diagnosed and was able to start on medications. I got stable on them pretty quickly, and was prescribed Ativan for the anxiety and Lamotrigine for the Bipolar. I felt so much better.

Except he felt that I wasn't me anymore. That I was still not having sex with him, now because of the meds, and not because of the anxiety. He felt that I was a robot. As the Lamotrigine increased my need for the Ativan decreased, and I was able to stabilize my meds.

 I would talk to my therapist about my feelings, and what was happening, and she would say that I needed to leave him. That maybe him not being able to deal with my mental health struggles wasn't a good quality in a partner for someone who is going to continue to have problems and needs these meds to function. I'd talk to my psychiatrist who would tell me that between him and the therapist, they thought I was finally experiencing a full, normal, range of emotion instead of extremes. 

I started being able to advocate for myself and tell my husband when he hurt my feelings. If he made me cry or if I said I was feeling a little depressed ""Then why are you on meds if you're still going to feel like this?"" He would say to me, and I would explain that being sad or depressed isn't bad every once in a while, it's when it's pervasive and I'm suicidal that I need to be careful. 

He then got depressed, I couldn't say anything. If I tried, he'd snap, or he wouldn't talk to me. I asked him if we go to therapy. I told him that I wasn't  asking him to get on medications, just that I thought  he would benefit from talking to someone. Finally I made that an ultimatum, he never followed through and neither did I.

Then it got to the point where we started having fights over him helping with housework- I work 40 hours a week, doing emotionally draining work, at an office- he works 40 hours a week, paid less, for manual labor and no benefits. 

""I get it you're tired, but all I'm asking you to do is to take out the trash and clean the litter boxes consistently without me having to remind you."" I'd say to him. He would blow up, telling me that because I have an office job that my work isn't hard. I deal with people who are scared, disabled, and are unsure if they will be able to survive until next month, it's not physically demanding, but it can certainly zap me of wanting to do anything when I get home from work, because it's emotionally exhausting. He consistently gets mad that I have paid vacation, sick, and holidays. But he loves his job and doesn't want to leave. 

He will belittle me about random stuff, and it's gotten to the point where I don't want to talk to him because I'm unsure of how he will react. I'm not sleeping, I'm not eating, and I have panic attacks in regards to wanting to leave him, as I can't make up my mind. His brother suggested couple's counseling after hearing us have a particularly nasty fight, and then hearing how we no longer resolve our fights, we just sit in silence together, until someone can say something that doesn't sound shitty and it's never related to the fight. I called found a counselor who is a male that can get us in on the 18th, it's a late appointment, the man is only a counselor and can't prescribe medications. I figured that would work best for him, 2 hours later my husband texts me to cancel the appointment because he wants to start individual counseling. I told him that I was glad he wanted to do that, but that I wasn't cancelling the appointment until he could prove to me that he has an appointment with a therapist. His brother and my best friend both thought that was a reasonable request since he never followed through the last time. 

I love my husband but this has gotten ridiculous. It's been over 3 years since we have been able to feel happy. Or even look happy. We've been roommates who fuck occasionally, and every once in a while we agree on something. Our interests no longer line up, and we can't agree to have mutual hobbies. We often sit in silence in the living room, and I feel very tense, and we don't talk he plays a video game or we watch a tv show. And every once in a while, it's good, it's great, but for how long? That's what I ask myself, how long will this last before we're back to being our old selves, fighting, no resolution. I would ask for an open marriage so that I can get the emotional support I need and he can get the physical support that he wants, but I know that open relationships don't fix broken marriages.

TL;DR my life was great with my husband for a few years and now we are roommates who can't talk to each other, and are maybe better off away from each other "
7n2j94,56,2017-12-30,Break the Cog,Jraywang,jraywang,https://www.reddit.com/r/jraywang/comments/7n2j94/break_the_cog/,"**[WP] A super hero fights evil by wiping memories of both the villian and everyone who knew of them so that they can be reintroduced into society safely. Today, as you were combing through old newspapers, you discover that you were once the world's most powerful supervillain.**

---

Honor and justice were words for politicians. Eraser had always believed in a single driving force to his heroism and that was efficiency. If the name was catchier, he would’ve called himself Factory Man, instead, he took the name Eraser for his powers in wiping villain’s identities. He took not just their memories, but the memories of all who knew them, rendering them a completely blank slate. Albeit a powerful one. 

What the world did with those people after he wiped their memories, he could care less. Hot-faced politicians screamed about retribution. Make those bastards pay for what they took ten times over. Stern-voiced suits talked of rehabilitation. People couldn’t be punished for a crime they no longer remembered.

In the end, America settled on the Reawakening Program, a half-assed rehabilitation center with nightmare conditions. Neither side won and nobody was happy. Though, that was the beauty of democracy.

Eraser had his own condo on Lazarus Island, the host of the Reawakening Program. Five days out of the week except for holidays and paid time off, the government stocked him here. Long ago, all the great supervillains had been erased and reawakened. Now, only the small fish remained and there were other heroes far more suited to handling those.

The doorbell rang and Eraser sighed. He hadn’t even finished his morning coffee yet.

“Mr. Eraser,” came Sarah’s voice. She was an intern fresh from college and still treated him with something resembling politeness. “We have the first batch ready.”

If the name was catchier, he was sure the government would have also call him Factory Man, due to how he was simply a cog in the reawakening process.

“Sir?” she asked when he gave no reply. “Would you like me to come back another time?”

He flipped through old newspapers. He had requested it to read stories about himself. It was pathetic really, but not as pathetic as the current state of affairs. The world’s greatest hero now working on some memory altering production line.

“No, no,” he said. “I’ll be ready.”

“Would you like the profiles? We have a mix of villains today, ranging from unpermitted protests to small theft to even—”

“No,” he said, cutting her off. It didn’t matter who the villains were. There was a system for vetting them and he trusted in it. It wasn’t his job anymore to pass judgment, not for Factory Man.

“Okay,” Sarah said, “Should I… wait here?”

“I can find my own way.”

“Sure.” But she stayed at the door. He could hear how hard she was breathing. “Sir?”

“What?” he spat. Patience was a virtue for the young. The old didn’t have enough time for it.

A newspaper clipping slid under the door. Curious, Eraser took it and scanned the headlines. The Great Reset, it read, with a giant picture of a younger him. His brow furrowed, staring at the picture. His cheeks were tighter, his eyes sharper, and his hair a burning red. He didn’t remember a time before his beer belly and faded eyes, yet here he was, chiseled.

“You reset the world,” Sarah said. “At least, you tried to. You saw that it wasn’t right. Violence, hate, war, disease, inequality, the world needed a fresh start. You even reset yourself.”

He only half-heard her words, his eyes were too busy flitting across the newspaper article. It called him the Soul Eater for leaving people empty after their battles. His heart skipped and his tongue curled around those words in familiarity. Soul Eater.

“But a few people escaped,” she continued. “And with the world a blank slate, they did with it as they pleased. It’s even worse than before. It’s all wrong.”

“So… you were one of those people that escaped?”

The door opened and Sarah stood in front of it, lockpick in hand. She looked like Soul Eater from the newspaper clippings, her eyes just as sharp, and her hair just as bright.

“Of course,” she said. “Because I inherited your powers.”"
7n2qv1,2,2017-12-30,Beauty is Only skin deep- Chapters 1 to 3,Anthonybrose,u_Anthonybrose,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Anthonybrose/comments/7n2qv1/beauty_is_only_skin_deep_chapters_1_to_3/,"chapter 1- See no evil

My name is Emma. From the day I was born, I have been considered a freak. This is not due to the way I look, which is kind of ironic for me, but the way I see other people.

Imagine seeing people for the way they really are. Yes they might look beautiful, but what if you can see their inner beauty. Or on the flip side, their inner ugliness. 

When I was born, my parents were told that I had the inability to see. They were devastated, I was in fact blind for the first few months of my life. There was a miracle however and what was once only darkness, became blurry images. The blurry images soon started to take shape and I was able to see perfectly. 

The doctors did many tests on my eyes, trying to determine how this was possible. But were unable to come to a scientific conclusion.

I used to love being in my dads arms. He would bounce me around in his lap, we would laugh together. from what my mom had told me we were inseparable. 

My mom then said when I finally was able to see, I would want nothing to do with my father. Every time he would try to pick me up I would cry, and wouldn't stop until my mom, Jamie would pick me up. As soon as she did, I would stop crying instantly. This made my father resent myself and my mother. He couldn't understand why I couldn't even look at him any more. 

As my awareness and understanding grew, I came to realize that when I saw my father, he looked like an ugly monster. He was missing teeth, he had hideous moles all over his body, his clothes were old and ripped.

As for my mother, she was the most beautiful most caring person in the world. She was one of the types of people who would light up the room when she walked into it. She had beautiful long blonde hair, blue eyes, 5 foot 8 inches tall. Her body was immaculate with no blemishes. She was the picture of beauty.

What I could not understand however was everyone treated my mom like she was the ugly one, while people treated my father like he was handsome not hideous. 

Although the ugly people usually hung out with my father, while the most beautiful people would be around my mother. The strange thing was, the ugly ones got more attention and money. 

My life changed when I turned 7. Like every other day, I heard my father arguing with my mother. I often found my mother the next morning with bruises covering her body. As the years had passed my fathers body had deteriorated to the point where he looked like a complete monster. I couldn't even look at him without having the urge to vomit. 

Ben: Who said you could go out with your friends! i told you to never leave this house without my permission!

Jamie: My... My friends husband just left her, she needed support, I... I couldn't leave her alone like that. 

As the discussion went on, I cracked open the door to their room, what I saw amazed and completely horrified me. The room was completely falling apart. Paint was peeling off the walls, darkness seemed to permeate off of my father. 

My mother permeated a small light off of her, which was growing smaller and smaller the angrier my father got. 

My mom was cowering in fear at this point. My father had a kitchen knife in his hand, he was gripping it so tightly that his hand was turning white. 

Ben: you have ignored my threats for the final time. 

He the knife and thrust it into her stomach. He pulled it out and stabbed her over and over again. The light the my mother had shawn slowly disappeared until nothing remained but darkness. The only thing I could see where his glowing red eyes. I screamed in terror, and his eyes turned in my direction. It looked like horns were growing out of his head now. 

I ran away from him, from the room. I ran into the hall and down the stairs. I could hear thundering footsteps behind me, as I reached the front door I opened it and was ready to run outside, but i felt a cold clawed hand grab my shoulder and pull me back. My skin burnedunder his touch. 

My own light flickering as fear over took me. My father turned me around, his fiery eyes boring into my soul. I felt like my life was over, like all that was good about the world was gone. I closed my eyes and cried. My father put his hands on my shirt and ripped it open. His claws raking against my skin. I screamed in pain, I knew what he wanted to do, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. 

I thought of my mom, her kind and caring nature. Her warmth, always making all my fears float away. She always told me to stand up to bullies, to be strong in the face of evil. 

I could feel her love for me permeating through me. I suddenly felt power and hope flow through me. My light growing stronger and brighter, until my house shawn like a beautiful mansion. My fathers eyes widened, now in fear and terror. He screamed a guttural scream. His grip loosened off of me as he fell to his knees. I opened the door once again and ran outside.

The police were called to my house, and found my father with a knife in his heart. My mother was in her bedroom with 8 knife wounds. 

20 years later.

Chuck: Hey Emma, you caught another murderer in record time! I don't know how you do it. Where everyone else has failed to find the murderer, you have no problem catching the perp.

Emma: I'm just lucky I guess

I shrugged at him and smiled. I realized after what happened to my mom and dad, that I am able to see people for who they really are. The better the person is, the more beautiful they are. The worse they are, the more hideous they become. 

This is why I became a detective, to get rid of those who want to hurt others.

Chapter 2

Hear no evil

There is a quote ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil."" 

Now you may think that being able to hear peoples true thoughts, the ones they keep inside their heads would be a gift. You would be able to know what people are thinking and feeling without them saying a word to you. I have the ability to know exactly who a person is just by listening to their thoughts.

My name is David and i just turned 27 years old. I am what the experts call a mind reader, or an empath. I am able to know what other people are thinking without actually hearing them speak. 

This ability really came in handy, mainly because I am deaf. I was born with the inability to hear. As far as I knew I was the only one in the world with such a unique ability. 

I quickly learned sign language, I was eventually able to speak, which baffled doctors, since I have never heard a voice in my entire life. Or so they thought. 

Since I was able to hear words and phrases in my head, I was able to pick up not only English, but French as well. I became fluent in both languages. 

My life took a turn for the worse when I turned 7 years old. My parents marriage was on the rocks, I didn't see my father much, because he was always on business trips. Recently I've been hearing from my mother that she believes my dad was cheating on her with the intern from his work.

It all came to a head on my 7th birthday. I invited a few friends over. Only one showed up for it; the one person that did was my next door neighbour, Emma. I said that I thought I was the only one with unique abilities. That is until I met Emma

 Where I was able to hear what people were thinking, Emma was able to see their true self. I remember we became instant friends from the time we were little, Our parents were close friends already and soon Emma and I became inseparable. 

When I became aware of my abilities, I was confused by what I could hear from Emma. When she looked at me, she saw this really cute boy. At the time I was confused as to why she would be thinking of some other boy when she saw me. I came to realize that this boy seemed to look alot like myself, but all my blemishes were not there. 

On my 7th birthday, my father was there. This had been one of the rare occasions I had seen him. This was also the first time Emma was in the same room as him. Emma and I looked at each other with dread on our faces. From what I saw from my father, he was indeed cheating on my mom with another woman. From what Emma had told me about her abilities and they way she looked now. I could only fathom what my father looked like to her.

Everything was going ok at first. Like always however, my mom and dad got into a heated argument. 

I wanted to confront my dad, ask him why he was cheating on my mom, but was too afraid. By this point I had finished opening my presents and finished my cake as well. Emma and I were playing with my legos when my dad burst into the house. That was when my mom and dad got into a fight. 

My mom was a strong woman, but when my father continued to deny about the affair, she screamed at him to get out of her house. She had tears in her eyes as she yelled. 

I could hear my fathers thoughts racing through my head. He wasn't happy, he couldn't stand being interrogated like this anymore. He stomped up stairs and a half an hour later came back down with a giant suitcase.

I am unsure of what they said, from what I gathered from both of their minds was that they wanted a divorce. After a few more minutes of arguing, my dad left the house in a rage. I looked at my mother and saw that she was balling her eyes out. 

David: it's going to be okay mom. 

I said as I walked over to her and hugged her. We hugged each other for a couple of minutes. When we let go of each other; she walked over to the kitchen and called Jamie, Emma's mother. 

I walked back over to Emma and saw the shear horror in her eyes. When I read her mind, I could see her thinking of my father...  I think it was my father, but what I saw was a monster. This really frightened me as well.

Emma's mother showed up at my house 10 minutes later.  She had brought cookies and the two moms spent hours talking to each other. Emma and I continued to play until 8 pm. 

I could hear shear fear in Emma's moms mind. Soon after she rushed into my room and told Emma that they needed to leave right away. 

They both left without much explanation and I didnt hear anything from Emma until the next day. 

The door bell rang at 8am the next morning. It was Saturday, and I was hoping it was Emma. I opened the front door and paused in shock. In front of me stood Emma, but with her shirt ripped open. I saw what looked like claw marks on her shoulder. I read her mind and what I saw, shook me to my core. 

The massacre her father had made of Jamie. I knew her father was an asshole, but I didn't realize how bad it was.

David: MOM! EMMA NEEDS HELP!

I yelled, Sherry, my mom, came rushing into the front hall, when she saw Emma's state, she called 911.

When the cops showed up to Emma's home. They found a trail of blood leading from the front door to the living room. The found Ben face down, his chest slightly off of the ground. When the medical examiner came, they found the same butcher knife that had been used to kill her mother, speared into Bens chest. 

There was 5 words written in blood, his hand laying right beside it. It read

-She made me do it!-

20 years later. 

I was a lawyer now. Able to mask my disability without anyone noticing anything too odd. A case came to my desk. The arresting detective was no other than Emma Rafferty. However, unlike her other cases, this one shook me to my core.

Chapter 3 

Speak no evil

My name is Bill, When I was a young man at the age of 20 years old, I was a sperm donor. I only did it twice and after that I had found a job that paid pretty well. I was able to live on the salary I was given pretty comfortably. By the time I was 27 I was a manager at Nortel. 

When I was 7 years old, my parents were concerned about my social skills, and were willing to try anything to fix my social anxiety problem. Nothing worked until my parents heard about an experimental drug. It was in a shady part of town, and the doctor who had given them the medication, seemed to be cooking meth on the side. My parents were desperate however, and that night I was given my first dose of the medication. 

After a week of taking it. I found it easier to talk to people and after a month, I was able to talk to anyone with no problem. After I had finished the bottle of medication, my parents went back, but the doctor was no longer there; he just disappeared. Fortunately for me, the effects seemed to be permanent and I continued to excel at life.

It was around this time that I found out about by my abilities. I realized that I was able to tell someone to do something, and the person had to do it, no matter how absured it was. 

I became curious about one of the coworkers one day when I saw him take interest in the new intern working under me. Even though he was married; I wanted to know more. So I asked him questions about his family.

I was surprised to learn that he was married and had a 6 year old son. He informed me that his son also had some supernatural abilities, he had the abity to read peoples minds and knew what you were thinking. Even more curious. I found out that his next door neighbour had a 6 year old daughter. She had the ability to see a person who they truly were just by looking at them.

This made me truly curious, here were two neighbours who had children of the same age with special abilities. After probing further, I found out that both he and Ron were unable to have children. Ben and Ron had met at the fertility clinic with their wives and the four of them became friends. Their wives both got pregnant a week apart. 

They decided to buy houses right beside each other. Everything was going good, until David was born 1 month premature. He turned out to be deaf, the doctors speculated that the premature birth had something to do about it. 28 days later Emma was born blind. After probing Ron more about this, he said that after a few months, Emma miraculously got her sight. 

At this point I wanted to do an experiment with him.

Bill: You will start flirting with the new intern Brittany, this flirting will turn into dating and eventually turn to sex. 

Ron’s expression became expressionless for a second, my orders taking root in his head. 

Ron: will do boss; I will get that project done for you in a month. 

After talking to Bill, I walked over to Brittany. We started off with a little small talk before planting an idea in her head. She was only 5 foot tall, with long brown hair and auburn eyes. Even though she was petite, she had an ample bosom.

Bill: Brittany, Ron is going to start hitting on you. You will now think he is the hottest guy you have ever met. You will develop a relationship with him.

Brittany’s expression became blank for a second. Once she got her wits about her again, Her demeanor changed. She walked over to Ron, and the two of them started to flirt with each other.

When the day finally came for Ron’s sons birthday, I walked up to him once again.

Bill: today you will get angry with your wife, it will make you pack up your bag and leave. You will then move in with Brittany and continue your life with her.

Ron smiled and walked away, I next walked over to Brittany and did the same to her.

Bill: Ron will show up to your house today, and the two of you will move in together. You will eventually start a family of your own.

Brittany smiled as well and walked away. The next couple of days were a blur. Everything seemed to be going according to plan. That was until I found out about Ben and his wife Jamie. How they had met such an unfortunate end. To my relief however, Emma seemed to be perfectly fine.

Emma was to be left with Sherry and David, according to Jamie and Bens will. Emma and David then became brother and sister and they grew up to be a happy family  

With my help behind the scenes, Emma and David got into the best schools. Both of them becoming a successful as a detective and Lawyer. They were my children after all, they only deserved the best. 

20 years later

I decided to see how good they were with their abilities. I had still been in touch with Bill, who now had 2 children with his wife Brittany; he was now 42 years old. We were at the king’s head pub, catching up on what’s been going on with our lives when I decided to implant another idea. 

Bill: I want you to track down your ex wife. I want you to make her pay for kicking you out of your house 20 years ago. After you are done, I want you to leave absolutely no trace you were there. Then you will go home and make love to your wife. You will tell her that the two of you had been shopping for Christmas presents all day. Once you come back home, you will forget everything you have done since the time you woke up. You will actually believe you spent the entire day with your wife. You will also completely forget about me, or that you even knew me. For all you know, I  was your boss 20 years ago, and we had no friendship.

Ron’s expression went blank and a second later he smiled and finished his beer. We talked for another hour before we parted ways.

Two days later, I saw the story on the front page of the Winnipeg free press. 

Single mother of two found brutally murdered in her own home.

Police were called to the residence of Sherry Foster on Wednesday. Police found Sherry at her dining room table with 20 stab wounds to her body. There had been no signs of forced entry, and the murder occurred some time between 8pm Monday and 6am Tuesday. Police are asking the public for any information that would be helpful to their investigation. Please call the hotline at 1-204-xxx-xxxx

An evil smirk came to my face. I Couldn’t wait to see what was going to happen next.

7n3jkh,1,2017-12-30,F4M - Gangbang the boss,millirette,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7n3jkh/f4m_gangbang_the_boss/,"Kinks: ENF, public humiliation, gangbang/DP, forced lesbianism, BBC, forced orgasm, non-con

Limits: animals, scat, major violence

As a CEO at just 30, I should be one of the most admired women in the industry. But my unapologetic arrogance and belittling attitude to others around me has instead made one of the most despised. My employees hate me, my rivals hate me - and I relish the fact.

I take delight in criticising and insulting my 'underlings', but from time to time I pick a particular employee to single out with particular cruelty. Currently it is a young female intern who we have been assigned as receptionist. Since she started a week ago, I have taken considerable pride in making her leave in tears three times.

Unfortunately, one of my employees has some very sinister contacts. They make contact with a local gang, who in return for the royalties they will get in selling footage of what they plan on doing, agree to break into the office after everyone else has left, kidnap me, and take me to their warehouse.

There, they will break my arrogance and defiance completely. I will be stripped, slapped, mocked, belittled, and subjected to a night of unspeakable sexual humiliation at the hands of multiple powerful, hung, black men. Deepthroat, double penetration, forced orgasms - and all of it on camera.

The only slight hitch with the plan is that when they arrive, my receptionist is there too. So they kidnap her too, and I have to share my humiliation with her...

While I am interested in forced lesbianism, the focus will still mostly be on me.

If this would interest you, and if you can **write long, detailed responses without narrating my character's actions**, please please respond! I would prefer to set the roleplay up first rather than just jumping straight in.

I have been working on learning the mix process for a while now, and am finally reaching the point where I don't think I'd be dead weight in a studio. I live in a city and have a list of studios near me and would like to see what I can do about landing a studio internship in order to gain more professional experience with music production.

I was hoping someone here might be able to share some experience they have about getting your foot in the door at one. I want to ask a lot of questions but I feel like there are so many unknown unknowns that I don't know where to start.

My plan right now would be to email studios and ask people for coffee just to pick their brains and see what places near me would want. if you work in a studio, do you think that would be an effective way of networking/relationship building? Or would such a message just end up getting deleted?

Would love to hear what people have to say on this!"

I fit all their criteria for the job, and I was emailed for an interview in January.

3.75gpa, on top of being a CrewChief responsible for teams, and aircrafts in the USAF, 2 deployments, I have held 2 managerial positions after the military. I was general manager for 2 restaurants, and I was also the director of production (on top of many other positions) for a beverage company (CEO). Both positions I had the power to hire and fire employees.

Based on these facts, how would you think my interview would go? I know the position is more office and paperwork oriented, but I have done my share of office and paperwork duties in the Air Force and in my civilian jobs, so I know I can provide adequate information relating to how I would qualify.

Maybe I’m just overthinking this, I’ve never held a federal job before, and it’s been a long time since I’ve had to interview. Since it is an “internship” would the interview be incredibly detailed?

Thanks in advance."

For M: Looking for ""Straight"" Guys Who Love Big Cock.",out_and_kinda_about,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7n4lhf/21_m4a_for_f_older_femaleyounger_male_buying_your/,"Working on a few new prompts. These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:

____________________________________________________________________

For F: This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)

My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).

_______________________________________________________________

For F:
I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.

Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...

Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.

_____________________________________________________________

For F:

I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.

For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.

Let's talk and see what we come up with.

____________________________________________________________

For F:

This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.

I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day. 

Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me.

Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. 

Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.

_____________________________________________________________

For F: A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.

___________________________________________________________

For M: I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.

Here are the things I am into: 

Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.

You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

My grandparents have decided to take money out of their retirement account to pay for the tuition of the internship, which is a HUGE blessing. I'm also very lucky to not have any undergraduate loans. 

However, how do I pay for living expenses and such while doing the internship? 

My parents have offered to loan me money, but I already have a toxic relationship with them, and I feel like borrowing money would further destroy my family. 

Another option is for me to apply only for internships close to home (there are two within 30 minutes of where I live now, but one is a VA hospital, so I don't think I'll get into that one. The other one I stand a chance with) and let my long term boyfriend pay my bills for the entirety of the internship. However, things have been rocky with him lately, so I'm nervous about pinning my finances on him right now. 

Third option is to simply take out loans to fund my food, housing, bills. 

Any advice for me? How did you afford to live?"

Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

7n5g8l,1,2017-12-30,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7n5g8l/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

That is a good win, and the template for how the Pistons will need to play to get wins until Jackson returns. First and most important is playing great defense, which the Pistons absolutely did, no matter what sort of noise is around it if you only allow 79 points you played some defense. Secondly, hope that Ish Smith can have at least one stretch of the game where he gets to run and become a transition terror. Third, give Tobias Harris the ball plenty and hope that he makes some tough plays (tonight often with his passing!!!). Lastly, and the most important guy, is for Andre Drummond to continue to be a grown man on the floor who holds everything together on both ends. It won't usually work this well, and it will never be pretty, but this is how the Pistons need to play to keep themselves afloat.

'

**Ish Smith:**

So far, so good for Ish Smith in his intern as the starter. He continues to pile on points with decent efficiency (especially by his standards) with 18 points on 18 equivalents with 4 assists against just 1 turnover in 30 minutes of play. One nice thing to see was that he got 6 free throw attempts which is generally a gaping hole in his game. Smith hit just enough shots in the half-court to come close to a net-neutral in that area, and had one stretch where the Spurs had a lapse in concentration which allowed him to get out and run early in the game that gave the Pistons some breathing room that they would never relinquish.

Once again, it isn't going to be pretty, there were a couple of possessions where a flurry of ball movement found an open shooter only for it to be for naught as the open shooter was Ish, but if he keeps hitting shots at a fairly acceptable rate they can work with it. It should be mentioned how nice it is to have a guy like Ish who even though he is lacking in many areas, you know that he is at least good enough to not ruin it as the starter.

'

**Reggie Bullock:**

I TOLD YOU HE WAS GOOD. I ALWAYS KNEW IT. Seriously, I figured that Bullock would go to the Spurs this offseason, and Pop would eventually unleash him as the awesome complimentary role player that he has shown flashes of. To everyones surprise he ended up sticking around, and now the Pistons are unleashing him as that player. Bullock scored 22 points on just 14 shots and I don't think a single shot he took was forced, he plays the absolute right way. Also, judging by the pull up three he hit in the opening moments of the game, he has really gotten confidence in his shot which is great to see. In the end though, we all kind of knew that Bullock could play offense if he ever got the chance, the real surprise has been on the other end.

I know that Kawhi Leonard is not all the way back yet, and he hasn't exactly gone through a murders row. But since Avery Bradley has been out while Bullock is starting, Bullock has been the primary defender on Victor Oladipo twice, and got Kawhi Leonard tonight (while Tobias Harris mainly went with Danny Green which was goofy and actually pretty effective) and he is 3 for 3 in doing a really good job on talented offensive players. Bullock has always played hard defensively which is obviously half the battle, but he has really gotten visibly stronger and smarter with the way he plays. If he keeps playing defense like this then he could end up being an absolute steal at his price tag and be a borderline savior for this Pistons team.

'

'

**Tobias Harris:**

12 points on 14 equivalents with 6 rebounds and 5 assists against 2 turnovers in 35 minutes of play is nothing to laugh at when you remember that he was being guarded by Kawhi Leonard for most of the night. Kawhi obviously made it very difficult for Harris to get clean looks for most of the night, but he found a few spots and hit them, and played a very unselfish game. Tobias will never be a good passer, but I'm starting to gain some hope that he may be taking the first steps towards being a serviceable one. He has absolutely gained confidence in hitting Drummond with lobs lately and he is looking for it more, and is generally more comfortable making passes on the move instead of outright resets. These are not big things, but it is big for Tobias. His passing has been a detriment to his game in a similar way to free throws for Drummond. Even though it is just one thing, it is such a glaring weakness that teams can zero in on it to really take him out of games, the Sixers did this most effectively of anyone in their first meeting this year by throwing hard double teams at Harris every possessions and letting him throw slow passes out to the perimeter which gave them plenty of time to make rotations back into place. Even if it is simply improving to serviceable, it would be big for Harris' offensive game.

On the defensive end he played better than the last game as well, as he spent a lot of the night guarding Danny Green which although not an especially challenging assignment, it is not very often that Tobias, who is a power forward nearly full time these days, is guarding a shooting guard so credit where credit is due there.

'

'

**Anthony Tolliver:**

He laid an egg on offense again as he scored 1 point on 5 equivalents by going 0-4 from the field with 7 rebounds and a single assist in 27 minutes of play. HOWEVA, he started tonight to guard LaMarcus Aldridge, and he was able to replicate his defensive domination of Aldridge once again. Aldridge finished the night with 15 points on 17 eqiuvalents with just 1 assist in 33 minutes of play, and most of his points were on put backs and plays where Tolly was elsewhere. The only area that Tolly struggled with was keeping Aldridge off the glass when Drummond was pulled out of the paint by Gasol. Obviously he needs to start hitting some shots again, but when he can lock down as talented a scorer as Aldridge he more than makes up for an off night shooting.

'

'

**Andre Drummond:**

It's funny because it is almost commonplace, which is the best sign that Drummond has made a major step towards being a legit franchise player. 14 points on 13 equivalents, 21 rebounds, 6 assists (no turnovers), 3 steals, and a +16 in 38 minutes of play for Drummond. Drummond was, almost quietly, the best player on the floor the entire night by dominating the glass, and owning the paint. The only nitpick with his night is that there were a few possessions where he was too willing to just sort of loiter around the perimeter on defense, which is not a huge deal because he is right to be wary of Gasol and Aldridge's shooting, but he was not always quite as active in staying engaged as you would like.

Other than that he was brilliant, he made some good plays, while at the same time doing all of the little things that help you win basketball games. Given Embiid's internet popularity it will be difficult for Drummond to be a starter, but my guess is that if the coaches were choosing he would be starting at center for the East, because he has been the best center.

'

'

**Luke Kennard:**

Kennard has been remarkably poised and confident for most of the year considering that he is a 21 year old rookie trying hard to carve out a role on a winning team that will not give him unearned minutes. It is a cliché but he has not looked much like a rookie most of the year. Last game against the Magic was the exception as he put in probably his worst game as a pro. He bounced back tonight by playing probably his best game as a pro, putting up 20 points on 13 equivalents (4-5 from deep) with an assist and 3 steals in 30 minutes. His +19 on the night was only topped by Tobias Harris' +20 as well. He was poised and looked back like his normal self which is great given that it is never a sure thing that rookies will bounce back after bad games. The shooting that the Pistons wanted so badly was well on display as several of his shots were tough pull-up looks with defenders in his grill, and he continues to impress with his defensive awareness. Great game from Kennard.

'

'

**Dwight Buycks:**

Buycks got his first real action as a Piston tonight as he got the normal backup point guard duties and he looked mostly competent, which given that he is a guy on a two way contract who is only being pressed into service due to injuries is perfectly acceptable. In 18 minutes he scored 4 points on 5 shots and had 3 assists with 3 turnovers. He did a fine job of getting the ball up the court and initiating the offense, and he looked fairly confident in trying to make some plays by driving into the paint. Buycks looked great with the Drive, but that is never a for sure thing to translate, and I don't know how Buycks will do if he continues to get minutes. The offense was not good at times while he was out there, but it also looked pretty good on some possessions and he really competes on defense. If he ends up being a serviceable player while Jackson is out then he would join Moreland as a nice feather in SVG and the front office's cap as bargain bin finds that end up contributing this year.

'

'

**Langston Galloway:**

Put back into his normal role of being an off the bench chucker didn't seem to help his shot. He went 0-4 from the field and didn't do anything of note in his 16 minutes. I'm not worried because profesional shooters off the bench always have ups and downs, but if he could get back on an up that would be very helpful.

'

'

**Eric Moreland:**

Got the backup minutes in the second half and seemed to do fine. He had 2 rebounds in 4 minutes of play.

'

'

**Boban:**

Got the backup minutes in the first half. Got a bucket on 2 attempts and drew a non-shooting foul in 4 minutes. Nice to see him get on the floor in meaningful minutes, and although I'm not sure exactly what the matchups were that caused SVG to want Boban in the first half and Moreland in the second, I'm all in favor of trying to work Boban in even if it is just for a single 4 minute stretch like that.

'

'

**Montero/Ellenson:**

Played a minutes of garbage time. They didn't do anything.

'

'

**General:**

This is the best version of it, but this is how the Pistons need to play to win until Jackson comes back. And if you want to go back the last couple of weeks with Bradley out and swapping the starting lineup up, and also remember that a summer league pickup has been the backup center for a long time now, if the Pistons continue to stay afloat while shorthanded it will look better and better for SVG and the job he is doing as coach this year. It also will continue to make Andre Drummond more and more impressive as he holds together a roster that is almost crumbling around him. With good teams, real good teams, as long as your star is around you should be able to keep things together behind your star and good coaching and the Pistons have done that. Hopefully they can keep it up.

'

'

**Important life announcement:**

I'm going to be in Detroit next weekend and going to the LCA for the first time! Me and a buddy will be in town all weekend, going to the Red Wings game on Friday and the Pistons game on Saturday. Last time I got to see a few of you there and I hope I can again this year!

What do you think? Can Buycks last as the backup? Can Drummond hold this together?"
7n6s6j,3,2017-12-31,Don’t know how i feel.. (long),wubbbalubbadubdubb,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/7n6s6j/dont_know_how_i_feel_long/,"I don’t really know how this works but i’ll start by giving background info. 

I’m 17, i’m a senior in high school and have finished my college applications. As a freshman when I first started smoking, weed was amazing. Long days at the park rolling up js with my bros after traveling to get “the best weed around”. We skated, biked, and walked everywhere stoned as we casually enjoyed life around our small town along with our occasional adventures to San Francisco. 

Many of my original stoner friends left due to family moving, or they just moved on to harder things and different people. Although I never reflected upon this until now as i write it out, it’s very sad, as one of my closest friends started hanging around thugs, and another is in a horrible position, as he moved and is a loner plus his older brother died in a biking accident a week after his suicide attempt. 

Over the blissful years of chiefin fat at the park and wherever, it became a normal thing. I started selling tree as a way to fund our daily smoke. I stopped selling, as I ended up consuming more than i would profit. 

I don’t know when things changed, maybe it was when everyone got their drivers license. All we do nowadays is smoke, sit in a car, and vape. Every single fucking day. 

One of my close friends got his med card 7 months ago and I have moved onto potent cartridges- i would dab all fucking day(at school, my paid internship, and wherever else i could) from morning to late night. But every time i took a hit, i just felt guilty. 

There’s no reason for me to be guilty right? 

Not to sound narcissistic but, I’m super athletic (pretty fuckin yolked), i’m not retarded (I took many advanced placement classes), i have a loving girlfriend, and I may hopefully have a future at a four year college as an engineer pretty soon. I am nothing like what stoners ‘should’ be like. I’m social, I don’t get anxiety, and I don’t see why I can’t be high 24/7. 

But every time before I dab, I just get a feeling of guilt. I don’t wanna do this shit anymore. But after that 10 second dab, i forget all about it, have a great time playing CoD after going 22-0 multiple times and I just sit in my bed listening to the same fucking playlist. 

I’m currently on a family vacation, where I didn’t bring along my cartridge and am 7 days sober. I want to stop my daily consumption as weed no longer has that ‘freshman feel’ to it anymore. However as i am soon returning and have a shit ton of weed and wax left, I feel like i am going to fall into the same cycle again. Soon, My friends and I are going up to the mountains where we traditionally get crossed af and snowboard, but I feel great and I don’t want to relapse. We will be drinking and smoking afterwards as we rented a cabin and are just going to play in the snow (it’s very special to us as we don’t have snow)  but I don’t know if i can say no. 

Being high all the time is amazing, but it got old. I don’t have a current urge to get lit af but I can’t help but think that once i get home all im going to do is fall back into the cycle. 

Exercise has not been a great way to get me out, as I lift and get baked af afterwards. I have planned to apply to Lululemon, and start working to keep myself busy, but I was able to get through school baked af, and I feel like weedbrain will think the same about my job as well. 

I love weed man it’s so cool, but i don’t know if i want to go back. It’s culturally embedded into my friends traditions and I really don’t know what to do. I know a lot of people have it worse than me and I may just be overthinking, but I need advice and any voice can help.

A moment later, Vacant sits down next to him. Both take a second to catch their breath before Susie places a bag of Taco bell between them, JJ pulling out a burrito and starting to unwrap it

Slowbro: Holy fuck this is just what I needed......

Vacant gives a nod, looking out to the crowd of interns of Ricky, Bobby and a few others are standing around acting as a small crowd for the two

Vacant: We will keep this short, because my best friend here has to beat the shit out of Pruef later tonight so we don't have a lot of time before we have to go celebrate. So let's make one thing clear, this was the biggest title match in LLR history, the road to Vacancy has started and no one will stop us. We showed everyone that everything we say? Every promo we cut? We back it up. There is no one that can stand up to the best in the world and the greatest of all time, simple as that.

Slowbro: I also want to say, we told you, we are the BOAT and the GOAT. We told you going into this match we were going to be the tag champ...and we shut up every single idiot in the back who goes on and on about how we are washed up or that we can only cut promos. FIRST TRIPLE CROWN CHAMPION BAY BAY. Now what? Well, were going into WK....and were going to put an end to Evolution and the Advantage for good? And who is going to help me erase those two horrible mistakes of mine?

Slowbro wraps an arm around Vacant

Slowbro: My best fucking friend.

Vacant: Then? Were going to win our matches at Wrestle Kingdom....JJ is going to be a world champ and Ill be going to the Rumble. Church? Throdis? Zing? Whoever wants to bitch and moan about how we got robbed out of our qualifying spots can bitch and moan all they like. The End Game is going into the Rumble and we are winning, no matter what management says. We are going to main event Wrestlemania, and there is nothing anyone can do to stop us.

Slowbro: This is our show now, we are the bosses of LLR. We put Church in the ground, we are tearing this corrupt machine down. Stand with us or get out of our way."

Who did he grab by the pussy?  He was talking shit to some guys saying that groupies let him do this.  Compare that to say Bill Clinton shoving a cigar up the vagina of an intern in the oval office and having Hillary lead his public defense.  Also Bernie and Obama were both congressmen at the time, do you think they denounced Bill or stood by him like Hillary?  it sounds like YOU are the one that supports con men and sexual predators.  Would you like to discuss Joe Biden?

John and I are very close despite our age gap, mostly because even after I finished college and started working, my profession didn't take me away from our hometown and until I started dating seriously, I spent all my evenings at my parents'. 

John and I text everyday and I had known of this girl since he started to fancy her and I actually approved of this. John is a college professor in a big city, and he met Emily when she was his student. Honestly, yes, at first I was hesitant to let that slide. But apparently, they had zero contact out of class until the semester ended. They started talking because she got into an internship under the wing of another professor John worked for, and the rest is history.

I approved of their relationship because I think John is one of the kindest, most respectable people I've ever met, and because of the circumstances. Truth be told, before he left for the big city for college, he became a key element in our community because he'd always be helping people with something. Keep in mind it is a very small place with many rural dwellings, ours stood up as being particularly wealthy. Whether it was helping with the building of a house, collecting good clothes for the shelter or organizing stuff at the nursing home, he always kept his hands busy, something he definitely took from our mother. After he left, I literally can't spend a day without someone asking me about him.

Now, to the circumstances. I believe that age differences on adults matter when people have completely different lives and mindsets. In this case, Emily also wants to become a teacher. Given the importance of their university, people that want to become teachers start doing so by being part of a formative program during their last year, which would be next for Emily, and after that then she might become coworkers with John. Also, from what I've seen on facebook and John, Emily's parents greatly approve of him. 

Now, to the issue. John invited Emily to spend Christmas here at our parents'. At the dinner, it was our parents (60s M,F), our grandmother (70's), my wife Grace (35F), our daughter (9F) and our son (6M).  

When I told Grace of John and Emily, she completely flipped out. She's 100% against relationships with big gaps of age, mostly because she comes from another country in West Europe. Her face when I told her my mom had me when she was 20, and consequently, my grandmother had my mother when she was 15, was out of this world. Before you start asking, none of them was a victim of abuse nor an accident; it's just the way it is in this small town or in non-urbanized regions of our country. And it kind of still is today, girls who do not go to college start marrying when they are around 20 around here. 

I thought she'd let it go eventually, but it only worsened during Christmas. Keep in mind that Grace was also super friendly with John; she always invites him over and has repeatedly introduced him to many of her female friends. But the moment they arrived, she greeted them coldly and didn't even call our children to meet Emily even when they were outside in the garden. The dinner was even worse. During our family meetings, we'd talk about how's everyone doing, their plans, normal family stuff. Our dad, who works in real state and finances, would sometimes talk about his projects. Now, during the dinner, the moment we started to eat Grace asked my dad how was business doing, and then, somehow, proceeded to make the conversation last THE WHOLE DINNER. She asked him how he saw some trade markets, which trends he usually looks for, etc etc. Basically, only my parents, Grace and I could participate in this conversation, since my Grannie is foreign to all of this and John and Emily's field is completely unrelated to finances, let alone high finances. Emily actually tried to partake by mentioning things she saw on the internet or that her parents told her, but she stopped once Grace ""innocently"" mocked her source being her parents. This is so unusual from her, because Grace is great managing big groups of people and make everyone feel entertained and involved, since she has an extremely magnetic, fun personality. Emily instead tried to make conversation with my grandma, but it was hard since she was getting up and sitting down constantly to serve everyone. 

As any other Christmas, the kids went to play to the living room. Then, my mother suggested we moved into the home bar. Grace actually invited her to either come to the bar to have a drink or go to the living room to play videogames with the children. John got super pissed and Emily just got upset. I thought we needed a word, so I suggested we went outside to talk. She basically told me that it was unbelievable how a girl from the big city like Emily, who was soon to finish her degree, was dating such an old guy. I understood her position, but it wasn't our place to do something, and clearly humilliating Emily wasn't going to make things better. According to her, eight and a half years gap is a way to ""ruin your life"", and that it was time someone broke ""our family's curse"". (??) Also, I got mad because she said it was ""sketchy"" how John had rejected one of her best friends, Sally (30F), even when she's extremely attractive. (In fact, John told me he had tried to like her but she was a bit of an airhead and was openly bored with his field of study, which he loves talking about) I didn't like her tone and did my best to not flip out myself. 

Grace eventually rejoined everyone, but still cold to John and Emily, and me of course. However, yesterday she threatened to stay at home with the children if my parents welcome them again, because she doesn't want to support their relationship at all. She isn't open to negotiation. I'm aware that she is on her right to not be supportive, but it's only a night i'm asking. Any ideas on how to reconcile with my wife? I naturally love her deeply and I might just stay at home this time to make things easier, but what if they date for a long time? We wouldn't be always doing this.

TLDR: My brother 29M is dating a 20F. My wife 35F is completely against, was kind of rude to her during Christmas and now is threatening to not attend (with my children!) NYE if they come again.

7n8j5q,9,2017-12-31,Maintaining flow and focus despite emotional distractions,TonyChedrawee,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7n8j5q/maintaining_flow_and_focus_despite_emotional/,"I took a professional development course at my university this past semester and we studied a concept called ""flow"". This is a relatively new psychological term which describes a mental state where someone is extremely focused, productive, and effective. A lot of the research being conducted on flow is being done by Dr.Mihaly Csikszentmihaly.

Flow is something many of you may experience on a daily basis. When you're in flow state, it's easy to lose track of time, feel a sense of fulfillment from the work you do, and have work just ""flow"" out of you effortlessly. Most of the research on this phenomenon is done on world class performers like athletes, musicians, and business executives.

Personally, I feel a state of flow when I do a few different activities like playing guitar, planning projects, drawing, or even studying. (I'm not an artists or a musician). My goal recently is to try to harness this mental state and develop the ability to ease into it when I do tasks more directly related to my life goals, like reading, writing, or working.

Although I haven't cracked the code on what to do to consciously enter flow state regardless of what task I'm doing, I have noticed an issue I deal with in regards to flow, which could slow down my efforts. Whenever I'm in a state of flow, or any type of focus for that matter, it is easy for me to get completely derailed by negative emotional stimulus in my environment.

For example I have a spreadsheet with a bunch of jobs I plan to apply for for a summer internship. This requires many applications and cover letters. Thankfully I can get into flow state when I write and have the work effortlessly come out of me, however I haven't been able to do this for about a week.

Since I live in a slightly disfunctional household, and interact with a lot of emotionally broken people on a daily basis, I am exposed to a lot of ""emotional distractions"". Considering the fact that I'm an empath doesn't help. Even though I have a fair amount of emotional stability myself, I do tend to be influenced by other people's emotions.

This hinders me when ONE simple emotional event, like seeing a family member cry, throws off my ability to focus on tasks for an entire day, sometimes longer. Even if I leave my environment, I lose my ability to enter flow states.

I don't want to become emotionally distant simply to do better work. I want to remain an emotionally supportive friend and family member, however I must solve this issue soon.

I'm reading a book called emotional agility. Which is basically about the ability to navigate our emotional landscapes and make our emotions work for us. There are a lot of valuable insights in this book that I think can be used to my situation, but I am having issues implementing them.

At the end of the day it's hard for me to remain focused despite an environment full of negative emotional stimulus.

How can I maintain my ability to focus and tap into flow states to produce good work without letting negative emotions slow me down?

How can I do this all without sacrificing my ability to be an empathetic friend?

Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any thoughts will be appreciated! "

Attacker | Defender | Type of Operation | Outcome | Results
---|---|----|----|----
MGB (USSR) | Afghanistan | Cell Establishment | Success - Operation Remains Secret | [Soviet agents made their way to Kabul, successfully posing as investors with most prospecting in the Afghani mining industry. They ask for a tour of the countryside nearby the mines, clearing themselves as threats and lowering suspicion of them. They make their way through the countryside and make contact with various Sarbani Pashtun Tribes throughout the nation with more focus on those north of the Duran-Durand Line. The contacts gauged the disdain of the tribesmen and its recent acceptance into the Commonwealth of Nations. Soviet MGB agents promise those who have a disdain for the British a great deal of weaponry, monetary aid and other promises that spark the interests by the tribesmen and women, some tribes even accepting the Soviets with open arms and remaining in constant contact with them. After exhausting their diplomatic attempts with the tribes, agents then return to their cover as investors, laying in wait for their next set of orders.](#secret)
Stasi (East Germany) | West Germany | Cell Establishment | Relative Success - Operation Remains Secret, One Agent Arrested | [A group of new-recruits to the Stasi Agency successfully sneak into West Berlin, although one agent's papers aren't the greatest and he is arrested on the border, the rest are business as usual. They gain contacts in the political branches of the government positions in West Berlin, signing up and on as interns and other positions that clearly strike no suspicion but are still important enough for a foot-in-the-door operation into the political structure of West Germany.](#secret) As for the arrested agent, he remains in custody but the possibility of extradition and information gathering out of him grows.
USSR | Afghanistan | Cell Establishment | Results Inconclusive - Operation Remains Secret | [The Cambridge 5 agents in the United States and in the United Kingdom receive orders and instructions to investigate British military movements in Afghanistan. For the US agents, the results are mostly unknown, as for the British agents, their results aren't entirely accurate but are aware of at least 2 battalions of Royal Paratroopers, at least 2 battalions of Gurkhas and 3 battalion of regular infantry. There is no information on support elements including air support and artillery support.](#secret)
DPRK | Republic of Korea | Cell Establishment | Failure - 3 agents captured, 2 claim success | 5 North Korean agents under the SAFA (State Apparatus for Foreign Activities) attempted to embed themselves inside the city of Seoul. They traveled in 5 separate groups with [2 traveling South across the Hangang bridge under the guise of fleeing the DPRK's conscription policy. They walk south carrying a civilian pack and clothing that will give them the chance to rent out a small property and to purchase food but were armed with a Soviet Designed Tokarev TT Pistol. The agents did successfully make ""operation headquarters"" in Seoul and did well enough to cover their tracks.](#secret) As for the other last 3 agents, they attempted to slip across the 38th parallel and met with the other agents in Seoul however each were searched and arrested. Brought in for questioning concerning their origins and their reasoning for coming South, the answers they gave apparently failed to meet the satisfactory of the South Korean police and were brutally tortured and interrogated. 1 agent did crack, detailing nothing more than a rendevous point with the others but gave no other information. As for the other 2, they remained quiet with one agent successfully managing to kill himself. [For the main 2 agents in Seoul, they were able to successfully contact the DPRK and were able to warn about future agents heading south. They successfully cover their tracks and provide little but well-descriptive updates.](#secret)

United Kingdom | Ukraine - Kiev | Cell Establishment | Successful - Operation Remains Secret | [MI6 and CIA agents entered into the nation of Ukraine into the city of Kiev to establish a cell and did so rather well. They await further orders but maintain hard radio silence.](#secret)
United Kingdom | Ukraine - Kharkov | Cell Establishment | Failure - Involvement Known, Agents Evaded Capture | MI6 and CIA agents entered into the nation of Ukraine into the city of Kharkov in an attempt to establish a cell but their tracks had met the radars of the infamous Cambridge 5. Their location and names were not known however their presence was alerted to Ukrainian Police. Corn-meister Khrushchev had police and Internal Security on **high** alert. It wasn't long before the agents tracks were being trailed upon. Finally, MI6 and CIA agents made a hard pull out of the city where the trail goes dark. [Mission failure, however agents were able to be successfully extracted from hot-zone.](#secret)
United Kingdom | Russia Far East - Vladivostok | Cell Establishment | Failure - Operation Relatively Remains Secret | [MI6 and CIA agents](#secret) entered into the USSR in the city of Vladivostok to establish a cell and started off rather well, however the Cambridge 5 had been alerted to the presence of the possibility of clandestine operations in Vladivostok. Soviet agents and police were put on **high** alert in the city and began random inspections along with random searches. [CIA and MI6](#secret) agents attempted to bribe citizens in the city, mostly asking those who were unhappy to live under communism to work as informants for them. The bribes were primarily unsuccessful until one man decided it was far more profitable to go to the police than to accept their bribe. He informed the agents that he was loyal to the USSR and told them, ""США СУКИ GET OUT REEEEEEEEE!"" Not only did he successfully report the agents but also was successful in being deported to a labor camp in Siberia simply for the fact that the men had approached him for a bribe. It was clear that he had to of been complaining about life in Russia after all or else he wouldn't have of been questioned. Agents escape from Vladivostok following the events, escaping capture. |
United Kingdom | Russia - Moscow | Cell Establishment | Successful - Operation Failed to Remain Secret, Cambridge 5 Alerted | [MI6 and CIA agents entered into the USSR in the city of Moscow to establish a cell and started off rather well. Agents found several people willing to work with them with 2 even declining the bribe.](#secret) However, Cambridge 5, those traitorous scum, alerted agents back in Moscow that there were active agents in Moscow. ""No shit,"" was the response. The entire city went up into high alert [during a meeting between agents and 3 potential informants. Informants gave the agents boarding and were not found with the agents deciding to remain in the city. As for the informants, they transmit information to the agents infrequently.](#secret)
PRC | KMT | Cell Establishment | Successful - Operation Relatively Kept Secret, Agents Identity Kept Secret | **During the evacuation of Hainan** [Communist agents already in the previous cell of the KMT Army find and link up with other communist members and sympathizers in the KMT Navy. They relay their plans before they are transported back to Taiwan where their goal is to make contact with the inland Communists present without raising suspicion. This was done rather well for a few months until the Naval Agents arrived where a group of them walked inland into the native land to *personally* make contact. They do so and return without any issues](#secret) other than the fact that they were being watched as they left to go make contact. The only thing that is reported is that the KMT Navy has communists inside of its ranks begging the question; of how high in the ranks are these men?
PRC | KMT | Intelligence Gathering | Failure - Agents Involvement Remain Secret | [Agents in Taiwan attempted to search for favorable areas for a solid beach landing, naturally on the West, South, and North Coast. Agents were supposed to relay troop counts and locations however failed to do so and simply lounged on the beach. 3 agents even held a small beach party while 5 got their tan on. ""Yep, this looks like a good beach to make a naval invasion."" would be a common saying. The more lazy would just look at a map and just point. ""This is a good spot. And there. And there, and there and there..."" The information relayed back to the Communists more inland simply enraged officials and partisan members there but was reported back to the mainland with an apology of ""Sorry for the incompetence.""](#secret)
PRC | India | Cell Establishment | Success - Operation Remains Secret | [PRC agents traveled to India to link up with the CPI (Communist Party of India) to establish a cell in their organization and to provide support. They successfully make contact but are mostly given the cold-shoulder. Despite this, reports and updates are sent back into China frequently.](#secret)

Israel | Jordan | Intelligence Gathering | Relative Success - Operation Remains Secret | [Mossad agents travel to Jordan and gather aircraft numbers inside of the nation that were still usable. While observing, the agents forget some of the numbers and provide rough estimates as best according to their memory. (Accuracy within 43% of exact number of only one Air Force Base of choosing)](#secret)
Israel | Syria | Intelligence Gathering | Failure - Operation Remains Secret | [Mossad agents travel to Syria to gather information on troop movements. Although their presence is not known to anyone, they fail to find anything that they hadn't already known.](#secret)
Israel | Iraq | Intelligence Gathering | Failure - Agents Captured, Involvement Unknown | [Mossad agents](#secret) travel to Iraq to attempt to gather information on troop movements however are caught attempting to take pictures of Iraqi soldiers lines. They are brutally tortured but give up no information. A few of the agents die from the torture leaving 5 in capture. It is unknown if they are Mossad but reasonable suspicion details otherwise.
Israel | Internal (Israel) | Intelligence Gathering | Success - Operation Remains Secret: Syrian Agent detected but unable to decrypt network | [Shin-bet begins monitoring Palestinian Civilians, trailing them and even to the point of bugging their houses. A patrol follows one and finds that he has been sending information back to Syria via an encrypted radio network however is unable to decrypt it. The results are clear - Syria has agents in Palestine and Israel.](#secret) (Bonus modifier for future detection on only Palestinian **civilians** in West Bank) 
Yugoslavia | Turkey | Cell Establishment | Successful - Operation Remains Secret | [Agents in Yugoslavia return back to Turkey, this time with more spies and more cash. Agents lay low with a majority posing as businessmen across the coastal regions of west Turkey (source of detection of transmissions), successfully identifying local police officers who they deem as ""sympathetic to influence"". Agents successfully bribe, blackmail, and threaten the officers to call off the search bringing the manpower on the search down by 20%.](#secret) (Bonus modifier in intelligence gathering and future cell establishment)
Yugoslavia | Bulgaria | Cell Establishment | Failure - Operation Remains Secret | [Operations by Yugoslavia in Bulgaria were nearly revealed today as agents from Yugoslavia attempted to reinforce the existing cell in Sofia, Varna, and Plovdiv as authorities nearly came upon a transportation mission of radio equipment from one city to another. One set of additive agents (consisting of 5 in a van), to avoid detection and capture, had disposed of most of the equipment in a river before a police patrol had drove up on them as a vehicle broke down on a bridge. Luckily for them, what they did was the right thing to do as police began to do a full search of their vehicle. Finding nothing, they were sent back on their way. The agents became fearful that if they were stopped again, their cover may be blown as returned to Yugoslavia.](#secret)
Yugoslavia | Albania | Cell Establishment | Failure - Operation Relatively Remains Secret | [Agents in Yugoslavia](#secret) return back to Albania, this time with more spies and more cash. Agents lay low with a majority posing as businessmen across East Albania, successfully identifying local police officers who they deem as ""sympathetic to influence"". Agents were unable to successfully bribe the officers to look the other way and were mostly threatened with arrest. Agents identities were unknown however this will spark more interest into the case of Albania. (Bonus modifier for detection in the future)

7n9khc,7,2017-12-31,The NDad Manifesto,mcdoggos,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7n9khc/the_ndad_manifesto/,"I feel trapped. I feel trapped within my household. I feel like I am stuck in Florida forever. Why did I ever decide to move to Florida at all? Yeah, I realize I was a bit of a loser when I was back in Missouri, and I was into My Little Pony. It kind of ruined my reputation but why didn't I just go through Missouri middle school and move on? My dad always barks at me to never think something with emotion, but the move to Florida was emotion. It was always emotional whenever I'm here. In fact, it is emotional for my father to even ask me to move down there with him. Not as emotional as him begging my sister to move down with him. Why is he begging? To get back at mom for cheating, if it's really the case? I never knew the true story. My brother was my age when he went through it, and knew the true story, but will never tell us. However, that may be for the best. He had to deal with the full extent of the shit when he was my age. I give major props to him for dealing with this. 
	My dad has been considered as an ""ndad"" by myself for quite some time now. Before I discovered the place which helps people with narcissistic parents (which I will not name), I thought the way he raised me was in fact right. I don't blame myself, I never experienced any other way of raising a child. I always blamed myself for the way he snaps at me. I always thought I was in the wrong for making him mad and upset. However, as I matured, I realized that it is not right. It's not right for someone to do some of the things he has done. It's simply wrong. He has called me a douchebag, a piece of shit, somebody he personally wouldn't be friends with, etc. He has hit me whenever I acted moody in front of him, and called me a drama queen when the force of which he striked me made me fall off a high chair. He's controlled my finances for as long as I can remember, regardless if they were hard earned or not. 
	When I was 15, he created an imaginary bank called ""The Bank of Scott"", to teach me the basics of finances. What is unimaginably stupid about this purposal is that it was basically an attempt to control what I spend. Whenever I wanted to buy something with Christmas or Birthday money, he always said no. He basically stated before that he did it so he can say no to stuff I want to buy. He doesn't realize that it's my own money. He gave it to me for Christmas, and Birthdays. Even with my own finances, that I earned from working, he tries to control what I spend. Because of the way he taught me money, he made me extremely frugal. It's not always a bad thing to be frugal though, but I feel like it came with anxiety.
	I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, and most of it was brought on by my father. Previously said, I was scared to upset him, since he is quite literally a ticking time bomb. This made me into the way I am with people; I am scared of what I say to people in fear of making them upset. I'm scared of making people mad at me and I'm scared of people. He made me scared of people. This is more than likely why I am an anti social person in the first place. He taught me to watch what I do at all times around him because obviously I did not want to be screamed at. Due to these teachings, he made me into a walking wimp. 
	He's made me scared of what people say about me as well. Since I was raised to be scared of him when he yells, and things I do, this probably affected me and how I think of people. He always complains about this, but thanks for the way he raised me, he made me this way. He taught me to be scared of him, thanks to his constant loss of temper.
	For years now, I have lacked the feeling of love towards my father. Why is that? For all of the things he's done. He's stubborn, narcissistic, and just flat out rude. Let me address the stubborn aspect first of all. He only believes he wants to believe. He does not like being told what to do, and he only wants to do things his way. Whenever I had a therapist back in eighth grade, he told me that he did not want me taking medication if I ever get diagnosed with anything. My brother has to take medication for his anxiety, and my father is a strong disbeliever of this. He blames my mom for it (like he always does for situations like this) and says I will never get on medication for anything mental illness related because he says anxiety is only a state of mind (along with depression) and says I should just toughen it out. 
	First, I'd like to debunk the claim of anxiety and depression being a state of mind (this is where I discuss him being stubborn). This could not be further from the truth. Tons of research has flat out denied this and says it's your brain that causes these problems along with a mix of other factors. He may think this because of the way HE was raised; he is a baby boomer, and he was raised into being a ""man"" and toughen out everything (which again, isn't a great thing to do). So, he is trying to push this rhetoric onto me and say that everything mental illness related is a state of mind and I should just toughen up and be a man. Of course, I reject this.
	The second aspect I should address is the narcissism he holds inside of him. He believes everything should revolve around his rhetoric, his ideas, and his morals. He wants me to be just like him, along with the rest of his children. He likes to target me specifically to be like him because 1: he's my only legitmate parent in this state. 2: he's made me into a weak individual to be scared of a lot of things so since he believes I'm an easy target, he can take advantage of my nature so I can be just like him. For example, he is a strong believer of flat earth, and tries to push this belief onto all of the family. He pretty much forces it down our throat, especially me because I have to listen to him. I'm scared of what he has to say because again, I was taught to deal with this stuff. Whenever I told him I have to go against his belief because of my own beliefs, he said the following: ""Even if you go against your own father?"" as an attempt to make me feel guilty about how I feel (thanks narcissism for making my dad into the way he is!).
	The third aspect I'm going to address is his rude nature. He does not care about what people think about him. Good for him! However, thanks to this, he's extremely rude, and never takes anyone else into consideration. Whenever he yells at me, he tends to berate me with insults as an attempt to make me feel bad about what I've ""done"" (I get moody with him when I'm not a good mood and I have a bit of sass, but whenever he's home, I have to interact with him. If he talks to me and I begin to exit the conversation, he barks, ""I'm talking to you! Come back."" and makes me stay. And I have bad days sometimes. We all do, and I tend to stay away from him so I don't make him pissed or something.) He was yelling at me because he was driving me home from training at an internship I had. It was an uneventful day and I was tired. I did not want to talk to him, I was in an ""eh"" mood, if you will. So, since I had an ""attitude"" he started to scream at me how I'm not thankful and brings up stuff that I did 6 months ago - 4 years ago, again, to make me feel guilty. As an attempt to defuse the situation, I say ""I'm sorry. Thank you for taking me home"" as a way to make him chill out a little bit. His response? ""You're sorry? You can shove your apologize right up your fucking ass! And that's not a joke!"" because he was joking with me, saying really racist stuff, and I wasn't a big fan of that. In my city, there's a paper plant off the road and when one drives through it, it has an odor that is generally not pleasant. He said ""It smells like niggers over here."" Me, not being a fan of that, did not reply. He started joking with me, but of course I was not in the mood, I didn't know of what he said was a joke or not, hence why he said ""that's not a joke!""
	Of course I can't do anything to combat what he does. With a typical NParent, they think everything they do is infact correct and they think it's the right thing to do. Whenever I tried talking to my stepmom about it to vent, she of course told my dad, and my dad talked with me a few days later saying ""I was in the army for years. You are under my expectations. You need to toughen up and deal with my yelling. Man up."" Whenever my stepmom talked with me saying if things were better, I had to lie and say yes to avoid creating more drama. I can't escape this until I either go to college or move back to Missouri. My dad obviously wants me to go to college in Florida because of debt, which I can understand. Until he tells me he wants me to go to a technical college, which in itself is the same price as a college in Missouri. Whenever I address going back to Missouri, he says that I just wanna escape and be coddled and be soft and ""pwotected"" by my mom (making an excuse to berate my mom for something she did 5-6 years ago, quite immature) as a way to preceive me as weak. I know that this is an attempt of manipulation by my father to make me stay so I can be under his expectations.
	Recently, he's tried saying how proud he is of me and my progress, but I know secretly that he's not. He's told me before that I can always do better, even with a 1 B report card or even straight As with multiple As in the 90 - 95 range. ""You can definitely make a better score in that class!"" Thanks dad for saying how proud I am but saying how much I can do better making it obvious that you really aren't proud. Really appreciate it.
	Thanks to my dad, he's made me scared of venting to people. Thanks to me being a male, I feel like I have to hold in my feelings because it's ""manly."" I obviously object this, but since I'm scared of what people think of me, I have all sorts of emotions going through my head whenever I vent to someone. One of them is fear. I fear that when I vent, I'm seen as self centered, or a genuine piece of shit. I can't even vent to my own father because of what I've said before, he doesn't even help. He just tells me to toughen up. I can't cry in front of him because he yells at me to stop crying, and says ""OH MY GOD PLEASE STOP CRYING. STOP CRYING!"" So, I'm scared of venting because I don't want to be seen as a narcissistic prick like how I precieve my father to be. Another emotion is the feeling of hopelessness. I feel like I'm hopeless, and how I'm going to be a sort of slave to my father forever, and I can't stand up for myself because I'm weak. He's also extremely controlling. If I rearrange my room without telling my father, he's stated that he will ground me from my room, and I will have no electronics in it, just a bed and nothing else, and he will make me sleep in the art room. He will make me sit with him at all times and make me interact with him. 
	One time, he was yelling at me before I go into the doctor's office for God knows what. He was still whispering to me in the doctor's office, and I was having a full blown panic attack, because I'm scared of all the other people think of me getting my ass chewed out in front of everybody. I wasn't answering him and he was clearly getting very pissed and I hear him slowly getting more angry and he's saying how I feel is bullshit and it is a stay of mind, and nobody cares what happens between us.
	I have many dreams in life that I want to achieve, but one of them is be a father. I want to be a father, and I've always been for many years. I want my kids to be grown in a safe non yelling (but will yell if I have to) environment that is non toxic and shows that the child/ren are safe from any toxicity. This is where the manifesto stuff comes in. Whenever I am a father, I am keeping my children as far away from my father as possible. I don't want my children exposed to that toxicity. I don't want my children to deal with the shit my father does. I want to be the best parent for my children for their life as possible. With my father, I can never go to him for advice because he always tells me to ""man up"" or ""boys will be boys."" I want my kids to know that they are safe to talk to me whenever they want to. I want them to know that I will always listen to them and will be there for them no matter what happens. I don't want my kids to think they have to take a bullet for me because I do specific things. I want them to know I will take a bullet for any of my children and they don't have to do anything for me back. They deserve any love and they don't deserve to be treated like I am right now. I dream for my kids to go to high school, go to college, have a successful future, etc. I know right now that whenever my wife or girlfriend at that time gives birth, I will cry and be grateful for having a child. I want to teach them it's okay to let out their emotions every once in a while, and that everyone is human and makes mistakes. This is opposite to what my dad does, saying that whenever someone makes mistakes, is mediocracy. I refuse to believe this. Everyone makes mistakes every once in a while. Just prepare yourself for that big mistake that could easily make you or break you. I want to be happy and be away from that toxic environment but I have to deal with this until 2019. It's so close to being over. I've been dealing with the worst of the narcissism for 4 years now. I can't wait for it to be over and I can be my own person without interference. 
	All in all, I absolutely feel no love for my father. I don't know if I can take this for much longer. I am at a point where I hate my father so much, I don't care what happens to him. I just want him out of my life and wish the absolute worst upon him for making me the way I am. I'm insecure, I feel hopeless, I'm anxious, and I'm depressed all thanks to my ndad. You're a real winner, Scott. You are a real winner."

This post is always my favorite part because we get to look back on the series that was, reflect on another year's tradition (my personal favorite series on this subreddit) and most importantly say thank you to all of the amazing writers, the reserves, the moderators, and everyone who watched, read, critiqued, and complemented all of the brave men and women who put themselves out there to share something special with the community.  

First of all, I want to give a very special thanks to the moderators for being so supportive of everything we did in this series.  When we first started 5 years ago, this was a small grassroots thing and we had to rely on the upvotes from our fellow Wredditors for visibility.  The mods were awesome this year with stickying every thread promptly so the most eyes got the chance to see the most posts for the most amount of time.  We are really lucky to have the group of mods we do who share a passion for this silly circus act and allow us all to share our silly opinions and comments.

Next, I want to say thank you to my reserves.  It is not hyperbole to say that you all are the reason this series goes on because sometimes, surprisingly, life doesn't care that you volunteered to write a goofy post about your favorite match.  Whenever I called upon my group of reserves, they not only delivered, but exceeded even my wildest imaginations.

Next, I want to recognize all of the amazing people who took the time, effort, energy, and talent during a hectic holiday season to provide this great community with the great content that makes this little corner of the internet the ultimate spot for fans of professional wrestling in the world.  I love reading all of the posts, reliving some of the most amazing and important matches in history, and most importantly learning about the people here.  At the end of the day we are all different: business people, construction workers, students, nurses and doctors, bankers, communications associates, interns, small business owners, and a myriad of every creed, every color, and every conceivable walk of life, but the common thread we all share is this circus we call professional wrestling.  Every post had a unique flavor that spoke to the personality of the moment, the personality of the match, and the personality of the writer.  If you missed a day or want to relive any of it, I highly encourage you to revisit the threads and participate in them.  The people who put these together put all of themselves into their unique posts, and putting yourself out there is an amazing feat that should never be underestimated.  Its the high quality nature of the content on this site that makes this place what it is and what it could be.

7nazl5,2,2017-12-31,(21/m) in need of relationship advise,swaggyp0429,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7nazl5/21m_in_need_of_relationship_advise/,"Alright so me and my ex(21/f) had dated for 3 years until a couple months ago we decided to end things mainly because it would've been to hard because of us beeing in our last year of college and it would've been hard to maintain a relationship with internships and everything going on. About a month after we broke up she called me every other day and texted me to see how I was doing. Then we talked almost non stop everyday, until the topic about the relationship came up. She told me talking to me really made her days go by easier and we will always be friends. I told her we know we can't be friends it's either we are together or we aren't because we care and live each other just to be friends and told her I'd rather her hate me instead of us being friends. Also she asked me if I was seeing anybody, idk if that means something or not, but I told her I went on a couple dates but nothing special because I'm the end i always thought about you even during them. Now we still talk almost everyday and I still do want to be with her and she is still interested in me I just don't know how to reassure her everything will be okay without forcing the relationship back in her face. Any help is welcomed"
7nbo9y,20,2017-12-31,I [25M] failed to meet my ultimatum to propose to my SO [25F] by 2017,yammier3,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7nbo9y/i_25m_failed_to_meet_my_ultimatum_to_propose_to/,"I had an ultimatum to propose by end of 2017 given to me three years ago. I made it clear to her in Q3 of 2017 I wouldn't be able to achieve this deadline with the support and advice of my closest friends and similar situations in r/relationship_advice. She didn't take it well and it drew us apart for the latter half of 2017. 

Some background, we met at uni and supported each other through thick and thin. From failing a semester of university to applying for internships and eventually securing graduate roles straight after uni. We supported each other through full-time employment and I eventually bought an apartment for us to live together to see if we could work out. There was always a progression in our lives which kept us together.

However it was clear we weren't made for each other. Our personalities clashed but we both made an effort to accept each other for who we were. We have totally different hobbies, she wanted to settle down and have a large family, she was very hesitant to contribute anything financially in the relationship despite earning similar to me. We were with each other because we were content and comfortable with what we had. We went on several holidays a year and we created plenty of memories over the past five years.

Earlier this year she blatantly lied to me a couple of times this year and she laughed it off casually as if it were no big deal. There was no way we were ready for marriage, and I wasn't sure whether we'd ever be especially after 5 years together.

There has been minimal bedroom activity for the past few months as I did not want that to be a band-aid fix for what was a major underlying problem. I've only had the one partner and I shared many firsts with her (sex, travelling to new countries etc) and I hold it very closely to my heart, making my decision even more difficult.

In late 2017 we've attended two weddings of our closest friends and the pressure to propose was immense. I had sleepless nights thinking about this life-changing decision. Frankly, I was more excited with the idea of being single in 2018 than taking the big step with her.

I'm currently on an overseas holiday with her and she's still been expecting a ring his holiday despite me clearly telling her earlier this year I wouldnt be proposing. The holiday has just reinstated everything I've known about our relationship and I've discussed my concerns and thoughts with her. Her words to me ""I'm not sure if I'm happy with you, but I know I'll live a comfortable life"". Basically, she knows I am a nice and caring guy but I don't make her roll on the floor on laugh like she does with her friends. She finds it hard to understand my humour and isn't very good at smacktalking either so she just gets angry and mad.

Last night (NYE) I made the call to end our relationship and to start 2018 afresh. We've got another 6 days of our holidays together but I couldn't fake it and give her false hope. We cried and she didn't take it well, but I still truly appreciate everything she has done for me in my life.

At the end of the night she forced herself on me, stripped and started rubbing her body against mine and forcingly kissed me. I was stern but I didn't physically push her off me (she would've called me a woman basher). It was the worst feeling I've had and if that wasn't rape, I don't know what is.

Redditors please help.

1. Best way to handle the next five days of our holiday together? I told her to treat each other as friends for the remainder of the holiday.

2. Getting over this relationship is going to take a big effort, any specific advice? I work 50+ hour weeks and dedicate 5 hrs/week to going to the gym already. I don't want to rush into another relationship so I'll be spending more time with my friends firstly.

3. How do I stop feeling sorry for her and stop feeling guilty about making the decision to seperate. She's my first girlfriend and I've never been through a breakup before.

4. I've made great friends through her circle of friends, she expects I don't contact them at all and to cut all ties. I don't think this is normal is it? 

5. Arranging for her to move out will be a nightmare. She will want to take everything she's bought for the apartment and for me but I think I've just got to cut my losses there.

Thanks in advance to this subreddit, I have been a long time lurker here and I really appreciate the sense of community and support here. It's really made me realise and reinforce my beliefs and thoughts of what's acceptable and not. "
