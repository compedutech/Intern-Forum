I just got hired to do a 6 month internship in Columbia, MD, starting in March. The place is right near snowden shopping plaza/whatever you call it.

I don't really have much opportunity to scout the area/apartment shop because I'd have no place to stay in the meantime, so I gotta shop on craigslist, or perhaps find a realtor. Thats why I'm asking for some advice from you guys.

Some things:

* I'm a 3rd year student, age 20 going on 21 in July
* On a similar salary, living in NYC, I was able to comfortably live at $725 a month including utils (probably could have went up to 800 or 900 without starving)
* On top of that, my company is giving me a monthly $400 stipend for housing, so that makes my ideal payable housing price at around $1100 a month, but the less the better cause I want to save money :X
* **I unfortunately need to rely on public transportation**. From what I have heard, it's not the best around there. I'm used to hour long commutes though. That being said, I don't know how far out I can go for housing that's still public transport accessible within a reasonable commute time.
* Alternatively I have nothing against biking or walking.

Any tips or anything of any sort is greatly, greatly appreciated.  Good areas to live, good realtors, I guess even people looking for roommates, it's all welcome!"

Most went very well, and all have eventually ended in someone else getting the job.  I had good grades in law school, law review, several good internships, etc., but I just can't get my foot in the door to get started in this field.  Recently, I have started to wonder how long a new lawyer can stay unemployed before the stink of failure starts to attach and continued unemployment starts to be a self fulfilling prophecy.   I have always wanted to be a lawyer, but I'm wondering if it might be time to table the dreams for a bit and just do something else.

My question for other recent grads and bar passers- has anybody just  given up on being able to be employed as an attorney right now?  If so, what did you do next?  Did you find another field where your skills were attractive to employers?  Do you plan to make a return to the law when things get better?  If you did so, and you returned to the law later, do you think the choice of non-legal work has helped or hurt your job career as an attorney?  "

I have been a loyal viewer of the site for some time and only now have gotten to the point where I feel the need to post, as I have exhausted all other resources (which admittedly were few).  I want to be a programmer, more than anything really, and I have no idea how to do it.  

I will be graduating in May with a software engineering degree, problem being it is from the University of Phoenix.  I have no issues with the school really, but I do not feel that the degree program I have enrolled in has taught me what I need to know to be even an entry level programmer.  Also, I haven’t made any real contacts in my field of choice.  What it has done is introduced me to something that I now love, but fear am not good enough at to perform at an adequate level.   Another issue is that in prep for my graduation I have developed a sort of ADD approach to learning.  I am supposed to be learning VB.net for school, but I have taken it upon myself to also re learn Java (to the extent which I had learned it before and hopefully beyond) and C#.  I keep starting books and tutorial videos, but do not get very far, reasoning that I should really be focusing on one language at a time.  

I believe that the solution to my problem is to get a job or internship and really learn how to program, but that too presents some problems.  I have two kids, a full time job and a wife who works part time while going to school full-time.  I make too much money and am relied on too heavily to take on a new full-time job at a pay cut.  Unpaid internships also present an issue as I cannot justify the added cost of daycare if I am getting no pay in return.  There is some hope, however, as I work Friday-Monday 10 hours a day, leaving me free Tuesday – Thursday.  The way I see it I would need either a work from home type option or a paid internship or part-time position at around 10 dollars an hour (to cover daycare).  What do Reddit?

I was recently offered a job in Irvine that requires me to relocate, and I'll be in sunny California ready to begin my new life and new career starting this Monday.

I'm a 24 year old male, and since graduating from college in Fall '09, I've been busting my ass working 2 jobs and various internships working toward my career and this marks the culmination.  I'm excited, but also extremely nervous.

So I ask of you, reddit, would you please help me by telling me a bit about the area?  For example:

* Where and how should I approach finding a place?  Ideally I'm looking for a decent room for rent for a couple months while I stabilize and find a more permanent one-bedroom arrangement.
* Where are some of the nicer, trendier spots in the area for food, drink and just general socializing?  I'm not going to know anyone, really, so I want to be active and acclimate myself to the social scene as seamlessly as possible.
* What are some general tips and tidbits of advice you have for an out-of-towner?  

Thanks in advance for all of your input.  I look forward to hearing some of your thoughts!

EDIT:

Thank you so much everyone for the overwhelming show of support. I'll be sure to try to get myself added to that fb group. It would be great to have a jumping off point with some cool people around the area.

ffsly,1,2011-02-05,Counselor and student relationship.,noggin_psd,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ffsly/counselor_and_student_relationship/,"Okay so at my school we have faculty advisers that are assigned to students according to their  last names .  The faculty advisers help students with scheduling  conflicts,  general questions,  help with internships/ employment ,  etc. My adviser is named  Jess Depew and she' s pretty hot.

She' s like 25 and she' s only been at the school a few years .  Anyway,  I have been looking into getting an internship  at a TV station or something over the summer,  and the school helps  coordinate  these  thing s with an internship  database that' s mainained  by the advisers.  You log on with your school ID and password and you can browse internship s and stuff .  I was having trouble logging on to mine so I went to go see Ms. Depew .  That' s where all the trouble started. 

Firstly,  I walked into office like 15 minutes early  like an idiot  and she' s in the middle of lunch .  So I awkwardly make stupid stall talk until  she' s finished. 

""Oh, hey, what are you eating? "" 
"" Salmon.  I love it. I eat it practically every day. ""
"" Just salmon?  That' s pretty weird . "" Why the hell did I say this? 
""Oh, well,  I don' t know.  I try to eat healthy,  natural foods . . . you know,  like wild berries and honey  and stuff . ""
"" Yeah,  I like food too."" * facepalm* 

Man, I was so nervous.  Anyway,  we finally begin  squaring my stuff  away.  She looks  up what I registered  with in the beginning of the year.  This is when the crap really hit the fan. This is how the conversation went: 

"" Okay,  you' re account name is [my name]  and your password is . . . ' depewissexy' . . . "" 

Oh damn.  I completely  forgo t that I put that as my password in the beginning of the year.  What the hell was I thinking?  It was probably the longest 20 seconds of my life before I final ly got my balls  together to stand  up and leave .  Just as I walk out the door she says, 

""In the future,  you might  want to bear in mind what kind of thing s you want keep to yours elf. ""

I was so freaking embarrassed I wanted to kill myself right  then and there .  I wanted to run the hell out of there  and never ,  ever see her again .  But something about  what she just said kept me standing in her doorway.  I decided to man up and apologize.  I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes,  and swallowed my pride .  And then,  it hit me like a train  full of bricks. 

She was eating Salmon. 

She tries  to eat all healthy,  natural foods ,  like wild berries and honey . 

She told me that I might  want to bear in mind what kind of thing s I want to keep to myself. 

Ms. Depew  was a bear disguised as a human . 

Immediately,  the bear saw that I had seen through its charade.  It roared loudly and took a menacing swipe  at me. I deftly avoid ed its claw and sprinted out of the office.  The bear was soon in chase ,  crashing through the walls  of the office as if they were made of paper .  I jumped over the receptionist desk and ran out the back entrance.  The bear followed,  tossing the secretary aside  like a rag doll.  The bear began  to pursue me through the street traffic.  While  I fought my way through the maze of vehicles,  the bear simply careened its massive force  through anything standing in its way. Cars veered off the road to escape the onslaught of grizzly force  that was barreling down the road.  The bear was gaining fast.  I had no other  option but to make my way into the nearest building:  a preschool.  I burst  through the door,  start ling the children from their  naps.  Immediately,  the bear slammed through the wall,  crushing a child  beneath his massive paws and burying several other  children in sheet  rock and debris.  I maneuvered  my way through the chaos  towards the back exit.  The pre-schoolers were little more than a screaming annoyance for the bear.  Its massive paws cut swath s through the sea of toddlers with each swipe .  I used the precious time these  children had afforded for me to make my escape into the playground .  I scram bled up a ladder to a fort- like structure.  My goal was to walk across the monkey bars then jump to a tree which  I could  climb  to the roof of the preschool and perhaps flag down a passing helicopter . 

I began  my trek across the monkey bars just as the bear charged outside,  its teeth  and claws  still  fresh  with the blood  of the innocent.  It let out a monstrous roar and began  its assault on the cheap ,  wooden playset.  I let go of all caution and ran to end the end of the monkey bars.  I leaped for the tree branch just as the bear' s enormous girth  came plowing through the entire structure.  I grasp ed the branch tightly as the bear collided with the tree,  sending it into a daze.  I saw this as my one opportunity not for escape,  but for victory.  I leapt  off the tree onto the ground and grabbed a stray  bar that had been shorn  from the playset.  The bear was slowly coming to so I had to act fast.  I ran to the beast  and thrust the jagged end of the pole into its jaw and through it's skull . 

The bear had been defeated.  I shambled home in pain but victorious.

But today ,  I returned home a champion.

tl;dr:  School counselor was deceitful but should I have asked her out?"
fgb42,0,2011-02-06,I am Filled With Worry and Woe: Confessions of an Uneasy Intern. Advice is Appreciated.,Worryandwoe,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/fgb42/i_am_filled_with_worry_and_woe_confessions_of_an/,"So, the following series of long winded rhetoric is a brief 5-year autobiography for me that will explain why I'm filled with such unrest.

After graduating High School I was accepted to the [University Here]. At that time, I wasn't sure what I wanted to study, and I made my decision based on short sighted reasons involving a girl. Shortly after socializing with people in my dorm community I found myself immersed into the culture that's kept me getting up in the morning everyday: Heavy Metal and Hardcore music. Doom, Sludge and Post-Metal more specifically.

I founded a band and intended to study Hospitality. Fast-forward a year, Hospitality isn't anything resembling satisfying for me. Working for Expedia proved that. I took my winter break that year to do some serious reflecting. Having taught Karate for 7 years through High School and College, I decided that working towards the betterment of the generation behind me was a personally respectable and satisfying choice for career. I switched my major to Language Arts Education at the advice of my advisor against my instinctual reasoning to earn a degree in Composition. Mistake #1.

I start taking Education classes, and BOY am I unfulfilled. However, promises of more challenging and relevant curriculum given by my professors kept me pushing. It never came. This gave me time, however, to start my own Metal/Hardcore promotion company, go on a few out of state tours to play shows, and enjoy college to the fullest.

Junior Year was when my life took a more sincere turn. My best friend in the whole world passed away due to a heart condition at 23 years old. My girlfriend of 5 years at the time became jealous of my mourning for my best friend (who was female) and leaves me, throwing me out of our apartment. I still am feeling unchallenged academically having taken all of my English requirements (equivalent to 1/3 of a Lit Degree). I was a wreck for nearly a year, and I took until late 2010 to regain 100% composure. 

Taking classes like Young Adult Literature, Teaching English in K-12 were not helpful either. The average class involved 60 minutes of hooting soccer momlets talking about their week. This practice was considered routine by our own professor. The remaining 2 hours of the class involved a series of long winded presentations/projects from students in the same boat as me. The majority of my classes were comprised of little to no involvement on behalf of the professor other than basic facilitation of student centered curriculum. This consisted of half-hearted attempts at lesson plans, powerpoint presentations riddled with clip art, pictures of their husband/fiancee, and extensive descriptions on why they enjoy their favorite CW programming; among other barely relevant topics. I'm fucking suffocating.

Back to music, I represent bands with names like: Weedeater, Eyehategod, Zoroaster, etc etc. Not the most PC choices in titling, but the music/sound that each band evokes is thoroughly satisfying to those that enjoy passion in their music. This is a cause for concern for me should my students/parents ever draw that connection. I will not abandon everything I’ve established in the music scene my friends and I have constructed from the ground up in just 3 years. 

I'm currently in my Senior Internship with a High School in my county. I'm working with the AP English Chair as my supervising teacher. Sounds great right? Wrong. I was bottlenecked into teaching her HUMANITIES class for her. Not only teaching, but developing 100% of the curriculum from scratch because she'd never taught the class before. I have little/no experience in evaluating students for social science curriculum, so I've been researching ideas online and I've had small victories in just four weeks. 

I graduate in May, and lose my university appointed position at the end of August leaving me unemployed. I have a good rapport with my supervising teacher and department so employment is looking good at this point. There have even been hints that I’m already being considered for an opening in the next school year. However, my supervising teacher also claimed that my degree was almost worthless compared to that of a Composition/Literature major. She seemed optimistic though, saying that I should just strive to earn my graduate degree after establishing employment. 

However, this brings me to my points:

1. As a promoter of Doom, Sludge and Death Metal do I have a giant target painted on my back for lawsuit crazed parents to pick off from a safe distance?
2. Having obviously been unprepared and lied to by my university in not earning the correct degree, am I at a severe disadvantage for job security?
3. My current plan is to earn my graduate degree so as to further my craft as a writer and educator (and not have to lose sleep over worrying about if my personal projects and hobbies would interfere with job security). Would teaching entry level composition classes at the collegiate level be feasible with this degree? 

Tldr; liberal Floridian junior teacher feels unprepared and that he must live a stressful double life under two different last names depending on who he’s talking to

All advice is appreciated. Thanks."
fg8vi,2,2011-02-06,It's over. What should I say?,whatshouldido11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fg8vi/its_over_what_should_i_say/,"Hi guys. I have been in an on-again-off-again relationship for the past 4 and half years. She and I got together the first semester of our senior year of high school, and we dated for about 10 months before our first break-up.

We were in love and we both decided to go to the same college, but she had family issues I wasn't aware of and had to drop out the first month we were there to move back home. That blindsided me caused me to break up with her (another long story).

Since then, she had another boyfriend and they were together for a while, but eventually they broke up and she told me that a major reason for that was because she still wasn't over me.

I told her that I wasn't over her either, but that I didn't think it would be a good idea to get back together because I was still in school, while she was still back at home 200 miles away. She asked me if she should wait for me, and I told her that I didn't know what fate had in store for us in the future and that anything was possible. So we decided to wait for each other until I graduated.

This was the summer after my sophomore year.

During my junior year, we started moving apart emotionally again and meanwhile, I got accepted for an internship 1000 miles away. When I moved at the beginning of last summer, it got harder and harder for me to still see a future between us and that scared me. So one night last May I called her up and told her that I still loved her and that I thought we could somehow make this long distance relationship work. She was really happy and so was I.

For a while.

I starting thinking about how I would never be moving back home once I graduated and I thought about how she had these dreams to go back to school and become a pharmacist. We would be apart from each other for years and years more, and I started to doubt everything again. And now I know that it's not going to work out.

I wrote her the following letter telling her that I want to move on, but I wanted to run it past you guys first to get your opinion if parts of it are too harsh or not harsh enough.

Thanks for your input:


&gt;Jane,
&gt;
&gt;I am writing this the day after we sat down and I told you that I thought we could make our relationship work out. I have been trying to think of the best way to tell you this for a while now, but the longer I wait, I the more I realize that there is no best way to say this: we're through. I lied to you, and for that I am deeply sorry. The truth is that I have had doubts about us for a long time, and I have been struggling for a while to overcome them, but in the back of my mind they are always there.
&gt;
&gt;We are becoming two very different people, and our paths in life are taking us both in different directions. In the past, I thought that somehow everything would work out for us; that fate would be on our side to bring us together one day; that one day, everything would click and it would feel right for me. But as time has gone on, I just can't see that day coming, and now I'm tired of waiting and tired of hoping. I'm ready to move on and to accept that this isn't in the cards for us.
&gt;
&gt;I know this will come as a shock to you, but you must have known something wasn't right between us. I have been distant for a while now, and I tried telling you how I was feeling back in August, but I caved and told you what you wanted to hear, just as I did the other night we were together. I never wanted this to go on for so long the way it has, but I couldn't bear to say anything to you until I was absolutely sure of what I wanted. I wasn't trying to be cruel or heartless; I just wanted to spare you of this pain for as long as I could.
&gt;
&gt;I do want you to know, though, that what I told you last May, that I loved you still, was true then and it's true now and will always be true. I won't take back those words or the feelings behind them. But sometimes I feel that it would have been better for both of us if I had never said anything because I had doubts about us even then. I was just hoping that if you knew, I could work through them and finally see a future with us together, but it was unsuccessful.
&gt;
&gt;I know how much I mean to you and how much time you have spent worrying about our relationship and trying to make it work. I know that it must have been really hard on you every time I was distant with you, every time I didn’t return your messages or your calls. You may have thought about quitting then and moving on every time I hurt you by pulling away. And you may be thinking now that all of these years have been a waste, but I don’t. You were my first girlfriend, and you showed me what it was to really love someone; and even though our time together has been full of hurdles, I don’t regret any of it for I will always cherish what we had together.
&gt;
&gt;I want you to know that I have always believed in you, even when you didn’t believe in yourself. You are an amazing, brave, powerful woman and I truly believe you can do anything you set your mind to. I want you to remember to keep those who know that close to you, and keep those naysayers in your life from interrupting your dreams. Your dreams belong to you and no one else. Treasure them, cultivate them, and don’t give up on them. You can accomplish them.
&gt;
&gt;And please don’t give up on love.
&gt;
&gt;I think it will be best for both of us if we don’t try to contact each other for a while. I am going to remove you from my friends list along with all of our mutual friends so the temptation isn’t there. You may write back to me when you are ready.
&gt;
&gt;John

If any of you out there have recently been dumped, let me tell you that it gets better. I'm still not out of the woods yet, but it gets a little better each day. I picked up a new internship, picked up a new exercise regimen, rearranged my whole house, and I try to get out as much as I can. If you just got dumped, I can't stress this enough: BREAK ALL CONTACT! NO MORE CONTACT! Also, find ways to get out of the house and be social. You don't have to start thinking about other girls, but just getting out and chatting with new people helps. 

I cried today. Every few days I'll just start to cry--the most random things can bring up the pain again. But the crying helps too.

When I need to feel like I'm not alone, I'll peruse the relationship_advice columns. Didn't realize there were so many break-up threads before I posted mine, lol.

fhslu,6,2011-02-08,Has anyone here made a drastic career change within the legal profession? (specifically: corporate to civil rights),[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/fhslu/has_anyone_here_made_a_drastic_career_change/,"And if so, any advice for doing so?

I'm posting this as much to help myself think about it as much as I am to solicit advice, so please feel free to skip the background and gory details of how I came to ask this question.

**Backround:** I'm a 3rd year corporate associate in big law (specifically in finance), graduate of a top 10 law school, undergrad degree in economics. I loved economics and went into law school with my eye solely on being a deal lawyer. I built my course schedule around that goal, taking every corporate or finance-related class I could get into, b. school classes on negotiation and corporate finance, and I even worked part-time during school as an intern for in-house counsel, instead of doing a journal or moot court.  I got my top choice for a job coming out of law school, and have endured massive layoffs.  I should feel proud and lucky to be where I am.  And yet after two and half years on the job, I've come to the conclusion that I utterly hate this shit.  It would take me all day to describe all the reasons why, but I need to make a change soon or I may lose my sanity.

I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about what I would rather do, and what I've learned about what I definitely do not want to do, and here's what I've come up with:

(1) **Something I care about doing, rather than something I find interesting at the time.**  Looking back, I can't help feel like my interest in transactional law was much more than a fleeting one that I convinced myself I would enjoy, based on what I expected I would like (considering my educational background), what I thought I would be good at, and a bit of rationalization of my urge to chase money and prestige.  Now I know that, if I'm to spend a good 70-80% of my waking time on something, it needs to be something I actually care about, something that I will actually derive some feeling of satisfaction from doing well.  I get plenty of praise for doing excellent work above my experience level, but I don't really care about the outcome of these deals or the well-being of the firm, and as a result, I also get plenty of criticism for not being committed enough.  My billable hours are abysmal and it's been tossed out there that I might prefer to move in-house or to a smaller firm.  I have two motivations in my current job: (a) avoid getting fired, so that I still have the means to pay my loans and (b) a sense of personal pride that compels me to do good work. I'm basically a highly compensated indentured servant. 

(2) **Something with a modicum of social value.** I have a genuine, deep concern for the state of our society, and yet I spend most of my time contributing a marginal amount value only to the institutions and individuals who are worsening it.  At best, finance is completely amoral, and most of the lawyers, bankers, traders, etc. in it are at best completely oblivious, if not actually despicable.  As a bit of an aside, I've become horrified at the amount of human capital that is devoted solely to arcane areas of finance, where the only objective is to figure out how to make more money off of money (real or imagined).  I want to stop being such a hypocrite and actually commit myself to making things right.

(3) **Less of a desk job, more excitement.** It's hard for me to describe the depth of my boredom and disinterest with what I do.  Whether we're busy or slow, I'm always thinking of what 500 other things I'd rather be doing. By my nature, I'm a creative person, and a bit of a thrill-seeker, yet I spend most of my time huddled behind my desk performing tedious paper-pushing.

**Conclusion:** Taking these factors into consideration, I know what I want to do: civil rights litigation.  My interests and politics and have shifted massively throughout my life, but my first passion, and the only thing I've cared about consistently (since I was about 12 years old) was civil rights/civil liberties.  I am passionate about the issues, interested in the legal theory and jurisprudence, and believe it is an area in need of more committed and talented people.  Trying cases is also far more consistent with my competitive personality, and I've always gotten a nervous thrill from public speaking.

**So my question is: is making the move from the corporate biglaw track to ultimately becoming a civil rights trial lawyer a realistic goal whatsoever?**

tl;dr: corporate biglaw associate in finance wants instead to save the world and live up to his childhood ideals."

My boyfriend and I have been together for 16 months exactly now (disclaimer: no I'm not one of those girls who counts every second and every day, it just so happens to be the 8th, which is our anniversary day). We're very serious; he's been ring-shopping when I'm not around and has ""the perfect way to propose"". He's already gone out and bought me some gifts, so I want to do something special for him, especially so since he's such a great guy and has been so damn good to me.

I'm in favor of more thoughtful than expensive, especially since my budget is tight while I try to pay off my car with internship money before returning to college.

Here's what he likes, and I'll list some things he already has.

Likes: cooking, geeky things/tech/electronics, puzzles, tv, reading, his car (2010 Nissan Versa), photography, travelling, gaming

Already has:

* super-expensive desktop, buying a new laptop shortly, awesome sound system, big screen TV, bluray player, a million remotes.

* every kitchen utensil that exists other than a stand mixer/unitaskers (Alton Brown anyone?)

* a Kindle to read with

* brand new touch-screen car stereo, speakers, amp, and gps

* lots of little things like pocket knives, mice, keyboards, etc etc

What I can do (maybe):

* drawings

* crafty/artsy things (to some extent, though these are often frustrating for me)

* knit

I really want to make him something that says ""I love you and thank you for everything you do. You make me super happy."" And throw in some little thoughtful store-bought things, maybe. 

Any ideas, ladies? I appreciate the help.

TL;DR: What do you buy for the man who has everything he wants, but deserves so much more, for Valentine's Day? 

P.S.: No to lingerie (too expensive!!! Plus I already have a few pieces), and since this is asking ladies for help, this may be unnecessary, but please no ""Give him coupons for blow jobs!"" etc. Thanks :D"

fj2i9,1,2011-02-10,Six months after finishing graduate school I feel like unemployment is eating away at me...,NewspaperCat,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/fj2i9/six_months_after_finishing_graduate_school_i_feel/,"This is my first time ever posting, but I really feel like I need to.  I’ve been a very optimistic and generally happy person for most of my life.  Not that everything has always gone well for me, but I’ve been able to keep a positive attitude.  However, I feel that old self slipping away from me now.

I’m part of the first generation of my family attending college and the first girl to graduate from both undergrad and grad school.  I was top of my class in high school and went to a very prestigious college.  I just always assumed that if I did well in college that I would get a job upon graduating.  Clearly if I’m posting here, that was not the case.   I’m now six months out of graduate school and have yet to find a job.  I’ve gone on a few interviews none of which resulted in a job offer.  I just have this relentless, depressing feeling that I’ve done everything “right” and have failed miserably.

I’m starting to feel that I’m unemployable for some reason.  I’ve had internships and received enthusiastic praise from my supervisors.   I’ve always been a hard worker and gotten along great with colleagues and supervisors.  I’ve never been extraordinarily outgoing or a schmoozer.  

Everyone keeps telling me that the economy is bad and that everyone is struggling, but it just doesn’t make me feel better.  If anything it makes me feel like my job prospects are even slimmer.  I’m constantly trying to remind myself that a job does not define my life.  It’s just really hard.  I just had to contact my lender to put my loans on forbearance, which made me feel like absolute garbage.   

I’m not sure what I want to get out of this, but I wanted to post.  I hope this post doesn’t sound too whiny, but these are my honest thoughts.  It feels nice to get this written down.  I have trouble talking about this with friends and relatives IRL because I just feel like they don’t understand.  I thought if anyone would get it, it would be this lot.

TL;DR  I’m feeling like I will never get a job, and unemployment makes me feel worthless.  Don’t really know what I’m looking for out of this post.

fiw3x,31,2011-02-10,"AMA So, you want to make video games.",DarrenEdwards,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fiw3x/ama_so_you_want_to_make_video_games/,"Before getting in games I had an ideal that art of the 20th century was photography or movies and the art of the 21st century was video games. I wanted to be part of that. I saw a golden age of possibilities as limitations fell and the technology grew. 

The reality of the business side burns people out.  A publisher takes the risk, but also gets the bulk of the reward.  A game is made by a couple dozen people, artist, programmers, designers and producers.  However, it takes several hundred people to get a game to market for distributing a physical disk.  For this reason most games never make it to publishing.  If it may not be profitable, it's cheaper to kill it during production than to get marketing involved.  Working on a game that never sees the light of day is a special kind of soul crushing.  

The publisher pays a development house.  The developer can be thought of as a games specialized employment agency.  The publisher's product is a finished game, the developer's product is man power.  The developer will charge by so many seats in each department and bid out for these seats.  Software and hardware are fixed costs, the variable is the cost of the employee.  For the developer to profit, it comes out of a livable wage of the employee.  If you have fantasies of being creative, you are just a cog in a machine.  A sign of a happy, well managed team has lots of Easter eggs, if it doesn't have side humor or hidden items you can bet the employees hated this project and management cracked the whip.

The developer is charging for your seat to be filled.  If the boss can fill it with an intern he will.  The rest of the employees now have to do their job, plus pick up the slack and get the intern up to speed.  This makes people form groups and hate each other.  As teams get split apart as one project needs help and another one completes, this makes for a rocky dynamic.  

I've seen kids reduced to full open sobbing from overwork.  While some are picked on, others outright steal other people's work.  I saw an entire afternoon wasted arguing if a werewolf would have a flat screen or an older monitor.  I saw a guy get so overworked by an argument he stabbed himself with a pencil.  I saw a guy quit with no notice and get into a shoving match because he wanted his last check before he left.  The worst I saw was a dating couple get fired because a drunk supervisor was turned away from the girl's apartment  at 2:00 a.m.  Firings happened for stupid reasons.  One guy was fired for sexual harassment on a day he was gone, over a girl he had never met.

Initially I saw a roommate, who lived on my couch and didn't work, get a job because he spent all day working on his portfolio.  He and another friend ended up working for a developer that had success elsewhere but had moved across the globe in order to run from an international lawsuit.  They took their best employees and padded their numbers with glorified interns.  I spent after hours there trying to learn 3d and eventually was able to pirate software and learn 3d myself at home.

I got my first gig working making an Age of Empires clone.  This was a small startup.  This was founded by a guy who had managed to only have mediocre gaming skills by the time he was in his mid 20's.  He also had a huge inheritance.  Once that got that he decided that putting a few programmers and artists in the same room a game would pop out and he would get richer.  Unfortunately he gave himself all the leadership responsibilities, and spend all day playing games.  After a year and a half, I left.  I heard he ended up blowing 6 million without ever accomplishing anything.

Next I worked for a developer that specialized in sports games.  I worked on about a dozen games( a zombie shooter, a couple of sports games, a WWII FPS, a Disney interactive, a real time strategy, and several other games that get killed half way to publishing.  The workload was stressful.  We were in dark rooms, not looking away from our screens, not going to the bathrooms too often, working 10 hours a day and sometimes weekends or overnight.  This place hired kids who still lived at home with their parents.  The pay and benefits were pretty bad.  They promised bonus checks, but those almost never happened.  It would take a year or more after a game was shipped before a check would come, if the employee had moved on in that time the company kept the check.  The turn over was pretty high.  After a series of bad decisions, they started firing for ridiculous reasons.  Eventually that had to do layoffs, just as the big project I worked on went into beta.  

With incredible turnover and so many young, antisocial employees the office politics at a game company is immature. While at the company, if someone doesn't have your back, you are fucked. It's more cliquish than high school. There is a pecking order for work and ideas. Those at the top feel no problem stealing credit from those at the bottom. The same goes with assigning blame for mistakes.  Sure that happens in all companies, here it was blatant.  Typically a career could be over quickly and many were eager to make a mark on one title.

I was once approached by a friend of a friend to help with a religious game.  Despite philosophical differences I said I would help.  That is, until I read the contract.  It was full of catches that restricted the employee, but no obligation to the employers.  The last line was,""as witnessed by our Lord, Jesus Christ.""  They tried to appeal to my greed, saying how much money I'd make when it was done.  This rubbed me the wrong way and I walked without signing, even though I had already provided some work for free.

The last place I worked in games was a Casino game company.  This place was made up of polar opposites, but with still serious communication problems.  The place was a bunch of sad old men with chemical dependency problems.  Some showed up drunk, or drank all day.  The main programmer had a 'fish bowl' office in the center where he chain smoked and a special air system sucked the smoke away.  The same core half dozen guys had gone through about 4 different companies in the area in 10 years.  They would run one place into the ground, split up, when one would get a job he would recommend his friends and they would run it into the ground.  Because they were part of a casino, they had lots of money to throw at problems.  I only worked there a few months.  

I don't know what it is about games work.  I don't know if it's the stressful environment or the people it attracts.  I am proud of the work I've done, but I don't think I'll ever go back.  I've moved on to interactive educational work and am much happier.  I've talked to a few redditors about the AI game developer degrees and they sound insanely bad.  $90 + 4 years of your for a degree in a field that often pays not near enough to cover student loan payments and will burn you out in a year or two.

The last month of school is devoted to a project of my choosing. I'd like to do some graphic design or some graphic design training, but I need to have an advisor with no relation to my school at all. 
If you:

**A**. Do work with graphic design and have the time and resources to take on an unpaid intern for 5 weeks,

**B**. Have some graphic design experience and the time to meet with a random high schooler for less than an hour a week for five weeks, or

**C**. Know someone that does,

do you think that you might be able to do a high schooler a massive favor and either help out or point me in the direction of someone or something that can?

Thanks in advance!!

**EDIT**: I really appreciate all of the help so far, guys!! A lot of you have been asking for some examples of stuff I've done. These are just a few of the things I've done for school... The way I see this working out, I would either intern somewhere, or I would create a moderate-scale skin for the desktop modification program, Rainmeter (Which I would do alone and bring to you once a week just for criticism and whatnot)

Also, people have been asking for examples of my work.
These are just a couple things I've done this year for my school, and I suppose the only large scale projects I've done this year... Aside from these, there are a lot of really small scale things I've done like vectors and whatnot, but that's really about it...

 I am a 32 y.o. childless female, he is a 38 y.o. male with a 10 y.o. son from his first marriage. For all intents and purposes, we have been together for a bit over 2 years. We are 19 months into a 3 year LDR, I had to leave for school, with plans to live together while I intern in his city this summer and then full-time after I graduate in 2012. We are not officially engaged, but our eventual marriage is a foregone conclusion.

I have spent most of my adult life vacillating on my position on children. As a child myself, I knew I wanted to be a wife and mommy when I grew up. I married young, and during the 16 months that that marriage lasted my then-husband and I unsuccessfully tried to start a family. I then got into a 7 1/2 year relationship with a man with grown children and a vasectomy. I did a lot of soul searching and eventually decided I would rather have the relationship with my then-boyfriend than the possibility of children. I even went through a phase of very vehemently not wanting children, as I enjoyed the freedom of my child-free lifestyle. At about 28 the biological clock started ticking though, and I told my then-boyfriend that if we were still together when I was 35 I was going to order some sperm popsicles and a turkey baster, and he could help raise the baby with me or not. Within a year or two though, the clock seemed to have broken.

So for the couple years since then (and for the entire time I have been with my boyfriend) I have been just without a desire one way or the other on the matter. I have known that if a pregnancy were to transpire I would be happy about it, though the timing right now would be quick frankly atrocious, but I have not actively wanted a baby enough to try for one or for it to be a deal-breaker in my relationship. I should note that as far as I am concerned, at this point I have a 10 y.o. son, and I love him dearly. But I did miss out on the first 8 years of his life.

My boyfriend has mentioned a vasectomy, so I infer from that that he is done, but we have never actually discussed having any more children. I've never brought it up because it's never really been an issue for me, I've figured if he decides he wants more children I'll be happy to go there, and if he decides he is done I'm okay with that too. Today though, I was on a forum where suddenly a LOT of women are announcing their pregnancies, and the idea of never having that myself did make me a little sad. I think I do want at least one more child more than I an admitting to myself. At the same time though, more children would only be icing on the cake, I am wholly happy and content with the little family that I have now. There is nothing in the world I would choose over them.

So all that being said, do I even bother discussing this with my boyfriend? And if I do bring this up, how do I make it clear that whatever decision we make is together? Because he always wants my happiness about all else, and I am concerned that if he knows that I would like to try for a baby he will say of course just to see the smile on my face. I am sure that he would love that child, but I don't want him to go there just for me. "

fl7dm,7,2011-02-14,Temporarily moving to San Francisco. Have a couple questions.,[deleted],sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/fl7dm/temporarily_moving_to_san_francisco_have_a_couple/,"Hey! I'm going to be spending the summer in San Francisco (which I'm super excited about), and I have to move out there at the end of May, sight unseen. I've stayed there before, but I am not going to have time to appraise a bunch of apartments--I basically need to get out there and immediately get set up. I have a few questions that I thought maybe some locals could help me with.

Here is the situation:

1) I have an internship in the mission

2) I will be living on about $2000/mo

3) I have had a chain of bad experiences with roommates that I didn't know--nothing traumatic, but things that really spoiled my experiences. I've decided that, if it can be managed, I would much rather have a place to myself (or myself and friends) &amp; have to teetotal a bit than live in an apartment with a bunch of strangers &amp; have extra cash. I know this is idealistic, but I'm trying to work the numbers with that in mind.

4) My girlfriend and a good friend of ours are going to be in San Francisco--unfortunately, their budget is much more stringent than mine. If they can afford to live with me, they will; otherwise, they will be staying at the friend's parent's house in Oakland. I would love to be able to stay with them, and I think it would be a lot of fun (I've lived with each of them before, so I'm pretty confident it would all work out). They will probably be working in Oakland.

5) I will be turning 21 over the summer, but I don't need an immediately accessible night-life--I'm not a big bar/club guy, and being as how the two girls are younger, I am not going to go out bar-hopping without them very much.

6) I would gladly pay more money than the girls if it meant I got to live with them--if we found a 2br for 1600, I would have no compunctions about paying 1000 to their 600. The way I see it, I am fortunate enough to have some funds, I should share that with others, and it would still end up cheaper for me than paying to live alone. Also, it's only going to be 3 months, so there's no question of me saying ""OK, I'll pay 1000 for &lt;this long&gt; and then you guys have to start making up the difference""--I know exactly what I'm getting into w/r/t cost.

As I see it, here are my two basic options if I do manage to not get a place with strangers (and feel free to correct me):

A) Get a furnished studio (~1400 to 1600, if I'm very lucky) in the Mission, spend the rest of my money on food, live an ascetic life. See my girlfriend and our friend once in a while when I get up to Oakland or when they get down to the city.

B) Get a 2br in Temescal or someplace like it (I have found a few for 1600 or thereabouts). We would all be together, and the place would certainly be bigger than in the Mission, which would be great, but I would have to commute to the Mission.

So the explicit question is: how plausible is it to commute to the Mission from Oakland using BART? Maybe not every day a week, but pretty frequently. I pretty regularly did a ~50 minute commute when I was living in Paris, so I'm no stranger to treks on public transportation, but I have never experienced it in SF.

Also, any general advice would be much appreciated."
fl773,2,2011-02-14,I know I'm not the first one,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fl773/i_know_im_not_the_first_one/,"I met my best friend in October of 2002.  I started dating her in October of 2008.  Last Wednesday she broke up with me.

It isn't a ""I just fell out of love"" situation.  We don't hate each other, nobody made a mistake, but we are in a long distance relationship and we are young (I'm 22, almost 23 and she is 20, turning 21 in May).  There are somewhat mutual feelings that being in this relationship at this age, given the distance, there are certain burdens that we're creating for ourselves.  In feeling that the relationship comes first it is easy to miss other opportunities for growth.  

How can I leave her out if I want to travel abroad alone?  How can she take that summer internship she's been dying to get if it means we'll hardly be able to see each other?  How can we remain youthful and committed?

When we broke up on Wednesday I didn't know what to think.  I had passing feelings of anger, sorrow and fear.  I tried to be stoic, I tried thinking that I'd be fine.  I went as long as I could without saying anything to her, but last night I texted asking if we could speak and we ended up having a few hour long conversation online.

It was extremely lucid.  We were speaking to each other like we were bystanders to the relationship.  How we both felt like in the relationship we were giving up on other opportunities, but outside of it we were giving up on what seemed so natural.

I cried like a baby afterwards.  She told me that she loves me.  That makes it so much harder.

I want more than anything else to realize that this isn't real, for her to realize that this is a mistake.  I know we need space and time to feel better, but right now I feel so helpless.  How do I even begin to move on when I feel like we're making the biggest mistake of our lives?

And how do I pick up later?  How do I meet another girl and not think that, even though everything seems perfect, she won't just get up one day and say it's not working out?  How do I even find someone as good as her?

I'm really hung up on this, and I know things will get better - no matter what happens.  But this thought doesn't make it any easer right now."
fl6nd,8,2011-02-14,Any cool robotics labs/startups looking for work this summer? Also a request for general advice.,stonelinks,robotics,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/fl6nd/any_cool_robotics_labsstartups_looking_for_work/,"Junior computer engineering student at RPI here. For the past two and a half years, I have worked at a prestigious university in the same lab designing and building experimental equipment to prototype optics for space telescopes. It has mostly been programming, automation, mechanical design and electrical design within the context of high precision manufacturing and automation for something that hopefully ends up in space.

While working in this lab was and continues to be awesome, my ultimate passion and career interest since elementary school is in robotics. To this end, I think it is time to pursue something more closely related to the field. This leads me to my questions for you, dear /r/robotics:

* First and foremost: are you part of or do you know of any labs / startups looking for a passionate and multi talented programmer, designer and problem solver this summer? References available.

* Are you part of or do you know of any large corporations looking for the same kind of person?

Some more general questions:

* For any of you working at a large corporation, how do you like it? is it as soul sucking as all my friends who did internships / co ops at places like GE, IBM, etc say it is?

* Robotics is a huge field, encompassing computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, etc. I've done a lot of this type of work in my job, at school and in my spare time that can be thought of as 'robotics' in some sense. I know I want to do robotics, but I'm having a hard time settling on any one thing. Could anyone provide a systematic breakdown of the field, or even just elaborate on what you do?

* And just in general, anyone in the field have any sage advice to offer someone in my position? is grad school worth it? is a masters worth it? is academia where all the cool cutting edge work is going on, or should I look at startups? 

Thanks for your time!

**P.S.** Everyone should watch jeopardy tonight or in the next three days. An IBM computer named [Watson](http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/) will be playing against human players. One of the lead programmers is an RPI grad and is coming here to talk about Watson before the match, so I'm really excited for it!"
fm2fv,2,2011-02-15,student/worker not sure what to do?,[deleted],selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/fm2fv/studentworker_not_sure_what_to_do/,"Hi Ask Reddit,

Long time reader first time poster here. I’ve got some situations I need advised on, and would appreciate some internet advice. A little about myself, I’m 50% of an IT department for a medium sized office of a large financial company. I obtained an associate degree in IT (regret) and am currently attending a big boy university for my CS degree, because I want to and got offered some pretty good scholarships.  I got myself into this job while working helpdesk at my first school. They took me on as an intern, then full time, and now make my own hours between classes (averaging 20). I have not had my pay raised above $8 an hour, despite having taken on every role imaginable. I also have not received my state mandated overtime each time I make it above 40 hours. This was all okay because I moderately enjoyed it. Around four months ago I got put in charge of a “paperless solution”, sparing the details this means that I, without help, am tasked with pulling staples out of files every hour of the day. While pulling staples, I am also tasked with responding to the whims and quarrels of anyone who makes more money than me (read: everyone). I’ve, obviously, become disinterested in my job.

I could even handle this because the other IT’er is a cool guy and we get along great, covering each other’s asses from upper management (who is always on our cases). Recently the company hired a new employee who is tasked with doing random things. I, being the young’in, can’t shake the feeling that this new employee is going to be taking over my job; I was asked to teach them each task that I would normally be taking care of…


Questions:

* 1)	Is this how a normal job is supposed to operate? Or am I  just being a baby about it?
                      
* 2)	I am broke because my pay sucks, suggestions? Is $8 average for someone in my position?

* 3)	Should I look for a new job? (I have some leads, and a way in with a major hospital in the area.)

* 4)	What are the possibilities of having a job similar to this while being occupied with classes in the morning?

* 5) WWYD? I’m open to most anything.


Ps: if it sounds like we could be friends or even coworkers and your city has the most superbowl rings, despite a heartbreaking loss recently, PM me!

-Thanks!

flxl0,4,2011-02-15,Are any other programmers incredibly averse to the idea of working for Reddit?,Mob_Of_One,DoesAnybodyElse,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/flxl0/are_any_other_programmers_incredibly_averse_to/,"I doubt they'd pay market, and it seems like it'd be an eternal uphill battle against architectural decisions made in legacy for the sake of a largely ungrateful community.

I don't really like the attitude I get from the job posts they put forth either, like we should feel grateful they're telling us to solve their rat mazes for a shot at a job there.

The Reddit employees I've met seem really nice, but I don't think I'd ever work for Reddit.

Do any other programmers already into their career feel this way? (Students/aspiring interns need not respond, you guys are impressed by being able to pay your bills. ;)

Edits:

To clarify the architecture comment, much of what I've read about various technological decisions (sorry alexis, chris, et al) made by the founders and team at various stages of the company have made me cringe.

I try to be charitable when evaluating decisions and examining situations from the outside, but it's beyond my capacity to cover for the continual problems the site has had since launch. The arrogant, ""you should be excited to work for us"" attitude in the job posts just cements my feelings on the matter.

I don't think Reddit is going to find many experienced and valuable people (and I don't mean me here, I'm in the first leg of my career) willing to deal with a combination of arrogance, many bad legacy decisions, less compensation, and what would likely be startup-esque hours despite having been bought out **years** ago.

Reddit is not cutting edge. It is not well designed. It is not an excellent place to work for.

Humility and humor will impress me, not ""zomg you should be happy to waste your time on our puzzles"".

**Comments from colleagues of mine, some of them more experienced than myself:**

""I fundamentally don't trust companies whose attitude is that you're one of the lucky and few chosen if you manage to get hired by themm [sic]""

""I remember reading about their search algorithms in conjunction with the database schema...I had a similar response [pissing blood cf. my response to kulp]"""

As an intern that only makes $50 a day and is living in Manhattan.  Most of this will be coming out of my tax return.  I like the idea of goose-down, but the water issue is concerning considering I am a novice.  I would like to aim for a 20 degree spec'd bag just because it will be more versatile when I tackle other trails. Are there brands I can always trust? What's a sensible option on temp rating? is the weight/size difference that dramatic between goose and synthetic?

So i figured Reddit is a great market to ask for this kind of help.  I am going into the summer before my last year at a 4 year college.  I have never really worked under anybody else so job searching is new to me.  I spent the past 6 years building a business teaching swim lessons in my neighborhood.  After my second year I was teaching 50-60 lessons a week.

I work great in groups and have had held positions to build emphasize this ever year I have been in college.  I am Majoring in Economics and Computer analysis, and Mathematics (that is 2 not 3).  I am also getting a minor in business management.  I am great with computers, familiar with java (and other text based programs), and I am focusing on statistics.

I am currently employed as a marketing assistant (SEO) though I do very little marketing. The majority of my work is answering the phone as operator. I don’t particularly like my job ,as in, find it intellectually stimulating enough. I don’t have enough work to do. Often I am disciplined by my manager for not doing work , though there is nothing to do. I have asked him on around 5 occasions for something to do; sometimes he says busy at this instant and will get back to me (which he doesn’t). He told me to ask colleagues so that I could help them. But as I am not familiar with what they do, they couldn't give me anything or they were up to date in their work.

I have good ideas for the website but it’s as though my manager has no time for me. We used to have weekly meetings but he delays them because he has more important things to do. Indeed, sometimes the meetings are delayed by weeks. I resent the fact that I don’t have time in the weekdays to work on my own projects, such as video editing, programming and fitness. I am paid minimum wage ( it isn't about the money I have enough savings) and my contract is up for renewal at the end of March for another 3 months (i've been working here since October originally as part of the University's Internship programme).

I am exploring other avenues for my future, for example I've applied to a few university courses and graduate jobs, I do part time courses at the local college (image editing, web design) and i'm in the process of being assessed to become a private tutor. With all that said, youth unemployment is at 20% now, particularly graduates doing rather badly in getting a job. Before, I felt like I didn't have the pre-requisite work experience to get a job but after having done a few internships and other jobs this is no longer the case.

What would you do if you were me? Would you stay or would you go?

EDIT: And before anyone asks, I go to a small state school in Pennsylvania. That's as specific as I'll be.

EDIT: Some more basic info...

I developed an initial liking for Microsoft in middle school when defending them against the Apple fanboy/hipster hybrids. As my education advanced, I developed an interest in technology, and after familiarizing myself with some products, developed a strong liking for those developed by Microsoft. Ever since, I've tried to become an early adopted with each of their products to display my loyalty.

I recently applied for a corporate internship with heir finance department, but do not expect to hear back from them anytime soon.

So! I currently am a college graduate, with an amazing job at an amazing company where my projected net worth in 3 years is 100k a year usd.  At the moment I live in my parents house, my city is expensive and Im a poorly paid intern at the moment which is why i dont have my own place.  So this morning I woke up with a horrific hangover at my gf's house.  After a long day of hangover and having to teach a dance class, i make it home, thinking about my MFLB that awaits me.  Vape once, get to [3]  eat some dinner and fam goes out.  Sweet, lets hit that box.  Cant! Batteries are dead.  Okay, throw them in the charger, takes the ones i use about an hour to charge.  Sweet, they're charged, lets vape again!  *VAPE* feeling good, i burn some oil to mask the air.  My mom walks in not 5 minutes after the oil has burned.  

""Oh why does it smell like burning in here"" 
*poker face* its the oil


She takes the oil dish and washes it out.

*Everything went better than expected*

She comes back 5 minutes later and still comments on the smell, she then says, it smells like marijuana, are you smoking marijuana in this room?

*poker face*No that silly, you know I wouldnt do that.  (note: im asthmatic so im not supposed to smoke ANYTHING it really fucks with me, also the mflb is pretty good, but i still feel gunk in my chest)

She looks like she doesnt believe me completely and i mention ill just open the window (which i fucking should have earlier, but its really cold out :( ).  

I leave with the cup of tea i had earlier to put it in the sink, here she can go and search my desk and find my mflb in the tin, but when i come back with another cup of juice, nothing looks disturbed.  

Great im out of the woods; nope,  not yet.  She comes back a THIRD time and asks why my room has a hint of pot in the air.  I blame it on my clothes that are on the bed.  I was out drinking and at bars around a lot of smokers.  She doesnt seem like she buys it completely and kinda hovers for another minute.  

My mom doesnt work, so she can tear my room apart any day when im out at work, so i need to dump my stash.  Im not about to flush 1/4 down the pisser, so I get the great idea to call my friend to come get it, hes not far and was playing a show so he should be on his way home.  Thankfully he is, so i ask him to come over i need a favor.  

Okay, great, i can dump the stash, but i cant throw it all in a bag and walk past their room, she could jump out and inquire whats in the bag.  I cant say i dont smoke if she grabs a nice ball jar of it from my hands.  I throw the jar in a shirt, throw it in a bag, with my mflb tin and throw it out the window, its just a 2nd floor, and it landed in grass, didnt sound like it broke, ill hope for the best.  My friend comes and gets the bag and here I am.  A bit worried, but the only thing she can do is get a drug test if shes really determined to find out if i smoke.

I dont get it ENTs.  I finished college,  I have no kids (pretty impressive if youre hispanic and over 18),  I have a great job which i guess i can start calling a career, I have no criminal record and im a great happy person.  Why the fuck cant i just smoke a bit of pot, it would be totally okay if i were drinking in my room tho.  I hate that shit.  I need to move out, ASAP.

#[**_EnderMB_**](http://www.reddit.com/user/EnderMB)


## STATS:

&gt; Male or female?
&gt;&gt; Male

&gt; Age?
&gt;&gt; 23

&gt; Relationship Status?
&gt;&gt; In a relationship for about four and a half years.

&gt; What general area of your country you live in? Do you love it?
&gt;&gt; I've lived in Bristol, England all my life. I find it to be one of the nicest cities in the United Kingdom, although one day I'd like to move on somewhere else for a bit, perhaps to America or Australia. However, given that all the good software jobs seem to be in or around the London area I'll probably have to drag my girlfriend there.

## FAVORITES

&gt; Foods/ Beverages?
&gt;&gt; Either Curry (the hotter the better) or Chinese takeaway, and to drink Cherry Coke by day, Beer by night (and sometimes day).

&gt; Movie/ TV?
&gt;&gt; It depends on my mood. South Park: BLAU,  Anchorman, Forrest Gump and the Harry Potter and Rocky movies are all pretty good. I'm a huge fan of stand-up comedy so I love shows like Mock The Week and Live at the Apollo, and I quite like American sitcoms, like Frasier and Scrubs. If it's funny I'll watch it.

&gt;&gt; At the moment I'm somewhat addicted to 30 Rock. I think it's terrible that so many great American sitcoms are overlooked on British TV.

&gt; Music?
&gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of pop-punk, alternative rock, and some older stuff too. My Spotify playlist is full of stuff from Motion City Soundtrack, The Fold, The Smiths, Killswitch Engage, Explosions in the Sky, Millencolin, even a bit of Justin Bieber. I'm really crappy at choosing favourites, so I typically say Foo Fighters, as I rarely hear a crappy Foo Fighters song.

&gt; Books?
&gt;&gt; I quite liked the Abhorsen trilogy, love On The Road by Jack Kerouac and quite like a good autobiography; My Booky Wook by Russell Brand is a fantastic read. I'm not the biggest fan of sci-fi books, but I've (finally) finished what's been released of the Ender's Game series of books and all I can say is ""wow""...

&gt; Games?
&gt;&gt; Chrono Trigger, then Ocarina of Time. Final Fantasy rocks my socks too. I own a Nintendo Wii that will remain unused until Skyward Sword comes out, and a worn-out PS3 that's suffered through hours of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and some FIFA '11 (when people don't rage-quit on me).

## MISCELLANEA:

&gt; What makes you laugh?
&gt;&gt; I'm a big stand-up fan, and I try to go to live shows whenever I have money and/or free time. I love Jimmy Carr, Frankie Boyle, Russell Brand, Jim Jefferies, etc. I also like to watch or listen to something funny at night before I go to sleep (for some reason I struggle to sleep when it's quiet) so I'm usually watching whatever comedy I can find. My current favourites are The Trip with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, the Russell Brand podcast and Jackass.

&gt; What is your biggest pet peeve?
&gt;&gt; People who fail to regard the feelings of others really piss me off.
More often than not I tend to be nice to strangers. If someone is running for the lift (elevator to you Americans) I keep it open for them, if I'm only going up a couple of floors I take the stairs, when driving I tend to let people out, etc. Most of my annoyances come from people who cut me up on the road, groups of people who wait ages for the lift only to get off at floors 2 and 3 (I'm on floor 13 and I take the stairs at least half of the time!), just small things that tend to add up during a shitty day.

&gt; What was the best thing about the last 12 months?
&gt;&gt; I finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, had a stress-free summer working on an internship (who now hired me full-time), got to speak to Nick Clegg at a Q&amp;A event and got to spend some quality time with my girlfriend. I spent a few months  studying for my Masters,  but I left due to money-issues and a lack of interest.

&gt; What are you looking forward to in the next 12 months?
&gt;&gt; I'm not too sure really, hopefully getting a raise (or looking for a new job), saving some money and going on a nice holiday somewhere. Hopefully I'll have time to work on something fun in my spare time, like a new Android application or a fun website.

&gt; All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?
&gt;&gt; Life. You were given one and it's your duty to live it.

## REGARDING REDDIT:

&gt; What is the origin or meaning of your user name?
&gt;&gt; At the time it just sounded cool, but then people kept asking me if it was a reference to Enders Game. I remember reading it a few years ago and it's probably where I got the name from. I've used a bunch of other usernames on different websites over the years, and the vast majority of them just come to me when I think of something that sounds cool.

&gt; Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?
&gt;&gt; Just this one. I don't really understand the need to have anonymous accounts or identities for different parts of Reddit.

&gt; What is your favourite part of reddit?
&gt;&gt; I joined Reddit after about two painful years on Digg, and used Reddit mainly for its CompSci, Programming and Java subreddits as the level of posting and commenting was far-above that of Digg. I eventually branched out into other parts and then realised that I hadn't logged into Digg in around a year.

&gt;&gt; Over the past year and a bit most of my time on the Internet is spent at Reddit, although I do spend a fair bit of time on Twitter and the BBC sport section too.

&gt; What do you do when you’re not on reddit?
&gt;&gt; I'm a web developer for a legal services company. To keep the nerds interested I am primarily a .NET guy, although on occasion I've been known to use Python with my Umbraco projects or do PHP work for external clients. Hell, a lot of the time I'm the one designing pages in Photoshop and writing the HTML and CSS behind them too. I don't get paid much, but there aren't many jobs out there for recent graduates so unless some opportunity at a large company like HP or IBM comes along I'm stuck here. It's not that bad a job, and I get a lot of freedom to do what I please with my projects.

&gt;&gt; Outside of that I live a double life. I mix between playing FIFA '11 and Football Manager, going out drinking with the guys, watching football and spending time with my girlfriend, and watching old Anime shows (Dragonball, Love Hina, Evangelion, Shaman King and Tenchi rock my socks), playing old RPG's and working on small programming projects. I've got a small group of very close friends and even though a bunch of them have moved around to find work we still meet up every now and again and tear it up.

&gt;&gt; Many people I know don't really see my nerdy side, and people tend to be surprised when I join in a conversation about who would win in a fight between Goku from DBZ and Superman.

&gt; Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?
&gt;&gt; Of course, any social website will change with its audience almost daily, just like everything else in life. As long as Reddit continues to understand its audience and its current vision for a social news website we'll be just fine.

&gt; If so, do you think it’s been for the better?
&gt;&gt; That's hard to say, because certain subreddits I frequent change drastically over certain periods. I'm a huge contributor to /r/Soccer and over the summer the user count almost doubled thanks to the World Cup; that had benefits in regular IRC game chats and added discussion and drawbacks in dumbasses that wanted to ruin the fun for everyone.

## FINAL QUESTION:

&gt; Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?
&gt;&gt; As I've got the opportunity, I'd like to plug a cool independent pop/rock band that I've grown to like over the past year or two, named The Fold.  They all seem like cool guys and they're living the dream, and whenever I listen to a song of theirs I usually plug it on /r/ListenToThis.

&gt;&gt; Sadly, none of the small projects I've been working on are even close to completion, so I can't provide a link or plug it. My two main projects at the moment are a football diving catalogue site and a rather unique article system, both in ASP.NET. I'm sure that I'll post both, both on /r/soccer and on /r/startups.

fr45b,0,2011-02-23,"Generation Y, Millennials: Surge in Serving America? ",Our_Values,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fr45b/generation_y_millennials_surge_in_serving_america/,"Do you know where Generation Y is headed, besides into debt? Service! We seem to be flocking toward serving America. Today, we’ll look at why that poses other problems for our generation.

All this week, we’re looking at challenges facing Generation Y—those aged 18-29, sometimes called Millennials or even the Boomerang Generation. Yesterday, we looked at Millennials’ boundless optimism. As a generation, we’re restlessly searching for options. Some of us travel, some go back to school and many of us compete to the death for unpaid internships. What do these options all have in common? They’re incredibly expensive, and add to the huge debt Millennials will spend decades trying to pay off.

The average college student graduates $24,000 in debt. With alarming unemployment levels, this kind of debt leaves many students looking toward options such as federally funded service programs that defer or cancel student loans—especially Peace Corps, AmeriCorps or the Armed Forces. Recruitment numbers for all three have dramatically increased over the past five years. In fact, applicant numbers for AmeriCorps, which includes the popular Teach for America program, nearly tripled in the past two years.

Though these programs are often short-term, they offer young adults a meaningful way to pass the time as they wait for more career opportunities to open up. As a result, Millennials gain needed experience, make important connections, and give back to their communities and country.

Researchers maintain that other factors aside from the economy also contribute to the surge in service among young people. National tragedies, including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, as well as President Obama’s call to service have encouraged Millennials to act for change.

Whatever is driving our generation in this direction, acceptance rates in these programs are edging toward the very employment numbers young adults are trying to avoid in a competitive job market. Teach for America, which boasts recruitment of the most “elite college graduates,” accepts a mere 12 percent of all applicants—a rate on par or lower than acceptance at most Ivy League universities. Most young adults looking into service programs are left in the same discouraging, unemployed position as before.

What are young graduates left to do? Teach for America promises to double the number of corps members it accepts by 2015, but is this enough to change prospects for the millions of Millennials?

What do you think? Will that help?
Should the government expand service programs?
Will service programs remain popular if the economy improves?

fqwz1,23,2011-02-23,Any tips for a guy who can't pay his credit card/loan bills?,helpimbroke,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/fqwz1/any_tips_for_a_guy_who_cant_pay_his_credit/,"Quick backstory:
I wasn't always frugal, and in the 2 years after graduating 5 years ago (engineering), I racked up some stupid debt in addition to student loans, mostly building project cars. I had it under control but two years later, a job change, cross-country move, and car-engine-failure later I had built-up debt to uncomfortable levels ($45k).

Last winter, I got an opportunity to go to school overseas for some schooling related to my dream career. I got nearly a full scholarship, but I decided that to do it without going farther into debt I would have to really change my lifestyle. This was a success story. I sold my car and took the bus. I made meals. I drank less. I terminated the lease on my apartment instead of letting it sit empty when I was gone. I actually paid down my debt more than usual at the same time as paying for school, which lasted from June until August. Win!

Before that was over, I was offered an internship in a different country, for 6 months but with only a $2800 bursary at the end. I said yes, and had 6 weeks in between to save money. Through good luck with a temporary contract, I thought I saved up enough to last the whole 6 months, including making minimum payments. While here, I lived in a dorm and ate cheaply, and got a free bike instead of taking the bus.

I am at the end of month 4, and broke. Current debt level is $37k, almost all of it is unsecured. I have been procrastinating but I know I need to call my creditors and tell them I can't pay right now. I don't have a job to go to yet, but I think my prospects are good. I do not have a work visa in this country and am not willing to risk closing the door on coming back by working. Once working, I expect to be able to live comfortably and pay down my debt in about 3-4 years.

My **first dilemma** is I am really scared of making the phone calls. Has anyone here been through this, especially in the Canadian system? What can I expect?

My **second dilemma** is that after this internship, I can get a full scholarship in my dream field for a PhD. It would start one year from now and last for 4-5 years. Is it worth walking away from debts? I don't feel good about the idea, but I feel terrible about not going for it. I am at the upper age limit for this option, so doing it later won't work.

**tl;dr: Have no income and can't pay my debts ($37k). Help me grow balls to call creditors. I can pay them in a few months again, but then need to make a decision: pay debts or get PhD.**

I know this is only sort-of on topic here, but it's an embarrassing, difficult issue that I hope others can shed some light on. It's also very hard to find information online: it's all blogspam and bankruptcy agencies.

edit: typo in the tl;dr

**update**:

Thank you all for the advice and surprising udeserved kindness. I've got some academic advice as well and made my plans more flexible. I can do this without bankruptcy or being a deadbeat. Here is my plan:

1. 
Working on budget for my working year plus school years right now. **done**
2. 
Call creditors when they open in the morning to defer payments for four months (after leaving here and starting work). Ideally I want to pay everything but I will look at making a payment proposal and consolidation.. **done**. One isn't too interested in my current situation and is calling back in 3 weeks to arrange a payment schedule, when their system triggers for a missed payment. This seems odd and I will probably call in a week to see if I can deal with things BEFORE a missed payment. I keep getting stuck on hold on the other one, and have yet to connect before my crappy wireless connection kicks me off. **update**: got through to them and they were VERY nice. Switched me to interest-only payments until I have an income.
3. 
Set up appointment with a financial planner. I want some independent professional advice too.
4. 
Finish application for PhD. Turns out it's flexible, I can leave after personal research (1 year) or a master's (3 years). My realistic goal is master's, but if debt payments go well I can get the PhD. If they go badly I will still get a year of experience in the field. **in progress, going well**
5. 
Apply for more jobs. My focus is on cities with potential roommates and jobs with overtime. **in progress**. So far have one rejection and one headhunter talking to me, and two cheap places to stay in two different cities.
6. 
For all my decisions, I am going to try and be realistic. I am not simply getting the PhD no matter what. I will estimate best and worst case scenarios for how much extra interest it will cost me. Off the top of my head, I think this will be $25 to $30k extra in the worst case. I might have $20k or more remaining to pay when I am done. Ouch, but could be worth it.

Found out I CAN work with the scholarship, up to 20 hours a week. Got a really good connection for a part time job, but obviously can't rely on it when I won't be back for over a year. It's a positive development though.

fqt7a,32,2011-02-22,IAmA sexual assault survivor who didn't physically fight back. AMA,wantedtosurvive,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fqt7a/iama_sexual_assault_survivor_who_didnt_physically/,"In October of 2009 I was sexually assaulted.  It was 2am and at the time, I lived in a fairly dangerous neighborhood that was definitely no good to be traveling around late at night as a young female.  I am 5'3, 115lbs and of petite build.  However, I've been a student of many styles of martial arts starting at seven years old.  At the age of fifteen, I started interning with the local law enforcement as an observer.  There too, I learned many self defense skills.  I'm no superwoman, but very often my sparring partners were quite larger and stronger than me.  I'm no stranger to grappling with men or women that are considerably larger then I.

When I entered college I majored and graduated with a criminology degree.  I traveled abroad and interned in an all male prison for several months shadowing officers as they go about their daily routine.  Quite frequently, it would be me - an officer - and a room full of convicted persons.  (Before anyone calls bull; this was a British prison, so apparently this was allowed.  When I interned in prisons at the state, very rarely was I in direct contact with the prisoners).

Now back to the story.  I was out of cigarettes and had a mad craving (I have since then quit, it's nice to be able to run again).  So I decided to safest way to get to a gas station to pick up the goods would be to take a taxi to the station.  At no time did I ever believe what was going to happen next.  The driver was friendly, talkative and .. distracting.  It was three minutes into the ride before I realized that we were not going to the location I requested.  I asked him where we were going, thinking (sadly naively) that he was aiming for a different route.  Indeed, he was.  An alleyway.  More specifically, a very narrow alleyway.  The size of the taxi made it so that opening the door to step out was next to impossible.  I wonder if I could've squeezed out in time, but I didn't have that opportunity.  The driver parked the car and lunged over the backseat to where I was.  It was bench seating, so there was plenty of room for him to get beside me.

I can't say I have years of experience with violent offenders, as of now I am only in my mid twenties.  But I knew one thing; 'no' was not going to work.  Something about this man told me that he was going to hurt me badly if I resisted.  Everything about his behavior told me that he was going to get what he wanted, and that included harming me in the process.  At first he insisted he just wanted to give me a back rub.  I told him no, to back out, and to let me go.  He wasn't going to.  I was in a tough spot, a confined area with a man who easily outweighed me and was notably much stronger than I was.  The one important lesson I learned during my studies and various interns was 'deescalation'  He was going to sexually assault me and there was no way out of this vehicle without him getting ahold of me.

So I started talking.  I told him my name.  I told him I had a boyfriend.  As he fumbled with trying to take my clothes off, between each 'no' I said I kept talking about my family, my school, my hobbies and the things that I wanted to do.  I was meat to him, but I wanted him to see me as a person.  There's no doubt I was terrified, what came out of my mouth was more desperation than bravery.  I just wanted to get away without injury, without being raped and not to die in the back seat of a taxi car.

He got my pants down along with my underwear.  I kept full body contact at bay by countering his hands with my arms, pushing them away or to the side - trying to slow him down with what he was attempting to do so I could continue to talk.  Thankfully, the time it took for him to try and remove my clothing he had gotten so excited that he ejaculated on my thigh.  He was smiling the whole time, speaking to me 'sweetly' as he was assaulting me.  He even offered me a folded towel to wipe my leg off.  I dressed as he climbed back into the front of the seat and he even offered to drive me home.  When he pulled out of the alleyway, I threw open the door and bolted from the car.  I didn't know what where I was, but a kind stranger helped me find my way back to the apartment.

I found out later through news (and recognizing the MO) that I was his third victim.  He picked up young women late at night and sexually assaulted them.  The first two weren't so lucky.  Both women were beaten so badly they were almost unrecognizable even to their own parents, left on the street curb like trash.

He was even so bold that two nights later, he rang my doorbell and requested me for 'another date'.  My family was with me at this point to help me recover, and my very brave mother and sister ran outside and took both his picture and his license plate photo.  The entire time, he kept telling them:  ""Why do you do this?  I did nothing wrong!""  

He was never caught.  The police told me he was likely an illegal immigrant.  The photo evidence and the license photo lead to a dead end.

Herein lies what guilt that haunts me.

Should I have fought him?  As ridiculous as it sounds, in the back of my mind I feel ashamed that my 'self defense' consisted of begging to be brought home and not harmed.  My 'self defense' was repeatedly telling him no and trying to keep his hands off me.  I didn't do what I was taught.  Jab my fingers in his eyes.  Hit him in the throat.  Anything, everything I know that could hurt him badly and him render him injured enough that I could have attempted to escape without being assaulted.

I'm not saying that I was 'asking for it' because I didn't fight back.  I don't believe I deserved what happened because I didn't go at him with tooth and nail.  But I wanted to go home to my family, I wanted to live.  Out of the three victims, I went home without a physical scratch - but the mental trauma will last much longer. 

So Redditors, I'm asking you.  The dark part of my heart calls me a coward for letting him use me that way without going down fighting.  I feel ashamed in light of the women who died fighting to keep people like him (or her in any situation) from violating their body.

Redditors, Did I do what I had to do to survive this situation?  Or am I a coward?"

fsbk0,14,2011-02-24,I need help fighting a ridiculous Rogers cell phone bill,johnwalkr,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fsbk0/i_need_help_fighting_a_ridiculous_rogers_cell/,"In October of 2010, I upgraded to an iphone4 after weeks of trying to get one. This extended my contract to three years. I though carefully about this because...

At the end of October I moved to Japan for an internship. Sometime in November I called Rogers and cancelled my contract. This cost $400 plus 30 days of service from the day that I cancelled. This was understood by me previously and I paid the bill in full as soon as I got it.

In the meantime, I waited for a way to unlock my iPhone so I could use it in Japan. In early January, I found out that Rogers was offering unlocks to people will phones paid in full for $50. I fell in this category and called them.

After about 2 hours on hold and being passed around various departments, it was determined by the ""unlocking department"" that I could not use a credit card to pay $50 to have my phone unlocked because my account had been deactivated. Note the word account  was used by Rogers. Another department offered to reactivate my account so that I could receive a bill for $50. I accepted this offer and then was transferred back to the unlocking department and it was unlocked without hassle. At no point was I told that activating my account had any other purpose aside from sending me a $50 bill, and was not informed of any changes to my contract or state of service. The word ""account"" was always used, ""activating my number"" was never used. My understanding was that ""account"" is not a synonym for ""service"" or ""phone number"". After all, you can have more than one phone number in one account.

I informed Rogers of my situation, living in a different country, and intent on using the phone with SoftBank, a Japanese provider.

Yesterday I received a bill by email for approximately $130. It is for 1 month of service plus the $50 unlock fee. I have not used my Rogers sim card since arriving in Japan, so until this bill I had no idea of any Rogers services that were active.

I emailed Rogers to have the service charges reversed, and explained the situation, the fact that I live in Japan and my previous call to have the phone unlocked. The reply was that I had to call back. They gave me a number with a 416 area code and informed me it would be long distance while ""traveling in Japan"".

I called them yesterday and was told that it was policy that I had to have an ""account and service in good standing"" in order to be unlocked, and was rudely told that I should have known my service and number would be reactivated, as it was the only way that it was possible to unlock the phone.

I tried to explain that this was absurd, because I specifically said that I wanted an unlocked phone to use in a different country with a different provider, and that I would not be in Canada in the near future, and would not need Canadian service. I asked them if they understood why I was confused that my number and service was started again and was told there was nothing I could do. Since Rogers policy is that I need to have a plan to unlock the phone, I would have to pay the current bill and re-cancel, incurring an extra 30 days charges from now.

At this point I was informed that when I unlocked my phone, the following happened:

* 
My $400 cancellation fee was returned to my account
* 
My account was reactivated
* 
A $50 fee was added for unlock
* 
My number was reactivated and monthly plan reinstated
* 
My 3 year contract was renewed

All I was ever informed of previously was:

* 
Account would be reactivated
* 
$50 charge would be billed to me

I talked to a manager, and she repeated Rogers policy and would not discuss reversing any charges. I asked her if she understood why I was confused at why things happened that I did not agree to. She would not respond to this question and offered to cancel my contract again. She stated this would take back the $400 charge in my account, and take effect in 30 days. I said that ""I certainly don't need Canadian service"", not wanting to accidentally agree to any charges.

She stated that I would be billed the $400, current bill, and for 30 days. I stated that I would not pay for the currently billed or any future service. I asked if there was anyone else I could talk to or any other recourse. She replied ""no"". I informed her that I would be seeking legal and other advice and would not be paying anything beyond the $50 unlock fee.

Unfortunately, I paid my previous bills using online banking, not using a credit card, so I have no recourse that way.

What now?

**tl;dr**
I tried to pay Rogers $50 to unlock my completely paid for iPhone 4 after cancelling my service. I agreed to reactivate my account for the purpose of receiving a $50 bill only. I explained that I was in a different country and wanted to use a different service provider, and needed NO Canadian service. The reactivated my account, renewed my contract and started billing for service again. The will not reverse any charges. What do I do?"
fsyxl,2,2011-02-25,"We're at ""that point"" in the relationship and I just don't know where to go.",[deleted],relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/fsyxl/were_at_that_point_in_the_relationship_and_i_just/,"**The Beginning**

Man, we started off poorly. There is no reason we should be together still. She had just left her husband that was abusive. She was my manager. I was a friend that wanted to get her out and making friends and interacting with people. And we started sleeping together. I told her I didn't want a relationship; she didn't want one, either. But she spent the night. And the next. And the next. And we didn't want relationships. But spent every day together.

Months past, and the girl of my dreams was suddenly on a break. I'd pushed her into it. I left the girl I was seeing. She was, at that point, what I called a booty call, but we still never left each other's side. The girl of my dreams went back to her boyfriend, I went back to the booty call. We kept at each other's side. Then dream girl was single. By this point, booty call had developed into girlfriend. I dumped her. Told her I was crazy about the other girl, that she was marriage material. I didn't see that with the current relationship. A day later, I asked her back. A week later, I dumped her again and went on a date with the dream girl. I couldn't do it. Three days later, I was back with the girlfriend.

We had a threesome, and the other girl tried stealing her from me. She was honest the whole time and kept me in the know. Nothing happened. Then we started falling apart again and she cheated on me. It crushed me, tore me apart. And I still gave her a chance again. I buried my pain and despair and isolation and stayed with her because... I don't know. It was easier? She was honest during the whole ordeal and seemed changed?

Then she took an internship a state away. It was less than a year at this point, and yet we decided on distance. Sometimes it was great, sometimes it was horrible. She left her internship and turned down a job offer to move back with me. We started living together after a year and a half.

Then our roommate became a heroin addict. She started working at a job I got her while I bumbled around with side jobs and retail. Our roommate became a heroin addict. She became more and more stressed.

**Now**

She's still working full time, school full-time. The roommate is clean and may be moving out. Her stress is down, but she's getting afraid that she's not ready for a real relationship. Going straight from the marriage to me meant she skipped the dating scene. She married young. She loves me and thinks of me as her best friend, but has this fear that she's missing out on dating.

I have a real job, but she's heading back out of state for the internship, and if they offer her a job again, she's taking it. I had decided to move down with her, which scares me shitless.

I'm crazy about her and want to go for broke right now. But if she doesn't know where she's going with wanting other dating experience, I don't think I can move with her.

Our two-year is in April, and we've been all over the place. We've been through a ton, and we're finally getting to a happy point, which makes it seem so frustrating that this is where we're closest to breaking up.

I'm just being supportive of her and letting her work through this. We're trying to communicate as much as possible and be honest with each other. It frustrates me to no end, but when we're happy, we're the happiest we've been in life. She's my best friend and I'm hers. We love each other, but sometimes that's not enough. 

I want to stick with this, but I also don't want to get hurt any more than I already will. We fucked up and made it through it, we're fighting to get a successful life for ourselves, and we're both pretty scared that this could be the relationship that we stay in for life.

Ultimately I know that her fears are ones that only she can get over. Are there ways I can be supportive? Is this something that can be overcome? 

I'm trying to stay with this; I'm trying to be supportive and caring. But it's scary as shit knowing that everything might fade away and I could lose someone so important to me."
ftyac,2,2011-02-27,I couldn't help but feel this way whenever my bf went on business trips. ,jinniepurple,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ftyac/i_couldnt_help_but_feel_this_way_whenever_my_bf/,"I'm 23, full-time graduate student. My bf is 27, working full time. We have been together for 2.5 years and it's going great. One thing that bothers me is he goes on business trips a lot. On average once or twice a month for about four days. Everytime he went away I felt a little sad but I kept it to myself. I know that he loves going on business trips and the last thing I want is to make him feel bad about having fun on his trips. The problem is that I could not stop myself from feeling sad. I sometimes feel it is silly to be upset about stuff like this because it's not like he's taking a long trip and I'll be seeing him soon. 
I was wondering if anybody else feels the same way about their SO when they are leaving for short times. 
Another thing is I don't like being so emotionally dependent on him. I am always an independent person and take care of myself. I have many hobbies that don't involve him. But lately I feel that I have a need to see him everyday, which is why I went over to his place every night after school. (We live about ten minutes apart in the city) 
I thought about not going to his place so often to get my old self back, but it was a lot more difficult than I thought. 
Please help. I really don't want to feel this way. I'm already distracting myself with focusing on school and looking for summer internships. I guess I'm looking for advice and moral support on regaining my emotional independence. "
funoq,0,2011-02-28,"Have a girlfriend, great career aspirations, lot of friends, yet my body image makes me depressed....",helpneeded321654,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/funoq/have_a_girlfriend_great_career_aspirations_lot_of/,"She tells me i am handsome and sexy...........yet i don't believe her. I have always had a problem with the way I look. I am about 6'6"", weighing about 195 pounds. I used to be same height but in the 160's 2 years ago. I used to be really skinny and hated it. Then I stopped taking my ADHD medication, cause it was just a crutch, and gained a good amount of weight at my internship last summer. I worked out for those 3 months every other night. I looked pretty damn good at the end of the summer and liked the way my physique was kept up.

I met my girlfriend in September when she was obviously first physically attracted to me. Since then I haven't really worked out at all because I am in school. Our work out facilities are very sub par here at my college. And I am always occupied with school So now I am just skinny and not very muscular.

Not muscular at all actually. We have spring break coming up in 2 weeks, so I am nervous to take my shirt off. I also have a very hairy chest and arms. Bottom line is I hear my girlfriend say she thinks I look hot, yet I don't believe a word she says.

Bottom line is i don't think i look good and it actually has gotten to the point where it bothers me that she says i look good because I don't think i do. I can't work out enough in these 2 weeks to make me look that much better at spring break..........so i will be nervous.

Anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to convince yourself you are better looking, when your brain keeps telling you that you aren't?"

fu2nk,0,2011-02-27,Need advice on how to get back together with EX GF.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fu2nk/need_advice_on_how_to_get_back_together_with_ex_gf/,"I am a M 23 who had been dating F 23 for nearly 3 years throughout college. She has been out of college for a year and has a full time job. Anyway, I started an internship 3 hours away Jan 10, which turned out to be horrible timing since things were a little shaky, and we wound up breaking it off on good terms shortly thereafter. this past weekend I was back at school for a mid-term and we had a good time; had lunch, went back to her place for wine and movies, cuddled and slept (yes, only sleeping) together, went out for brunch and bloody marys... good weekend. The problem is any further advances made by me were met with here saying, ""It would just complicate things."" I did manage to get some goodbye kisses however. I still love here very much and would like to get back together, is there anything I can say/do do get past here defenses?

TLDR: Had good weekend with ex gf, could feel something between us still. looking for advice on what to say/do to help assist in getting back together."
