mwilf,1,2011-12-01,"Exactly, how bad is adderall? Should I be using it? Details inside.",[deleted],askscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/mwilf/exactly_how_bad_is_adderall_should_i_be_using_it/,"**Background:** When I was younger I was diagnosed with mild ADHD. I was an absolutely obnoxious little kid and my parents are very proud the way I have mellowed out and grown up. They have said ""We honestly thought that you would be in prison at this age.""

They had the option to put me on meds, which would have made their life much easier. They gave them to me ONCE, I said I didn't like how it made me feel, and they never gave it to me again.

To deal with my obnoxiousness, they really just got lenient with raising me. Kind of ""Let him do what he wants, he'll wear himself out"" strategy. I was babied in order to keep me in line and didn't learn much self discipline.

By high school I had mellowed out. I obeyed my parents and have yet to ever be in trouble woth the law. My irresponsibility continued and I just cruised through high school with little motivation. Without trying, I averaged a 3.2 gpa. I could just never get myself to focus for longer than 30min at a time.

**Now:** I am now a Senior Mechanical Engineering student and have a 2.8 gpa. For three years I struggled with ""should I take medecine for ADHD."" I knew that all it entailed was going to a doctor and asking for it. There was no real diagnosis process. Did I really need it? Could I not focus just because I was lazy? Am I lazy and unmotivated because of my (possibly self-percieved) lack of self discipline and irresponsibility? And if it was because of never learning those traits, did it really matter if that was what was holding me back and adderall would improve it?

After struggling with this and spending hours upon hours on engineering assignments staring blankly at the page, I decided I would try it. It has been two months since I've been taking adderall. All I take is 10mg twice a day. In two months, I have pursued  college recruiters and gotten three interviews and been offered all three jobs. I chose my perfect internship from the three. I'm no longer sleepy all day like I used to be, but instead I have a steady flow if energy from 7am until 8pm. My intelligence is starting to show, motivating me to work harder. I have been able to focus longer on assignments and have solved problems that I never knew I was able to solve. I am more social, and am contacting family members much more frequently.

**Question:** In the back of my mind, I feel like this is wrong. Do I really need it? It IS a drug, but if it is improving my life, is it really that bad? Is it possible that, if I really just hadn't learned self discipline / responsibility in my developmental years, that adderall could justifiably compensate for that until it has actually enabled me to learn those life skills?

Help would be great, Reddit. The anonymity of the website and supportive community allows people to get advice on such things. 

**tl;dr;** Was an obnoxious child. I feel because of this I may not have developed  crucial self discipline / responsibility skills. Parents accepted my declination to adhd medication when diagnosed. Senior in college, decided to get adderall perscribed. (10mg twice a day). Life seems to have greatly improved in the two months but, do I really need it?"

I recently had a paper accepted by a conference and was invited to present. Unfortunately, I think attending the conference will be prohibitively expensive once travel, lodging, and registration are summed up. I graduated a few months ago, so I'm no longer officially associated with a department that could pay for these expenses, and for the time being I'm a part time intern who is paid enough to cover food and rent but not enough to attend conferences out of pocket.

I've heard rumors that there are grants available from various organizations for the purpose of covering conference costs, but I don't know where to look to find these grants. Does academic publishing know where I should look?

Edit: Quite a few people have asked for the same info, so I figured I'll put it up here. The paper was accepted by the Broadcast Education Association (BEA) [conference](http://www.beaweb.org/bea2011.html). The paper itself is about a bill introduced in the Senate regarding federal regulation of online consumer privacy, and in general I keep a foot in computing/IT and in science/technology policy.

The paper itself started as an assignment for a class I took in the last semester of my master's work. The professor for that class provided the feedback and assistance of a typical class paper, and was the person who suggested I submit the paper to this conference. However, this professor hasn't had the time to be a second author, so the paper has been submitted with myself as the solo author. And to add one final bit of important info, the class and professor for whom I wrote this paper are not from my home department while I was a masters student, though there is definitely overlap between the content of this paper and the focus of my home department.

Thanks to everybody who has responded! I'm getting a better sense of where I need to look for help."

Dear Dr. Tyson,

Because of the Ask Me Anything you recently conducted through Reddit, I know you have some familiarity with the community there. Currently, the atheism board is engaged in a full-throttle fundraiser for the extraordinarily worthy cause Doctors Without Borders. So far, we have raised over $100,000, and we're hoping to get far more by the end-of-the-year-deadline! I'm sure you are aware that you are a hero to the r/atheism community, and that there are countless posts praising your devotion to science and your excellent track record as a brilliant, well-spoken spokesperson for science.

Keeping this in mind, I was hoping you would consider lending a hand to the fundraiser. If you were to go to r/atheism and create a post promising some sort of special distinction (Twitter call-out, ten-second personalized video response, etc.) to anyone who donates a certain amount (say $100 or above), I think the response would be overwhelming, and would easily send the fundraiser over the $200K hurdle. I know you are a very, very busy man, but if this is something you (perhaps with the aid of one of your obliging interns/ site admins) could take the time to do, it would be of immense benefit to the charity drive.

Respectfully yours,
[PipPipCheerio's real name]

If we could get him on board, I'm sure we could clear $200K by the end of the year easily. I'm betting items in his email inbox can easily be overlooked due to sheer volume, so email him/ tweet him yourself too if you're interested in seeing this happen!"

Something is wrong with me. I was turned down for EVERY job I applied for. From engineering internships to grocery stores. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!
  
I constantly fantasize about getting in a van and just driving away. I don't know where, maybe Oregon. But I am very afraid this is how people become homeless and eventually die. I don't I'm that different from homeless people though. We're both ghosts. I feel so cold and invisible.

What's the point in starving myself if I'm going to make my body look like shit with cuts? I like them though. My favorite is from when I took a lot of cocaine. I don't really remember it well. I did it because I couldn't feel anything. That area still feels ""off"" and it's been a couple years now. I'm so attached and fond of all of my scars. I carved a scull and crossbones sort of lightly a while back. It' pretty faded now, I didn't go too deep because i wanted to get the contours right. i am poison. is this a juvenile idea? I don't like when people cut in straight lines. I started playing tic tac toe.

But i threw everything away. The doodles on my thigh feel nice and are entertaining, but they aren't enough anymore. I'm scared because the only satisfying place to cut seems to be my wrist. And this is not good because I don't think I will commit suicide, when I do, by cutting. And I don't want to make my family sad before they have to be. I don't want anyone to see.

Maybe by not cutting on my wrists, I'm still keeping hope for my future. Is that strange? I want to be a doctor. I know I'm fucked up but I have a solid gpa and go to a really good school. i got accepted to a highly competitive internship for next semester and i have an interview for another tomorrow.

what the point anymore i mean im not going to even be alive much longer. i hate this. i fucking know i fucking know that i know. i cannot fucking think. i fucking know that on some level i want this and i want to be ok. that's why i havent fucking done it yet. that's why i cant fucking take myself fucking seriously. i shouldnt have listened to aaron. i should have kept my razors. i took the last of my ""emergent"" hydrocodone and the only beer i had.

dont take hydrocodone without at least one beer! total waste. 

i want to live but i cant anymore. 

things that might justify me killing myself. 
1. none of these reasons will be justification for me leaving my family but here goes. 
2. i guess one wasnt a point. and neither is this. 
3. i was raped last summer and havent had sex sober even since even though i had a boyfriend for 6 months
4. i've broken every person ive ever been with. a book by a woman named marya put it nicely and i'm afraid i cant describe it as poetically. breaking people just to break them. just because you can. i cheat on everyone.
5. i think im gay but i give really good head. 
6. like really good.
7. im really high
8. i miss cocaine. so badly. every day. every fucking single fucking day. 
9. daddy hit me
10 then he touched me
11. then he hit mommy
12 every day
13 my family expects too much of me blahblabhalbhabhlabh first world problems
14. i guess none of my reasons are good enough. 
15 oh yeah i think i sort of accidentally an eating disorder over the past 3 years. 
16. and might have bdd
17 and i have no friends and ive never had any friends. and whenevr i have friends  they all end up hating me even though i dont do anything

mz90d,1,2011-12-03,I'm a terrible person.,fuctupkid,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/mz90d/im_a_terrible_person/,"I don't really care if anyone even sees this but I wanted to put my feelings to text and throw it to the wind. 

It all started 2 years ago when I was at a party with a bunch of friends. One of them was my best friend I've known since 5th grade, his roommate was a girl. She was beautiful to me, her face lit up the room. We danced around each other for a few weeks. I had recently gotten burned by a girl and had just really gotten over it, when I started sleeping with my friend's roommate, just sleeping so far. She was a virgin, I'm a whore. She asked me to take her virginity, and I didn't even blink. We started having sex, only really at the parties at her house. I was still not willing to trust, she was too new to relationships. I ended up moving home for a few months and not seeing her for that time. I had heard that she was mad about it, but I drowned myself in various forms of distraction from life. 

I carried on my life, and I thought she had carried on with hers, but as it turns out she was just waiting for me to come back. And I did. I could never say no to her, anything she wanted was hers, from my body, my things, my heart. About a year and a half ago, 6 months after we started our little affair, she finally gave me an ultimatum: We started dating, or we stopped having sex. 

I decided then and there to date her, I feel like I was already in love with her at that point. It took me longer to say it to her, and to really realize that I did fall in love with this girl.

Fast forward a year. We are living on our own in our nice apartment, I had a good job, she was interning in the field she loved, we were in love and nothing could stop us. 

The day it all changed was a Friday, right around noon. I got fired from my nice cushy job. Not to get into too many details, I hated the place, the people, the work, and I probably let it show too much, I had stayed only because they paid so well, but it leaked through. I let her down was my first thought. She had always put a lot of pressure on me to succeed. Partially because I'm very capable but lazy as hell, partially because we had already started discussing the rest of our lives together. 

That was the day everything went to shit. As closely as I can pinpoint it. She was very disappointed in me. It took a while but she began resenting me for it. Even now I'm still unemployed. 

I started seeing her pushing me to succeed as her trying to change me. I started seeing her neediness as clingy, dependence, weakness. I began pulling away. My feeling changed. But I didn't say anything. I would drop hints, but never outright say it. Even now I'm not sure how much was cowardice or hope that it was just a rough patch. 

We got by for awhile with just her working as an intern by me working odd jobs, ebaying stuff, selling drugs. It was stressful and probably didn't help.

We're almost to the end of the story, but it gets significantly worse. 

I became friends with this couple. Me and the girl would hang out a lot as our significant others had jobs and we didn't. I felt a tension between me and her, but brushed it off as me being weird, she had a boyfriend, me a girlfriend, her for 3 years, me for a year and change. 

Sept 29th, me and this girl were sitting on a couch watching TV, when she leaned her head against my shoulder. My heart started trying to beat out of my chest. She heard it, and asked me why my heart was beating so fast, with what I now know was anticipation. I sputtered something about having a fast heart beat for a moment, but we locked eyes, and our faces leaned in and we kissed, ""that's why."" was all I could say. As they say from there one thing led to another.

So we cheated on our significant others. It became addictive. We snuck around and lied and were bad, but it felt so good. I think we both considered only once actually coming clean, it was quickly discarded for being hard and scary. I could feel myself slipping further away from my girlfriend and developing feelings for this new girl.

My girlfriend could tell something was up. She started looking at my text messages, reading my facebook chats, throwing fits when I would go out. Instead of making me regret my actions it just made me angry.

Yesterday, my girlfriend found a facebook chat between me and the new girl. Of course I should have deleted it, but I felt safe with having my computer off and logged out of facebook. 

So I went home and told her everything. I answered all her questions with the truth. I told her all the things I didn't say before, and she told me all the things she had been holding back. 

She went home to her parents for the weekend.

I can honestly say that I have never felt this much pain and confusion. I still love her. I broke her heart. She's my best friend. I disrespected and hurt her. I love this other girl. I feel empty inside. I've cried more in the last 24 hours than I have in my whole life. I sobbed like I haven't since I was a child. I haven't been able to eat anything since yesterday morning. I got super wasted last night and talked to my friend who was my girlfriends roommate. I'm lost.

I do technical sales (pre-sales, kind of consulting + commission if they buy) and will make $125k in 2011. I have excellent ratings, network, visibility inside the company and I'm on a career path to become a manager. 

One of my mentors, a very high up smart executive, left the company a few years ago to create a startup which does specialized cloud computing work. He wants me to join as employee #19. I would be titled as the technical sales manager and would have two employees report to me. Both of the employees are top notch seasoned sellers with over 20 years industry experience each -- they could easily be my father so I believe the ""manager"" title is to be taken with a grain of salt, but an excellent opportunity and feather in my hat. I would have many new responsibilities, leadership experiences, and opportunities to wear many hats because, frankly, there's nobody else to do the work. 

The company is not profitable yet but has received another round of VC to last at least another year or two. All their employees that I have met have been top notch at what they do. Their cloud business model makes sense to me and they have a few notable very large customers as references. 

Their initial offer was $125k base salary (I should have never told them what I make) plus a realistic expectation of $10-$15k commission, with more possible. In addition, they're offering 30,000 shares of stock. Their stock is currently priced at $0.225 and the strike price is $0.25, so those shares are under water. My shares are vested incrementally over 2 years; 10k upon joining, 10k the next year, and another 10k the second year. Assuming the stock reaches the strike price! The benefits match my current employer.

I told them I was hoping for $150k base (thinking a 20% increase to justify the risk) and this was their first offer. Obviously, they're below but what strategy would you recommend to negotiate this higher? I don't want to give them any more numbers but at the same time, I won't consider a base of anything less than $140k. I like the company and, more importantly, the people enough to want to work there. At the same time, I'm worried about the risk. 

How would you play this?

n4zt9,3,2011-12-08,Boyfriend's Mom &lt;vent mostly&gt;,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/n4zt9/boyfriends_mom_vent_mostly/,"She drives me up a wall sometimes. She's a nice enough lady but she really grates on my nerves. 

She wants grandchildren as soon as possible. She has been talking about them since before my boyfriend and I had been dating for a year. Most recently she was angry that my boyfriend said if we had kids it wouldn't be for probably another ten years. She sent him a text message the next day giving him a time line on when she expects us to have our first kid (5 years from now at the latest). It's creepy.

She's incredibly suffocating. She says things about how empty my boyfriend and I's fridge is. Sure it isn't overflowing but there is always a meal or two in there that needs to be finished. If she comes over and our place isn't spotless she will point everything out. She once started cleaning the whole apartment when she came over somewhat uninvited. 

She has more negative things to say about my boyfriend than positive. She nitpicks everything he does. He managed to get a great internship and all she had to say was that $300 was far to much to spend on an interview suit because you could get nice dress clothes for $50. When the internship offered him a second internship the next summer with a raise she couldn't believe that he didn't look at other jobs. Never mind the fact he loves the place, is swamped with homework so has no time for job hunting, and wants to work at the company full time.

I get the feeling she wants me to be with her family more than my own. For Thanksgiving she had me every week for a month if I was coming with her to her family's Thanksgiving. While the offer was nice being asked every week even after I said I would be with my family got old fast. She pulled the same sort of thing with Memorial's Day when I said I was going to seem my family for my birthday.

She is constantly talking about having her daughter come stay over for a weekend with my boyfriend and I at our apartment so her daughter can see what college is like. We've pointed out that there is nowhere for her to sleep and that she wouldn't even enjoy the classes if she went but those points fall on deaf ears. While I would have no problem if my boyfriend's sister wanted to come by and hang out for a day (my sister will be doing that) the fact her mom is insistent on a weekend bothers me particularly since I am not asked if it is okay.

She is just so different from my mother. My mother leaves me alone except for a weekly phone call of chit chat. Her only comment on grandkids was when I said a lot of my graduating class already had babies and her response was basically don't you do anything like that. I don't know how to deal with my boyfriend's mom, and since the holidays are upon us I get to see a lot more of her. I'm worried this will end in hurt feelings. I want to talk to my boyfriend about it but I'm not sure how to approach the subject without seeming like I'm attacking her. I'm not even sure if there is a way to fix anything since he says he just ignore 95% of what she says because that is the only thing that works."

n4mdc,30,2011-12-08,I'm really happy,[deleted],lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/n4mdc/im_really_happy/,"but I don't have many people to share it with. So I came here.

I'm a girl, dating a girl. We met in fall of '06 and started dating in spring '08. Things were really rough at first, because neither of us had ever been with another girl. We broke up that summer, there was a boy. 

But love is love, and we began dating again in November. We told our friends, and many of them didn't understand, or more often made it into a joke. It was hard because we were still trying to accept it ourselves. One of my roommates found out and tried to get me evicted. That roommate ended up moving out, and things got good again. We stayed together through the rest of college and graduated together. In the summer of '10 I got an internship at Disney World, and she went back home. 

We loved and cried and fretted through nine months of a long distance relationship, before finally getting an apartment together. Our first.

I have a lot of friends here and there's a lot of gay people, but I'm still scared to tell people. I worry they will laugh at me or think poorly of me, because no one would ever suspect me of being what they classify as ""lesbian"". I like going out just me and her, and being in such a big town with such a constantly shifting population, and I can hold her hand and we can be together. I feel safe and happy in anonymity.

The truth is, I'm happy, really happy, and I really do want to show people and I wish I was braver. Because right now this girl is sleeping next to me and I'm very, very in love. 

I still feel scared about telling people about my relationship, and sometimes I still get nervous to kiss her on the cheek, if I know strangers are looking. But soon I'm going to ask this girl to marry me, and I don't even feel a tremor."
n4gyt,4,2011-12-08,I wrote this letter to the President to describe some ways the healthcare system discourages quitting.  Anyone have similar experiences?,BarackObamazing,stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/n4gyt/i_wrote_this_letter_to_the_president_to_describe/,"Dear Mr. President,

I am a 22-year-old university student from --------- and as a temporary caucus chair for my precinct, I am an active supporter of your presidency.  I have participated professionally in Democratic politics since --------- as a field organizer for ----------, a government affairs assistant for ---------, and an intern for ---------.  I have strong desire to participate in my state's political future, but in order to realize the long and productive career of my audacious dreams I must quit smoking cigarettes.  

I am writing you to describe some institutional and financial obstacles I have recently faced in my effort to quit this disgusting habit.  Smoking has drained my bank account, ruined my respiratory health and will certainly kill me if I don’t quit. The personal benefits of quitting are as obvious as the societal advantages of a smoke-free population.  And yet I have been financially discouraged from quitting by expensive smoking cessation classes, an unaccommodating health insurer, and predatory pharmaceutical prices.

When I was 15, I started smoking as an act of poorly considered youthful rebellion.  My father is a pulmonologist and my mother is an oncology nurse, and in my willful ignorance I started smoking as a way to reject my parents’ values.  Since then, my tobacco use has increased almost as fast as the price of a pack of Marlboros. Until last week I was spending $6.27 every day for the privilege of poor health and a premature demise.  

I quit smoking last week after enrolling in a local tobacco cessation program for which I paid $90 for 6 group sessions.  Because my parents work in healthcare, I was able to obtain a prescription for the Nicotrol nicotine replacement inhaler without the additional financial burden of a doctor’s appointment.  But my “Cadillac” health insurance plan refuses to cover my cessation class or any nicotine replacement medication. Instead I have to pay another $180 out of pocket for only a one-month supply of Nicotrol, which I believe will be the most effective quitting tool for me. I’ve received no financial help whatsoever from my insurer, and am faced with paying almost $300 that I don’t have upfront to help me quit a deadly, socially detrimental habit. 

Today, when I tried to fill my Nicotrol prescription, my credit card was declined.  I couldn’t afford the product that would best help me quit tobacco, and was refused help after an afternoon spent arguing with my insurer and pharmacy.  But I did have $6.27 in my pocket. I bought a pack of smokes instead.  

My experience has been incredibly frustrating, and I am still without medication a week after I dropped off my prescription.  But while the most desirable nicotine replacement method has proven difficult and expensive to obtain, I have been offered Pfizer’s Chantix at every turn.  The drug’s FDA black box warning describes extreme psychological side effects, yet my smoking cessation nurse, my insurer and my pharmacy all have suggested I take it.  There appears to exist a coordinated effort to force this drug on smokers.  I’ve even witnessed my nurse knowingly recommend Chantix for a commercial vehicle driver in violation of a DOT advisory against its use, and have heard health providers question the validity of FDA reported side effects.  My lung doctor father, however, is extremely wary of prescribing a drug with such severe pitfalls and refuses to do so unless he is able to warn his patients’ family members of Chantix’s potentially dangerous psychological effects. In my experience, the smoking cessation industry is demonstrably more concerned with Chantix sales than helping me quit.

Your success in quitting smoking has been an inspiration to me, but my healthcare providers have discouraged me at every step. I urge your administration to review medical practices regarding Chantix and nicotine replacement, and I hope you can ensure that people quitting smoking in the future are provided more options and support than I have received. I am confident that I will succeed in quitting, but my success will occur in spite of, not because of our nation’s healthcare system. The fierce urgency of responsible tobacco policy demands your administration’s attention.

Thank you very much for your time and for considering my experiences.  Please know that I will express my appreciation by working as hard as possible to aid your reelection in every way I can.

With sincere admiration and respect,

Edit: **TL;DR** I can't afford my desired nicotine replacement therapy and my insurer, smoking cessation program and pharmacy are all trying to force Chantix on me.  My dad's a lung doctor and is very wary of Chantix after several family members and patients experienced extreme side effects.  The smoking cessation industry appears more concerned with Chantix sales than people quitting."
n4f91,1,2011-12-07,"She's ""coming back""",[deleted],relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/n4f91/shes_coming_back/,"Hey guys. You've helped me get through tough times in the past, and unfortunately, I'm back here once again. I'll try to make this brief.

Me: 22m Her: 20F; both seniors at a University in Southern California. 

We met Freshman year and dated for two years until the summer after our Junior year, when I decided to take an internship in London. She had also decided to study abroad in London, but she wouldn't be leaving until after I got back to LA in late August. We would have 10 days together here before she left for her four month program. Being tragically naive at the time, I thought that this whole experience of us being separated would somehow bring us closer together. The reality: she dumps me one month into my stay in London, telling me she can't handle the distance (that's when I first came to this subreddit). Of course the advice on here was to cut contact completely; however, I failed to do so and have been talking to her sporadically since July when she left me. Recently our phone calls/skype chats have taken a bit of a different tone; there is now a longing in her voice and it is evident that she misses me. I know that she is not completely happy there. Something is missing but I can't assume that it's me. 

It's impossible to tell whether she misses me as a friend or as a lover. I am absolutely dead-set on winning her back, but I fear the worst. I don't know what will happen if I am once again rejected; my psyche and mental state will just crumble. 

I've been sort of procrastinating thinking about what things will be like when she comes back to LA, but with her arrival so near (this Sunday), I have been absolutely consumed by it. She expects me to be at the airport along with her best girl-friend. I just don't know what to expect. I can't help but fantasize about her coming back and jumping into my arms and things going back to the way they were months ago; but I know this is just a fantasy. 

I just don't know what to do, how to feel, what to think. I'm just completely beside myself at this point. Any thoughts/insights/whatever would be greatly appreciated from you guys :)"
n4die,3,2011-12-07,Unstable Ex-girlfriend.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/n4die/unstable_exgirlfriend/,"Hello,

I am a 25 year old guy who just recently moved across the country to pursue graduate studies. About 2 years ago, I met a girl (she was 20 years old at the time, I 23) at a friend's party, we were both drunk, and naturally, in my state, I tried to sleep with her. She denied me but we exchanged numbers. We meet up a few days later and went on a date. One date turns into two, three, four, and eventually we were officially dating. Fast forward a couple of months, and I discover that I will be going away for the summer to do an internship. The ""relationship"" up until this point consisted of dates a couple times a week, and having sex, ...I was not very emotionally invested. I thought she was on the same page. It eventually comes time for me to leave for the summer, we say goodbye, and mention that we will keep in contact over the break. Over the duration of the summer, we Skyped a few times, she even came to visit a friend in a nearby city, which gave me an opportunity to see her for a couple days. The Skype calls became less frequent near the end of the summer, up until the point I came back home. Given the long break at the beginning of the relationship (in fact, longer than the time we had been dating up until that point) my feelings for her were not especially strong when I returned. I tried things out for a couple of weeks, but eventually confessed that I did not feel the spark anymore, and I thought it would be good to break things off. She reluctantly agreed. Fast forward a couple weeks and she mentions that she has some questions that she wants cleared up and that we should meet over a coffee. I agreed. The coffee meeting ended up turning into me going back to her place and hooking up, which is hindsight was a VERY bad idea. My mind was clouded, I was thinking with my other head, and even though it was just sex to me, it just made her more confused. After that she was messaging me more often, and I eventually needed to abruptly end things (yes call me an asshole). I thought things were completely over at that point.

Jump ahead about a year, I have now moved, pretty much have a completely different life. Out of nowhere I receive a message from her, innocent at first, asking how my life was going. I replied lightheartedly, saying it was going well. She added me back on Facebook (I know I should not have accepted) since this just opened the floodgates for her creeping everyone on my page, and sending me more messages. A particular stream of messages states that she ""saw me with another girl"" ...which was impossible because I now lived 2500 miles away. She was delusional. The messages started becoming much more frequent, with her confessing that she loves me ""in a friend way"" and eventually saying that she ""cant be friends"" and that she actually ""loves"" me and wants to be with me again. I sent her back a short message saying that she has said some pretty heavy stuff in the messages and that when I come back to visit family we should meet to clear up any misunderstandings. The messages started coming unbelievably often (sometimes 20 per day, and even during the middle of the night). She was confessing that she is seeing a psychiatrist and that she is having panic attacks. Some of the messages are nearly completely intelligible and are likely just her dumping all of her thoughts on the page. At this point I am overwhelmed and cannot think of a response (wondering if I should even respond). The messages have turned into her saying things about ""when we start dating again"" etc. To me, she seems absolutely insane and VERY unstable, stating in one message that ""if you don't give me a damn good reason why you don't want me, I'll kill you lol"" I am hoping that is a joke, but honestly, given the number of messages, I am uncertain that she is sane at this point. I am concerned for her safety, but also mine if I decide to meet with her saying that I cannot be with her. What should I do? I feel that if I write her a letter stating my thoughts, she may do something stupid, as in hurt herself physically.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

In July I finished a two year course on Digital Compositing. The last four months consisted of an internship period, which I spent at a vfx studio in Denmark. When school finished I worked at said studio for two months, but my contract ran out in August. I've only been able to score a quick 48-hour project since. 

Yesterday I received my letter of admittance to a [six month course](http://www.kau.se/en/education/courses/ISGB20) on the basics of 3D modelling, lighting and animation. Do you think it will be very difficult for me to find work with my last studio position almost a year in the past and a relatively short 3d education?

I have 5 years voluntary work experience; progressing from shop assistant to a supervisory role in a local charity shop, as well as representing them on local tv and helping to organise, and participating in, a charity fashion show. I also spent a summer improving software usage, working on reception and running a stall at a local festival for CSV Media Clubhouse.

I led a team of non-science students for the Engineering Education Scheme investigating the challenges in building foundations on a site for new holiday homes, in order to identify a solution that was both structurally sound and commercially viable.

I led two teams of students to produce the two most successful magazines at my high school - encouraging people to submit content, organising the team to be able to publish on time, and negotiating a discounted price with a local printing company. We won the school's Searchlight Cup for teamwork both times.

I was runner up to the Somerville and Gurney essay prize for Sixth Form Scholarship students at the GDST, and won the Reade Essay Prize at my school, both for communicating scientific topics to a non-specialist audience.

**Additional skills and interests**

* Confident working with Microsoft Office, Haskell, LaTeX, MATLAB, Linux, Photoshop and MAPLE (98 in first-year project)

My wife is studying in her home country (Germany) and as part of her degree, she is required to undertake an internship in her field of study.  
As we haven't seen each other in over two years, and as I'm currently financially trapped (being in postgrad education myself for the next three years), the ideal situation would be that she comes to NZ for the duration of her internship - we can see each other, have teh sexytimes and generally be together again.   

Now, I know that 'internship' is often used as a cover for slave labour, but my wife is very capable and has nine years work experience under her belt already, and she does not want to be used a cheap (= free) worker.
Our circumstances are such that she has to earn a wage while she's here - her parents can cover the airfare, but the tank is dry after that.   

My wife is studying toward a Bachelor in International Tourism Management, and her majors are in Tour Operations and Business IT - we'd really like to be able to find her a short term contract in either area, running from February through to August; her specific career interests are more on the IT side of things and so finding an internship/contract where she could learn more about websites and intranets or even social media would be great (which is Web Development I guess).   
Other areas where she has interests are in databases and data management, as well as HR and business management.  

As I said earlier, she's been working for nine years, so isn't a total noob and has worked in Ireland, the UK and New Zealand, so has a lot of exposure to different work environments.   
She speaks English like a native, and has worked for some major corporates.
She's 's also very cool, gorgeous and I love her to bits - two and a half years is a long time to be apart.

If anyone's able to help in any way, we'd be extremely grateful.  
Please message me if you think you might be able to help.  
Things are a bit desperate.

TL;DR - wife needs a short term IT job, I need my wife..."
n64sh,2,2011-12-09,Where to start when trying to enter a career in eSports?,SRuff,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/n64sh/where_to_start_when_trying_to_enter_a_career_in/,"Not really sure what it is about StarCraft 2 and the entire idea of eSports but ever since I decided to start playing sc2 again and watched MLG Columbus this year I have had an urge to try and somehow enter eSports on some level, hopefully as a career. The biggest issue I've had though is I am really now sure where to even start. I've thought of trying to stream/cast, but this has never really gotten off the ground since I'm not the highest ranked player or even that well know in the community. As for trying to work for MLG, a pro team, a community website, or any other sort of tournament or connection with sc2, I really am unsure of where to start. Just hoping for some advice, tips, or really anything that might help. 

Such as, do I need to finish my degree first? Should I try and offer some of my time to a community website? Should I do casting or eSports writing? Do different tournaments offer internships or any other entry level positions I can just jump in on?

Hopefully someone can help me find the right direction &gt;&lt;

Filled with that hushed din of young professionals forgetting the dryness of their work week at the office with an even dryer martini.  A man in the corner was making love to a jazz ballad on his sax. It was a classy joint a block away from the three biggest law forms in Manhattan. It was the go to place for the more junior members of the firms, those not looking to run into the vice president while thoroughly enjoying happy hour. Harry was sitting at the bar, slowly stirring the ice of his third gin and tonic.  He checks his watch. 10:29. His “date” was supposed to be here at 10:00. He downed his drink with a flick and ordered another. “Fuck it” he snickered under his breath. She wasn’t coming. He’s used to it by now. It’s not his fault, he’s not a bad looking guy, his expensive hair cut is only a week old, he even was wearing some new French cologne that he read about in a magazine on the flight back to New York this Tuesday. But money is what makes the second date in this town.  His salary as a law intern was nothing to scoff at, but women in this town have access to much more. At least this one didn’t show up with at the same bar with a different guy like the last soulless bitch. 
He took his drink and turned to the crowd of faces blurred by gin and jazz. He regretted ordering the drink, but wasn’t in the mood to let it to go to waste.  His eyes passed over the far corner. She was sitting alone at a table for two, nothing on it but an empty martini glass. The little sword stripped bare. She must have been a Goth girl in high school. Far outgrown it now, but you can tell she missed the freedom. She had shiny black hair that sat smooth and round on her head. She wore an outfit fit for a “girl’s night out” with her own flair. A smooth tight silver cocktail dress that showed just a hint of cleavage. She wore bright red shoes that matched her lips. She was writing something on a napkin. She looked up for just a moment and they caught each other’s eyes for the slightest of moments. But it was enough.
Something weird came over Harry. He asks the bartender for another of whatever she’s had, and starts to walk over to her. As he walks over to her with the drinks, he suddenly realizes what he’s doing. This isn’t him. He doesn’t just buy women drinks and sit down at the table with them. He’s not some Casanova. He put the glass on her side and puts his down on the table. His hand shaking ever so slightly. He tries to hide it under the table. Without looking at him she takes a sip from the glass he put down. She puts it on the table. A few seconds go by and she says “I don’t usually take my martini this dirty” she said with a false attitude and a deep voice.  Harrys mouth opened slightly but no sound came out. She peered up at him with a coy smile. ‘Molly’ she sighed, as she held out her hand. Her voice had the smoothness of a hand rolled cigarette. Harry shook her hand and did his best to flash his smile.  But then he tried opening his mouth. “Uhhh, hi I’m Harry.” 
Molly didn’t particularly like meeting people in bars.  The men there were always too easy to read. But for now both just stared at each other. They reached for their glasses at the same time. Both took a drink and softly put their glasses down. They kept eye contact the whole time. Harry’s eyes were a dull green with flecks of yellow, gold in the bars lighting, spiking from the center. Molly’s eyes were very round, and very open. Her steely gray eyes looked around at things as if they weren’t seeing the same things you were.
Harry blinked and realized what was going on. He reflexively asked what Molly did for a living. It’s what he always asked. Because then they ask him. A job with a firm for a man is the same a women getting plastic surgery. Hundreds of thousands of dollars for an easier pick up line.
Molly sighed. She reminds herself to bang her head on the wall when she gets home to punish herself for even acknowledging this guy. She could tell he was nervous. But his smile was nice…“I work for a pharmaceutical company, I help design and make drugs for AIDS patients. All boring science stuff you probably wouldn’t understand.”
She suddenly felt bad about being mean to him.
“Sorry uhh, Harry right?” she asked with a worried sort of scrunched brow
“Uhh yea” Harry mumbled. He was still soaking in her last sentence and figuring out if that comment was mean or not.
“Look, I don’t mean to rude.” She said nodding her head in. “One of our patients we were working with died today, and we were dealing with that grief, and the mounds of legal paperwork, and my girlfriend is not meeting me at this bar any more, and now I’m ranting extremely embarrassing and personal things over to a complete stranger. Jesus, I’m just going to go.”
Harry sat dumbfounded as she grabbed her bag and stood up. She cleared the martini glass in a single gulp and headed for the door. When she was half way to the door, Harry’s mind kicked back into drive. Ignoring his drink on the table he started after her, getting stuck in the polluted sea currents of the bar. He was a moth to a flame. 
He opened the door to see Molly lighting her cigarette in the cab. She looks out the window to exhale, and sees Harry standing in the doorway with a looking a weird mixture of worry and determination on his face. Biting her lip and closing her eyes, she pulls out her business card and holds it out the window. Harry grabbed it, and she looked him dead in the eyes, took a drag from her cigarette, and simply said “don’t fuck this up.” 
The cab took off.

Okay, so a very interesting circumstance I'm in and I'd like some tips on landing this internship.
Essentially, I know the IT guy at my local library, and one day when my brother and I were screwing around and used Backtrack 4 to get into his network and redirect every page attempted to be accessed on the network to an image of trollface (similar to methods used in phishing). This was mostly a feat done by my brother, and although I made this an evident point, he still asked if I was interested in an internship. Although being far from a computer expert (but knowing my way around a computer and hardware), I agreed.
He gave me his business card and wants me to e-mail him. How does this fourteen-year-old make this internship work? Tips and recommendations are greatly appreciated."
n8fxo,1,2011-12-11,"Advice on a girl I met at an internship, who seemed interested in me, but nothing happened. Can't stop thinking about her since.",throwaway_ra_1337,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/n8fxo/advice_on_a_girl_i_met_at_an_internship_who/,"Okay, so this is a bit of a doozy. I’m looking for advice for a girl and I (both 21 years old now). Some unimportant details will be changed to protect the innocent (though if she saw this post, she’d probably know it was her…). I did a research internship this last summer. She, let’s say her name is Kat, was also in the same program. At first, we didn’t really talk much, since our research wasn’t related – however, she always did seem a bit “friendly”, possibly flirty. Mind you, I’m still a virgin, never kissed, never gone on a date, etc – so I don’t always pick up on these things, but she did seem interested in me, but I wasn’t sure since she seemed somewhat flirty with others besides me too.

It wasn’t until the last few weeks we started to talk. At first it was about her wanting to build something that I’m good at (unimportant detail), I figured it was one of those topics you use to start talking with someone you don’t know. I already had an interest in her, so naturally I flowed the conversation into other things. I friended her on Facebook and suggested we hang out. Kat gave me her number, so I began to text her and whatnot – talked about different things – again, good impressions. I asked her if she’d like to get dinner and watch something (which I thought would be obvious implying it’s a date) and Kat. This was getting close to moving out since the internship was nearly over, so she suggested lunch on campus. I thought, okay, makes sense, Kat’s just really into her research and is trying to do as much as possible before the internship’s over and she has to move out and go back to school.

Well, lunch came, but she ended up cancelling – she said she couldn’t since there was so much stuff to move – which I gave her a pass on since it was the last two days she could be there. I volunteered to help her move out, she obliged. We talked a lot while I helped move her out, on all sorts of topics. Again, I kept getting good vibes, and she seemed bummed we couldn’t do anything. We ate a quick lunch in her apartment (seems like she had her roommate disappear for it). She was mostly moved out at this point, she just had some other stuff she needed to finish up and I wasn’t really able to help there. We did bump in with each other the rest of the afternoon quite a bit, though. Kat asked later on if she could have dinner over at my place – I said that’d be great. So we whipped up something simple, and talked some more, still more great vibes. Finally dinner was over and she was going to go back to her new place (close by) to organize. I offered to help, but Kat said it’d probably be boring (her body language was confusing – it’s as if she did want me to, but didn’t), though it was up to me. I said that’s fine; I probably have to get ready to move out myself, but told her to stop by later if she could so we could maybe watch some of a TV series I suggested to her. We hugged and she was off.

Kat never came by later, texted her and she said she had too much. But she suggested we grab coffee in the morning (hours before I leave), and just have me wake her up in the morning since she’d be pulling a late night. Well, I did, but she said she was too tired and apologized, she was genuinely sorry. At this point I pretty much wrote her off and thought I had been played as a fool. Maybe Kat was leading me on, maybe I was reading way too much into things, I didn’t know. I ended up leaving later than I said I would and texted her goodbye, she said she woke up a bit ago and apologized that she was such a flake and hopefully she’d see me soon (we were hoping to go to the same university next year).

Anyways, she sounded a bit terse in the last text at that point. I was angry with myself for possibly screwing stuff up, and just a bit angry with her for not being clearer. I didn’t text Kat for awhile, but I did eventually and told her everything was fine, we’d meet up some other time. She didn’t text me back. She’s been nice on Facebook, some things happened that raised my eyebrows, thinking maybe she was paying extra attention to me, I wasn’t sure if that was so or if I was reading too much into it. But overall, the last 4 months there’s been little contact with Kat. I’ve been thinking a lot about her and have been going through one of the darkest and roughest patches of my life (some of it related to her, some for other reasons relating to the internship). I really don’t think I can live with myself if I don’t at least give contacting her a try. But I’m not even sure what to do or where to start. Some of my online friends have basically said that I should forget about it, one even said I had been friend zoned, or even worse “pity friended.” I’m not sure if this is the case.

A few extra details that are probably not terribly important: during the internship, she was really close to another intern. I could tell he was interested in her. Though I recently found out via her Facebook that he hasn’t talked to her since he started school again. I also heard a rumor from another intern that she was friends with benefits with some guy back from her hometown – which was plausible seeing how much he posted on her Facebook wall. Something happened with them since then, I think, after looking over Facebook. Maybe these were two reasons she may have held back regarding me, I’m not sure.

Anyhow, I’m hoping you guys can give me some advice regarding Kat and how I can proceed. I’d be alright if we had just a friendship, but it’d be much nicer if there was something more. I thought there were feelings on her part. I knew I definitely did. Being around Kat made me feel so… *alive*. Help. Please.

**tl;dr:** Okay, you really should read the above since this is a long story… but, here you go: met a girl at a summer internship. I started talking to her late in the internship, seems like there was a connection, and I set a date which she was receptive to. She ended up canceling since she was moving out, I helped her move out and we talked a lot, we did a quick informal lunch and dinner together, everything seemed good, but nothing more happened. We were going to meet before I left, but that didn’t happen. She apologized profusely, I accepted and told her we’d meet up again sometime. We’ve barely talked in the last 4 months since the internship. I can’t stop thinking about her and want advice regarding possibly contacting her again."
n8c9s,14,2011-12-11,My Story,historic66,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/n8c9s/my_story/,"*Note: I'm writing in a stream of consciousness, so I apologize in advance if this becomes a TLDR post*

I was raised in church. By raised in church, I mean I was [dedicated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedication_%28Baptist_ceremony%29), and attended often, usually three times per week (twice on Sundays and once on Wednesdays). I went through every level (I use that word as though one might use it to describe grades in school) of Sunday school, attended [bible school](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacation_Bible_School) until they would no longer let me and attended church camp from fourth grade (the first year one is allowed to attend) until I was a senior in high school (the last year one is allowed to attend as a camper). I also served as a counselor to ""junior camp"" once I was in high school and lead the band in my youth group for almost six years.

To sum up, I was about as dedicated to ""Jesus' team"" as one could get.

In the summer of 2002, the youth pastor I had always known abruptly left, giving no reason for doing so. Two weeks later, rumors began to spread about the senior pastor following his intern's (a different man than the youth pastor) abrupt departure. After several weeks of testimony before the [Deacons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon), it was revealed that the pastor had engaged in an inappropriate homosexual relationship with the intern and resigned.

During the next few months, our church and youth group, now both in shambles, struggled to get back to ""normal"". During this time, the adults in the church seemed to be far more concerned with their own wants and needs, neglecting the youth entirely. It was during this time that my band became the tightest and most creative of our entire tenure. It was also during this time that the youth began a rotation of ""taking turns"" delivering the youth sermons on Wednesday nights.

Eventually, a former Deacon stepped up to lead us until both a senior pastor and youth pastor could be found.

Both of the aforementioned hires turned out to be worse than having no official leadership at all. The senior pastor was a money hungry, [hyper-Calvinist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-Calvinism) who often used the church funds for person gain and neglected the congregation. The youth pastor was an immature liar who saw his job not as his [calling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_%28religious%29), but as a stepping stone to senior pastor. After he verbally embarrassed one of my close friends during a sermon and asked him to leave, I stopped attending church on a regular basis. For the second and final time, I also left the band I had been playing with, more or less, since I entered the seventh grade.

In the fall of 2007, I was attending a commuter college and began seeing my first serious girlfriend. It was during this relationship that I lost my virginity. My parents, upon discovering this, [kicked me out](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m67gf/need_some_help_with_acquiring_a_car/) and sold my car. Although I attended church a few times during our relationship, my days as a regular attender had come to an official end. This was also the event which caused me to look, critically, at everything I had been told growing up, especially considering the complete contradiction between what my parents had taught me and what they were doing.

Since then, I have attended church only a handful of times (for various reasons), but have ceased believing in any sort of higher power. Also since then, I have begun to research religion a great deal and am amazed daily with the [inconsistency of the bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency_of_the_Bible) and with the absolute lack of common sense Christians seem to have. 

Someone posted something here not long ago that mentioned how it takes a long time to ""cleanse"" someone of a religious upbringing. I had never thought of it until then, but now I notice it constantly. From time to time, something from Christianity will be presented to me (the story of Jesus' birth as told during Christmas at a local [theme park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Dollar_City), for example) and I will get chills, only to remember moments later that the story is bullshit.

I said all of this for two reasons: 1) I wanted others to know where I'm coming from and 2) I wanted those who feel ashamed of being atheists to know that it's okay to admit you have decided to live by logic and reason, not faith and fear."

I think Ryan chambers was killed by Louis already? I mean I think Louis had it staged from before. He met Ryan and they both were going for the Intern job and he made sure somehow that Ryan gets hired as the intern.

I think he probably knew how Masuka is and maybe he thought Ryan would get hired easily. So they ( RYan and Louis) both started going out and all. He had her get the hand and all. He told her to put it on the website so they could sell it but he didn't want to sell it. He just wanted Masuka to find out that she was the one who got it and was selling it.  

So obiously Masuka found out and she got fired. Being the computer geek Louis is he deleted it from the website. OR he knew Ryan's account and basically just removed the item from there.

He then killed Ryan I think so his plan just stays a secret? I just wonder how he would have killed her ?"

But I just do not have the work to back myself. I feel confident about knowledge, I understand the principles and can see where/how things can be fixed to look nicer. But in a student film-school context, all my projects were rushed out over 3 days or less. As a result I'm having a tough time getting my reel to look like something I could be hired over.  
  
I'm currently in Toronto and looking for work as a compositor, I know After Effects and expressions. I can prototype a Python script in the ORSDK for Motionbuilder and I've got just enough understanding to feel like my toes are wet about Fluids, nCloth, DMM, RBD, SBD and Particles in Maya... But in no way have I found a time to get my hands on a decent camera and go shoot pieces. Or to create anything completely in CG.  
  
So this is what I'm wondering, if I decide to just do freebies for short films/student projects. To work on tiny things for dirt cheap or literally nothing... Would it be harm or hinderance.  
  
I don't know what to do. I am supposed to do an internship by working at a company as an 'assistant' or something. But no one has replied and most anywhere I find in the area is calling for Nuke, Shake, Flame or Fusion knowledge. Which I just don't have.  
  
It's likely a lot of fear and just anxiety at the idea that I'm just no good, that I'm disillusioned. But I'm damn certain I can do the work, that I can learn Nuke on my own and that I can turn out product worth broadcasting. I just don't know what to do from here.  
  
I'm sorry to be asking this but just any help or projects you need help with in AE... let me know.  
  
Help me r/vfx... you're my only hope.


**edit for clarity**: I began learning after effects 6 years ago. The program I just took (postsecondary film program) has been going for 3 years and pushing after effects. Now I'm near graduation and am taking in that what I've been taught is largely irrelevant. I will be learning Nuke by the PLE and downloaded the Manual and resources also whatever Lynda.com can offer. At 36k in debt I can't afford to not use solely free resources and common sense. It's how I've learnt most things thus far, it's, after this experience with college, the only way to go.  
  
I do enjoy writing Python so I'll be aiming for that. My only experience with nodal anything is Houdini. I've 'played' with just about every software, it's just once my program picked up speed and people asked me to do comps, I was only able to turn them out in after effects so the space to learn outside of the classroom just wasn't there. I've spoken to my course co-ordinator and am now working in Maya to finish up my dynamics project (If you have tips for why my road isn't taking shadows that'd be awesome but also it's own post). It was agreed I'll work for a month with the school full-time paid and then begin my co-op later than the others. during that time I'm expected to (and obviously will) learn Nuke... and then apply python to all the things.  
  
Prior to coming here I was writing Java in a Comp Sci program and doing network IT/management... So the tech part is easy, it's just adjusting to nodal that i worry will slow me down.  
  
Thank you everyone"

Also, feel free to encourage (I feel so lost right now and I have cried for the first time in years, one of few in my lifetime), but that is not what I am here for. I am sorry if this is too much detail (I have never done anything like this before), so you can skim this and read the conflict part, but I hope that you read it all if you’d like to give your advice or opinion. I typed this in my fury somewhat as a recap of out entire relationship so you can skip to the bottom to the more recent events.

Background: I am a 22 year old guy and she is a 26 year old gal. I am a hardliner atheist and she is a staunch Fundamentalist Christian (Literal interpretation of the Bible, Old Earth Creationism, and all that stuff). I am still a student currently with a year of bachelor’s left and she works as a nurse. I am also of eastern-European descent and have always had trouble with English and, coupled with being pathologically shy, could never make any real friends (almost had a girlfriend but never mustered the courage to ask).  She is a bit older, but still very young and energetic and only dated one guy before me that, as it turned out, wanted to marry her for a green card (they were a very “Christian” couple from what she has told me, they held hands together, so for all intents and purposes, I was her first real boyfriend).

Our story: 
We met when I was an 18 year old freshman in college and she just transferred from CC to get a nursing degree. We lived right next to each other but did not talk much during the first semester. We started talking at the end and had all kinds of interesting conversation and debate pertaining to religion and politics. She taught me how to swing dance, we danced outside, went to run after a rain, ate together and with friends. I soon realized that even with all the differences we had, she was the perfect girl to complement me, my thoughts and my abilities. 

Once spring was over and we separated we wrote each other long FB messages, somewhat flirty, but she was pretty naïve about me and wanted to be just friends. I confronted her and she rejected me, mainly because she wanted to date only a devoted Christian guy. I was devastated. 

I moped for a long time before the school started again. We were living on the same floor and she was going to be an RA. We met and spoke still and tried to be friends, but it wasn’t working for me, and I tried to convince her that I was worth it. She allowed me near her, and we hugged, touched (although she would not allow intimate places) and eventually, we built up to that moment when we had our first kiss (both of our firsts!). After that, we officially became boyfriend and girlfriend and no day went by without us seeing each other. We declared our love to each other by the end of the semester and I couldn’t be happier. We sort of lived in the moment and didn’t think about the future, just enjoying each other’s love, companionship and support. We both knew that it probably wouldn’t work out once we were done with college, but for the moment, that did not matter to me, and I assured her that we would get through it one way or another.

So that semester and the following flew by. We spent most the time together, except the times we studied. I never made many friends, except my immediate study group. One of the people that she studied with, a male student in her class is one of the culprits of the current conflict. They would talk a lot, but mostly with other people there (the guy had a girlfriend, and the few times I have met him he seemed like a nice enough guy, although an ex-marine). We spent the summer mostly apart but in constant contact over FB and phone even though she had no internet in her home. My parents knew of her, but she did not tell hers since she feared they would ostracize her and destroy whatever peace was left of her troubled family for dating an atheist (she is in a family with a single mother of three, of which she is the oldest).

 The fall semester, she was finishing up her degree and I lived in an apartment. I would often stay in her room and practically lived with her. Our love for each other was undying and we both worried what would happen once she was done. Yet, when she was, we decided to stay together, and since she lived only a bit of an hour away, she would visit me and friends. We were a very good couple in my opinion. She needed a lot more support from me due to her troubles with family, friends, (before she graduated, school), so it was always slanted a bit more towards her. She supported and encouraged me in endeavors and I have done some things thanks to her that I could have never done without her.

I made the decision to transfer to a much better school 3 hours away, sent my application and was accepted. I spoke to her about it when I first started thinking and again, we figured out we could make it work. The next semester flew by, with her visiting, going to a few parties with me (nothing wild, I taught her to drink alcohol with me, not a lot, just a little bit; she got a lot from some of her girlfriends). We slowly built up to sexual intimacy over the course of this relationship (no vaginal intercourse though, although she offered, I refused because I did not want any accidents or complications; we are still technically “virgins”) and of course by the end of this semester were fully comfortable with each other. The summer, we took some more time together because she was finally living on her own and we could get more time. She finally got a job, but before that she tried to get a job at a hospital literally across the street from the university (very halfheartedly and she admitted she didn’t want to get it because she wanted to be closer to her family; needless to say, she didn’t). My parents moved closer to her place at the end of summer and I moved to school 3 hours away. That’s when more troubles began to surface. 

A lot of times she was upset about the distance and wanted to come out and see me. I accommodated her as much as I could, but my workload as a transfer student was insane and there was only so much that I could do. The arguments got a lot tenser and difficult. We stopped talking about religion and politics and other sensitive issues because over IM and even phone we were not there to support each other and she would get very emotional (she was hopeful (both of us were) that I would change my views and we could be a happy “Christian” family). So this semester went by fast, we saw each other, and the times that we saw each other was absolutely amazing. She wanted to make friends where she lived and met a few guy friends, some of which got weird and she cut contact with them. We always talked about that, even if not in the open, and she was good at handling it, even though she had some mild issues saying no to people. We were still this hopeful couple utterly and devastatingly in love. Fast forward to next semester that preceded much like the fall, except the tension rose a bit more. She insisted that she needed more time with me, but again, I could provide her only so much… Then closer to the end of the semester I finally received an offer for an internship till the end of the year in a state over 2000 miles away. I tried finding opportunities in our state, but besides a few startups and financial firms, our state did not offer much for my occupation. I told her before I accepted and she cried. Maybe that’s when she thought our relationship would be soon over. We talked about it a lot though, and it seemed to me like she would bear with me. I had to take it because I needed the experience (and the money wouldn’t hurt). We were just so madly in love. We spent all the time together that we could before I left. She liked sending me cards (snailmail) expressing how much she misses me and loves me.

This summer went by fast, I worked at a large company with many other interns, and I met some people and had fun, but mostly events and bars, not even any parties. I almost never hung out with girls because I did not want to make her uncomfortable (although she never admitted it, she thought that without a code of morals like hers I could never be entirely trusted, that or was afraid girls would take advantage of me).  She told me that she met her friend from nursing school for lunch a few times. Him and his girlfriend has issues and he didn’t tell her that he was visiting my girlfriend.  She however, went to a b-day party for him later anyway (that his girlfriend hosted). I never voiced my concern on her seeing that guy until much later, but I thought she could handle herself, and I think she did. We still communicated a lot, video chat, phone, IM, texting, we did it all as it fit our mood. We had one major spat when I told her not to visit me for 2 days when she could because I did not want to meet her and have to leave her so fast (I realize I was a fool for thinking that, I would kill for that time if it could make her feel closer to me). I visited her for 8 days during Labor day week, during which we took a trip to the Creation museum (an attempt to reignite conversation on religion and science), and as always, had a great time. We were just as intimate, and close as ever, even if a bit distant at first.
Then I went back and we continued what we were doing before. I tried playing sports after work and going to gym (for her! even though I am already reasonably fit, I wanted her to think I was the sexiest man alive, and I will admit that I enjoyed looks from others of the opposite gender, but only for sport), so we talked a bit less but still a good enough amount to run out of things to talk about. 
Over the course of these 3 years she became my best friend and I thought I became hers too (maybe I am, but I cannot be sure now). I supported She was my first kiss, my first dance, my first valentine, my one and only love, the love of my life, my world.

The Conflict
What I knew up to today:
Things started to get weird around November. She would speak less and less to me, and was becoming more distant than ever. We would still talk, and share convo, send hugs and kisses, say “love you” and good night, and support each other. Then, she told me that she was meeting her friend from nursing school, more and more frequently. His girlfriend and him broke up, and I their meeting had a lot to do with the fact that he was available (both schedule and relationship status-wise). I suspect that she met him more often for lunch and such that she didn’t tell me about. She told me he had helped get a Christmas tree, introduced him to her friends. Only a bit over a week ago, she told me that he said he had feelings for her. I am still unclear on how she responded, but I think she tried to let him down easy. I have met him and know him, albeit only briefly. I don’t know why he would do such a thing that I later I found out he did - he just seemed like a much better man than that to me.

When she told me this, I was the most understanding a guy could be (as I usually am, which is the reason I am typing all this past 1 AM on  Sunday night), but now I realized I should have stopped her from seeing him at all costs. Instead, she assured me that they were just friends, and that she tried talking to him after and it didn’t seem weird, so she thought it was ok. She told me that she shared a lot about our relationship with him and received a lot of advice and explanations from his (he’s agnostic) perspective. I know he is one of her best guy friends, so I told her that I didn’t mind that if that’s all it would be then that’s fine. She has very strong opinions on cheating (and she more than once told me that the relationship would be over if I ever cheated… oh, the irony), I trusted her immensely, and I thought she would never let it happen even if the bastard tried. 

This week:
 She went to a friend’s party (Ugly Sweater party) this Saturday. The way things were between us, I didn’t want her to go because I knew there’d be drinking and she would drink (the party becomes much more important later on), and I always worry what could happen to her, especially with a bunch of random people that her friends know. Her nursing friend was also invited, although she said she would have liked it more that he wasn’t. I asked her why and she said I thought I’d be mad and asked her “you are just friends, right?” to which she simply said “Yes”, and for me, her word was more than enough, but doubts lingered. She was also staying at her girlfriend’s place for the night, which I thought nothing of also, since I assumed there would be only girls left (as my girlfriend is adamantly against sleeping in the same quarters with another gender, and has given me much grief for my apartment searching).

Sidenote: 
She swears that it’s not related to anything that happened in the last few weeks, but she also started talking about ending the relationship over this same time period. Mostly because she did not want to move if I got a job a year later in the same state, and did not think we could ever raise children together and didn’t want to continue on with it. I told her that I was thinking of marrying her (which took her by surprise, she thought I wasn’t even thinking about it), and can compromise to work things out. She reluctantly agreed that we should continue for now.

Which brings us to today (Sunday):
I called her to talk about the party and to see how she was. Turned out that she stayed out really late and drank a lot, danced with a bunch of people (probably not grinding or anything, but I am not sure now since she was drunk) did not “sleep well” on her friends couch. I talked more to her and she again tried to tell me that we should just stop seeing each other. I told her that I thought of a plan to get us through our misunderstandings about our mutual futures (there were a lot piled up by now), and that we will do it once we get back. I sent her a message on FB after that describing how much I love her and want to be with her and want to prove to her that I can be the “life-long companion, husband, father, lover, and best friend” that she wants me to be. She had her family for a Hanukah party later (they celebrate it due to their family ties with Messianic Jew community), so we did not talk about it. Once they were gone, she called me and told me that she read my message. I asked her what she thought and she wanted me to tell her more specifically what I wanted to talk about… we talked about that a bit and she seemed very receptive. 
And then the conversation took a turn for something I will never forget.

She was trying to say something, and said that she has done a lot of dumb things this week. I immediately perked up, my heart racing, afraid of the worst.  She was very slow about telling it all, most of it through tears and “I love you so much”’s, but she made out with her nursing school friend. On her bed, and he stayed the night (although she assures me that no clothes came off, but I assume there was groping and fondling). Then, she told me that she met with him again, and they made out again. This time, I am not sure if he stayed the night, but I don’t think he did, and again, she says it was just a make out session. 

I was unbelievably mad and angry, angriest that I have been in my life. I raged for a few moments. How could she betray my trust like that?! Right after I reinforced it and told her I trusted her?! Why would she do this when I was just a few weeks away from returning home? My heart sunk so far… I thought this would never happen to my sweetheart, my love, who I thought was so madly in love with me. I have tried everything in my power to make this LDR work, but it seems that it just wasn’t enough.

Then we talked more, I told her how truly heartbroken and stunned I was and she was asking for forgiveness. Then I asked if anything else happened. Turns out that when she got back from the dancing at a bar and crashed on the couch, one of her friend’s drunk friends climbed on top of her and in her drunk state, she made out with him too (and that’s where it stopped also, she told me).

The Aftermath:
We talked more and she is so extremely sad, both of us were, and how sorry she is to have done what she did, she says that she wishes she was dead rather than put me through this, and hates that she is now a “slut and a whore”. She said she would stop talking to that friend of her forever if I accepted her apology. When I asked her “what if I didn’t, would you still meet with him?” to which she replied “I don’t want to lose two friends in the same day”, to which I replied “Then how do you think I would feel?” I spoke more to her, trying to make myself and her feel better. I told her I still loved her and did not hate her but wasn’t sure if I can forgive her or not just yet. I told her we are all human and we make mistakes, and since this all happened within a week with an otherwise faithful and loving girlfriend I am ready to chalk this up to a “crime” of passion, but…. But I am hesitant because of the circumstances described above. Even if we continue it will be so much harder to work through our issues and disagreements... it may make it impossible if it wasn’t before. Even if we did, I could never trust her again as much as I did now. And what about the future? Could this happen again if I am away for some reason, or if she thinks that I am not treating her fairly or whatever it was that she thought when she cheated on me? I am afraid I can never be assured of that as I once was.

Can you help?
I will need some time to think about this myself, but I need somebody else’s opinion.  Unlike my foolish self, my girlfriend has made some more or less decent friends and still has a lot of her old childhood ones, but I am stuck by myself, with maybe my brother to talk to. I have lurked reddit a lot and love the community (for the most part) and am hoping to get your advice and thoughts on this on how to proceed. 
Which brings me to my point: what do I do now? I am not even sure how to feel or think about this right now as it’s late. She betrayed my trust and faith that I have put into her (in a conversation that I believe took place only shortly before she did so). Maybe the relationship dragged on longer than it should have to begin with, but it all happened so fast… It has a lot to do with me being far away, as she has expressed many times that she wanted me with her and couldn’t carry on like this for another year or more after that. I wanted to take the last week of the year off work and couldn’t visit her before all this happened… I feel like I should have now.

TL;DR: Otherwise faithful, amazing, loving girlfriend of 3 years makes out with a close guy friend from her nursing school days and also gets drunk and makes out with a random drunk guy at a friend’s party after passing out, all 2 weeks before I come back home from a 7 month internship. She says that she has no feelings for him, she doesn’t know how and why it happened (twice!) and that she is sorry about what happened at the party, that I am the only man she loves and she doesn’t (weirdly, all of a sudden) want to lose me, especially not like that. She did all this after I told how much I trust her and think that she can handle herself, not to mention that it strongly goes against her beliefs. What to do/think?

n9bk4,3,2011-12-12,"Advice on a girl I met at an internship, who seemed interested in me, but nothing happened. Can't stop thinking about her since. (xpost from r/relationshipadvice)",throwaway_ra_1337,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/n9bk4/advice_on_a_girl_i_met_at_an_internship_who/,"Seems that this subreddit has a lot more exposure, so crossposting from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/n8fxo/advice_on_a_girl_i_met_at_an_internship_who/), but do comment here.

Okay, so this is a bit of a doozy. I’m looking for advice for a girl and I (both 21 years old now). Some unimportant details will be changed to protect the innocent (though if she saw this post, she’d probably know it was her…). I did a research internship this last summer. She, let’s say her name is Kat, was also in the same program. At first, we didn’t really talk much, since our research wasn’t related – however, she always did seem a bit “friendly”, possibly flirty. Mind you, I’m still a virgin, never kissed, never gone on a date, etc – so I don’t always pick up on these things, but she did seem interested in me, but I wasn’t sure since she seemed somewhat flirty with others besides me too.

It wasn’t until the last few weeks we started to talk. At first it was about her wanting to build something that I’m good at (unimportant detail), I figured it was one of those topics you use to start talking with someone you don’t know. I already had an interest in her, so naturally I flowed the conversation into other things. I friended her on Facebook and suggested we hang out. Kat gave me her number, so I began to text her and whatnot – talked about different things – again, good impressions. I asked her if she’d like to get dinner and watch something (which I thought would be obvious implying it’s a date) and Kat. This was getting close to moving out since the internship was nearly over, so she suggested lunch on campus. I thought, okay, makes sense, Kat’s just really into her research and is trying to do as much as possible before the internship’s over and she has to move out and go back to school.

Well, lunch came, but she ended up cancelling – she said she couldn’t since there was so much stuff to move – which I gave her a pass on since it was the last two days she could be there. I volunteered to help her move out, she obliged. We talked a lot while I helped move her out, on all sorts of topics. Again, I kept getting good vibes, and she seemed bummed we couldn’t do anything. We ate a quick lunch in her apartment (seems like she had her roommate disappear for it). She was mostly moved out at this point, she just had some other stuff she needed to finish up and I wasn’t really able to help there. We did bump in with each other the rest of the afternoon quite a bit, though. Kat asked later on if she could have dinner over at my place – I said that’d be great. So we whipped up something simple, and talked some more, still more great vibes. Finally dinner was over and she was going to go back to her new place (close by) to organize. I offered to help, but Kat said it’d probably be boring (her body language was confusing – it’s as if she did want me to, but didn’t), though it was up to me. I said that’s fine; I probably have to get ready to move out myself, but told her to stop by later if she could so we could maybe watch some of a TV series I suggested to her. We hugged and she was off.

Kat never came by later, texted her and she said she had too much. But she suggested we grab coffee in the morning (hours before I leave), and just have me wake her up in the morning since she’d be pulling a late night. Well, I did, but she said she was too tired and apologized, she was genuinely sorry. At this point I pretty much wrote her off and thought I had been played as a fool. Maybe Kat was leading me on, maybe I was reading way too much into things, I didn’t know. I ended up leaving later than I said I would and texted her goodbye, she said she woke up a bit ago and apologized that she was such a flake and hopefully she’d see me soon (we were hoping to go to the same university next year).

Anyways, she sounded a bit terse in the last text at that point. I was angry with myself for possibly screwing stuff up, and just a bit angry with her for not being clearer. I didn’t text Kat for awhile, but I did eventually and told her everything was fine, we’d meet up some other time. She didn’t text me back. She’s been nice on Facebook, some things happened that raised my eyebrows, thinking maybe she was paying extra attention to me, I wasn’t sure if that was so or if I was reading too much into it. But overall, the last 4 months there’s been little contact with Kat. I’ve been thinking a lot about her and have been going through one of the darkest and roughest patches of my life (some of it related to her, some for other reasons relating to the internship). I really don’t think I can live with myself if I don’t at least give contacting her a try. But I’m not even sure what to do or where to start. Some of my online friends have basically said that I should forget about it, one even said I had been friend zoned, or even worse “pity friended.” I’m not sure if this is the case.

A few extra details that are probably not terribly important: during the internship, she was really close to another intern. I could tell he was interested in her. Though I recently found out via her Facebook that he hasn’t talked to her since he started school again. I also heard a rumor from another intern that she was friends with benefits with some guy back from her hometown – which was plausible seeing how much he posted on her Facebook wall. Something happened with them since then, I think, after looking over Facebook. Maybe these were two reasons she may have held back regarding me, I’m not sure.

Anyhow, I’m hoping you guys can give me some advice regarding Kat and how I can proceed. I’d be alright if we had just a friendship, but it’d be much nicer if there was something more. I thought there were feelings on her part. I knew I definitely did. Being around Kat made me feel so… *alive*. Help. Please.

**tl;dr:** Okay, you really should read the above since this is a long story… but, here you go: met a girl at a summer internship. I started talking to her late in the internship, seems like there was a connection, and I set a date which she was receptive to. She ended up canceling since she was moving out, I helped her move out and we talked a lot, we did a quick informal lunch and dinner together, everything seemed good, but nothing more happened. We were going to meet before I left, but that didn’t happen. She apologized profusely, I accepted and told her we’d meet up again sometime. We’ve barely talked in the last 4 months since the internship. I can’t stop thinking about her and want advice regarding possibly contacting her again."

But not today. Maybe I can feel like shit tomorrow. Or next week. But right now... I'm going to better myself.
I drank some hot chocolate and listened to some upbeat music to clear my head. I made a game plan. Pumped some iron and feel a lot better.

I asked her to design a website with me and I'll do all the technical work.

Now she has a bunch of friends and seems to be so much happier. I took the time off to really better myself as well. I poured myself into school and got an internship and it seems that I'm on a great path. At about 2 months of separation and absolutely no contact, she wrote me a handwritten letter telling me how much she missed me and how bad she wanted me back.

I guess my question is, when is getting back together a good idea?  She crushed my heart but I can forgive that.

",YourDirtySlut,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nblqf/a_series_of_repetitive_failed_relationships_now/,"**UPDATE:** This has been the most confusing 2 weeks imaginable, and I understand the simplicity as to why... he has been torn.  He broke up with me 2 days before my birthday, completely shattered my heart.  The next day, I failed the final I attempted to study for through puffy eyes.  But that day I was determined to start hardening myself and moving on.  4pm that day (the day I failed my final), he started texting me again.  I don't think he could handle NOT doing so.  And I so wanted to talk to him and not lose him.  Wednesday and Thursday we kept texting like we had never broken up, and he even suggested that Thursday night (the night of my birthday), that we spend a last night together (which is what I fucking wanted in the first place).  I agreed.  Again, texting all Friday and I went over to his place this Saturday night to enjoy a final evening together.  I wasn't sure how it was going to be.  If he was going to be weird, if he was going to change his mind again, I didn't know.  When I got the door of his apartment, I received the text I most hoped for... ""So, what do you think about pretending like we never broke up tonight?  Lol.""  What I thought?  FUCK YES.  And let me tell you... it was one of the best nights I can possibly remember, because I got the day I always wanted.  The night was... perfect.  We had crazy, intense sex first, like we were eating each other up.  Then I got my 5 minute break (per usual, the guy cant just have one session...) and we changed to making love for the next hour.  He kissed every inch of my body, and I just wanted to cry in the ecstasy of it all.  Afterward we just held each other, continued to kiss, he stroked my back, and constantly kissed the top of my head or nuzzled his face in it while we watched the credits to the movie we never watched.  I tried to memorize every curve of his face with my fingers while we laid there, traced the veins on his arms.  I was so happy.  He also got me a birthday present as well, something I did not expect with all the confusion that was us.  And it was the most wonderful birthday present I have ever received from a man.  Actually, it was something cheap and simple I have asked EVERY boyfriend since I was 15 to get for me, but none of them ever did: a stuffed animal sprayed with his cologne (even more meaningful since he was leaving me).  Not only that, but it was a stuffed bulldog (my dream dog that I am finally getting this winter).  He also got me this cheesy toy that we played with from the 90s, and gloves to help me avoid callouses at the gym.  As well as a birthday card.  So while we are apart, I can still have his smell and see the intimacy of his handwriting.  As painful and confusing as things I have been, this has been the best birthday of my life.  Today it wasn't goodbye, it was see you later.  But I still cried- a mixture of happiness and knowledge of how much I will miss him.  But I feel a new strength in me.  I know I can handle being single until I see him in February.  And I found an internship for this summer 20min from where he will be living.  I will be seeing my Therapist this Thursday, and that is when we will begin working on my past damage so I can make the next few months until I see him, and then the few months after that until my internship.  Now, I just need to learn how to act/deal while we are apart.  It's going to be hard for me to hold the sap back and treat him as a friend.  But I am really looking forward to seeing what will happen in the future.  2 months until I go the furthest from home I've ever been!

TL;DR- I got my last, wonderful night with him until I see him next.  And he just continued to prove how wonderful and perfect we are for each other.

I'm just so tired of crying right now :(

Little background here... been struggling with depression since I was 15, finally had it beat when I was 21, fell back into it last year when I was in a horrific car crash.

I've never really been single, always sought out the belonging, love, and security of a relationship.  The last time I was single I dated for 2 years, and I thought that was my method of dealing with it.  I was recently in a LTR until the end of October when I finally got out of the abusive relationship that it was.  If had let him tear me down because I didn't want to be alone.  1 month later, I met Greg, and we fell hard and fast for each other.  It was intense and crazy, and I couldn't stick to my ""move slow"" promise for long.  He was physically absolutely GORGEOUS (like Ryan Gosling with a fantastic tan), was sweet and romantic as hell, and best of all, he was crazy about me.

A week and a half after asking me to be his girlfriend, he informed me he was moving back to California and I had no say in it, but he didn't want to let what we had go.  For the past week now we have juggled with what to do.  I wanted to do long distance.  He wanted to just be friends, visit each other, and see what happens.  I accepted his want only if he agreed that he wouldn't be leaving me alone on my birthday (Thursday).

Tonight he tells me he can't do it because it's too hard for him.  WTF?  TOO HARD FOR HIM?? It's my goddamn birthday, I'm in the middle of my finals, and now I'm being dumped?  And he would get what he wants AND move back to California where it's warm and sunny with all his friends?  What the hell am I getting out of this aside from another shitty ass birthday?  Oh yeah, another note?  I have a series of REALLY shitty birthdays... ie, multiple pets have died on my birthdays, last year it snowed 2 feet so I had to cancel (and was in the middle of finals so it was pointless to reschedule to fucking January), and my childhood I dealt with a drunken father every year.

All of my past relationships have ended fairly similar... they use me, abuse me, then take off, and my heart ALWAYS breaks, even when I knew they were total assholes.

My therapist and I did some digging on Monday to figure out why it is I can't be single, why I give so much to relationships, and why I always give in to men. It stems from my childhood, basically.  I always knew it sucked having alcoholic, unaffectionate parents, being an only child, and taking care of myself since I was 9.  But I never realized that it is directly tied to my desire to fall in love and start my own family (I'm about to be 25).  I've never had that security that comes when you are strongly loved, even though I always knew my parents loved me.  I never had someone I could go to to feel safe and comforted.  No one to hold me when I felt like the world was out to get me.  I've spent my WHOLE LIFE struggling on my own with NO ONE to be there unconditionally. I've always felt like a burden to people. And all I have ever wanted was someone to want me, to treat me like I'm important, to treat me like I'm special, and to not leave me.

This is why my past relationships have always ended the same.  Even more so, this is why I am hurting so badly now, because Greg gave me all these things until he told me he was leaving.  He was the first person to really look at me and tell me I was beautiful. Plenty of men have said I was hot, sexy, etc, but that doesn't mean shit these days.  I always forgive men, let them get away with virtually anything, and then they take off and I hurt because I gave it all.  

I have my hobbies.  I have my goals.  I have friends.  I'm on meds that stabilize daily anxiety and depression.  But jesus christ I am so tired of feeling alone."

Description
EVA is quite simply The Best Voice Assistant for Android.

EVA is quite simply the most full featured virtual assistant for Android. If you have tried Vlingo, Speaktoit, Jeannie and Iris and you want something that does most everything they can do plus a lot more then give EVA a try.

naukq,8,2011-12-13,"IamA Pentecostal musician desiring to leave the UPCI, and attend a Nondenominational church. This is my story.",jarlos777,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/naukq/iama_pentecostal_musician_desiring_to_leave_the/,"You see, I grew up Apostolic Pentecostal, and I can relate to the authorative, judgemental, and emotional abusiveness of the UPCI. I currently play Keyboard for a small UPCI church in Washington, and am doubting alot of the Doctrines of the UPCI. My sister and mother were part of ministries, and were removed from said ministries for cutting their hair, and I was threatened to get kicked out of my Keyboard ministry for participating in 'No Shave November'. I often get pulled into jumping for Jesus, and get prayed for by ministers who want me to 'Pray through', to 'Give it all to God' and to 'Stop making God a casual thing'. I love God with all my heart, I love my Jesus so much, that I decided that staying sexually pure for him until marriage was the right thing to do. To represent my commitment to him, I wear a Purity Ring on  my left ring finger. When I wore it to church, my pastor approached me, asking me to remove said ring. I didn't want to make a scene about it, but I did ask, 'Do you not believe in Purity Rings?'. His response was 'not 'till you're married'. I removed it only for the cause of preventing a scene being caused. It hurts to remove it at church; it hurts to get judged for every little thing I do, and it hurts to get preached at for said things. I love God so much, and I highly doubt a God of Love works that way. I have 'spoken in tongues', but I know that all it is, is an Emotional high. It's fake, at least in the UPCI's form of preaching it. People love it, because being wild is fun, especially when a crowd of people are joining you. I notice that it's all just repetitive gibberish, which has no scripture to back up that it's the evidence of having the Holy Ghost, and that it's essential to enter Heaven. I have friends who visited my church, and were told they would not see heaven of they did not speak in tongues. One of them even repeated the gibberish that the ministers were telling him to repeat because he just wanted the ministers off his back. In his head, he was praying for the ministers to leave him.alone.

When we take communion, we are told that we MUST be right with God, otherwise we will bring damnation on our souls. I saw, with tears in my eyes, my mother and sister not participate in Communion as they were met with judgemental looks. My mom is often the outcast of the church, and only a few members speak with her. It hurts me to see my mom cry over this. My Pastor is a good man, but is very authorative, and demands  commitment to every event that the church has. He even rebuked me for skipping Fellowship group because I visited a friend who I hadn't seen for  months. My church lacks a Youth Group. It's so hard to live for God without having  fellowship with young Christians who share your passion. I asked my Pastor if I could miss Wednesday Prayer so I could visit Landmark's Youth Group. He strongly opposed it, and said that he won't have musicians who aren't faithful to the house of God, and that we don't even know the Doctrine that is preached at Landmark. Simply put, I want to leave my church. 


...I'm so scared to do so, though. I'm 18, you see, and I have spend my whole life in the Apostolic Community. I have so many friends who are Apostolic, and I don't want to lose them, but I know I will be shunned if I leave. I know my Pastor will play the 'We don't have anyone to replace you on the Keyboard' card, and that I will 'lose my salvation'. You see, I want to be a Youth Pastor, and my Pastor has asked me to be a Youth Pastor Intern, but I simply refuse to preach the lies of the UPCI. My parents support me, but my little sister often judges me for wanting to leave. Thank God no one else in my family is Apostolic, otherwise I would die of a broken heart for all the 'shame' I would have of being a 'backslider'. It hurts to think of all the connections I'll lose, but I no longer want to live for God out of fear. I want to be my God's friend. I'm so scared, and I am asking for help.

Your Brother in Jesus,

nakwf,27,2011-12-12,"If you live near Hammond, please read this... SLU is up to no good!!",seekingjustice2012,Louisiana,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/nakwf/if_you_live_near_hammond_please_read_this_slu_is/,"Southern Louisiana, you disappoint me. I wrote -EVERY- media outlet I could find an address for in the area and told them about Southeastern Louisiana University suing to contest my great aunt's last will and testament. In what amounts to blatant fraud and taking advantage of the elderly, SLU wined and dined my great aunt and got themselves written into her will. When she was admitted to the hospital with terminal cancer, my grandmother, my mother, and my aunt showed up to take care of her as well as watch over her home and property- which had already been used for personal profit by the 'nice lady down the street'. My great aunt realized she was wrong to have left out her own blood from her last will, and changed it in the hospital two weeks before she died.

In an -unprecedented- move, SLU sued the estate of my great aunt. Yes, that's right, a publicly funded institution is suing to gain control of a family's last Louisiana home. So far, it's easy to say that the university has spent more on attorneys fees than the property is even worth.

Ladies and Gentlemen of the internet, it is time to stand up to institutions like this and hold them accountable for spending our hard-earned money. I have written the Governor of Louisiana as well as the President of SLU, Dr. John Crain, with an offer for a generous donation in my great aunt's name for them to drop the lawsuit.

I have yet to see a response from either individual or a representative of their offices.

How can people sleep at night knowing that the very institutions that we pay for will break every fundraising ethics rule (and even federal law) to make a quick buck?

Do you think my family is the only family SLU has done this to? They saw dollar signs when they took my great aunt out to formal dinners with a 19 year old intern as her escort (that goes waaaaay beyond cougar, my friends). They saw dollar signs when my great aunt donated small sums to SLU (could it have been because she was a teacher her whole life?). And they saw dollar signs when they noticed she owned a home, and had been a widow for some time. They neglected to realize she had any family in the area, and broke fundraising rules by intentionally separating her from her family. 

Sadly, there is very little public exposure for this heinous crime, as the media will not investigate the story while the court case is ongoing. Instead, the judge will most likely rule in favor of the University as he himself is an alumni of SLU and as we all know, Louisiana isn't exactly free of nepotism and corruption.

Shame on you Louisiana. For letting a school that you pay for, that should be accountable to you for its actions, to take a home from a family while posting a loss of money to pay for the attorneys fees.

Shame on all of us for not taking a stand, and instead finding comfort in the warm embrace of apathy.

If you care, feel free to repost this to your page and express your feelings. I welcome a hearty debate should you feel SLU is doing the right thing.

najmi,6,2011-12-12,Has anyone studied  P.R and then realized it totally was not for them?,marieelaine03,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/najmi/has_anyone_studied_pr_and_then_realized_it/,"This might not be the best place for me to post my question, as anyone who isn't interested in P.R probably won't look at this sub reddit, but I figured I'd ask...

When I was 17 and needed to decide what to study, I chose Public Relations without any hesitation at all...I thought I'd love it, and more importantly, I thought I'd be good at it...I guess you can say I had passion for it.
I went to cegep (mandatory in Quebec before going to university) for 2 years in Communications.
Then I did a 4-year bachelor's degree in Communication Studies.
And to add to it, I did a 2-year university certificate in public relations management.
That's a total of 8 years of school for this.

I needed to get a good stable job to pay rent...I went on a few P.R job interviews but did not get the job.
I then took an office job so I can live comfortably and pay the rent.

I've worked there for 3 years now.
Family and friends ask me when I'm going to start working in P.R...some even send me links to job postings and let me know when internships are available.
The trouble is that I have absolutely no passion for it anymore.. I actually don't see myself being successful in the type of business...I just don't see it happening.
I know I don't want to work in an office forever though...so I've decided to start a new 4-year program to become an elementary school teacher.

I have a friend who also studied PR, and she has been working in the industry for the past 4 years. Her resume is super impressive, she's worked for really important huge multi-million dollar corporations as a PR / Media person. When I think about that, I get a little twinge in the sense that "" could I have done that too, had I just worked harder to get a job in the field?""...but then again, if my passion is absolutely and 100% gone, there's a reason for that!
I don't regret studying P.R in any way because at the time I absolutely loved studying it and enjoyed my time at school....
but part of me hates that I kind of wasted a lot of money/time.

So my question to you guys : when you finished your studies and started working in P.R...was the passion still there?
Did you have any second thoughts like I did..or did you still feel you were right for the industry?
Did you start working in P.R and then realize it's not what you thought it would be? (and if so..did you still stick it out and work in the field even though you didn't love it?)...or did the opposite happen, and working in P.R was exactly what you'd thought?

This is just for my curiosity, but I appreciate any response :) thanks!"
nd1kp,5,2011-12-14,Advice for a winter noob,shutup_takemoney,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/nd1kp/advice_for_a_winter_noob/,"Hey guys! I'm having problem in determining what to buy for winter in the Northeast USA. I'll be be moving in January to Connecticut, commuting to NYC for a internship in video post production. 

I've practically have lived all my life in a place where the minimum in winter is 70F (Puerto Rico). As such, practically all my clothes are suited for summer. I do have a couple of sweaters and hoodies, but that is all in regards to cold weather clothing.

I'm aware that I need to buy a coat, boots and winter accessories. My question is, what kind of coat and boots could I buy that can handle a Connecticut winter while still being somewhat fashionable? I know that in freezing temperatures sometimes being fashionable is not an option, but would like to know my options. Would a peacoat keep me warm in 15F to 20F? If not, what kind of coats would work for that? Would [this](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/LaceupBoots~212469_-1.html?bcc=y&amp;action=order_more&amp;sku_0=::ZDB&amp;CM_MERCH=IDX_Men-_-ShoesAccessories-_-Shoes&amp;origin=index) boots be enough to last me thorough winter? They can be had for $70 now. I expect to walk about 30 minutes from the home I'm staying to the train station in Connecticut. 

My budget is around $275 for both the boots and coat. Since I don't have a lot of money, I would like that the items I buy would be as versatile as possible. Can it be done?

PS. I'm 5'9"", weight between 155-160 and about to turn 22, if that sort info is of any use. Also, are long johns necessary?

Thanks guys."

Dexter is like ""woah this search engine is good, I'm gonna stalk all my victims and secret shit on it from now on"". This had NO IMPORTANCE on the show's plot, yet the scene was placed there for a reason.

Knowing that Lewis is a typical TV-show ""computer geek-hacker"" maybe he made this search engine himself that logs searches, and only told Dexter? So Lewis can see his search history? Maybe not cause he thought he was a killer but because he has a boner for Dexter. After this he found a correlation between Dexter's search history and recent future events (I think he searched for a bunch of suspicious things before they were known to the force). And now he knows Dexter is not who he seems.

ncq1p,49,2011-12-14,"SEX. There, do I have your attention? (This post is long and hard)",tossaway_FTM,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/ncq1p/sex_there_do_i_have_your_attention_this_post_is/,"Well it’s probably a bad idea for me to be writing this right now because it’s finals week and in the words of Anya: “These things are real, they’re dangerous, and they’re coming.”  

But I wanted to share this kind of bizarre experience I had that was very outside my comfort zone but ended up being really rewarding in a strange way.  

I’m not an outgoing guy as far as romance goes. I started transition when I was 18 and I’m nearly 25 now and the last time I had sex it was before I was even out yet, so you do the math. I think part of my gender identity disorder manifests in that I don’t see myself as sexy, or as a sexual being. My mental age in that category is stuck at 16—I just don’t ever feel like I’m ready to share my body with anyone else. It’s private, and it’s not exactly a place of happiness for me. My body has been my main source of unhappiness for all my life, how can I feel comfortable letting other people see it?

And now, many years on T later and years out of top surgery (the number of people who have seen my post-op chest, I can count on one hand), I still can’t help the feeling that my body is gross, unsexy, how could anyone find me attractive, just no. I can barely look at myself below the belt, why should anyone else want to conduct business anywhere in that vicinity?  

But recently I’ve been horny, ok? So shoot me. I think I passed the many sexless years with grace and dignity, and now I wanted to just get some. And I wanted a man, a biological, cisgender man.  

I should add that I’ve never been with a cis-man before. I had never touched a dick or even seen one that close up, let alone let anyone fuck me. The last time someone put something up there, I was on my gyno’s table and it was hot, let me tell you. (That’s a joke, BTW. It was extremely traumatic and I immediately had a panic attack.)  

Anyway, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I wanted to know, to absolutely *know*, what I’m missing. I wanted a man to lay in my bed, take his god damn clothes off, and let me touch him just about everywhere. And I didn’t want him to touch me, because I’m sexless and unattractive and no one wants to be with me because gross. I just wanted him to be my human model so I could get a look at what I don’t have and never will have.  

This semester I “studied abroad,” but actually I just went to my state capitol city for four months and worked an internship. I got a four-month lease on a student apartment so I had a perfect place to experiment on any possible male trysts. So I was just missing a dude with a dick who would let me touch him and possibly put his dick in my mouth. Hey, I said I was curious. So sue me.  

So I went to the same place you always go when you need something strange: THE INTERNET. And it took a few weeks, but eventually a guy did message me. And I swear, he was *perfect*. 33 years old, attractive, interested in trans guys (it’s possible he was a chaser but I really don’t care because I was essentially “chasing” him too), and he told me two key things during messaging before meeting him:  

1.	He would do as much or as little as I wanted and he wouldn’t push or hassle me about it.
2.	He would lay back and let me explore his body.  

Fucking perfect, right?? That’s what I’m saying!  

So long story short, at the beginning of the semester he came over and let me do what I wanted to him, and I did what I wanted. And he even got me to take my shirt off. I had completely forgotten how nice it was to have someone touch my skin like that. So even though I was nervous about it, he made me feel really good about it. He *liked* my chest, and he liked what I was doing to him.  

For the record, it turns out I give *great* blowjobs.  

He left after he came, I never let him touch me anywhere below my belt but I told him if he wanted to do it again some time then he was welcome to come back. I told him when I was leaving town and he said OK. In the morning I texted him “Hey thanks for letting me blow you” essentially, he said, “Nah bro thank YOU,” and that was that for a few weeks.  

About two weeks ago he texted me again, he wanted to come over and this time he wanted to “go further.” I freaked out for a few days, finally texted him back saying, essentially, “Sounds scary but let’s do it.”  

I threw caution to the wind. I was very scared to let him see me, and possibly even fuck me, but the thing is that he was a really sweet guy and I knew he would stop if I felt uncomfortable, and the even bigger thing is that I knew, I just *knew*, that I would regret it if I didn’t take this opportunity. So I decided to just do it.  

Well, he came over last night and I let him do whatever the fuck he wanted to do, and it was great, okay? Just great. I didn’t have an orgasm but that’s ok because even on the best of days it’s hard for me to come, let alone with this relative stranger conducting business near my junk. It still felt fucking awesome and I was still really glad I did it.  

But I think the best thing I got out of this whole experience is that, yes, there are people who are going to be attracted to me, and they can be nice people! They can be cool people and people with interests similar to mine. I don’t have to be alone forever, as long as I take a little extra effort to put myself out there and meet people.  

So here’s my advice to struggling trans people out there in the lonely stealth world: *Do one thing that scares you every day.* Just do one thing that puts you outside of your comfort zone even just a little bit, and you will find that your zone is expanding faster than you could ever have imagined it would.  

Thanks for reading, if you read it. I know it’s a lot but I just had to get it out there.  

TL;DR – I fucked a cis-guy and it was AWESOME.

years.",abHowitzer,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/nbo5r/she_loved_me_less_conclusion_reached_after_nearly/,"Preface: I'm a 22-year old male, diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD. She's 21 years old. Both studying.
I'm going to be living in another city (150km away) for an intership from February to May 2012.
Important: We share 90% of our friends and hang-out places. So we can't really go ""on a break"" mentally as we'll see each other at least twice a week.

We've been together since February 2008, so a bit short of four years. We were a high-school couple.

She doubted our relationship two weeks ago, saying she didn't know where it went. Saying she couldn't really picture me in her future.  I fought for our relationship that whole weekend. We (she?) decided to give it another chance.

But this night, it all came out. The doubts never left. Contrary to that, we had a really great time this weekend. We did a lot of things together, enjoyed each other, had good sex (imho). To me, signs that everything was okay. But I felt uneasy.

Yesterday evening, she texted me saying how she loved me, how she wanted to persevere even though I'd be leaving for the internship. She's clearly battling her own emotions, but seems to have taken a permanent decision.

She doesn't love me enough. It has been that way for some time. I clearly remember me always feeling like the one who needed more affection, even though I'm the dude. (Yes, I know that's macho.)
But I always attributed that to me being overly needy and her being normal.

Right now, I don't know what the fuck to do.

I had three securities, things that made me who I am: My family, my friends and my girlfriend.
My friends are very supportive, they've already checked up on me.

But what the fuck? It was me and her. We love(d) each other. I still fucking do, so much. I didn't care the lack of affection, I was happy with what I had.

And what now? I have fucking nothing. I just feel betrayed and humiliated.

What can I do to get over this as soon as possible?"

questions",Progenitus,malaysia,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/neexg/hi_rmalaysia_im_going_to_be_spending_some_time_in/,"I've asked this in /r/travel as well, but I figured going to locals would also be a good plan!

I've got the opportunity to spend 6 weeks doing a work study/internship in Kuala Lumpur in May/June. I haven't officially decided to go or not, but I almost certainly will be.

My first concern is getting an accurate idea of how much it's going to cost me; flights and accommodations are taken care of in the program cost, so I was hoping someone could give me an estimate of what kind of costs I'd be looking at for food/travel. The apartments are apparently located in the heart of the city (listed as 'across the street' from the Petronas Towers), but lets assume I'm going to have to use transit to and from work each day.

Second, I'd really love some ideas on what to do in my free time. As I said, I'll be doing an internship during the day but I'll have evenings and weekends free. The program includes two 'cultural trips' which I believe leave the city, although I'm not sure what they entail. That leaves me a few weekends free that I'd be willing to go somewhere if it was feasible.

Lastly, any tips about living in Kuala Lumpur/Malaysia in general, be it culture, cuisine, work ethics, etc. would be fantastic.

The apartments are apparently located in the heart of the city (listed as 'across the street' from the Petronas Towers), but lets assume I'm going to have to use transit to and from work each day.

Second, I'd really love some ideas on what to do in my free time. As I said, I'll be doing an internship during the day but I'll have evenings and weekends free. The program includes two 'cultural trips' which I believe leave the city, although I'm not sure what they entail. That leaves me a few weekends free that I'd be willing to go somewhere if it was feasible.

Lastly, any tips about living in Kuala Lumpur/Malaysia in general, be it culture, cuisine, work ethics, etc. would be fantastic.

Thanks!"

the O stuipdly capatalized because who would pay an intern to do
that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.

Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.

Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.

Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past. 
What?

Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.

===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
show you wanted.

I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
again for all this crazy shit.

Sincerely, Louis C.K."

    trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
    reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
    tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
    the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
    overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
    possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
    back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
    pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
    you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
    fat sweaty dolt).

    I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
    and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
    bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
    same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
    show you wanted.

    I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
    was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
    happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

    I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
    that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
    it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
    interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
    shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
    interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

    I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
    my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
    Industries, who created the website.

    I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
    goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
    again for all this crazy shit.

    Sincerely, Louis C.K."
ndrmu,1,2011-12-15,"Reddit, I need your help to find the motivation I need to get a job.",[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/ndrmu/reddit_i_need_your_help_to_find_the_motivation_i/,"Okay so here's the situation.

I'm 21 and recently dropped out of engineer school. Up until now I lived on my (private) student loan, but money is coming short after the past months and I need a job to keep paying rent and everything. My parents are good people but I would feel really bad asking them for any money since I actually have lots of free time to work my own job now.

I live in a medium to large city in France and I have behind me 4 years of formation in IT, plus the standard high school scientific formation. I can basically do anything one would need with a computer; I can do sysadmin, databases, network admin, programming and webdev (although I dislike webdev). I can also do gamedesign even though I don't have actual formation in the domain, I worked on different amateur projects in the past 7 years, most of them never went too far. And I have my own game design document for a rather large idea I've had for the whole past years I keep with me and improve on every now and then with the help of fellow designer friends.

So here is where the things get tough. I have an history of heavy procrastination since I'm a kid and I always managed to do the things I like instead of the things I have to do. I value my free time and freedom more than anything else. I'm also a long time hardcore gamer, not only video games but also tabletop role-playing games and card games and I would feel very unhappy if I was to give up on them. I was also thinking seriously about getting into pro-gaming to be able to live off my passion, but seeing as the probability to make it is rather small and I have pressing short term budget issues to solve, this is an idea I keep for later if I ever decide to give it a try.

Ideally I would like to find a part-time job in IT that permits me to keep most of my free time while still having enough money to sustain myself over time. I looked through job offers on the web and most of them are not quite what I'm looking for. Employers are looking to hire full-time in 99% of the cases or they look for part-time internship contracts with students who are still in school. The salary they offer in IT for a fulltime job is also way too much compared to what I need. To give you an idea, job offers that suit my profile are about 20,000 to 25,000€ a year for someone with little to no experience, when I only spend about 650€ per month (7,800€ a year) including rent, food, bills and various government financial aids.

I've been undecided as to what to do for the past month (or even more), thinking about it every day and kind of putting it into a corner of my mind since I can't settle on a final decision. I've been too hesitant to even fill up an application, even though I have my complete resume at hand. Finding a decent job is actually the most difficult thing I had to do thus far and I didn't think it would be that hard to get a situation that is both profitable for me and for my future employer, since I don't want to get a job and feel like I'm forced to wake up every day, wasting my time into an unenjoyable, necessary duty and not be productive because of that (this happened in the past with internships I worked and I felt pretty bad after that).

So that's the problem I'm facing right now. Actually just coming up with this post was kinda hard for me and I wouldn't admit any of this if it wasn't for the relative anonymity of the internet. Any tip or advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. And if you took the time to read this entirely, thank you."
ndlgj,8,2011-12-15,Not sure if I'm strong enough to forgive,Bleachd,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ndlgj/not_sure_if_im_strong_enough_to_forgive/,"Hey Reddit I could really use your help tonight.  I’m having a pretty tough time and would like to get this off my chest.  I hope putting this out there will make me feel better.  Over the summer I started dating this girl.  We fell pretty hard pretty fast.  I am a sales engineer and work and she was the intern in one of our other divisions.  We had a great relationship for a while.  She had a guy friend that lived here in town.  (You can already see where this is going.)  

Anyway, she had been spending some time with him.  She went to a wedding with him and didn’t come home that night.  I was furious.  I packed up all of her things and left them by the front door.  When she got home in the morning she began crying her eyes out.  We argued and she genuinely convinced  me that this guy was only a friend.  From that point forward our relationship deteriorated.  She became withdrawn and distant and our sex life dwindled.  When I would confront her she claimed that my overreaction to her not coming home had upset her and she just wasn’t able to get over it.  Things got worse and worse until she went back to finish her last year of college in fall.  Finally, I couldn’t take her distant attitude and ended the relationship.   

I moved on with life and dated some other girls, went out and had fun.  She was never completely able to leave me alone though.  I’d get random calls asking my advice on things and I maintained to everyone that she was still my friend.  I should mention, she has been offered a full time position at our company so I will be seeing her again… A LOT in June 2012.  So one night a month or so ago it came out that she missed me… and I told her that I missed her as well.  We had seen each other a few times and spent a lot of time talking.  We made plans to spend New Year’s Eve together in Chicago and exchange gifts for Christmas.  

I have a sales call not far from her university tomorrow morning so we agreed to have dinner tonight and exchange gifts.  We were having a nice evening, talking lightly about how we missed each other.   Then she dropped the bomb on me.  She teared up and admitted that over the summer, she had been cheating on me with her friend… the first night was the night I suspected and it continued on from there all summer.  She started to cry and tell me how much she loved me and how she hated herself for it.  She said something about she was 21 and made a mistake.  To be honest, I just zoned out and gazed into the distance.  Finally, she just got up and walked out of the bar.  I chased after her and said, “You said a lot of shit in there… but I never heard you say you were sorry.”  She started to cry harder and tell me she loved me, kissed me, and ran.  I came back to my hotel….devastated.   

Reddit, I don’t know if I can forgive her or trust her again.  I know I don’t need to make that decision tonight.  I feel humiliated, hurt, angry, and strangely numb.  I’m embarrassed that as a 27 year old man, who prides himself on being able to read into other people…. That a 21 year old girl took advantage of me and hurt me this bad.   I spent most of my 20’s being a less than upstanding gentlemen when it comes to the opposite sex, maybe this is karma.  But I had to meet so many girls to find this one that I truly loved… I’m scared of how long it will take me to find another one.  I’ll get through this (maybe with her or maybe without her) but I’ll come out a better person on the other side… I could just use some friendly words of encouragement right now."

I was honestly not nervous at all, in fact I was calm as shit, because I didn't need the job because the ad on the website didn't mention the limited time frame.

I told him ""I'm naturally a calm person.""
He said ""oh good, we were hoping for a really extroverted person""


I replied ""I can be extroverted depending on the situation, I play in a band and that usually calls for extra extroversion. I can't just stand there I have to be very fluid and in the moment.""

My question is, do interviewers expect the interviewee to be jumpy, loud and really anxious?

I felt that I should act professional and not really anxious.

I can act extroverted when needed, so next time should I act nervous/jumpy/ditsy since I don't really feel nervous during interviews?"

It seriously is me. Im even going to leave
the O stuipdly capatalized because who would pay an intern to do
that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.

Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.

Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.

Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past.
What?

Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.

Regards. Sincerely, Actually,

Louis

===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who

same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the

it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you

My grandfather was dying.  He had been ill since about March and was progressively getting worse until he died at the end of May, the day of my graduate commencement (he passed three hours before the ceremony). During this time, I was in a very intense internship and R. was on my team. R is an older lady who was about to retire and took me under her wing.  I was struggling with my own health issues, my grandfather dying, and the weight of such an intensive internship on my shoulders.  She understood what I was going through unlike any other person that I worked with. It was R. who told me to stand up and pretty much tell everyone to go screw themselves  and just take care of me.  Without her, I would have not survived those three grueling months and the time after graduation when I was flailing around.  I took her advice to heart, did some soul searching and this spring, I am going back to school and completely changing my career.  Today, I did some online stalking, found her address and am mailing her a Christmas card that truly thanks her for what she did for me.

A 60 year old women that tells you and someone on your behalf to go screw themselves is pretty baddass and even though its been six months since I've seen her, I hope to see again soon one day.

So thank you R for being your badass self and having so much compassion when you didn't need to. "

Proof that it can work.,dlmead,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ngj2q/in_a_little_less_than_one_month_my_ldr_will_be/,"After two and a half long years of trying to move to NY to be closer to my SO it's finally happening! I have been commenting on posts for a while, but I have never told our whole story. I figure now would be a good time. Warning, this will most likely be very long.


We met while both working at Disney world as college ""interns"" in April of 2009. At the time I was dating his roommate at the time but he says the instant I walked through their apartment door he was in love. After a few weeks I could kind of tell that he liked me, especially the night of the formal when he told me that I looked beautiful about five times. I was starting to get kind of creeped out, but my then BF told me thats just how he was. Slowly but surely we started to become good friends, and when the other relationship came to an end I really started to rely on him. About two weeks after the break up he tried to kiss me for the first time by pulling the strings on my hoodie, but I pretended to be distracted by the parade. A week or so later one of his roommates LD GF's came into town and we spent a nice morning in the theme parks with them. Apparently as soon as we left to get to work the GF asked the BF how long we had been together. When he responded that we weren't, she told him that he needed to find a way to get us together because we were perfect for each other. Later that week as we were sitting in my apartment eating lunch he randomly asked me if I would consider moving to New York after our internship if I fell madly in love with him, because if so he would up his game. I told him I didn't realize that he had a game, but really I wanted to shout yes! That night when we were at EPCOT we decided to have our picture taken, and the photographer tried to get us to kiss and look lovingly into each others eyes. He kissed me on the cheek, but I wished he had just kissed me then. Also that night we decided to both sleep at his apartment since my roommate had her boyfriend over. We spent an hour awake just whispering with each other and cuddling. We almost kissed, but we could feel someone's eyes watching.We both were moving back home a month later, and I was scared to start something to have it end so quickly, but every day we spent together I liked him more and more. For my birthday he had planned to surprise me by taking me to a super fancy restaurant, and I decided to surprise him by kissing him. The day before my birthday he got fired, and had to move home unexpectedly. The day before he left we sat cuddling in my apartment, and I wanted to tell him how I felt so badly, but I just couldn't do it.

 
Later that month I decided to surprise him by flying to NY with his roommate, the one that had his GF visit earlier. I told myself that I needed to go so that I could figure out how I felt, but I already knew that I wanted to be with him, and only him. On the first plane up I started writing a letter to tell him how I felt since I am better at writing things down then saying them, but on the second flight the roommate was watching me write so I didn't write everything that I wanted to. I spent the first three days of the trip depressed because I couldn't bring myself to tell him. Finally the roommates GF showed up and at a party that night I confided in her that I really liked him, and I didn't know how to tell him. She told me that he had said that he has loved me since the moment I walked into their apartment. That put a smile on my face, and after a few more drinks I finally got the courage to tell him. Our first kiss happened that night because when I told him I started hyperventilating and kept trying to talk. So our first kiss was to get me to shut up. Two days later when it was time for me to leave and we decided to not be exclusive at first and discuss it after the next time we saw each other. When I was getting on the subway to the airport he kissed me over the turnstiles and then two minutes later came rushing down the stairs to say that he wanted to say goodbye some more, and also he had left his i-pod in my purse.
    

We didn't see each other until that January when we met up at Disney World. It was on that trip that I told him I loved him, and he told me he was 85% sure that he loved me. The actual words didn't come until July, but he said it in different ways. We ended up not discussing the relationship thing while we were together, but three weeks later on January 27th he told me that he couldn't take it anymore and he wanted me to be his girlfriend, and I accepted.
     

We were able to visit each other every other month for the first while, and then when I moved back to Florida we saw each other every month. This past January when I moved back home, which is Portland, OR, and he started a new job we realized that we weren't going to be able to visit each other for quite a while. That put a lot of stress on both of us, and I got especially depressed because I didn't have a job and I didn't really have a life outside of talking to him which was a big mistake. In May I broke up with him, but we said that if I ended up in NY later we would try again. We didn't make it that long though. We started talking every day again in August, and in September he came out for a visit and we were officially together again. I moved to Utah in October for a job that hasn't been working out so well, so I started looking for jobs in NY, and yesterday I got offered one! I will be an hour and a half train ride, or a 45 minute drive away from him which will be some amazing. I am visiting him next week and will be there until the 4th of January and then on the 13th I move to NY for good. We have definitely had our ups and downs but I am so glad that we were both willing to see this through because so soon we won't have to say goodbye for longer than a few days at a time instead of a few months. So to all of you guys in LDR's when it's the right person it is so worth it.
Tl;dr Had an up and down LDR with someone I met at Disney World, but in a month we won't be LDR anymore :)"

I'll start with a little bit of back story...

So my girlfriend and I have been dating since about july last year, coming up to a year and a half, we met through my friend and his girlfriend (different story), really hit it off etc. Anyway, so for the first three-four months, we were not exclusive, we liked each other, saw each other regularly, but were still doing our ""own thing"". It was really fun, exciting ladida. We finally became ""exclusive"" at around January time, when we both realised that we were not getting with other people, not because we felt bad, but because we didn't want to (if that makes sense). Roll on a few months and we reached our first argument(after 9months). 

Basically, this guy that used to like her, she was out clubbing, so was he, they were talking and she sent me a text saying ""this guys wants to get with me"". About a month later when she came down to my university(we go to different universities, about hour away no big deal) and we ended up getting drunk... She then told me that the guy kissed her, but she pulled away and didn't let it continue. I was naturally, a little angry, the whole ""typical excuse he kissed me I didn't do anything) but by this point, I was emotionally attached and decided to give her ad break, we just really click. I am the sort that's very picky about girls. So everything is really well until summer when we both go on internship.

We ended up doing the same internship. Which required us to live in houses with 4-5 other people. She ended up being in a house with 4 other guys. This didnt bother me much, as there was little time to go out partying and what not because of the intensity of the internship. It lasted for 10weeks, we saw each other about 4-5 times during it. It was no big deal, but obviously, living with guys, I was a little worried... But I'm very trusting and didn't really bother me.. Until our last night out for our awards ceremony. 

She was extremely flirty with some of the guys in her team in the club (night out before awards), we have never really been the type of couple that has to spend every second together.. But it bothered me. I raised it up with her in the club.. Got in a huge argument and ended up with me going home because she accused me of cheating (I have never cheated in my life, it's sick and I find it disrespectful. Being from a middle eastern background, respect is a major thing for me). Anyway..

The night if the awards ceremony, I was staying with her team in the hotel study had booked, so we agreed to not fight and just have fun with our friends. The awards was fine. We then went to a after party with the whole company.. Again I was ignored and disregarded for, she ended up getting quite drunk. This is where my paranoia starts.. On the way home, she was holding hands with one foe the guys in her team.. Me and the rest of her team went to get some food, they went back to the hotel without us. When I finally got back, I found both of them outside the hotel room waiting, we went into the room, I lay down on the bed, at which point she comes and lays next to me. That's fine. Then she gets up and begs the guy to take her to her room. They went up to his room(another guy there also from her team). After about 10mins I decide to go get her. Arguing all the way back down to our room. I then leave in the morning, not saying goodbye and went home. We basically then had a chat about it, and she apologised and apologised and apologised. We decided that with friends of the opposite sex, we can be ""friendly"" but not to that extent or rub it in each others faces like she did(I'm okay with the being friendly with friends, as I have a few very close female friends). Then things have been better than ever ever since then. 

But, as part of the internship, the best performers go on a company trip(their team won best team) I could not go on the holiday, but now she's in a sunny country with all her team and that guy. I'm just paranoid that she will do something.. Being clubbing, drunk for a week, with ad guy that has a clear interest in her (which she disagrees with that he has an interest, but it's a little obvious) I think something could accidentally happen.. 

I dunno, am I being paranoid? Or is this natural? Or should I bail.. We are both nearly 21.. So its not the end of the world, but I just click with her, she lovely. Would appreciate some advice. Thanks so much.

nj0ql,3,2011-12-19,I'd do anything for you...but I hate you.,iHateYou_iThink,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/nj0ql/id_do_anything_for_youbut_i_hate_you/,"You're my best friend. You know that. I think you and I have been through a decent amount of the bullshit but we kind of made it through. Sort of.

You know, I get some weird looks when I tell people you're my best friend. They question your character, if I could trust someone like you. I have for almost a decade now, maybe this is all out of habit. I know you're a good person at heart. I know you honestly...well probably wish the best for me. I like to think you wish the best for me but part of me isn't so sure any more.

You have your boyfriend and I'm happy for you. Maybe he provides that normalcy in your life you've never really had. I didn't like him at first, but I realized he's an okay guy. He worries about you, he cares about you and he loves you. I'm happy you have that. You probably deserve that much.

I just don't know if this friendship goes both ways my dear. As the months have drawn on...I think this has been a one way street. A street I should probably turn around on and get off of.

I've never truly gotten advice from you. You've always been short with me. Never taking in what I had to say and trying to give something back. Always trying to turn it back to you. I just sort of accepted that's how you dealt advice and moved on. I've never pointed out a girl to you that you've approved of or thought ""was right for me."" It was a negative and then move on. When things didn't pan out, you said sorry. But did it relieve you in a way? Did you have a sigh of relief that someone wouldn't be taking up my time away from you? When she dumped me, you just told me about how you couldn't see your boyfriend. So I bottled it up. You weren't interested in it...so forget it.

When I got my internship acceptance letter and you found out, you brushed it off. You just couldn't give a shit less, could you? Or were you mad? All of my friends whom I told we're excited. They offered congrats, wanted to start scheduling going away things and the like. And you? You tried to tell me how your friend hated it. That I wasn't going to like it. You didn't even want to talk about it further. On my birthday, you made it an objective to take potshots at me in front of my friends. You haven't said so much as a word about if we'll see each other before we leave. I'm going to be gone for eight months, maybe longer. But I don't know if you care, our if you want to act like I'm not leaving.

Right now I could care less if I ever see you again. I don't know if I can stomach your presence.

What am I to you? Do you have these weird feelings for me? A jealousy of seeing me go further and not being that crying shoulder? Do you enjoy seeing me fail and come down to this miserable level? 

You tell me I'm your best friend. And I'd do anything for you. Maybe I love you still. But right, now I hate you. I don't want to...but I hate you so much. "
nibjp,2,2011-12-19,Dexter Season 6 Finale (Spoilers!),FlopShop,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/nibjp/dexter_season_6_finale_spoilers/,"Personally, I stopped enjoying the season about half way through it. The only thing I enjoyed about the finale was when Deb catches him. 

There was a lot of filler in this season that all seemed to happen for no reason at all. (Brother Sam seemed almost forgotten by the episode after he died, Dex going to Nebraska for nothing, Brian coming back for one episode, etc.) The one thing that annoyed me, is the plot gaps and the things that the writers are kind of brushing off, reason being that I always treasured Dexter as the show that never did that. (Remember in season 5 when Quinn was tailing him, and found that his partner got killed? Apparently the writers don't.)

But really, Dex just seemed invincible this season. Even though he was making stupid mistakes, nothing ever happened. Like when he was captured by Travis, he got away without a scratch. And the season ended with so many questions left unanswered, and with a cliffhanger, which Dexter never usually does as a show. Who was the intern video game kid, and why did he send the Ice Truck Killer arm to Dex? What's happening to Quinn? 

Anybody agree, or disagree?"

**But you are not in prison or dead... who knows what could have happened to you.**  
Worse case scenario I'd be in jail and have food everyday no goddamn bills and no worries about money lol


----
**I don't know if the drug game is friendlier in Canada, but in America you either end up doing life in prison, dead, or with a semi-successful rap career that ends in you doing pop music with Katy Perry. Are you any good a rap? That guy Snow was from Canada and he was pretty good.**  

**Seriously, there are more important things in life than money. Freedom and not getting shot come to mind. Someone once told me that ""nothing worth doing is ever easy"" and I've found it to be true.**  


lol that made me laugh thanks.

In my experience to get shot at I'd really really really would be out of luck.
The only time I had a gun pointed at me was when I used to drive escorts and some black guys that knew what we were doing came knocking on my car window with his gun out so he could get a free blow job from one of those dumb ass bitch of escorts. I just drove away.

nothing worth doing is ever easy... Yeah but you are supposed to get something out of it! I got NOTHING from going the hard route doing the right thing. I've found to be true that to keep doing something you need to get some returns 


----
**Why would someone downvote this? Seriously, this guy could use a break. He's trying to do the right thing. Perhaps a few upvotes will get him noticed by someone that can give him a legit job.**  

**Do you really think doing the right thing is going to be the easy thing? Fuck no. Often it isn't. But I sincerely feel for you and wish things would have worked out eazy breazy.**  

**If you haven't already, expand your job search to any-fucking-where. Move if you have to for a job. Even if you don't want to leave where you are, do it and in a couple years come back when you can find a job where you want to be.**  

**If you do go back to your former vocation, do it just for the rent, just to squeak by. Don't sell the E and speed. Stick to pot. Don't get any new customers, only people you know to limit your risk. And do it while you're looking for a real job!**  

I'm looking all over the place I'm at a point I don't even look where the job is I job apply and if I get it I don't care I'll move. E and speed is way more profitable then only weed thats the big problem. And yeah if I go back it would just to make ends meet. 
And yeah I need a break I've been working on getting my shit together since 2008 and after 3 years of hard work and always telling myself continue like this its gonna work out somehow...

But to be honest I've lost hope, its just been too much without anything good coming out of it


----
**Honestly, I would go back to dealing. You have experience in the business and could be smarter about it. Based on your responses, you're not that afraid of the law or going to prison. You did the right thing and tried to live a good life, but now you're at a position where you're just trying to survive. If anything, repeat the cycle by dealing, saving, getting a real degree like more than a bachelor's and looking for a good job.**  
Yeah all I got to do is manage a way to survive till next spring so my seasonal job with no real future that isn't in my field starts again.

Which sucks that after finishing school the only job I could get was not in my field and the irony is it paid more than I would have in my field.... 

And to be honest I should have put in my title it was either going back to sell drug or to drive escorts again which I did before selling drugs.



----
**Isn't it sad in our world that its easier to do something illegal to get by on than do ""the right thing"" and get by on it?**  
Actually it really is. But I won't go back to old ways gonna give land surveying another year then change career if it doesn't work out


----
**Are you extremely passionate about the feel you studied?**  
Was at first but with the passing months and the lack of responses from possible employers just got me down. I was in the top 5 best students during my class


----
**I work for a very successful land surveying company in a big city, and it's definitely not easy for someone with 20 years of experience and connections to get a job, let alone someone right out of school. Try to get  some kind of internship 'cause you're not gunna make $30 an hour right out of school like you could 10 years ago. Lemme know if you have any questions about the field.**  
My only question can you get me a job?
Yeah I'm not expecting doing 30$h I'm asking for like 14-15$h. I just want to find a good place that I can get experience and stability for at least the 3 next years.

I just want some place that give me a chance.

The only place I that hired me for land surveying was an office that as a very bad reputation and tbh I didn't like that company because the way they worked didn't make me comfortable with my personal ethics. Example lying to clients, cutting corners everywhere and they made me work with an intern so basically we were 2 guys on the job with no experience at all trying to do the job and when I asked questions to the boss or supervisor their answer were : I don't work on the field I don't know how to set the station settings... Or even once I had a problem I had to move a point's location by 30cm and I was having problem with the cogo menu I call my boss and tell him the problem his answer: Well cogo! They couldn't even be bothered at the office to make it on autocad and give me the coordinates nope just cogo


----
**What Operating System(s) do you run in your computer(s)?**  
at home windows 7 at work was windows XP or 7 but the last job 7 was giving us problem because of the program we used wasn't made for win 7 so we had a lot of crashes.  


----
**If you're willing to move to Alberta, there are a shitton of surveying jobs out here. Fun fact: More people have been hired in the land development field (Surveying falls under this category) than the entirety of the United States in the last year.**  
Yeah I've been thinking about it a lot! Got any leads?
I don't mind moving anywhere my only condition is that I can take my dog with me. 


----
**Former drug dealers are not the only people struggling to find and keep work, you're not the only one. Changing for the better was not about making money, it's about doing the right thing. Hang in there, you've made it this far, don't screw it up!**  
Yeah the right thing I keep telling myself this but the ""evil side"" in me that is tempted by having money is getting stronger every damn day


----
**Did you enjoy the work you were doing as a drug dealer, or did you feel ashamed of what you were doing, but put it to the back of your mind because of the load of cash you were making?**  

**Also, do you plan on finding a girlfriend/wife and starting a family?  Would you continue selling drugs if you had a family?**  

**How many scary situations have you actually been in while in the drug trade? and how long have you been doing it?**  
Never found much joy in doing that. To be honest saying the ""scum"" of society every damn day and the misery that drugs bring about didn't make me happy but I'm mostly missing the money

Girlfriend\wife\kids yeah definetly I wouldn't go back.

Only 1 dangerous occasion someone tried to ""kill me"" in the dumbest way possible. So the guy got my number dunno how wasn't to sure if I knew him or not but decided to go anyway. So I get there the guy comes next to my car I have the window rolled down and he grabs me by the throat and says i'm going to kill you. So I basically just laugh in his face kicked open the door he fell to the ground I took my baseball bat and was like : Come at me bro I'm pissed now I wanna see some brain matter explode.
Thats when I realised I was next to a main boulevard 3 blocks away from a police station at 7h pm pockets full of money and dope. So I got the hell out there before I could see some brain matter explode


----
**dont play the game. sell drugs and make money, to be fair, society doesn't give a shit about felons etc. everybody is just a number and if you've made a mistake in your life it's over. it's just a huge game that you'll never win. or get lucky with a good job you like but unfortunately that probably wont happen.**  
Wow thats how I'm seeing things right now you just put better words into expressing it!


----
**Simple, start selling drugs again, I mean wtf. Its a no brainer.**  


**I thoroughly enjoyed drugs, ecstacy, meth, cocaine, acid, shrooms, speed and my personal favourite was cat, loved that shit.**  

**Clean now for years, but would love to do it again. I did excessive amounts, and then just stopped, was weird.**  
Yeah its a no brainer but I still wish I could have a real job with stability "
nkfyd,9,2011-12-20,"Ladies and Gentlemen, it is possible",ShrinkingUrHead,SingleParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingleParents/comments/nkfyd/ladies_and_gentlemen_it_is_possible/,"I just recently stumbled upon this subreddit and figured I'd share my story with you guys. And for those of you who ask if it gets better, I can tell you it does. 
My story starts in 2008. I was married, on active duty in the U.S. Navy and just had my son. As soon as he was born he was rushed to the NICU because he had severe seizures. I was told he would be a mentally challenged child. We brought him home a week later. I played constant music in the house, read to him, sang to him, basically I did anything I could to stimulate brain growth. 
He was doing well for a while, growing and developing like a ""normal"" child. The doctor had me weening him off the Phenobarbital.  Then one day he wouldn't stop screaming, he was pale, and lethargic.  My husband said he would stay home since he had gotten out of the Navy and could take the day off from work. I had a mandatory training class to get to. I got half way to work when he called and said our son went completely limp and pale before he screamed again. I couldn't take it anymore. I risked my Naval career, turned around and got my child. I took him to the Naval Hospital where he had a seizure infront of his pediatrician. They admitted him right away and then my entire world fell apart. They ran a bunch of tests and refused to tell me why.
The next morning a Naval Chief, hospital social worker, two police officers, armed security, Child Protective Services, his pediatrician, and pediatric neurologist came into the room. They told me someone had shaken my son and they were taking him away from us until the investigation was complete. 
The events after this were a whirlwind and a blur. What I clearly remember is my mother flying from Florida to where I was stationed to take custody of my son so he wouldn't get lost in the system. Our CPS social worker even allowed us all to be in the same house as long as no one but my mother was alone with my son. 
One of the few days I remember clearly was the day I realized my husband, the father of my child, shook the baby. We were in a private room in the CPS office with our social worker and her supervisor for 45 minutes and his story of what had happened changed FIVE TIMES!! As miserable as that was for me, it was also the happiest day of my life. I was given custody back of my son. 
Two weeks later, the day before he was going to be arrested he left. I haven't heard from his since. He's been on the run for three years. His family is helping him fly under the radar. At first I was pissed at this, but then I realized Karama's a bitch.
I stayed where I was stationed until the end of my enlistment and moved into my parents house. I'm not thrilled to be living with them, but it's what was best for my son.  
They supported us for nine months. My parents allowed me to stay home and spend much needed bonding time with my son. After those nine months I went back to school, full time. I met new people, started going out again, and enjoying life. 
Here we are, three years later, both happy and healthy. My son is ""normal"" (for lack of a better term). He's very intelligent, handsome, and a very curiously child. I have two semesters left of school before I do my internship in Addictions Counseling. 
Just over a year ago, I met a wonderful man. He loves me and my son. We do not live together (my son and I are still living with my parents), but when the two of them together I can see a wonderful bond forming. It warms my heart to think that my son will not have to go through life without a Dad.
So, for those of you who aren't sure if you can continue this forever uphill battle I say just stay strong and try to surround yourself with a good support network. I would not have been able to handle everything if it weren't for the most epic support network every.
It's okay to cry, just remember to hug your babies a little tighter. It's all for them, and one day they'll realize why you've done all you have. 
I hope my story has helped at least one person realize it's possible to be happy. Have faith, my loves."
nk6gn,0,2011-12-20,My student adviser is hot,[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/nk6gn/my_student_adviser_is_hot/,"Okay so at my school we have faculty advisers that are assigned to students according to their last names. The faculty advisers help students with scheduling conflicts, general questions, help with internships/employment, etc. My adviser is named Jess Depew and as you can see she's pretty hot. The picture doesn't really do her justice but they're all I've got at the moment. She's like 25 and she's only been at the school a few years. Anyway, I have been looking into getting an internship at a TV station or something over the summer, and the school helps coordinate these things with an internship database that's maintained by the advisers. You log on with your school ID and password and you can browse internships and stuff. I was having trouble logging on to mine so I went to go see Ms. Depew. That's where all the trouble started.

Firstly, I walked into office like 15 minutes early like an idiot and she's in the middle of lunch. So I awkwardly make stupid stall talk until she's finished.

""Oh, hey, what are you eating?""
""Salmon. I love it. I eat it practically everyday.""
""Just salmon? That's pretty weird."" Why the hell did I say this?
""Oh, well, I don't know. I try to eat healthy, natural foods...you know, like wild berries and honey and stuff.""
""Yeah, I like food too."" *facepalm*

Man, I was so nervous. Anyway, we finally begin squaring my stuff away. She looks up what I registered with in the beginning of the year. This is when the crap really hit the fan. This is how the conversation went:

""Okay, you're account name is [my name] and your password is ...'depewissexy'...""

Oh damn. I completely forgot that I put that as my password in the beginning of the year. What the hell was I thinking? It was probably the longest 20 seconds of my life before I finally got my balls together to stand up and leave. Just as I walk out the door she says,

""In the future, you might want to bear in mind what kind of things you want keep to yourself.""

I was so freaking embarrassed I wanted to kill myself right then and there. I wanted to run the hell out of there and never, ever see her again. But something about what she just said kept me standing in her doorway. I decided to man up and apologize. I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes, and swallowed my pride. And then, it hit me like a train full of bricks.

She was eating Salmon.

She tries to eat all healthy, natural foods, like wild berries and honey.

She told me that I might want to bear in mind what kind of things I want to keep to myself.

Ms. Depew was a bear disguised as a human.

Immediately, the bear saw that I had seen through its charade. It roared loudly and took a menacing swipe at me. I deftly avoided its claw and sprinted out of the office. The bear was soon in chase, crashing through the walls of the office as if they were made of paper. I jumped over the receptionist desk and ran out the back entrance. The bear followed, tossing the secretary aside like a rag doll. The bear began to pursue me through the street traffic. While I fought my way through the maze of vehicles, the bear simply careened its massive force through anything standing in its way. Cars veered off the road to escape the onslaught of grizzly force that was barreling down the road. The bear was gaining fast. I had no other option but to make my way into the nearest building: a preschool. I burst through the door, startling the children from their naps. Immediately, the bear slammed through the wall, crushing a child beneath his massive paws and burying several other children in sheet rock and debris. I maneuvered my way through the chaos towards the back exit. The pre-schoolers were little more than a screaming annoyance for the bear. Its massive paws cut swaths through the sea of toddlers with each swipe. I used the precious time these children had afforded for me to make my escape into the playground. I scrambled up a ladder to a fort-like structure. My goal was to walk across the monkey bars then jump to a tree which I could climb to the roof of the preschool and perhaps flag down a passing helicopter.

I began my trek across the monkey bars just as the bear charged outside, its teeth and claws still fresh with the blood of the innocent. It let out a monstrous roar and began its assault on the cheap, wooden
playset. I let go of all caution and ran to end the end of the monkey bars. I leaped for the tree branch just as the bear's enormous girth came plowing through the entire structure. I grasped the branch tightly as the bear collided with the tree, sending it into a daze. I saw this as my one opportunity not for escape, but for victory. I leapt off the tree onto the ground and grabbed a stray bar that had been shorn from the playset. The bear was slowly coming to so I had to act fast. I ran to the beast and thrust the jagged end of the pole into its jaw and through it's skull.

The bear had been defeated. I shambled home in pain but victorious.There will be more threads and more bears in the months to come.

But today, I returned home a champion."

My current roomie is about the move out (his internship is over and he's going home). I thought I'd ask around to try and get a new one, as Reddit has proven itself in this department before.

About the place:
2br, 1 bath. With utilities, it runs about $400/mo per person. Located near Macarthur and South Grand.
 
About me:
I’m fairly quiet but amicable. Early 20's, female. Has boyfriend who will be around twice a month or so.
I work during the day and some weekends.
I am clean but absent-mindedly messy. I don’t mind being told to pick shit up.
 
Conditions I’d like you to fill:
18-27ish? It’d be nice to have someone around my age (recent college grad).
Some sort of income would be good (parents, part-time job, whatever).
Pets are ... negotiable. 

PM me or ask here with questions."

I'm a Computer Science student, and I'm in a bit of a pickle. I currently have an offer for a summer internship with Microsoft and Zynga, and I don't know which one to choose. Something to keep in mind is that I'm interested in getting into the video game industry. I'd appreciate any advice! By the way, this will be my last internship before I graduate, and in the past, I've interned at Apple and Microsoft. Which will help me more in the future: Microsoft (non-gaming internship) or Zynga (game development internship)? Thanks!


**Microsoft:**

**+**Slightly better compensation (+700/month)

**+**Fairly interesting project (MIGHT get to work on technology that game developers will use for mobile)

**+**It's Microsoft (GOOD, STABLE, and BIG company)

**-**Away from home (I'll be lonely because all of my friends that will start working at Microsoft will start as full time employees towards the last 2-3 weeks of my internship)

**-**I've interned at Microsoft before (different team), so it won't be a new experience (I'm interested in startups)


**Zynga:**

**+**I get to work on games (however, I'm not a fan of their games)

**+**Get experience in the game industry

**+**The internship will be in my hometown (I'll be close to my friends and family)

**+**Still a fairly small, startup-like company, so I'll get a new experience

**+**Free lunch and dinner

**-**Slightly smaller compensation (-700/month)

**-**It's ZYNGA (I'm not a fan of the company, they just went public, and I've haven't heard or read good things from the employees)"

Newer fans are probably curious about the shows SNSD have been on (which would explain inside jokes that long time fans would know lol), as well as SNSD's past songs / albums. To help the newer fans, I've compiled a list of required SoShi viewing. Hopefully this helps newer fans who are interested in learning more about SNSD, who necessarily don't know how to go about finding what they want.

****

**Required Viewing:**

* *Girls Go to School* (2007): A 9 episode documentary of SNSD, covering their time right before and during their debut. It shows the girls moving in together for the first time, as well showing their first live performance on Mnet's **School of Rock**. See how it all started and see how far these girls have come. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4B4FCF006758F167&amp;feature=plcp).

* *MTV's Girls' Generation* (2007): Another documentary filmed around the same time as GGTS, this one is also 9 episodes long, with each episode focusing on one member at a time (starting with Sooyoung and ending with Taeyeon). Get to know the quirks, personalities and aspirations of each member. [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2BB92300435644E6&amp;feature=plcp).

****

**Variety Show Appearances:**

* *Factory Girl* (2008): A show focusing on SNSD as fashion interns for **Elle Girl, Korea**. They are divided into two groups, and the two groups are then put into fashion competitions (the teams are; **Candy Girls**, Taeyeon, Jessica, Sunny, Yuri and Yoona - **Dream Girls**, Tiffany, Hyoyeon, Seohyun and Sooyoung). [WATCH HERE](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4DF8F05542C11575&amp;feature=plcp).

* *Horror Movie Factory* (2009): A variety show that focuses on having the girls go through 'scary' moments in order to help them with their acting in various situations. It's a short show, only having 6 episodes and the premise of the show changes about 3 episodes in. It goes from the girls experiencing scary moments while acting out scenarios and ends up as an extended acting lesson for the girls. It's filled with hilarious moments from the girls. [WATCH HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/mbc-snsd-horror-movie-factory-eng-sub/).

* *SNSD's Hello Baby!* (2009): A show about SNSD taking on the role of moms as they babysit a baby for months (not entirely sure how long, maybe half a year?). An awesome show filled with laughs and awkward moments (watching 9 girls attempt to change a baby **boy's** diaper is hilarious). It was supposed to be a show about teaching the girls the roles of motherhood, but it ended up being a show with SNSD playing with a baby and with each other. [WATCH HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/kbs-joy-snsd-hello-baby-season-1-eng-sub/).

* *Invincible Youth (Season 1 and 2)* (2009 - Present): A variety show which puts idol girls in the middle of rural South Korea and are taught how to live the life of a farmer. They learn how to farm certain vegetables, they learn how to take care of farm animals, they learn how to drive farming machines, and they learn how to cook. Watch as the girls go from 'City Idols' to 'Farming Idols' and their growth as friends. Season 1 had our very own **Sunny** and **Yuri**, and also starred fellow idol girls; **Narsha** from the Brown Eyed Girls, **Hara** from Kara, **Hyuna** from 4minute, **Hyomin** from T-ARA and **Sunhwa** from Secret. Later on in the show it also had; **Victoria** from f(x), **Juyeon** from After School and solo singer **Sori**. Watch Season 1 [HERE](http://entertainments10.blogspot.com/2010/11/invincible-youth.html) (Thanks to [kimbrough](http://www.reddit.com/user/kimbrough) for the link). Season 2 of Invincible Youth is currently airing, new location (a fishing village) and new members. The new members are ; **Sunny** and **Hyoyeon**, **Woori** from Rainbow, **Bora** from Sistar, **Jiyoung** from Kara, **Amber** from f(x), **Suzy** from Miss A and **Yewon** from Jewelry. Watch Season 2 [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-56NNoV9zfc&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL7B1F36AA29B09E5F).

* *We Got Married (Season 1 and 2)* (2009 - 2011): A variety show which puts random celebrities into fake marriages (yes you read that right lol). They do what any married couple does, they move into a house, they cook together, they go on dates, and they actually take wedding pictures together. **Season 1** had our very own 'Kid Leader' Taeyeon, who was paired up with popular comedian Jung Hyungdon. They were nicknamed the '**Pudding and Jelly**' couple. Watch the couple [HERE](http://ithetimes.wordpress.com/mbc-wgm-pudding-and-jelly-couple-eng-sub/). **Season 2** had our innocent, sometimes borderline unemotional, maknae Seohyun, who was paired up with the leader and lead vocalist of idol band CN Blue, Jung Yonghwa. They were nicknamed the '**Goguma**' couple (for Seohyun's love for sweet potatoes) and the '**YongSeo**' couple (**Yong**hwa + **Seo**hyun). Season 2 is definitely a must watch for fans, Season 1 was very short and had some funny moments, but it wasn't really engaging (the age difference between Taeyeon and Hyungdon really turned off some people, and the fact that he was in actual relationship at the time didn't help at all). The YongSeo couple moments are fantastic, unless you're a huge Seohyun fanboy who gets jealous easily lol. Watch the YongSeo couple [HERE](http://gogumaepisodes.blogspot.com/p/goguma-episodes.html).

* *Girls' Generation and the Dangerous Boys* (2012): Their newest variety show, it puts the girls as guidance counselors for troubled boys (high school boys). The girls are divided into 5 different groups to guide 5 different boys. The boys themselves will actually be living together as well. Watch the first episode [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/user/taenacity#p/u/4/tq9Vyc5BRoA).

* *Numerous Popular Show Appearances* (2007 - Present): Part of the girls' ridiculous fame is the amount of shows they have appeared on. Newer fans may have watched awesome clips of SNSD on shows but have no idea where they are from, so I compiled a list of shows that they have appeared on. Shows: **Family Outing, Running Man, Strong Heart, Star Golden Bell, Star King, Happy Together, and Star Life Theater.** Find these shows on [Soshified](http://soshified.com/), the biggest SNSD international fan website on the internet.

****

**Drama Appearances:**

* *Unstoppable Marriage* (2007): Featuring cameos from Yuri and Sooyoung. [MORE HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstoppable_Marriage).

* *You Are My Destiny* (2008): Yoona's first major role, it's also the role that helped her break through in terms of acting (she won an award for best new actress for her role as Jang Saebyuk). It's a daily drama which is a whopping 178 episodes long. If you're a fan of Yoona, it's a must watch. [MORE HERE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Are_My_Destiny_\(TV_series\)).

* *Cinderella Man* (2009): Yoona's second major role, a mini-series which is only 16 episodes long (each episode is about an hour). It didn't do very well ratings wise, but I enjoyed it more than YAMD. [WATCH HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/40/1/Cinderella_Man/).

* *Fashion King* (Currently Airing): Yuri's first major role in a drama, she plays a fashion designer named 'Choi Anna'. Watch Fashion King [HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4100/1/Fashion_King/).

* *Love Rain* (Currently Airing): Yoona's third major role (her first in almost 3 years), it's a double role, as she plays two characters in the series (her co-star Jang Geun Suk also plays two roles). Watch Love Rain [HERE](http://www.dramafever.com/drama/4099/1/Love_Rain/).

**LAST UPDATED**: April 2012"
nlezb,9,2011-12-21,Professional Ents - Please give me some advice!,EntProThrow,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/nlezb/professional_ents_please_give_me_some_advice/,"Sorry to use a throw away account but I'm at a loss.

I came to discover my love for trees in college, and we soon became inseparable. Unfortunately my choice of major, and internships, was in engineering (in manufacturing in particular).  Most engineering jobs require drug testing, particularly in a heavy manufacturing environment. 

So as you can see there is an impasse between the two things I love. I was willing to not smoke for the 4-5 months out of the year I needed to be ""clean"", for the four years I was interning at school.

Around the time of graduation I contracted Chron's Disease. This permanently eliminated my other chosen vices of smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol (they cause me extreme pain, bodily damage). Smoking trees became much more important to me.

So after graduation I decided to expand my horizons a little bit beyond manufacturing. I followed up with a Masters in Business Administration. I finished up my coursework with a very high GPA, and will be graduating in January. I hoped having an advanced degree as well as an engineering degree from a prestigious university would give me the leverage necessary to bypass the drug test issue.

The problem is that i still want to have a lucrative and successful career. In the business field this mostly exists in management, accounting, and finance. Being that I don't have an accounting or finance background, I have a big disadvantage to apply to these jobs. Also, if I work in accounting or finance, my engineering pedigree will basically be worthless.

I really have trouble coming to terms with the fact that despite all of this ability I have gained over the years, the fact that I like to smoke trees trumps any future employer's into thinking I'm some stereotypical worthless stoner. 

In the past when I had other fun options, like drinking, it wasn't as hard to stop smoking. Now it's the only choice I have left in terms of vice. I think that I deserve to have at least one vice. My partner of 5 years who I will likely marry also likes to smoke trees. Her career choice makes it easy for her though (shes an art historian).  Obviously I would like to smoke trees with my future wife into our old age.

I really want to find a career where my two lifestyles are compatible. I want to find an employer who will appreciate me for my ability and contribution and not discount me because of my like for trees. However, I feel if I even mention the question of drug testing to an employer, regardless of whether they require it or not, my resume will be thrown out. I am not willing to wear a whizzinator and lie to my employer/attempt to beat their test. It isn't a choice that is sustainable for a career. 

I want to know if there are any professional ents out their who have some advice on how to proceed with my life. How did you find a career as opposed to looking for ""jobs""? 
Are there any ENTrepreneurs out their who have the same ideologies I do? If so, would you be willing to give this man a chance, or point me in the direction of someone who will?

nl13r,4,2011-12-21,Moving to hyderabad. Need some advice (tl;dr included),rohanprabhu,hyderabad,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/nl13r/moving_to_hyderabad_need_some_advice_tldr_included/,"Hi all.. I am moving to Hyderabad from Bangalore this January and was hoping to get some advice from my dear Hyderabadi redditors. I was in hyderabad last summer for 2 months as part of my internship stint. There was a place in Kothaguda (Shilpa Park, to be specific) where for a monthly rent of Rs. 10,500, the following facilities were available:

* A single room with cupboards and necessary furnishing.
* A/C
* Attached bathroom
* Television (an actually kick-ass one)
* Cable television (might also be DTH, don't quite remember)
* WiFi enabled internet connection
* Lunch and Dinner (veg and non-veg)
* Daily cleaning of the house
* Shared refrigerator, kitchen and dining area

So, my question is, could I avail the same facilities in Madhapur for a similar rent? I am being posted as intern in HiTec city, so I believe Madhapur would be the best area for me.

Also, at hyderabad, the guesthouse where I was given accommodation for 15 days, had a Beam telecom internet connection and I got some crazy speeds there. The plans say 1000 bucks a month for a 10mbps line (2 mbps post 40gb). Despite the cap of 40GB, this is an awesome package compared to other broadband services. So, can anyone tell me how good their service is in the long run?

**EDIT**: Got a deal for Rs. 10000 in Madhapur. All facilities, but the best part is that this place is much bigger than the one I had gotten earlier and the flat is totally new.. I would be the first person occupying that place.. so its totally spic :) Thank you all for your help.

**tl;dr**: Saw a room for 10.5K a month with A/C, internet, lunch+dinner and shared fridge and kitchen at Kothaguda. Can I get the same at Madhapur?

**tl;dr2**: How is the service on Beam telecom in the long run?"

nplce,12,2011-12-24,"Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas is for my heart to be put back in my chest",sadthrowaway23,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/nplce/dear_santa_all_i_want_for_christmas_is_for_my/,"Santa should be coming tonight, right? Well I finally have something to put on my list since my *wonderful* ex spent the week building me up just so he could destroy me on Christmas Eve. 

Now I am gonna rant but if you do read it, hell even if you don't, I could really use some uplifting words and some holiday cheer. Here it goes.

He and I are both 20. Almost a year under our belt. Met in college. First real relationship for me and I was crazy about him from the start. However the bickering got to be too much for us, and I tried breaking up with him a couple days after Thanksgiving. However both of us lacked the self control required to stay away from each other. 

I had always asked for him to take me on a date, and we laughed at the irony when took me to dinner and a movie a week later after we broke up. We were talking for a while, and most importantly happy. No bickering. I could feel myself latching onto him again though, and with failed attempts at distancing myself from him (it's hard to distance yourself from someone who lives in the same dorm as you), I gave up and gave him everything I had again. 

We started sleeping together again and it was better than ever. I felt excited like I did when I first met him. I would look over at him and see him smiling at me from across the room. Things went on like this until break. I prepared myself and told him we could have our space over winter. 

And then there is this week. I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about everything. 

On Monday, his psychedelic mushroom trip brought upon fleeting feelings for me. 

Tuesday he confessed how much he was thinking about me and how special I was to him. I tried not to let it get to my head.

On Wednesday, he got drunk at a party and called me to tell me that after much thought, he had come to terms with the fact that he loved me. I told him I wouldn't believe him until he could tell me in a sober state. And he did. 

The next morning he called me, apologized for the drunk call and confirmed that he meant it. He then proceeded to invite me to a holiday potluck with his friends and then to a party afterwards. Against everything in my head that told me not to go, I couldn't help myself and drove 45 minutes through the pouring rain to meet with him. He was drunk by the time I got there and ran through the streets saying how much he loved me. He eventually got mad that I wasn't returning the affection to extent he was and I told him I was confused. The night was amazing. We drank, we gleefully ran around 7 Eleven grabbing all the junk food we desired, we went back to his place where we proceeded to smoke and pig out and have sex. This whole time he was assuring me he wanted to be with me, how much he loved me, how beautiful a person I was. I kept laughing it off and begging him ""please don't say these things if you really don't mean them."" 

I guess you could say things turned sour. It sounds funnier than it was but mid-sex he accidentally thrust into my clenched, unseasoned asshole. I screamed in pain and started crying. He apologized profusely, and I told him it was okay as I brushed his hair aside. I let him finish in my but from here he felt too bad. And he said that I was the one making him feel bad. He wouldn't touch me the entire night, and the next morning you could say we both woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I left for an appointment I had. I texted him and said I was sorry for being grumpy and that I had fun the night before and I hoped he had a good day. No response. I brushed it off. I waited. I went over everything in my head. I couldn't stop thinking about everything he said. I was fully ready to start things again, us both as better people. 

Last night I called him while he was with his friends. I told him I didn't want to bother him, but that I had wanted to talk to him. He was short so I asked what was wrong. He said he was upset because he didn't feel accomplished compared to his friends. I immediately responded with this, ""Nobodys lives run at the same pace. Some friends may have amazing internships now, but who is to say yours isn't around the corner? Or ten years from now? We have classmates who are already married parents. And we can always find flaws when we compare our lives to others. But you know what? None of your friends have a girl who cares so much about them. I'm here for you whatever you do."" And he admitted to being cheered. 

I proceeded to get wasted at a friends Christmas party and called him multiple times. Eventually I stopped once I felt like a psycho and let him be. 

And here we are today Christmas Eve. I wait all day for him to call me since historically he sleeps late and his phone is always dead. I answer and ask if everything is ok. What we proceeded to discuss was how he never wanted to see or speak to me again. He told me I ruined the idea of relationships for him. That I ruined talking on the phone with people. I asked him what caused this sudden change when he was so sure of loving me. He said he didn't want to be with me. He denied every statement he made to me. Every declaration of love he made, he now claimed I was either crazy or he was blackout drunk when he said it. I freaked. I felt like I was in some freaky nightmare. That my world had been ripped out from underneath me. I was crying and struggling to figure out why he was doing this. He was incapable of saying one kind, soothing word to me. 

And now I am alone on Christmas Eve. The holiday makeup I applied for tonights Christmas plans is now smeared across my cheeks. I am sitting here in my underwear with my outfit I had planned on the chair across the room. I am struggling to figure out where to go from here and what to feel. I feel like it is all my fault for falling for it all. This deception has left me completely broken. I can't imagine ever trusting anyone with my feelings ever again. And I don't ever want to see another Christmas.

**tldr; the ex convinced me he still loved and then denied saying or meaning any of it in a christmas eve phone call.**"
nparh,19,2011-12-24,How I want Season 7 to play out...,DexterrrMorgan,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/nparh/how_i_want_season_7_to_play_out/,"I kind of made this comment in another thread, but I wanted to expand on it.

So we all know the end of Season 6, and for many the question is: Will Deb realize that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher? 

Personally, I do not want Deb to know right away, and I'll explain why in a minute. The obvious hurdle to her not knowing: is her overlooking the fact that Dexter is using the same MO as the BHB in the church. So let me go into how they could get around this.

**The Lie**

Dexter has finally been caught with his pants down. So what does he do? Well, he lies of course. Dexter tells Deb that after Rita was killed, he swore to himself that he would never let another serial killer harm another family again, if he has the opportunity to prevent it. He can even say he was fueled further by this when the man that killed Rita, went back and killed Jonah's Mom and Sister as well and is still out there (feed one lie into another lie). But we still have the problem with the BHB MO he's using. Simple. Dexter could tell Deb that as a blood analyst, he knew that Doakes's method was the most efficient and safe way of not spreading the evidence. Having worked his case directly, he took inspiration from that. Hell, he could even tell Deb that he's way in over his head and that this being his first kill, he didn't even want to do it. And that he wasn't even going to kill Travis, but was personally investigating him on the side, and then Travis took his son. So he decided he had to do it, for the safety of his family. Either way, there is a way for Dexter to throw Deb off for the moment, and it's with a good ol' fashion lie.

**Why I don't want Deb to know right away...**

In my opinion, Deb walking in on Dexter at the end of Season 6 did not really feel earned. Unlike Season 5 (where she used her intuition and detective skills to corner Dexter and Lumen) - Season 6 felt like she just stumbled in on it. It lacked tension and suspense for me (personally). But by her not knowing Dexter is the BHB right away, it does two major things.

* I. It builds up suspense throughout the Season, as Deb starts to doubt what Dexter is saying.  This in turn forces Deb to investigate into her brother, and start questioning his actions.

* II. They could use this plot to tie up all the loose ends of past plots that the Miami Metro (and FBI) foolishly overlooked. Remember how Dexter got arrested at the same bank as Trinity at the exact same time he was there? Remember how Deb saw Dexter at the Trinity house before anyone else, without a vest on, and in a location he shouldn't have even been? Remember how Rita was Trinity's last victim, and they never thought it was odd that Dexter was at the same bank as Trinity, and then his wife was the last victim? Not to mention the mysterious Kyle Butler that was some outside guy, that was intervening in their family matters. These are just a couple examples. But point being, Deb could start looking into some of things that might have bothered her in the past, and could start to realize one by one that Dexter IS in fact the BHB. That he's lying etc.

Not only does this vindicate past plot points, but it cleverly wraps up the entire story, and makes all of Dexter's past sloppy actions have actual consequence. It all comes back to bite him. This intensity would also be heightened if they choose to use Louis in Season 7 as the new killer. But he's not just a killer. He's a copy cat killer. He's trying to impress Dexter, and is actually learning from him. He's using his job at the Miami Metro (well, we'll see. They hinted that his internship was almost up. But if they do bring him back for a full time job, or even part time job) - he could use his job to foil his investigations, similar to what Dexter has been doing all along. So while Deb is dealing with her doubt with Dexter, Louis's killings will have a similar MO, making her think it's Dexter. 

The other aspect I like about this, is that Louis actually means well (in regards to Dexter). And it would be Dexter in a weird position, because Louis never knew the code. And would end up on his table by the end of the season for killing innocent people. He didn't know Dexter abides by this code, and will feel betrayed that his idol is not pleased with all that he has done.

So that's my take on Season 7. That's how I personally want it to play out. Would love to hear what you guys think. "
np54o,5,2011-12-24,Fantastic girl shows the signals but then confuses the hell outta me.  Did I mess up or was there nothing ever there?,roy_boy,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/np54o/fantastic_girl_shows_the_signals_but_then/,"Hey reddit, I’m in a situation I have never faced before and I was looking for some input.  It’s a lengthy piece but it gives more than enough food for thought.  I put some bolded **TL;DR** if you want to skim but the devil is in the details here.  Any answer is appreciated!

I'm 20 years old and over the past six months I have become very close friends with a girl named Lorie, who has recently turned 19. A little background on Laurie first:  she is a sci-fi fanatic with vast knowledge of Dr. Who, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica, Merlin, Firefly, Stargate and so many more it’s unbelievable.  She loves to read any and everything from pure science fiction to Palahniuk to the classics including her favorite The Count of Monty Cristo.  She also plays video games, and by play I mean she actually plays them for enjoyment.   Overall everyone sums her up as a guy in a girl’s body.

Our relationship started when I met her through a group of friends who all worked at the same theme park together.  When we first met I was dressed in a ridiculous pair of jean shorts and was very shy towards her.  Over the first few weeks after meeting her she began texting me through various friends’ phones at work teasing me on and asking for entertainment.  We would talk about science fiction, joke about the ridiculousness of my outfit when I met her, as well as playfully banter with each other.  I could always make her laugh too; she seemed to love it because she kept coming back for more saying she “loves the way you (I) text.”  She then got my number off of one of my friend’s phones and started texting me directly.

She lives about a half hour away and would always go to our friend Tyler’s house after work.  She has a bad home life so she would stay there for days on end sometimes, sleeping in the upstairs bunk bed.  I would be invited to come over and hang out, but it would always at least be her, Tyler, and me.  According to people from their work she and Tyler had gone on what Tyler had thought was a date but Lorie only considered it a trip to the movies with a friend.  Despite this, every time we would hang out at Tyler’s house, she would be touchy-feely with Tyler including hugging him, tickling him, and lying on top of him at times as well as saying the occasional “Tyler is my best friend” phrase.  Everyone from their work said they were the best of friends and only friends but it did not seem that way.

**TL;DR Girl named Laurie shows interest by getting my contact information on her own.  We text a lot and hang out at our friend Tyler’ house.  Tyler is her friend, but she has a lot of physical contact with him.**

The most upsetting time I hung out with Lorie over the summer was at one of her co-workers parties.  I arrived late and was greeted by a drunken Laurie.  We played some pong together and then she left when her one friend said “he’s halfway there, go for it.”  She came to me eventually and looking for Tyler, claiming he is who she goes to when she is not having a good time at a party, and eventually went with him upstairs to the bathroom.  I found her then alone and crying in the bathroom.  I put her on a couch and went to sleep myself.  I found out the following day that she was hoping to have sex with one of her other co-workers but got rejected.  She later told me that she becomes an emotional mess when in a drunken stupor and had apologized to her attempted one night stand, clarifying that they were now solely just friends.

The pinnacle of our hangouts over the summer came when we went on a trip to New York.  It was a trip planned by Tyler and Laurie as an end of summer event.  Laurie invited me saying that Tyler was bringing his two Chinese friends.  She continued to say that Tyler always entered an “Asian Mode” where he never listened to anyone but his international love interests so she needed someone to talk to.  She would always text me days before the trip asking if I was excited and that the trip was a big deal.  Prior to leaving, Laurie was introduced to Tyler’s best friend from up the street who was also my mutual friend since junior high school, Stefan, very important later.

So it was set that Tyler, Laurie, the two international girls from Tyler and Laurie’s job , and me went to the big apple for the day.  It was a fantastic time to say the least.  Laurie and I got a lot of one on one time going through the Museum of Natural History, the MoMa, and central park.  We joked of Tyler’s “Asian mode” and then shared a bed in the hotel but nothing happened since Tyler and company were in the same room.

**TL;DR Laurie tries to have sex with a co-worker and says alcohol make her an emotional wreck.  Laurie is introduced to our friend Stefan.  Laurie, Tyler, and I go to NYC but nothing happens between her and I.**

So summer ended and Tyler, Laurie, Stefan, and I all went back to school.  Stefan goes to school in California, Tyler in New York, and Laurie and I both in Ohio.  Laurie actually attends a branch campus of my college, the very branch campus I had spent two years previous at.

I thought that our texting would die down after school started, but it did not.  Laurie would always make attempts to ask me how the main campus was, how things were going in general for me, and where certain buildings were at her new branch campus, a lot of small talk.  Eventually, Laurie would send me messages saying she needed “help” with her calculus homework and that I should call her to help.  We fell into a groove where she would initiate these calls that ended up just being us talking about her our friends, her family life, school, good novels to read, and her dislike of guys who tried to hit on her at school, almost anything.  She began working at an internship two hours away as well where on her drive there she would call me to keep her company. 
 
She also revealed that unlike Tyler she and Stefan had been keeping in touch too.  She said she would Skype him at work for someone to talk to since his time difference had him up when she was at work.  She said he was not really a texter and did not like to initiate conversations but she could still get a hold of him on the phone if I was not available.  She said she had been forwarding the best drunken messages of mine to him and that they both wanted to see me drunk.

**TL;DR Laurie and I keep in touch after school starts up.  Contact goes from small talk via text to full phone conversations.  Laurie keeps in touch with Stefan but not so much Tyler and sends Stefan my drunken texts.**

When I would go home every so often, we would go hang out together.  One weekend she said I should come back to go out to eat with her, Tyler, and the group of friends she worked with over the summer.  I would not have been able to get back in time for the meal, but she suggested I come back anyways to hangout the next day.  We went alone together (Strokes fans rejoice) to see the Lion King in 3D and I tried to make a move by putting my arm around her but she did not have it.  I averted and made a joke of it to which she seemed genuinely amused.  She gave me the title of innocent kitten, which I thought was a way of saying I had no chance.  After this there were a few times where I came home and we hung out, but it always was with a group of people.  During one of these sessions she made a point to say that Tyler had thought they were on a date when they went to the movie during the summer, but that attempt by him had earned him a permanent spot in the friend zone.  This made me lose faith in a relationship even more.

**TL;DR Attempted to make a move on Laurie while at the movies together and pushed away, find out she says Tyler was friend zoned in a similar situation.**

I tried to get her to come up to my campus for Halloween weekend, but she said she could not get off work and on several occasions said how disappointed she was.  She came up the following week with my band mate, who was also a co-worker of hers.  We all got drunk both nights, but she got especially plastered the second night.  It resulted with regurgitation in my bed, disgusting but I managed to clean her up and made sure she wasn’t swallowing her own vomit.  In the process I had to maneuver her phone about and saw that she and I had the most amounts of texts, 900 some more than the closest person.

In the following week she said she was sorry that she vomited in my bed and I responded with the fact that “sheets were replaceable, which they were with silk ones, but you are not.”  She absolutely died and said she would save the message forever since it was so adorable.  One night while talking on the phone she was petting her cat and went on to say how cute and innocent it was.  She concluded saying that being an innocent kitten didn’t necessarily mean anything bad at all.

Mid November we got into a discussion where she said we should get married so she can stay in my bed.  I made nothing of it but later she asked if she was poor, would I marry her.  I said yes, of course, assuming she was joking and that that was that.  She continued to bring the discussion up weeks later though, saying how we would get married but our last names did not flow well so she would keep her own.  I went with it and had fun crafting our future together.

**TL;DR Sweet talk Laurie and she says its adorable and that her provided nicknames are not meant to be degrading.  She talks of a future where we get married.**

Around her birthday, in late November, I decided to send her personal hand-written card saying how happy I was that we kept in touch.  I went on to say that our talks always made my day, that she meant a lot to me, and that I thought she was beautiful. She texted me saying I was the ""best that ever lived"" and over Xbox Live the following day told me that it was a pleasant surprise to come home to and that for my birthday she was going to get me a pair of silk suit pajamas, which are extremely pricy for a friendship gift. Since then our texts had died down a bit yet she still called me, but again not as regular.

Recently during this winter break, we crossed the border to Canada to celebrate her birthday.  This was the first time I had physically seen her since the letter. Again, a group of our friends went, including Tyler and Stefan.  We had a great time and over dinner she said she was going to give me the nickname of “blue eyes” as she held my stare for extended periods of time, note though we all had alcoholic teas during this period.  Afterwards we were en route to get liquor for the night, still buzzed, and she said how she wished I would initiate texts with her more often and call her instead of her having to do the work.  She said that when I don’t respond to her calls, she goes to Stefan and attempts to figure out why I don’t call back.  We drank in the hotel that night and the next morning she, Stefan, and me watched a Plinket review in bed.  Tyler tried to lie on top of Laurie but she told him no skin to skin contact and pushed him to the side.  She then said her leg was cold so I warmed it with my arm, which she had no qualms about.  After Canada, she, Tyler, and Stefan were going to go to Tyler’s place in New York for the a few days and she really wanted me of all the others to go, but I had prior obligations.

**TL;DR Sent Laurie a hand written card saying how much she means to me.  She says I’m the best person that ever lived.  On a trip to Canada she sends signals that she is interested.**

If you are still here, this is where it all comes together.  A day after those three returned to the area, we were drinking with our friend group again.  She gave me her phone and I saw that she texted Stefan about the birthday letter I had sent her, demanding that Stefan had to call her. Their following texts said they were composing their own sappiest, cheesiest, and over romantic ""letters"" to each other, it seemed to be a joke.  Somewhere along the line Stefan told her that she was without flaws and she took it to heart. At this party she called Stefan her ""flawless gem"" and was very touchy-freely with him giving him a plethora of hugs and clinging onto him.  Despite this though, she would say in her drunken stupor that she “wants to remain single for the rest of her life.”  

I knew Stefan knew Laurie and I kept in touch so I went to him alone, playing the role of the plastered drunk, to attempt to divulge details she may have said about me.  I asked him if she had told him about the letter, which obviously from the texts from her phone proved he had,  and he said that she had not mentioned anything and that whatever I sent she was probably fine.  How could such a long time friend betray me?!   

We had another party last night for Christmas where I brought gifts for my friends, as I usually do this time of year.  I did not even get real thanks from Laurie for the gift, just a reassurance that I would get my silks.  She continued to talk and cling to Stefan flirting and having side conversations.  The final nail in the coffin came when I found out that Stefan would be taking Laurie to a wedding in August.

**TL;DR Found out Laurie told Stefan about the letter.  They made their own joke letter to each other and Stefan calls her flawless.  She starts calling him her flawless gem and is very flirtatious with him.  Stefan is taking her to a wedding this coming year as his date.**

My ultimatum was to ask Laurie out over this winter break but now I cannot decide what to do.  Everything seemed perfect until this whole flawless gem bull shit.  Is she just trying to be playful around Stefan since he will be gone for a while back in California or is there serious potential there for the foundation of a relationship between them?  Did I ruin my chances with her by sending her the letter or were there never any true feelings on her part, just teasing?  My only choices for a relationship now would be to wait to ask her on a date prior to new years to try and establish a connection, which I personally do not see as an effective way to move forward, or to go to a New Years Eve party I was invited to with her, Tyler, Stefan and crew and hope that alcohol works to my favor.  However I could always wait another semester of college until she comes up to my campus and have other people out of the way.  What should I do?!

**TL;DR Is she really interested in a relationship with Stefan?  Did sending the letter ruin any chance of mine or were there never any true feelings from her?  Should I ask her on a date now that we are on a break from school or wait till she goes to my college campus, which next year she will, to make another kind of move, or am I too late?**

np4m3,1,2011-12-24,Fantastic girl shows me the signals but then confuses the hell outta me.  Do I peruse a relationship or withdraw from the battle?,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/np4m3/fantastic_girl_shows_me_the_signals_but_then/,"Hey reddit, I’m in a situation I have never faced before and I was looking for some input.  It’s a lengthy piece but it gives more than enough food for thought.  Help is appreciated!

I'm 20 years old and over the past six months I have become very close friends with a girl named Lorie, who has recently turned 19. A little background on Laurie first:  she is a sci-fi fanatic with vast knowledge of Dr. Who, Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galatica, Merlin, Firefly, Stargate and so many more it’s unbelievable.  She loves to read any and everything from pure science fiction to Palahniuk to the classics including her favorite The Count of Monty Cristo.  She also plays video games, and by play I mean she actually plays them for enjoyment.   She claims to be bisexual and overall everyone sums her up as a guy in a girl’s body.

Our relationship started when I met her through a group of friends who all worked at the same theme park together.  When we first met I was dressed in a ridiculous pair of jean shorts and was very shy towards her.  Over the first few weeks after meeting her she began texting me through various friends’ phones at work teasing me on and asking for entertainment.  We would talk about science fiction, joke about the ridiculousness of my outfit when I met her, as well as playfully banter with each other.  I could always make her laugh too; she seemed to love it because she kept coming back for more saying she “loves the way you (I) text.”  She then got my number off of one of my friend’s phones and started texting me directly.

She lives about a half hour away and would always go to our friend Tyler’s house after work.  She has a bad home life so she would stay there for days on end sometimes, sleeping in the upstairs bunk bed.  I would be invited to come over and hang out, but it would always at least be her, Tyler, and me.  According to people from their work she and Tyler had gone on what Tyler had thought was a date but Lorie only considered it a trip to the movies with a friend.  Despite this, every time we would hang out at Tyler’s house, she would be touchy-feely with Tyler including hugging him, tickling him, and lying on top of him at times as well as saying the occasional “Tyler is my best friend” phrase.  Everyone from their work said they were the best of friends and only friends but it did not seem that way.

The most upsetting time I hung out with Lorie over the summer was at one of her co-workers parties.  I arrived late and was greeted by a drunken Laurie.  We played some pong together and then she left when her one friend said “he’s halfway there, go for it.”  She came to me eventually and looking for Tyler, claiming he is who she goes to when she is not having a good time at a party, and eventually went with him upstairs to the bathroom.  I found her then alone and crying in the bathroom.  I put her on a couch and went to sleep myself.  I found out the following day that she was hoping to have sex with one of her other co-workers but got rejected.  She later told me that she becomes an emotional mess when in a drunken stupor and had apologized to her attempted one night stand, clarifying that they were now solely just friends.

The pinnacle of our hangouts over the summer came when we went on a trip to New York.  It was a trip planned by Tyler and Laurie as an end of summer event.  Laurie invited me saying that Tyler was bringing his two Chinese friends.  She continued to say that Tyler always entered an “Asian Mode” where he never listened to anyone but his international love interests so she needed someone to talk to.  She would always text me days before the trip asking if I was excited and that the trip was a big deal.  Prior to leaving, Laurie was introduced to Tyler’s best friend from up the street who was also my mutual friend since junior high school, Stefan, very important later.

So it was set that Tyler, Laurie, the two international girls from Tyler and Laurie’s job , and me went to the big apple for the day.  It was a fantastic time to say the least.  Laurie and I got a lot of one on one time going through the Museum of Natural History, the MoMa, and central park.  We joked of Tyler’s “Asian mode” and then shared a bed in the hotel but nothing happened since Tyler and company were in the same room.

So summer ended and Tyler, Laurie, Stefan, and I all went back to school.  Stefan goes to school in California, Tyler in New York, and Laurie and I both in Ohio.  Laurie actually attends a branch campus of my college, the very branch campus I had spent two years previous at.

noxh8,32,2011-12-24,The struggles of forgiving a girlfriend who cheated.,toughtoughlife,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/noxh8/the_struggles_of_forgiving_a_girlfriend_who/,"We're both 22.  In the first 2 weeks of our relationship (before we were ""official"" we were still just hooking up occasionally) I ended up going out to a party and having sex with another girl i had met.  
I felt terrible about it, told the girl the next day, she forgave me about a week later and we have been dating ever since.  As we weren't even dating or remotely serious at this point, it wasn't really brought up again.
During the summer after all this happened, we became extremely close.  I love you's were said very early on, talks of marriage and future were brought up.  At the end of the summer I had to leave for three months to intern in Seattle and she stayed in DC.  We promised we'd stay faithful.  I have been cheated on in past relationships and begged her not to.  She promised she wouldn't.  At this point we had been dating for 10 months.
We talked and videochatted everyday while I was gone, it was difficult, but I was happily staying out of trouble and was completely in love with her.  


One saturday night I stayed in and she, unlike usual, didn't call me when she got out of work that day.  I figured she was tired and went to bed early.  It turns out she had gotten home from work, decided on a whim to go out with some neighbors, drank a shit ton, did coke, blacked out and ended up fucking her next door neighbor.  She apparently stopped him in the middle of it, woke up the next morning, puked on his floor and ran out crying.  She called me first thing balling her eyes out apologizing.  I was absolutely furious.   She ended up buying a 600 dollar plane ticket to Seattle the next weeked (losing her job in the process) so she could apologize to my face.  It worked for the most part.  I gave her an ultimatum, if she could stay sober for the rest of the time that I was gone and turn her life around, I would attempt to forgive her.  I've been given a lot of second chances in my life that I didn't deserve and know what it means to be self-destructive, I figured I'd try it out as I've never been one to forgive anyone.


Flashforward to now, the day before christmas eve.  Things have been going great, she bought me a wonderful watch when I returned to show me how greatful she was that I stood behind her and allowed her to clean up her life.  She is now sober, has a better job, and is working on her future.  She tells me everyday how devoted and thankful she is that I forgave her.


But still, even though I can feel great with her all day, I get so angry sometimes.  I feel furious, I over analyze every single detail of that night, ask her to explain things over and over again.  One doesn't obviously just ""get fucked"" by a dude, you talk to them, you go to their room, you kiss them, you take off your clothes, it's a lot.  And she still lives nextdoor to this guy (they haven't talked since and I told him that if he even so much as looks at her he'll get his head smashed in). 
 

I want to forgive her, I actually completely utterly want to move on, but I can't shake the feelings I get in my chest, it's like my stomach is turning over and I just can't get rid of it no matter what I do.  Most days since i've been back it has been wonderful.  If she goes out alone, at most she'll have one beer and even then she doesn't finish it.  If we go out together we attempt to ""party"" like we used to but neither of us feel really comfortable about it.   Honestly though, we get these wonderful moments where all is forgotten and we're just happy and overjoyed to be with one another.  
 

She's about to spend christmas with me and my family, I have been taking her in and attempting to give her the second chance I feel she rightfully deserves, but still, tonight I feel furious.  Tomorrow I'll feel fine, but I'm tired of getting this rage when I'm alone, or in the shower, or driving to work, it's taking it's toll on me.  And it isn't fair to her as well, if I'm going to say I forgive her I should be able to fucking forgive her.  I get so angry.  I obsess over getting revenge on this dude.  I just want to forgive her so badly, maybe more so to forget it and move on.  I know at this point the responsiblity falls on me to either make or break this relationship.


**tl:dr: girlfriend cheated on me one night, she told me immediately the next morning terribly upset.  Flew accross the country to aplogize, changed her life around, and has completely devoted herself to me.  I ""forgave her"" and love her everyday, but at night when alone, I think terrible angry thoughts and can't forget.** 

Any tips for moving on, forcing myself to get over it.. or is it hopeless?


**well happy christmas eve, blargh.  I'll keep this to myself until a few days after christmas, I almost want to show her this thread just so she can understand the struggles and the differing opinions.  I'm not going to give her the boot, I do really care about her.  I think I'm going to work on my own mental struggles, so I can address the root of the problem, and if the root of the problem is that she cheated or my incapability to forgive it (or forget it), so be it.**

I met him 7 months ago as I was getting ready to graduate college and as my 3 year relationship was falling to pieces. He was just hired where I was finishing up my internship. My original plan was to move with my fiance after graduation but when that was no longer an option I went full time from my internship. Over the past 7 months he has became my best friend. He helped me through my breakup, I helped him fight an illness which kept him away from work and laid up in bed many days and we have talked about everything and anything. I had told him a few times that I had feelings for him but it was all pretty much swept under the rug. A few weeks ago he met a girl. She's blonde, beautiful, pink motorcycle, and pierced nipples from what he told me.

Well, in short I couldn't handle it. I told him how much it hurt me to see him with her, but I would try to work through it. It turns out that I can't.... I let it all out tonight. I told him I loved him, that what we had is a rare thing and that I couldn't bare seeing him fall for another girl. I went in to kiss him and he dodged it. He told me he would but we work together and that would cause tension and big issues at work. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't seem very put together but I am distraught and typing this on my phone. I guess I am just looking on advice on how to get through this and handle it at work. Our offices are directly beside each other and there are only 12 people in the whole building. Should I try to still be friends? Should I try to pretend he doesn't exist? Should I move to Siberia? "

I'll be graduating this May and I'm looking into transferring somewhere for more school, but I'm unsure what the best bet is.

I entered college with limited knowledge, only knowing how to navigate and use a computer well, but no technical skills. I'm currently an intern at a huge retirement community which I started about 7 months ago.

My concern is since I'm new in the IT field, is more school something I should pursue or does real-world experience teach you so much more the college ever can? 

I enjoy IT, but there is so much to know which sometimes is overwhelming. Thoughts? Advice? Personal experience?

npzbj,1,2011-12-25,The Night Before Hipstmas,[deleted],humor,https://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/npzbj/the_night_before_hipstmas/,"Hi Reddit, I wrote you a poem to celebrate for the season. Enjoy.

**The Night Before Hipstmas**

Twas the night before Hipstmas, and all through the apartment,

Not a creature was stirring, not even the dog we ironically named Jean-Paul Sartrement.

The homebrew was fermenting in the fireplace with care

to air out the rank smell emitting from there

The guitar was making some weird feedback

Since no one had bothered to pull out the jack. 

The housemates were scattered all over the Mission

While dreams of intercourse danced in their vision

And me with the Coors Light, and Max with the Jack

Had just settled ourselves for a drunken night’s snack

When out in the art room there arose such a clatter

I sprang from the den in time to see the splatter

The moon reflected off of the fresh-fallen vomit

splayed out on a vintage sweater in the shape of a comet.

Puking Max running round like a reprobate Elf

had drunkenly knocked down the IKEA shelf,

And what to my horrified eyes did appear

But an explosion of vinyl, and vomit, and beer. 
 
More rapid than eagles the records did fall,

from the IKEA shelves once affixed to the wall,

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

I was smacked by a 7-inch as it fell to the ground,
 
“Not the vinyl!” moaned Maxwell still dribbling puke,

“Not the Ella! The Calloway! The Sinatra! The Duke!

Vintage, all vintage,” he screamed in despair, 

“Those LPs were expensive—and foreign—and rare!”
 
Yet while he was lamenting, I heard two sharp cries

Emanate from the chimney where the homebrew resides,

When, what to my critical eyes should appear

But an overweight hipster with an ironic beard!
 
He was dressed in a Snuggie (facetious, I think)

from behind his square glasses he gave me a wink

As I took out my earbuds and pulled out my phone

I just had to tweet “St Nick is here in my home!”
 
A bundle of presents he had flung on his back!

And he looked like a homeless man opening his sack,

His eyes–how they twinkled with feelings sardonic!

(And I think his tattoo of Frosty was ironic,)
 
The stump of a Parliament he held tight in his lips,

He sighed. “Wait. I’m not Santa. It’s just an internship.”

He rolled his red eyes and he took a big toke,

Then he blew in my face and said “mind if i smoke?”
 
Before I could reply with a witty wisecrack

St. Nick’s intern removed several gifts from the sack

Since my trust-fund was dwindling, I watched on quite eager,

But the size of the haul seemed especially meager.
 
Only six presents, nothing more, nothing less,

And the size of the packages didn’t impress.

“Is that it?” I asked him, trying not to sound brash,

“Is that all that we get from your magical stash?”
 
The intern sighed again and said, “Not to be snotty

But according to Facebook, you’ve been pretty naughty,

You’ve been sucking down whiskey, giving adults attitude,

Spending food stamps at that yuppie Whole Foods,

Shopping at vintage stores, running up your mom’s credit,

And spending your nights browsing porno on Reddit,

“I can see from your photostream you drink more than enough, 

And besides, you guys already have lots of stuff,

Come now, do you think that these presents are free?

Go out and do something with that English degree.”
 
His words hurt me more than I care now to share,

And I pushed away the iPad and sat down on my chair,

Yet when St. Nick’s intern saw the tears in my eyes,

His jaded young heart must have increased in size,
 
“Come on, I was joking. I have one more gift.” 

Then he stuck his hand in and gave his bag a sift,

And when his hand emerged, it held an LP

With Japanese lettering I couldn’t quite see,
 
“What is it?” I muttered, examining the condition,

“It’s rare,” said the intern, “a foreign edition, 

by a band that’s so good no one knows who they are

but they sound like the Kinks kinda mixed with The Cars,
 
Then mixed with Arcade Fire. It’s hard to explain,” 

He thought for a second while scratching his brain

“Anyway, never mind. Just take my advice,

On eBay, this fetches a pretty good price.”
 
And before I could take a picture for my blog,

The grizzled young intern scurried off like a dog,

He sprang towards the fireplace like a stout little pixie

And rode back up the chimney on his magical fixie. 
 
And I swear that I heard, as his fixie took flight,

“Merry Hipstmas to all. And to all a good night.”"
npsxn,7,2011-12-24,Do people ever grow past 'attachment issues'?,attachment_issue,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/npsxn/do_people_ever_grow_past_attachment_issues/,"So I'm a 21 year old male, and my girlfriend is also 21. We are in similar programs at school and share many of the same classes. I am on an internship for the year (started last May, ends next September), and she is continuing classes. If it matters, I am a North American Caucasian, and she is Chinese (moved here ~10 years ago; her mother comes from a militant background).

So we got into this relationship around November 2010, and things went relatively okay until May 2011 when I started my internship. She got a 4 month internship (May 2011 through August 2011) at a city about an hour drive away from where I got mine.

We would visit each other every week (I would go there, or she would come to where I am). Things went pretty okay until around August when she said that we wouldn't be able to see each other for a while because she wanted to spend the month hanging out with her friends from high school, who happened to be in the same city she was in. I obviously got upset with this, seeing as she was basically saying we wouldn't be seeing each other for 4 or 5 weeks. Things eventually blew over though, and I got to see her a couple times during that period.

During this time, she progressively became harder and harder to get a hold of. I would message her a couple times a day online, but would only get a response maybe 1 out of every 10 times. I got upset, but then accepted it assuming she was probably just very enthralled with whatever work she was doing.

September came around, and it just became worse. It annoyed me because the classes she was saying she was very busy with were classes I had taken the year before - I knew they had a lot of work, but certainly not enough such that I wouldn't be able to at least say 'hi' once in a while. Most of the time when she would initiate contact with me through this period, it was to ask me for help with something, and once she got it, she would disappear - often mid conversation.

The odd thing though was that when I would visit her on weekends, she was fully attentive to me and we could talk and have fun - just as if nothing were wrong. She attributes this to that when she's not looking at me (or not being with me rather) I'm just completely out of her mind and not a concern. She doesn't 'remember' me (if you want to call it that) unless I'm with her. She says she doesn't find talking online fun anymore, and would rather play video games by herself. She finds it a chore to 'have to talk to me' every once in a while because of how boring talking online is. It's odd to me because I've never considered online chat to be something 'fun to do' and rather a communication medium for talking to other people. I don't know if I'm the odd one out on thinking the person on the other end is what makes it entertaining - not the way you do it.

At one point during a visit to her, she said she had really bad stomach pain, and I told her to go to the university doctor as soon as possible. That was on a Sunday and she had scheduled her appointment on a Monday. I wasn't able to get a hold of her at all until the Thursday of that week to ask her how it went - obviously pissed off that she took so long to contact. She got mad saying that she has a really busy schedule and if I want to talk to her, I should do it through email so that she could respond to me at her leisure. This worked well for a while, and I was able to get decently long and thoughtful responses from her.

Right now I'm on vacation, and told her I would email her every so often to just check what's up and tell her what I'm doing. The past few emails I've sent her, probably about the length of half of this post have either gotten no response or a one word response to some question I asked her within the email (i.e. ""So how are you doing?"" - ""Good""). I had a feeling she just basically glanced over what I wrote and looked for anything ending in a question mark. So I asked her if she was disinterested in what I had to say (making it obvious I didn't like her lack of response) and if she would prefer we just speak in the new year. She said ""Ya, lets just talk in the new year then"" and that was it.

Obviously that didn't go well with me, but I didn't respond to her... just left myself time to think.

-----

Aside from that, she just got a 16-month internship herself starting in May. I tried to coax her into not applying to it (she only did because it was the first posting she saw), because that would mean we would now graduate at different times (I'm in a 4 year program, she's in a 5) - and because there would be plenty of 4-month postings later at the same company. The plan was originally that we would live together our final year, but she suddenly decided against it (before she got her job offer) saying she wanted to live with some friends by herself. I've never met these friends, but she's gone to multiple parties with them and told me not to come since it would be ""awkward"" (these are friends she met through her previous boyfriend - they don't know I exist). She says they're all single, and it would be weird if I lived there too because it would make her the odd one out as the non-single one (she wants to keep up a sherade that she's single too). After that point we would then 'meet' and it would look like we started dating after she moved in with them. Seems absolutely stupid to me.

She also started making comments here and there about how she doesn't see us lasting after graduation since we'll probably have to go our separate ways. I got all depressed over it and she said it was just her 'being realistic'. She then later said she said that because she has a problem with 'pushing people away after she gets close to them' like she did with previous boyfriends - an attachment issue. She now claims we're going to be 'together forever', but I know she's just saying that in a weak attempt to make me feel better.

. . .

So this being my first relationship, I don't know what to make of all of this. I feel like this is all related to the 'attachment problem' she goes on about - where she severs connections upon people she's close to not physically being in the same place as her anymore. She can even go a couple months at a time without talking to her parents, who are only a couple hours away.

I really don't know whether to attribute all of this to her being a jerk or her having some kind of behavioural problem that may or may not be correctable - I can't see any advantage of not being able to form persistent attachments so I'm just assuming it's a problem. It may not be a problem with her at all, and may be an issue of me being too needy - I don't really know what the '0' of the relationship normality plain is. I just know it's making me feel pretty bad.

What do you all make of this? Any advice?

nqua4,1,2011-12-25,What do I do? Am I a bad person?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nqua4/what_do_i_do_am_i_a_bad_person/,"I'm a 21 year old college dude with 1.5 years to go and the girl I am currently after is same age and has either 1 year or 1.5 years left in school. However she Lives 2,500 Miles away (essentially Im on the West Coast and She is on the east) The real kicker here though is she has a boyfriend, of 4 years..... 

So that's the demographics on us and here is the other background information. So I have been going to the same summer camp for the past 16 years and 2 years ago same old same old checking in but then all of a sudden me and this girl (M) saw each other for the first time and we both had the whole dear in headlights, omg, love at first sight connection thing. We both talked a bit and things were great. She asked me questions like ""do I ever get breaks"", etc. (I was a volunteer counselor and she was staff at the camp) So I switched my schedule around and we hung out that monday, flirting and making out ensued that's it. But then I am going until that Thursday night and she switched her schedule around and we ended up hanging out that night. I was like what the hell once in a lifetime thing at camp, never going to happen again so we ended up having sex, cuddling after all that. I got her number we talked for about a month after and then it all stopped and we got on with our ways, I thought that was that.

She cam back to camp again the next year, started texting me all day every day for a month before I got there. Started having serious feelings for each other needless to say camp happens, we hang out and flirt one night and then two of the other nights we have sex and the last night we just laid together cuddling and actually fell asleep with each other under the stars (best night i have had with a interested partner) Afterwards we end up talking all day every day for 3 months we actually start to get to know each other while I also get as much information as possible on her current relationship and the boyfriend and of course im going to be somewhat biased but I find out he, makes fun of her body (her parents drove her to anorexia as a child), physically doesnt hug her, kiss her rarely anything. Her mother had cancerous surgery with big complications and he didnt eve ask her how she or her mom was doing until the day after, She drove to see his brother and his partner for HER birthday and he didnt pay for any of the gas, hotel room, etc. Didn't get her any kind of gift OR even tell her Happy Birthday on her birthday (they drove together for 9 hours sitting 1 ft from each other, how hard is that?) she asked whats up and he said ""its not always gunna be rainbows and butterflies, and kisses and I love yous"" every relationship has a honeymoon phase but you dont say things like that. However, this is the best guy she has ever dated :( shes been thrown down the stairs, cheated on, etc. anything you can think of by past Boyfriends.

I start getting really attached and start trying to help her gain self confidence and try to explain to her that her relationship isnt healthy but eventually become attacking and mean so I told her I need a break so we dont talk for 2 months then she texts me again and we start up talking all over and thats where we currently are. I'm trying to rebuild what I destroyed and show her I really care about her and want her to be happy and even if it doesnt mean me she deserves better than this asshole. So I am going out there for Spring break and even if I don't see her then I will for sure see her at camp again this year. The BF might do an internship in Colorado after camp so they would be seperated for 6 months. Her and I both are planning on moving there after school so I have no idea if I should continue to try to pursue something for that long. Should I tell her good luck and be on our ways. Should I be a good friend and be there for support and try to show her she deserves more? 

I just have no idea what I should do. I Care about this girl and we click more than I ever have with anybody I have been interested in or who has been interested with me. I want to be supportive and show her there are good guys who arent douchebags (in doing this I am really hurting myself seeing them together, knowing their together, etc.) as well as enabling her to cheat on her bf etc. or do I just try and give up and move on and just see where things are at camp or when were both done with school and in Colorado? Sorry for such a lengthy post but I would really appreciate any advice.

Thank you friends :)

ns0cf,2,2011-12-27,College student having trouble losing weight,violabeatle,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/ns0cf/college_student_having_trouble_losing_weight/,"For as long as I can remember, my mother has been putting the pressure on me to lose some weight, even as far back as middle school. Until I began work at a major fast food chain my senior year of high school, I was around 165-170 lbs, which is on the high end of ""average"" weight for a girl of my body type and height. I was pretty much allowed to take home whatever food (mostly junk food) I wanted throughout my time at the job, which lasted about 8 months. I gained about 15 lbs. 

I left my job to go to college about 6 hours from home. I gained the dreaded freshman 30. When I returned home for the summer, my doctor recommended I see a nutritionist. The nutritionist laid out a diet plan, and to this day I've tried my hardest to follow it. It's a plan that seems easy and makes sense. For who knows what reason, I'm finding it extraordinarily difficult to follow. I try to keep healthy foods in my apartment (fruits and veggies of course) and portion my unhealthy foods. However, I continue to buy unhealthy foods, and when looking for a snack, I go for those, even though I know I shouldn't. As a result, healthy snacks go bad in my fridge. 

This past semester I made it a goal of mine to work out at least 2-3 times a week. I succeeded for the most part, until mid-November came along. That was about the time of the semester when I had very little free time between the constant stream of tests and projects, my current job, finding a spring internship, and extracurriculars. I felt like I had no time in the day to do my own thing, much less hit the gym. On top of all of that, I was stress eating which as you all know helps nothing. 

I guess my issue is motivation. What motivated all of you guys? From what I've seen, this is a strong community and maybe some support is all I need to get started. I would love to get down to my original weight, and if possible my ultimate goal is to be about 150 lbs.

nto21,1,2011-12-28,"IAMA guy who fell into a barrel cactus 6 years ago. Hilarity ensued, including hospitalization, orthopedic surgery, as well as some at-home surgery courtesy of my wife. AMA.",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nto21/iama_guy_who_fell_into_a_barrel_cactus_6_years/,"About 6 years ago, I had dropped off my car at a local dealership to have the brakes worked on. I had arranged for a co-worker to pick me up that afternoon, who was unfamiliar with exactly where to go to get into the place.. So, I waved her down, and like a complete doofus, jogged over to the street where she had pulled over. In the process, I tripped over a retaining chain between two cars, and fell arms-first into a large barrel cactus like the one in this photo:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Echinocactus_grusonii_-_golden_barrel_cactus_-_status-endangered.jpg

Havign fallen on it, I rolled off it to one side. Amazingly, I didn't feel it at first. Maybe it was the shock of it, or the little adrenaline boost that came from jogging over to the car, but I didn't feel a thing at first. I just stood up and noticed I had maybe 30 or 40 spines in my arms, each about the diameter of a toothpick, curved, and about 2"" long. Not really knowing the full extent of my injury, I hopped in the car, and we went back to work.

On the way, I started bleeding out my arms.. It didn't look too good, bleeding all over the place, and my coworker suggested I go to the ER. (I work at a hospital, thankfully, so, it was within walking distance..) ...So, i'm walking over there, dripping blood all over the place, and the pain starts to set in. It hurts to let my arms hang at my sides while I walk, so I start walking with my forearms stretched out in front of me looking like I'm carrying an invisible package. I get into the main building, and start looking for direction signs that will get me to the ER. That was fun, in and of itself, walking by people inside the hospital with my arms out like Frankenstein having to explain to them, ""It's okay, I just fell into a cactus.."" and having them not freak out at all the blood.

Anyway, I get to the ER, and get triaged.. I get in pretty quick, and the doctors have a look at me. The doctor was new to the area (this is Tucson we're talking) and hadn't quite dealt with a cactus injury before. In conversation, I found out he had just come in from Baltimore, and was more used to gunshots than cactus needles. He conferred with some other doctors about giving me a CAT scan, but it was decided that the spines probably wouldn't show up. He settled on giving me an ultrasound instead.... which proved to be equally pointless.

By this point, i'm in some pretty significant pain. Maybe 7 out of 10. I can't move a couple fingers in my left hand for some reason. So, they put me on an exam table, and wheel in an ultrasound unit, and start lubing up my arm in preparation for the scanning wand. I didn't think much of it.

The instant they pressed the wand into my flesh, it felt like my whole goddamn arm was being sawed off. As I explained in a different post preceeding this AMA, it felt like my arm was being put through a deli meat slicer, and with every pass of the wand, the slices were being flipped through like a deck of cards..I howled in absolute fucking agony, each pass of the wand basically driving the needles further into my arm, one by one as the tech moved the wand up and down my arm. The pain was so incredible that it triggered that weird sort of ""animal"" response, where I felt compelled to attack the thing causing it. I tried very, very hard to resist the urge to do so, and blacked out, waking up a few seconds later on my side, crying. They called off the ultrasound at that point.

A few minutes later, an intern shows up with a rather large pair of tweezers, and starts examining my arms for puncture marks. They manage to locate quite a few, and pull each one of them out, like toothpicks out of a ham. The spines themselves were are similar in shape and size to the tines on a dinner fork. They were flexible, but stiff, sort of like thick plastic. In a way, it was good that they were so large. The smaller cactus needles are hard as hell to find and remove. Tweezer guy removed about 20 of them.

They strip me down and find a couple more embedded in my butt. My wallet still has the marks from where a needle or two poked through my jeans and dug into the leather (thank you, wallet!) ...After taking care of those, it was time to look at why my middle and ring fingers weren't working. A doctor comes in, and asks me to try and move them... then suddenly, POP, oooooooooooh fuck. ... Turns out I had a spine lodged directly into one of the tendons just below my wrist, and in retracting that tendon, it basically flipped the needle like one flips a light switch on a wall. Unbelievable pain.

An hour or two (and LOTS of pain meds later), i'm informed that the local orthopedic surgeon had just left on vacation. There was another one available, but it would be two weeks before I could see him. They bandaged up my arm to keep it immobilized, and sent me on my way.

Two weeks later, I see the ortho. Turns out the surgery involves full-body anesthesia! Apparently, the nerves in the arms and fingers are not to be fucked with, and the risk of damaging something on a local anesthetic is too high.. So they just knock you out completely. I wake up in the recovery room reciting numbers and telling the nurses how beautiful they are.

The surgeon said it took quite a while to locate it, so, the resulting scar was much bigger than he had wanted. All stitched up, I headed home.

I'm a Unix admin by trade. A computer geek. My hands are my livelyhood, so I kept the bandaged area absolutely air-tight and soaked in neosporin for the whole time it took to heal. For those of you who dont know, keyboards and desks are fucking playgrounds for bacteria. Worse, I work at a hospital, and not 6 months ago there was a case where someone in my department had contracted MRSA, presumably from their keyboard. He was a cubicle worker, like me.

Keeping the area bathed in neosporin meant it took quite a while for the scar to heal up. And it looks fairly nasty. It's like a little flabby bag that hands off the lower part of my forearm. (I'll include a picture here shortly, for amusement).

Over the years, some of the remaining spines still lodged in my arms have worked their way out. I can still feel at least 3 of them in my shoulders. My wife removed one, bless her heart, using some good ol' fashioned 19th century home surgery. A razor blade sterilized by candle, a bowl of ice cubes to keep the area numb, and a pair of tweezers to extract the needle itself. I have a small scar on the back of my right arm from the procedure about the diameter of a nickel. I'm happy to talk about how that whole procedure went as well.

nteem,1,2011-12-28,"IAMA guy who tripped and fell onto a barrel cactus about 6 years ago. Even with surgery (including the home variety), I still have cactus spines embedded in my arms to this day. AMA!",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nteem/iama_guy_who_tripped_and_fell_onto_a_barrel/,"About 6 years ago, I had dropped off my car at a local dealership to have the brakes worked on. I had arranged for a co-worker to pick me up that afternoon, who was unfamiliar with exactly where to go to get into the place.. So, I waved her down, and like a complete doofus, jogged over to the street where she had pulled over. In the process, I tripped over a retaining chain between two cars, and fell arms-first into a large barrel cactus like the one in this photo:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Echinocactus_grusonii_-_golden_barrel_cactus_-_status-endangered.jpg

Havign fallen on it, I rolled off it to one side. Amazingly, I didn't feel it at first. Maybe it was the shock of it, or the little adrenaline boost that came from jogging over to the car, but I didn't feel a thing at first. I just stood up and noticed I had maybe 30 or 40 spines in my arms, each about the diameter of a toothpick. Not really knowing the full extent of my injury, I hopped in the car, and we went back to work.

On the way, I started bleeding out my arms.. It didn't look too good, bleeding all over the place, and my coworker suggested I go to the ER. (I work at a hospital, thankfully, so, it was within walking distance..) ...So, i'm walking over there, dripping blood all over the place, and the pain starts to set in. It hurts to let my arms hang at my sides while I walk, so I start walking with my forearms stretched out in front of me looking like I'm carrying an invisible package. I get into the main building, and start looking for direction signs that will get me to the ER. That was fun, in and of itself, walking by people inside the hospital with my arms out like Frankenstein having to explain to them, ""It's okay, I just fell into a cactus.."" and having them not freak out at all the blood.

Anyway, I get to the ER, and get triaged.. I get in pretty quick, and the doctors have a look at me. The doctor was new to the area (this is Tucson we're talking) and hadn't quite dealt with a cactus injury before. In conversation, I found out he had just come in from Baltimore, and was more used to gunshots than cactus needles. He conferred with some other doctors about giving me a CAT scan, but it was decided that the spines probably wouldn't show up. He settled on giving me an ultrasound instead.... which proved to be equally pointless.

By this point, i'm in some pretty significant pain. Maybe 7 out of 10. I can't move a couple fingers in my left hand for some reason. So, they put me on an exam table, and wheel in an ultrasound unit, and start lubing up my arm in preparation for the scanning wand. I didn't think much of it.

The instant they pressed the wand into my flesh, it felt like my whole goddamn arm was being sawed off. As I explained in a different post preceeding this AMA, it felt like my arm was being put through a deli meat slicer, and with every pass of the wand, the slices were being flipped through like a deck of cards..I howled in absolute fucking agony, each pass of the wand basically driving the needles further into my arm, one by one as the tech moved the wand up and down my arm. The pain was so incredible that it triggered that weird sort of ""animal"" response, where I felt compelled to attack the thing causing it. I tried very, very hard to resist the urge to do so, and blacked out, waking up a few seconds later on my side, crying. They called off the ultrasound at that point.

A few minutes later, an intern shows up with a rather large pair of tweezers, and starts examining my arms for puncture marks. They manage to locate quite a few, and pull each one of them out. The spines themselves were about 1-2"" long, very similar in shape and size to the tines on a dinner fork. They were flexible, but stiff, sort of like thick plastic. In a way, it was good that they were so large. The smaller cactus needles are hard as hell to find and remove.

They strip me down and find a couple more embedded in my butt. My wallet still has the marks from where a needle or two poked through my jeans and dug into the leather (thank you, wallet!) ...After taking care of those, it was time to look at why my middle and ring fingers weren't working.

nt1lw,1,2011-12-27,How do I tell her I don't want to be with her anymore/am I just an asshole?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/nt1lw/how_do_i_tell_her_i_dont_want_to_be_with_her/,"Hey guys so I need a little help. I've been dating this girl for 4 months now (we've known each other for 8 months) and to be honest it’s not working for me anymore, for a few reasons.


 Firstly, she’s getting increasingly needy for attention to the point where she gets mad at me quite often for not showing her enough attention. Now I am perfectly fine with showing attention to someone I care about but the amount she wants gets in the way of my work and studies (we’re both in college) and she makes me feel bad whenever I tell her that I have to do stuff. She’ll pull the sad card or the angry card and I’ll end up feeling like an asshole for trying to get my shit done. I am juggling a research position, a distance job from Chicago, School, and a fraternity (which she has already started voicing displeasure about despite supporting me before). She basically had me tutor her all through last semester at the expense of my own studies and If I didn’t have time again made me feel bad about it. I’m currently on break and working 2 jobs and commuting to cover tuition next semester and every day she’s gotten mad at me for not talking to her for hours when I barely have ten minutes to myself between the jobs and travelling and the maybe 4 hours of sleep I get a night. She expects me to write her “morning messages” which are supposed to be these long messages talking about how much I love her and sweet stuff like that because I did that once or twice but now I’m getting up at 6 to go to work and I don’t have time to write that stuff before I leave.  I just feel that it’s kind of ridiculous that she doesn’t understand when I tell her these things. I’ll digress on this subject because I could go on for a while.


Secondly, she expects me to deal with a bunch of her issues like her ridiculous test anxiety/general stress. Again normally I would love to and wouldn’t think twice except for the sheer scope of the situation. She’ll get so upset before an exam or if something goes wrong with school or her work that she’ll basically get hysterical and kind of mean really and I just feel like I can’t deal with that anymore. I have so much on my plate already that I just can’t add hours of consoling just for a simple test. And it really is hours. She has these ridiculous expectations of me that I can’t keep as a college student like taking her out all the time (she insisted it didn’t have to cost money but just take her out somewhere like a park) or cook her dinner all the time and I just don’t have the time! And then she gets mad at me and says I don’t make her feel special and that she does so much for me (AKA brought me food a few times when I was studying) and then she’ll burst into tears. 


She demanded that I stay at her place every night last semester and basically had me move in to her student apartment room, so I had two shelves to put my clothes and shit on and had to take trips back to my apartment to get books and stuff for class and had nowhere to work and if I EVER mentioned sleeping at my apartment she would get mad and sad and all that and talk about how she didn’t want to sleep alone. One time I made the mistake of going out partying and crashing at a friend’s apartment ( I may not have answered my phone all night due to intoxication) and she told me not to come home and was pissed at me all day the next day until I had to apologize to make my life easier.


Now here’s where it gets complicated. These feelings are completely and utterly one-sided. She tells me all the time how I’m perfect and how happy she is to have me and how she wants to spend the rest of her life with me (another worry) and stuff like that. How am I supposed to break up with her? I’ve had these feelings like I just want out for a while now but I just don’t know what to do. Am I being an asshole? I’m really a nice guy and a good boyfriend but I just feel like this situation is too much.


Holy shit this is long. Sorry guys I just had to get it out. 


EDIT: also one thing I failed to mention is that she still keeps in contact with 1) her ex boyfriend, who punched her in the stomach during a fight but now apparently has "" done his time"" according to her and she seems ok with his desperate grovelling and is still his friend and 2) these guys who constantly flirt with her, one of whom during a night when we were both drunk partying at my fraternity house threw me into a serving table, cutting my head open (clearly over her), and who also kissed her over the summer at a party at a time that we were basically together while I was in Europe on an internship. She was playing beer pong with him just a week ago the night I left to come back home for break.  It just bothers me how she is still friends with that asshole and also with these other guys who flirt with her all the time. but maybe I'm overreacting. 


tl/dr: girlfriend is needy and doesn’t understand my time constraints and makes me feel bad about myself. However she tells me I’m the one she wants to spend the rest of her life with. How do I tell her I don’t want to be with her?

I have a clean box here with XP installed. 

What do I install to get started in ABAP programming? I assume the application server? Does that include everything I need to get started?

Is WinXP the best OS for this? I am very proficient with Ubuntu so should I install that instead? 

I believe we will be running WinXP so thats why I installed WinXP. 

Any other advice?

nwicv,2,2011-12-30,Should I drop out of college so I can help out my parents financially?,Akinera,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/nwicv/should_i_drop_out_of_college_so_i_can_help_out_my/,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this.

I'm a sophomore in college and a general biology major. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with that after college. However, I live very close to a military base with research labs and I've worked for them for the past three summers teaching kids. I'm hoping to get a job there eventually, but I'm not sure about what that'd be or how I'd get it. 

As far as school goes, I'm not doing so bad but I'm not the best either. I've got a solid 3.0. I'm part of a club. I want to be a TA for the introductory biology course at the university because of my small background in teaching and my love for the course. At some point in my college career, I definitely plan on either doing an internship or doing research under a professor on campus. 

Here's the thing: my family has serious financial issues. My mother has a gambling problem and my father's a simple-minded man with a short fuse who drives about an hour or two getting to work so all his money basically goes to gas. My mother ALWAYS ""borrows"" money from me and it's scary because sometimes, it's the money I get from loans. She always says, ""I'll pay you back"" and although I've had some close calls, I'm able to pay my rent and tuition miraculously. 

My sisters are working now. My older sister's trying to pay off her college debt and my little sister is training to become a nurse. I'm the only one who's currently enrolled in college and not working. I'm planning on getting a job next semester, now that I'm taking the bare minimum amount of credits because I'll be taking three labs. I'm hoping that'll help with day-to-day things like paying for groceries and making ends meet with utilities.

I'm afraid of falling into the same trap as my older sister: going to college for four years only to be trapped at home trying to pay off all that. My parents never saved up for college and all the money I made from working in high school went straight to my mother to pay for the bills. My mother gambled away all the money that was supposed to go to paying for our house and now she's trying to catch up by borrowing money from me. It also frustrates me that my parents are very irresponsible with their money. My mother tends to buy things that she doesn't need and doesn't listen to me or my sisters when we tell her ""No. Don't get that."" The ""just talk to them"" solution never works with my parents, and believe me, I've tried on a number of occasions. 

A few times this semester, I've thought about dropping out so that I can go home and get a simple job in order to help my mother with the bills. Sounds fair since I don't even really know what I want to do with my life yet, I've been doing average in school, and I feel guilty enjoying my time with college knowing that back at home everything's a wreck. I can just go back to school when I've figured it out and when the house, cars, phones, etc. has been paid off, right? 

However, I've already applied for a loan that'll be paying for the rest of the spring and summer, so if anything I should just finish this school year off and then get another job over the summer. If I decide on anything, it'll be for after summer is over. Also, I feel like if I go home and get a simple paying job, that'll be the end of it. I'll be at a dead end and no longer able to advance either academically or in terms of a career. I'm probably all wrong about that, but I don't have much telling me otherwise.

**TL;DR** I'm an average college student with a family that has financial issues. Should I drop out to help out with the bills at home or should I continue to go to school in hopes for a better job in the future? "

Everyone should pay attention to this, not just those interesting in circlejerking.",[deleted],circlejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/nxujy/reddit_has_proven_to_have_far_more_jerking_power/,"tl;dr Reddit is starting to make big differences in how important we all think we are sitting at our computers. Let's continue, and convince ourselves that we are shaping the world even more next year. Let's make it Reddit's New Year's resolution.

Reddit has formed into an affective way of fighting back against $2 fees, but those politicians whose batshit ideas will die out with their generation. It has become sort of a magnifying glass for many of us want to be intellectual 20-somethings, and the rest of the weak 3rd world is on the other side. We have the power to set any any we want aflame like the joker in the Dark Night because our opinions are so fucking important.

It's been a long journey for me with Reddit, but what we've been doing to talk amongst ourselves about SOPA has warmed my heart more than any other altruistic function Reddit has ever organized (next to Ron Paul). I think we should continue. Reddit has been in the news more than ever (a whopping 2 times in the 4th quarter of 2011), and I think it says something very important about the United States political system. Democracy in and of itself it incredibly ineffective unless the people are well informed like everyone who browses r/politics and r/atheism and agrees with the hivemind there. At this point, especially in the United States, the status quo are, unfortunately, very uninformed and just downright wrong (Ron Paul). So those who ARE informed, must fight back with in a collected, unified, targeted manner against anyone who identifies themselves as a Republican, Christian, Conservative, White, and over 35. Not just boycotts, but, just as many have said before me, targeting one or two politicians at a time and spamming their inboxes with form letters for their interns to delete. Or one or two corporations at a time so they can blatantly ignore us or pander bullshit to us to shut us up. The harder we smash them into the ground, the more revered Reddit will become, and the harder my dick will become.

Other things I want to add if you want to be a part of this:

* Make a Reddit account already. Upvotes/downvotes are what make Reddit so powerful and you can't do that without and account. Seriously, if we have more fake internet points NOTHING CAN STOP US. Signing up for Reddit was the quickest and more painless process I've ever went through for a site, but remember, don't disagree with the hivemind.

* Comment on things. Sure, you'll probably get downvoted for having an opinion on stuff but who cares? It's a number. That's it. I've gotten downvoted plenty of times before, and as a result I learned why what I said was incorrect. The Hivemind is omniscient and omnipresent like Ron Paul.

* Lastly, and I hope most obviously, take part in what we decide to focus on. We are right. All the time. You may think you are only one person and moving one or two domains from GoDaddy or doing that ONE THING won't actually change anything, but you are thinking as a single person. This is a collective organism. This is hivemind. You can't think that way, or you won't help at all. It does make a difference. We are so god-damn important. Unless you disagree with us. Then, fuck off.

nxn2v,1,2011-12-31,Advice for atheist new to a career setting,saramb03,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nxn2v/advice_for_atheist_new_to_a_career_setting/,"I'm a recent atheist (about 3 years ex-Christian) and I'm about to start a career in a hospital laboratory. I've been doing internships for my last year of college and have already been put in a position where Christians have been questioning my beliefs. On almost my first day there, my trainer and I were discussing the coagulation cascade and she said that when she learned about coagulation, ""that's when [she] knew there was a God."" Then she looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to agree with her. I had no idea what to say, whether I should play along in hopes that I be hired there someday or just tell her the truth. I ended up saying ""Yep, it's pretty amazing...."" After that, she was significantly cooler to me, and we had to listen to the Christian radio station for the rest of the day. I'm wondering if this is something I will experience at every job (This isn't my first job, I have worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years. The demographics in a restaurant are completely different though, and could hardly be considered professional; I could say whatever I wanted at any of my other jobs). 

Normally, I like to be pretty vocal about my atheism but I'm worried that in a professional setting this might work against me. Ideally, I'd like to get into management and I wonder if coming out as an atheist will get in the way of that with office politics and all. Also I worry that people will think I can't make moral decisions about patient care since I don't believe in god.

My questions to r/atheism are: 
What have your experiences been with theists in the workplace? Any confrontations? 

Did you tell them you were an atheist, try your best to be ambiguous, or lie about your beliefs? 

For people who are openly atheists at work, have you had a negative or positive experience?

For any Christians reading this, would you be weary of promoting an atheist or feel inclined to discriminate against them because you feel they have no basis for morality?"

She's always been a party animal, but as of the last two years, since she returned from a year long internship abroad (in Chile), her partying has grown to frightening porportions. We're talking drinking to the point of blacking out on a regular basis (and belittling those who can't or won't drink at that level). Additionally, she's become hypersexual; we recently went to a party where she pointed out five different guys in the same clique that she's slept with in the last three months, and became upset when I simply spoke to them in a non-flirtatious manner. 

After this party, she became hysterical when her and another friend got into a fight of Jersey Shore proportions (screaming, grabbing, etc) regarding one of the guys she hooked up with. I broke them up, and the other friend left. K was crying, I sat her down, and got her a glass of water. She responded by GRABBING THE GLASS AND THROWING IT IN MY FACE. It didn't break, but it did leave a bruise. I began taking my things and making to leave, she grabbed my legs and begged me not to leave her. I stayed to calm her down, then left as quickly as I could the next day to have brunch with a saner friend. K whined that she wanted to come with, despite another friend repeatedly asking her to come out, and if I was a true friend I'd invite her along. I responded that a true friend wouldn't have attacked me the night before. I left her moaning and crying alone in her apartment. 

I spoke with some mutual friends about what happened. Two of them pointed out that K's been getting more and more hysterical over the last year, as well as becoming more narcissistic (Example: a mutual friend had ovarian cysts removed, and may not be able to have children. K's idea of cheering her up was coming over to her house after surgery, getting drunk and bragging about her sex life. Not once did she discuss the friend's operation). 

After talking about this, we think something may have happened to her in Chile. How do we ask her if something happened, and how we can help? The narcissism bothers me; she's an immensely fun girl, but her actions over the last year are upsetting. Throwing a glass in my face was the final straw. I want to be friends with her, but I'm truly concerned about her behavior. Should we be having an intervention for her? Call her parents? Consult a counselor, or hell, even AA or Sex Addicts Anonymous? What should we do? "

Let me start with some background info so you can see my reasoning.

My Parents were immigrants from Europe. Both have Masters Degrees. They lived with their parents until they came to the US. They left Europe because they could not make ends meet as Teachers and came to the US legally and are US Citizens. Because they didn't speak English this was a major block to their potential employment prospects. My mom was a housekeeper for years and finally moved up the ranks to that of Supervisor. She currently makes about $40K + benefits. My dad did various low paying jobs and eventually got into construction: working for a General Contractor for over 20 years. My dad has never made more than $35K and has never had benefits. It makes me sick to my stomach that even though he has all this experience he gets paid so low.

Like most people on here I was told the same thing about going to college and getting a good job afterwards! I had dreams about getting a good job so that I could help my dad retire early. I was so sick of my dad being taken advantage of that I was willing to support him if I made enough money. My dad is a very hard worker but he is just not a people person. There is no way he could ace any interview. 

Even though both of my parents don't make much money [ New York City standards] they live what I would consider a middle class life: They have a house with a mortgage, a used car, cable tv and cell phones. They bought their house in Queens in 1994 and got a 30 year mortgage. They have about 13 years left or so on it. The house was $195K which was the most they could afford at the time. Same house today is about $450K. They were forced to buy outside of the neighborhood where we originally lived - Greenpoint, Brooklyn. If you are from NYC you know that area along with Williamsburg has exploded ! The price for a house now in that area is at least $750K and I am talking a piece of shit wooden house with no garage. There are condo buildings going up left and right all the time and I think the minimum is about $500K [ but I could be wrong depending on the size and # of bedrooms etc] Basically if you want to live as a family in that area be prepared to spend at least $750K.

OK back to me. So my parents thought that I should go to college and I would be able to get some good job and be better off than them. That was the plan.
For my freshman year I went to a reasonably priced school called Hofstra University, which cost about $14K for the year back in 1995 - 96. I had to commute everyday and lived at home to save money. I also worked pretty much everyday to cover whatever scholarships and loans didn't. The commute from Queens to Long Island to school and then the commute from Queens to Manhattan to work took its toll on me and I decided to transfer the following year to a school in the city. 

Here is where I started making major mistakes. I ended up going to NYU where tuition was over $25K if I remember correctly. Of course I got some grants etc, more loans but I was always short. Whatever money I made I was constantly paying it to the school to cover the tuition, books, etc. After I graduaded in Fall of 1999 I had student loan debt of approximately $50 - $60K. There were so many loans it was confusing to keep track of all this stuff. For the first few years I remember making only the minimum payments because my income was just so low. Finally in 2004 I made more money and increased my payments and by October 2009 I actually finished paying off my student loans. Yes it took exactly 10 years to pay it all off.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Finance. This is a hard major and people are supposed to make good money with this degree. Never happened to me. I do blame myself though - but only to a point. You see, I didn't even want to go to college and I really hated Finance after studying it. I only went because everybody including my very successful boss was telling me that is what I needed to do. I saw college as expensive and in the way of my job but I didn't listen to me, I listened to them.
I started working at age 14 and at age 16 I met my main employer. This would become my employer for the last 17 years! Yes, I started working there at 16 in 1993 and finally lost my job in 2010. What's hilarious is that I was already there working at 16 yrs old so technically I didn't even need to finish High School! I could have dropped out in my Sophomore Year and nothing would be different. I learned everything I needed to learn on the job and eventually trained other employees.

After I got my degree I realized how hard it is to get a better job [i.e. with health benefits and opportunities for advancing an actual career] than the one I had been working at since age 16. I had no industry connections, my parents had none either. Actually I had 1 contact in the finance world and even he couldn't help me although I offered to work for FREE to get experience. He and other adults told me that most of the finance jobs go to the kids of the parents / relatives already working there at those firms. So the only other slots left were for students with very high GPA's that had managed to get industry specific internships at those firms. So if you didn't have that internship - you were toast. I would have gladly done an internship but that was out of the question because I was working to cover whatever the loans didn't. The big companies already had online recruitment then and after I submitted my applications I never heard back from any of them. 

So here I was working the same job since High School and here come some recessions: 9/11 attacks, dot com burst etc. Had to take a second job during those bad years to survive. I even went to some computer retraining program on Sundays for several months during 2002 that was funded by the State. Didn't learn anything useful that I could use at work or to get better work. Turned out to be a scam school of some sort. I feel bad because the State was scammed along with the tax-payer and I.

So to sum this up I went to college but never got a job in my field or a remotely related field and never got a job even utilizing anything I supposedly learned in school. I was essentially cornered into holding on to my job until things improve. They never did. I was one of the unlucky graduates who fell through the cracks of the system. I was lucky that I did manage to pay off my student loans during the better years when the economy was good for all companies even the shitty ones. Then I lost my job the following year. And I ask: What the fuck happened? I just wasted 10 years of my life working and paying off some shit that hasn't done me any good. Negative return on investment.

During the busiest years at my old job I didn't have dinner with my family for 2 years! I only saw my kids in the morning when they went to school and then on Saturday and Sunday nights. It was like having ""visitation rights"" with your own family even though we lived together.

I want to puke everytime I see some ad in the subway for such and such college. Pictures of smiling kids with Graduation Caps. Such false hope !

One thing that I want to clear up is that I am not jealous of anyone else. I am pissed because others have figured it out before I did. I believe that everybody who works hard and is interested in working should be able to get a good decent job. And if you want to be exemplary then be a star performer and get the best compensation. But the average people don't even get a fair chance at average pay. Everything seems below average with no benefits and no stability.

I tell people that I totally fucked up when it comes to the whole college thing. I have a laundry list of what not to do. I am convinced that college is for few people either the priveledged ones or the lucky ones or the dirt poor ones that can get a full ride. College is not for the average person with no connections -- only to be saddled with debt.

You know, when it was time to go to college, everybody said ""don't worry, just go, you'll get that fantastic job later"" Now that we're out ""oh no, there was no guarantee of a job"" . Hey - Fuck You ! You should have explained that more clearly in the beginning and I would have never went. You should have explained that some people get good jobs with signing bonuses but some graduates get crappy leftover jobs and they're underemployed perpetually. There will be incredible competition for jobs - translation: there are NOT enough good jobs for everybody. There's no rhyme or rhythm. I feel like the whole jobs situation is like a Ponzi Scheme. The people at the top are the lucky ones and cash out.
It's a combination of connections, luck and street smarts. I obviously have none.

Update on characters in my post:
That 1 contact I had in Finance: Lost his job at Bear Stears when Bear crashed, now lives and works in Asia. His wife lost her job at Lehman Brothers, works somewhere in NYC doing something similar to her old job, their relationship soured from being apart, most likely will divorce in the future.
My ex Boss: his company finally closed in 2011, getting divorced.
My Mom: After she lost her job in 2008 [ at the place she worked at for 25 years] she rebounded and found a similar position in 2010, still there $40K + benefits.
Dad: no change, still underpaid, still no benefits.
Myself:  A year ago I got my security guard license but couldn't find any legit guard work. Zero. Currently selling things online and in person to barely make ends meet. Studying for a CDL to see where that goes. I don't think I will ever use my degree for anything. It's too late and I don't remember jack shit anyway because I never had the oppurtunity to use and build on what I had learned.

Am I going to tell my kids to go college? Hell fuckin NO."

I am a student intern at the Blind Pig.  It's an unpaid position, but I do it because I'm really passionate about this place, it's one of my favorite concert venues in the world, and I want to show it off to all my friends!

I run the Twitter Page, so follow me for a followback if you'd like:

I really enjoy this place, and it might be a cool hang out, meet up for my fellow redditors.  There are some great shows coming this year, and if you have an act that you'd like to see, and they are suited for a ~350 person venue, let me know and I'll chat with the agent about getting them here to rock out!

Have you guys seen some great concerts here?  Anything you feel that the establishment should improve??"
nwz11,4,2011-12-30,"Reddit, I broke up with my girlfriend and now I have to see her every time I hang out with my friends, how do I get over her?",Awkwardartist,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/nwz11/reddit_i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_and_now_i/,"So I made this throw away because she's an avid redditor and I don't know if she will see this. I also posted this r/Relationships and they pointed me here. I figured I repost to see if I can get some more advice and from people who are more used to this sort of thing. More is always better than less right? Before we start, I'm a twenty one year old male, and she's 22. We dated for about a year and a half before we eventually broke up. If any other details are needed or anything about the relationship I'll put it up. I'm not really sure what you guys need but here we go.
So I broke up with my now ex because she was severely unhappy in our relationship, she wanted to be independent and have her own place but she has been constantly relying other people. Moving from one family member to another, till eventually she moved in with me and my family. We got her a well paying job that she could use to support herself, but she hated working in an office, as she has only worked retail, which showed in her work and attitude which eventually got her fired. Slowly over time she gave up in our relationship, even though I did everything I could to help us and her. Including constantly searching for jobs and defending her from my family who was getting annoyed by her not doing anything to really help. She slowly started to resent me until one day it erupted into a hate she only reserved for her father and possibly Hitler. Over night I had become the worst scum alive and had done something that made me ""a manipulative and lying bastard"" and ""I was never a good person"" that she refused to reveal and yet would never tell anyone about. She then packed up and called my best friend to pick her up and take her away. She then moved in with him. A week later I had to see her at a Christmas party with my friends where she took every chance to passive aggressively insult me and our relationship. I don't want to take her back, with us separated both our lives are much easier. I can go off and finish college (I had taken an internship with an art studio and got me a job there, I just want to expand my knowledge) and she can do whatever it is she wants to do. The only thing I want is how do I get to feel comfortable with my life again, as I'm constantly haunted by all of this. I have two jobs, in both I work by myself so negative thoughts are often easy to think about, and since my friends and myself are all very busy it can be difficult to get everyone together. Now when we do she is always there. Reddit, how do I feel better about myself and get over this girl without sacrificing my friends?"
