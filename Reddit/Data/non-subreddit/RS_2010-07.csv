clgyd,5,2010-07-02,Boyfriend broke up with me ... I feel so lost and stupid ...,throwaway19407,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/clgyd/boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_i_feel_so_lost_and/,"My boyfriend of three years broke up with me two days ago.  I thought he was ""the one.""  We both love each other, but he says I need to ""find myself"" first ... he says I needed to be more independent.  He brought this up a while ago when I was really getting clingy, and he even said I made a lot of progress since then, but I don't know.

I know I'm supposed to move on now, or at least move on long enough to ""find myself"" or whatever, but I just feel so lost and confused.  No one's ever broken up with me before, so I've never felt this feeling of helplessness.  I didn't have any problems with him, he just had problems with me, which makes me feel so worthless and retarded knowing I was solely responsible for the demise of the relationship ... that's probably not true, but it just feels that way.

I'm interning in a different city for the summer than most of my friends, so it's not like I can hang out with them every day, and they're really not the comforting type anyway ... mostly guys, and we don't really have a talk-things-out kind of friendship.

I don't know.  I feel stupid for letting this relationship go sour and not realizing when I was messing up.  I don't know how to get over him.  And he's all I can think about, and I can't concentrate at my internship or anything.  I don't know how to deal with this kind of thing.  

I think it's time for ice cream.  In the meantime, any advice, 2x?"

cnh4z,40,2010-07-08,So I've seen a lot of amazing things happen on reddit... today I received my first commission check from iTunes for a project I've been working on for 3 years.  It was all of $1.55. Please help my website get the attention it deserves and get me out of school loan debt!,ohsnaaap,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cnh4z/so_ive_seen_a_lot_of_amazing_things_happen_on/,"I've been a redditor 11 months now (other username: tcash21).  I've seen a lot of amazing things happen here, from money being raised to help a sick redditor without health insurance, to random strangers offering organs, to music artists selling loads of CDs overnight. You guys really are a great community. 

Here's my story: I started working on a website just for my own entertainment and fun while I was on an internship in college.  A year later I ended up finding links to it on iambored.com, blogs, and forums.  People actually liked it! So I put more work into it (on the side of course on top of school and now a full-time job).  

Basically it uses Last.FM feeds to help you find and listen to new artists that you may like.  It allows you to explore an interactive web of related artists.  I finally set it up with Amazon and iTunes affiliate links back in March or so.  So far I've made $1.55 [Picture of the check](http://imgur.com/Ox0a0.gif). So it works! It gets on average about 170-1,000 hits a day (depending on blog posts or reviews, but usually max 300 hits). I think it just needs more attention and to be honest I'm barely able to cover the hosting fees, let alone pay for expensive advertising campaigns. If you happen to already buy music through iTunes/Amazon please use my site to do so if you find it useful!

I would also LOVE feedback, constructive criticism, ANYTHING! I know the UI could be improved I'm just not sure how yet. ::nervous inhale:: So without further ado, I present to you, [MusicRoamer](http://www.musicroamer.com). Thanks in advance for even reading if you did.

ALSO! Try the konami code on it :)

**TL;DR.** I am 90k in school loan debt and I really believe my website has a chance.  Please reddit for the love of god try it out and comment!  

**UPDATE:** Thank you all so much for the feedback and for sending my site to friends/significant others/family! I've gotten almost 150 hits just from reddit in 5 hours. I will be hard at work trying to make all of your recommended changes. I seriously appreciate it, you guys are awesome!

So for a little background, I’m 22, an engineering student currently on an internship in one of the bigger cities in the states. I’m only here for the summer before I head back to school. 

Anyway, July 4th, rolled around and I ended up meeting three great ladies at the bar. We all hit it off and hung out a lot last week. I noticed right off the bat that one of the girls (lets call her Betty) wanted to be more than friends, and that was confirmed when she came over along on Thursday. After the initial awkward dust settled, she started to flirt over the top and eventually full on made a move. After a decent make out session, I pulled back and suggested this might be a bad idea. When asked why, I proceeded to tell her all my faults – I’m only around for 2 months, just looking for a fun time, definitely don’t want a girl friend, known to be notorious for one night stands, think a lot with my dick, etc, etc. After some initial hesitation on her part, she decides she wants to have sex with me anyway, and at this point I’m way too horny to argue any further against my pecker. We had sex. Rinse. Repeat.

The entire group continues to hang out on the weekend (Betty and her friend + me and my buddy from back home), and we hit a few bars. Chick comes on to me again, we go for round 2. However, at this point, things were not looking so peachy for me. She seemed to be getting clingy and whatever I said on Thursday seemed to have gone in one ear and out the other.

Come monday we all go for a concert at the local watering hole. I'm double fisting beer and having a great time. Through out the night I kept mentioning to her and her friends how I love being single, joked around about cheating, etc,etc.

Later on in the night as the band is packing up, this hot little thing (lets call her Veronica) comes over and strikes up a conversation. She is obviously flirting hard, and I can't help myself, and flirt back. End up finding out that shes from Russia, and since I approach my conquests like I do a game of Risk, I was immediately intrigued.

This is where it gets juicy. A lot more alcohol is involved, resulting in a lot more flirting. My buddy later tells me that Betty was giving everybody dagger eyes, and was not pleased with what was going on in front of her. Knowledge I didn't process in my drunken haze. I start getting a lot more touchy, feely and am actively hitting on Veronica. I'm pretty sure at one point i told the girl that ""I wish you were a cell phone, cause I want to work a number on that ass..."" (I know, I have no clue why I get laid either...)

We end up making out on a now completely empty dance floor. Betty comes out of nowhere and says ""You are a fucking asshole! You can fucking lose my number."" To which I, for an unknown reason, decide to respond to with hysterical laughter while my friend and her friend restrain her as she wants to take a swing at me.

I take Veronica aside, diffuse the situation, make out some more, get her number and book it out the bar. 

On my arrival home, I promtly try to fix things by trying to send an email saying the following. The only reason it didn't go through, is cause the room mate wrsetled the computer out of my hands:

Dear Betty

I'm sorry about last night. The alcohol is definitely my cryptonite. While I shouldn't have done what I did, its not like you didn't know who I was. I mentioned on multiple occasion that I was an asshole, a bad boyfriend, ________, ________ (feel free to replace the blanks with whatever expletives you want). But I never lied to you about who I was. I'm sorry you had to see that (I regret that happening in front of you) but when I'm drunk my true personality comes out.

Like I mentioned on Thursday (before we did the nasty, which was pretty fucking amazing), I hope we don't regret this. And I really hope we can still be friends.

You are truly an amazing individual.


Also apparently, at some point in the night she sent me a message saying ""you are disgusting. I've never felt so embarassed in my life"", to which I responded ""its hard forgetting your number when you keep texting me""

So now wise old Reddit, how do I fix this? I've gone through various scenarios in my head but all dont end well... Would like to still be friends with the group..."
cpc22,1,2010-07-14,"RE: Dillon Cossey, ""Columbine wannabe""",Condawg,WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/cpc22/re_dillon_cossey_columbine_wannabe/,"A friend of mine recently told me the story of a local boy (of whom she is friends with the mother) who, a few years back, at the ripe age of 14, was arrested for plots of obliterating students in his school.

His name is Dillon Cossey. Here's the basic story...

He's a really big dude. Because of this, he was bullied at school. The school eventually called his mother, Michelle, and asked her to remove her son from the *(public)* school, because his presence there was not conducive to him nor the school itself.

His mother removed him. She had him schooled over the internet. He made friends with a kid named Lou Bennett. Lou and Dillon got together and boiled up a plot to take down the school. They had no means to do this, but they acquired floor plans and plotted out where they would place bombs to take it down. It was a sick fantasy, but it **was** just a fantasy; just two kids having their own weird kind of fun.

Well, one day they got in a fight. Lou went home and presented all of the plans to his father, exclaiming ""Look at what Dillon's been planning."" His father alerted the authorities and the next morning, Dillon was awoken by several police cars waiting to take him into custody.

My friend had been in school the planned day of the attack. She had an internship, and as such, left school at 12:00. As she prepared to leave, it went into full lock-down, with the school being surrounded by around 25 police cars and having helicopters flying overhead. Fox News even reported that a kid had been shot. (Big surprise, eh?)

None of the students (or *teachers*) were informed of the situation. Mass panic in the building. Eventually, my friend got out (and was allowed to pass by an officer who chalked her up as no threat (mind you, even the officers had no idea what was happening inside, at all)). 

So, jumping back to Dillon. He was arrested and sent to juvie until he's 21. This was two years ago, and he was 14 at the time. The judge told his (incredibly religious) mother that it was a ""devious act of god that allowed [her] to bare children.""

The mother was also arrested for six months for having a weapon licensed in her name, although her husband was not allowed anywhere near guns. (She kept the handgun at a friend's house, in a safe. The judge was out to fuck this family over, and did so very effectively.)

The news outlets went nuts. Reports flew around, saying that aforementioned Lou Bennett was a ""hero"" for reporting Dillon to authorities, and that Dillon had planned a ""columbine-style shooting"" at the school, which was, of course, a complete fabrication, considering the fact that he had ""planned"" (in fairytale land) to blow it up, without any means whatsoever to carry out his plans. 

Some media outlets said that Michelle had purchased several guns for her son. Some even [quote her](http://www.weirduniverse.net/blog/comments/dillon_cossey/), saying that she purchased him a rifle to ""help his self-esteem,"" when she had never purchased a rifle, ever.  

Lou was met by George Bush in Philadelphia, to reward him for his ""heroic"" actions. Motherfucker got his hand shaken by the president.

Well, in the later months, this Lou kid robbed the fuck out of Dillon's vacant room. Stole his airsoft guns, his video games (of which he had a shit-ton), as well as other shit. He sold it at school. Eventually he got caught, at which point George W. Bush looked like even *more* of a dumbass.

But he never got busted or even got recognized as a kid who helped plan the ""attack"" that Dillon got buttfucked for. Media outlets completely blew the story wide open with outright fabrications and nothing but lies. This has made me even more aware of how fucked up the media in this fucking country is, as well as the judicial system. I'm not going to defend Dillon; I feel that his punishment was far too severe for actions that he *hadn't* done or actually planned on **actually** doing, but they did completely fuck over his mother (who is, from what I hear, one of the nicest women you'll ever meet).

So, if you've heard about this story (it was apparently hugely talked about everywhere, but I hadn't heard of it at the time), be informed that everything you've heard is complete and utter bullshit. No story I've read even mentions bombs; they try to make an advantage of him by saying that he wanted to impersonate the Columbine shooters, when this is incredibly and utterly false."
cplg8,0,2010-07-14,This is why you shouldn't work at home,rileyatreddit,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/cplg8/this_is_why_you_shouldnt_work_at_home/,"Hi reddit. Long time reader first time poster.

I am a CS major, and since it's summertime, I am working as an intern for an educational research group at my local university. Specifically, I am working on building a virtual campus in Second Life for them. They also hired two co workers: one who is a very good coder, Paul, and an upcoming freshmen, Chris. Finally, there is our supervisor, Samantha. She is for the most part a ""hands off supervisor"". She gives us broad goals, and we come up with and build specific things. It doesn't matter how we get things completed, so long as we're making progress.

Chris has no programming experience, and sometimes feels a little overwhelmed because the scripting language can get complicated, and we're always scripting. So I let him borrow an intro to java textbook I got during my freshmen year, and have been nagging him to read through it

Lately, I have taken to just work at home. It's completely fine with my supervisor, and she even suggested it to me, but I still feel a little guilty not taking the commute in everyday, while Paul and Chris sit in the office

Today was going well until a few hours in, when I these messages in Second Life from Samantha:

Note: We all have ridiculous usernames, but I changed them as well.

[10:38] Gabe Dao: sure

[10:38] Peter Uyiza: ok

[10:38] Peter Uyiza: keep up the good work. hope to see you tomorrow.

[10:41] Gabe Dao: ok

[10:41] Peter Uyiza: i need to go. see you tomorrow

[10:42] Gabe Dao: bye


The whole conversation was really weird. 15 minutes later, I get a message from Chris, about how Samantha is all mad that he's wasting time reading up on java. Apparently it was my fault, in some way. So I get ready to drive down to the office and resolve this, when I get an email from Paul titled: A Lovely Conversation. And it struck me.

Paul had access to Samantha's account.

And I was going to bring in cookies for a birthday party that didn't exist.

crudi,28,2010-07-20,Who is Jennifer Soares?,Prop19Warrior,prop19,https://www.reddit.com/r/prop19/comments/crudi/who_is_jennifer_soares/,"A line of argument I have seen gaining more traction over the last few days is being peddled by an attorney named Jennifer Soares.  Her arguments can be found on many of the No on 19 blogs and repeated in many comment sections even here on reddit.  Here are a couple of examples...

http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/06/05/Why-You-Should-Vote-YES-California-Control-Tax-Cannabis-Initiative#comment-29899

http://votetaxcannabis2010.blogspot.com/2010/07/why-pro-pot-activists-oppose-2010-tax.html?showComment=1279437960986#c3869748808779970903

Here is her being referenced in our comments: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/cpwp7/have_you_been_wondering_exactly_how_theyre_going/c0ukytl

I want to be clear that I think she is entitled to her opinion.  Everyone is and as a lawyer of course she can offer her opinion as a lawyer.  However, I want people to understand who she is and her background before running around and citing her as an expert.

The first thing to know about Ms. Soares is her background.  First, she graduated law school from *University of the Pacific* in 2009.  That's not a typo, she graduated law school last year.  She attended undergrad from 2002 - 2005 at UCal Davis.  The math on that is correct as well, she finished her BA in 3.3 years.  A point she seems to be very proud of.  

Before graduating she was an intern in the public defenders office.  

Why does her background matter?  Because she is offering opinions of legal theory and future interpretations.  She gets very defensive if you challenge her credentials and says things like...

""I simply claimed that 3 years of schooling and 8 months of practice gave me ample time to see the effect of prohibition and poorly written laws in the judicial system.""

I disagree.  The judicial decisions that matter are going to happen on an appellate level, not the trial court level.  She is not an appellate lawyer, she is a trial court lawyer.  

The second thing that is important to know about Ms. Soares is what she does now.  Currently according to her LinkedIn page she is working for herself.  Her line of work is medical marijuana.  Some items from LinkedIn:

-Law office specializing in medical cannabis and criminal defense representation.
""
Medical cannabis representation:
- drafting and filing corporation documents
- act as agent for service processes as well as agent for neighborhood complaints as required by many city ordinances
- draft, file, and represent clients in obtaining seller's permits, business licenses, and board of equalization permits
- represent clients during lease and/or employment negotiations
- representation of patients fighting city and/or county ordinances that limit access to medication
- legal training for employees of collectives/dispensaries
- mock raid training""

This screams conflict of interest.  If Prop 19 passes her business will be impacted.  With real legalization, many if not most of the people using the medical marijuana system in Cali will stop.  This means less need for her services.  

[LinkedIn Screencap](http://i.imgur.com/RpTrb.png)

tldr: Jennifer Soares is neither experienced nor objective enough for people to take seriously.  Stop feeding the troll who just wants to keep her payday coming.

**Edit 1:** You may also notice from her LinkedIn page that she is ""Chief Legal Counsel"" for VibeNation Multimedia.  A quick look into them shows the owner is Susan Soares.  Either that's a remarkable coinciedence or their is some nepotism going on.

Also, here is the website for vibenation media... http://www.vibenationmultimedia.com/

**Edit 2:** [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/prop19/comments/crudi/who_is_jennifer_soares/c0urww0) is a comment from someone who says they went to school with her, along with their opinions on prop 19.

She's been gone all summer visiting her brother and working on an internship, while I've been here trying to renovate the house and renovate myself before she gets back.    Here's the rub:  

I'm 5'11""-6' tall (depending on who's measuring,) I weigh (as of this afternoon,) 153.5lbs., and my body fat percentage is around 15.5% according to my Weight Watchers ConAIR scale (I'm not doing Weight Watchers, but it seemed like the best scale, unless anyone has any other suggestions - which I'm completely open to.)  If my scale is to be believed, I've lost somewhere around 14lbs. since the beginning of the summer, mainly through going to the gym at least three times a week, cycling, running, and eating less overall (summer has that effect on me.)  

I've also been a martial arts instructor (I have a black belt, but I haven't taught in a while,) and I used to skateboard religiously back in the day, so I've always kept fairly fit, or at least tried to.  As of recent I've worked up to running a full 5k at a time, usually in about 25 minutes or so.  I do body weight exercises (pull-ups, chin-ups, dips, etc.,) as well as squats and a few other things depending what I want to do.  Blah blah blah, here's my question:  

If I'm looking to drop to about or slightly below 10% body fat in the next three weeks, what's the best way to go about doing so, if it's even realistically possible?  Depending on my body fat percentage daily, that means anywhere from about 8-10lbs of fat that needs to be lost.  I should mention that I try and keep abreast of fitness literature, read /r/fitness daily, etc. as much as possible and so I know there is a difference between weight loss and fat loss, so I'm trying to approach this from all sides.  I also know that this is - given that the stars align - fairly realistic if I commit to it.  

So, what's the best way to do this?  Low carb/ketosis seems to be the most obvious choice, but I'm open to all options.  Should I up my 5k runs from three times daily to five or so times a week, while keeping my weight training at three days a week?  I'm fairly well built  (at least to where I'm happy,) so cutting I guess would be priority number one, I suppose.  

The best advice will be strictly adhered to, and I will update weekly (every Friday until the 13th, when she gets back.)

Give me your best, /r/fittit, and thanks for reading this rambling.  

**TL;DR** I'm 5'11""-6', weigh 153.5 and have a body fat percentage of around 15.5% (if my scale is to be believed.)  How do I cut down to 10% or less body fat in three weeks?  This means losing roughly 8-10lbs.

**EDIT:** I am not dead set on losing this exact amount, etc.  I just want to know what I could/should do in the next three or so weeks to get closer to that goal.  Some pictures were also added [here](http://i.imgur.com/qCCfn.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/VnVWo.jpg).  

Also, the low/no carb/ketosis route seems to be the most likely way - thus far - to do this.  With that in mind, I need an exit strategy.  How do I go from two to three weeks of this regimen back to maintenance (for example,) without yo-yoing back to where I am now?  Any advice is greatly appreciated."

Yet, there was no way I could walk out the door in shorts. I was deformed. Hideous. The masses would recoil in fear at the sight of my gnawed legs.

Bed bugs.



Until somewhere around the 20th bite, I was unaware that bed bugs actually existed outside of the common mantra for tucking children in at night:

""Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite!""

I'd like to know: what sick person decided that this was an appropriate part of their child's night time routine?

""Good night, sleep tight, don't let the flesh-shredding, blood-sucking parasites that are crawling all over your mattress latch onto that vulnerable, snoring bag of hemoglobin, otherwise known as your body, tonight!""

Scratching yet?

I was. My nightly routine as an intern was to come back to Brooklyn after a long workday, sweating through my jeans, strip naked in the bathroom and scratch like a flea-ridden mutt for twenty minutes while sobbing incoherently over the phone to Andrew about how I'd just have to sleep in the tub tonight because rubber-banding my socks over my pants and sleeping on an air mattress sealed with a plastic zipper bag in the middle of the kitchen was still no defense against these thirsty. mother. fucking. bugs.

The two girls who subleased the apartment to my roommates and me bragged about how they'd gotten all of their furnishings at a great price: For free! From the oh-so-sterile curbs of our Brooklyn neighborhood!

""You'd be amazed at what people throw out!"" they gushed after we'd already paid and signed on the dotted line.

'Amazed' wasn't the adjective I had in mind as I piled my entire wardrobe into the dryer to burn off any existing parasites before storing it all in garbage bags, which I would live out of for the remainder of my summer internship.

It hadn't taken more than one or two Google searches to find out that the apartment contained bed bugs.

During my search, I learned of the mind-fuckingly disturbing characteristics of the bed bug.

Here are some fun facts:

1. Bed bugs typically live in--you guessed it--BEDS!, but also infiltrate other furniture.
2. They feast on blood, first anesthetizing their victims with their spit, then sucking out life juice to their hearts' content.
3. They are dark red/ brown in color because they're full of your blood.
4. They communicate to other bedbugs through the use of pheromones: ""Hey guys, this twit passed out drunk and won't be waking for another 12 hours! Open bar to raid! Dibs on the aorta!""
5. When temperatures are colder, some bedbugs can survive for up to a year without eating. A year. I can't survive for more than 2 hours without tossing food to my gullet monster.
6. Bed bugs molt out of their skin at least 6 times before reaching fertile adult hood. Fucking. Sick.
7. Shells of their bodies, as well as their iron-laden blood poop, sink into your mattress, creating a visible brown line on the side: one of the clearest indications of infestation...aside from tiny blood smears on your sheets...yum.
8. Male bedbugs impregnate female bedbugs NOT by gentle woo'ing and tender love-making, but rather by stabbing them in the torso with razor sharp genitalia and depositing semen. ""You want kids? I'll give you kids... Ahhhhhhh! I. AM. SPARTACUUUUUUS!""
9. There has been a resurgence of bedbugs in NYC since gene mutations promoted the flourishing of pesticide-resistant bedbugs. This means that many can survive a bath of toxic chemicals as though it was nothing more than an aggressive facial.
10. One of the only surefire ways to kill bedbugs is to expose them to heat that's 115°F for no shorter than 7 minutes. (Aka--putting your clothes in the dryer...hence living out of sealed garbage bags.)
11. Because of international travelers from countries with less-expansive health department regulations, these little creatures are often stowaways and are making increasing visits to many Big City, USA hotels. They only ever come with one-way tickets.

In summary, bed bugs are hideous, opportunistic, impermeable assholes that make it their business to feast on the most vulnerable subjects: sleeping humans. And there's not a whole lot you can do to stop them.

That's how the psychosis sets in. By the 3rd month of being feasted on every night and waking up every morning with 20 new bites, I was losing my mind. The exterminators had been in an out with no results, pest bombs had no effect, I had spent weeks obsessively drying my clothes and thereby only having a handful that still fit, and Andrew had begun, weeks prior, to expect a phone call around the same time every day from his hyperventilating girlfriend. My body was riddled with old bite wounds and new bite marks. My legs were so ravaged, it took the better part of a year for the scars to fade.

The bedbug: a tiny creature with the immense capability of upsetting some primal balance within. It's a humbling and downright fucking miserable experience. I was lucky to escape the situation in one piece (minus a few hundred flesh nibblets), but it's instilled in me a paranoia of hotel floors, old mattresses and any piece of furniture salvaged from the curb.

cte2k,7,2010-07-24,I am bisexual. Now what do I do about it?,random_gay_guy,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/cte2k/i_am_bisexual_now_what_do_i_do_about_it/,"Hello everybody. I have a throwaway account here. Lets get a few things out. 23 male.

I think my parents would be ok with me coming out. When I was 16 my dad gave me a talk about how one of his friends was gay and did not come out untill he was 30 and it ruined his life. Never had any other conversations about it with him.

Anyway, I've been a severe closet case. I really enjoy thinking about guys and girls. I realized a few weeks ago that I am indeed bisexual. I've always been effeminate. Sex with girls is great, but I've noticed I lust for intelligence within men. Does anyone else feel this way?

Anyway, I attend a university and I'm afriad that my coming out would negatily affect how people treat me. I'm in an engineering dicipline program in a smaller community. Also I graduate next year. I have an internship and I'm also concerned how I should approach this situation. It's a smaller town (20,000 people or so) and word gets around here. I'm not ashamed of who I am anymore, which is something that has made me feel better than ever. 

Are my fears unfounded? 

Thanks in advance!"
ctt90,47,2010-07-26,A potential employer asked me what Linux distribution I liked most...,tori_k,linux,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/ctt90/a_potential_employer_asked_me_what_linux/,"I am dressed sharply, my arms forcibly relaxed at my side. I take a deep breath as the nerdy recruiter skims over my resume. I'm standing in a gym of my university for a career fair, hoping to get an internship for the summer.

He purses his lips to the side. ""I see here you know a little about Linux. What's your preferred distribution?""

""That's a tough decision, really. I've tried Slackware, openSUSE, different flavors of Debian and Ubuntu."" I scratch my freshly-shaven chin. ""Of all of them, I would definitely say I prefer Ubuntu. The ease of setup and out-of-the-box functionality allows me to focus on more important things, like working on my projects.""

His jaw twitches. ""Okay. Thanks for the resume and your interest. We'll give you a call later on.""

He smiles; I smile. I shake his hand, and walk away.

Six months later and no phone calls. I accept an internship with a different company, developing a web application for IE6, using ActiveX to connect to an Access DB client-side.To a point, I'm unhappy.

If a potential employer asks what your favorite Linux distribution is, should you be worried?

**TL;DR:**

Recruiter: ""Favorite Linux?""

Me: ""Ubuntu.""

Recruiter: ""Have a nice day.""

Did I do something wrong?

**EDIT:** Great response from [corpsemcgee](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/ctt90/a_potential_employer_asked_me_what_linux/c0v7tn4). His post is hidden underneath the weight of jigglebilly's sinking comment."
cuoux,1,2010-07-28,"I'm stuck with a gym inadequately equipped for squats, deadlifts and power cleans until October... should I follow the weight machine program they gave me or try alternative free weight exercises?",Mordisquitos,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/cuoux/im_stuck_with_a_gym_inadequately_equipped_for/,"Long story short, I'm slightly overweight (1.75 m, 85 kg / 5 ft 9 in, 187 pounds) but not too unfit. I'm doing a summer internship in a different city and I joined the gym just below my workplace for convenience. The trainers gave me a pretty vanilla program, mostly consisting of Nautilus-style machines and some cardio to improve my general fitness.

However, that was before I decided to do free weights following the Starting Strength beginners program.

Now I've decided to do free weights, you could say I'm appalled at the weights section: there's no rack (only a Smith machine), no platform, no bumper plates, no standard height plates... and hardly enough floor space to do anything outside of a bench or the Smith machine. There's even a sign saying _""Please do not move the benches""_, so making some room would, in principle, be out of the question.

I'm certainly going to check out other gyms in the area but from what I've seen I very much doubt they'll be any better.

Anyway, it seems like if I don't find a gym with a decent weights section, my options are:

+ Continue the machine program they gave me until the end of September and join a decent gym when I get home. At least I'll lose some weight.

+ Start a weird version of Starting Strength with no proper squat or power clean, and probably no deadlift either. Can I replace these with dumbbell variations? Is _starting_ squats with a Smith Machine worse than doing no squats at all?

Just for the record, buying my own equipment is out of the question for the time being.

Thanks for the attention! If you would like any more details don't hesitate to ask."
