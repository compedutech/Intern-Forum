12hgkp,27,2012-11-01,90 Days and I am starting to like my self :),tmag14,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/12hgkp/90_days_and_i_am_starting_to_like_my_self/,"Just got 90 days for the second time, but this time is much different.  I wanted to share a bit of my story to those who are new or struggling.

Grew up in a very privileged family outside Philadelphia (but in NJ) with non-alcoholic parents who were high achieving but mentally ill (depression, anxiety).  I received those genes along with the pre-disposition to addiction that runs in my fathers side of the family.  From about age 11-20 I suffered from severe social anxiety and depression.  I didn’t drink that much during high school but I loved drinking because it made me forget about how depressed I was and my anxiety went away.  Beginning of college consisted of blackouts and vomiting along with waking up the next day wondering what I did last night, and a life revolving around partying.  Each time I woke up after blacking out or embarrassing myself I would get so anxious about what I did that it just increased the amount of anxiety I had along with the depression.

  Eventually I started realizing I should avoid drinking so much.  So I decided to start commuting to college and I worked on political campaign.  I still partied but just not as much.  The successful campaign increased my confidence a lot, and kept me away from the college parties but it also gave me some opportunities to drink with staff and politicians.  Somehow I managed to never embarrass myself.  

Next I studied abroad in the Netherlands.  In hindsight this was a 6 month bender.  My parents gave me a lot of money to spend so I found a group of expats who were hard partiers.  We would party 4-5 nights a week.  I loved it because I was of age in the NL to drink and of course the bars/clubs would stay open until the sun comes up.  Also being able to buy weed in shops was cool.  So during these 6 months I drank and drank and drank.  Somehow I never got arrested or anything, probably because there’s no laws against public consumption or public intoxication…and.. well.. there aren’t much police in Holland.  I also tried that famous Dutch ecstasy a few times.  After I left the NL I decided I would try to stop drinking for 30 days when I got back.  Only stayed sober a few days.  Next I went to intern in Washington for a Congressman.  Being back in America was weird, but it was alright because I had my best friend alcohol.  I had a fake ID and there’s plenty of free booze to go around in DC.  I missed a Congressional tour of the White House and interesting hearings due to hangovers.  I woke up once in downtown DC on a bench after a Thursday night spent clubbing.  Thought I definitely had a problem by then.  Looked up an AA meeting and almost got there but decided to turn around because “It was too much of a ghetto area to be white and wearing a suit in.”  so I kept drinking.  Get back to college drinking every weekend and eventually get arrested for public intoxication.  Then I proceeded to kick out the back window of the cop car window (and got maced) so I went to county jail for 16 hours until my parents bailed me out.  The cops must have loved me I was being a smart ass, calling them uneducated, saying I’m gonna call the ACLU, screaming for a lawyer and much more embarrassing stuff.  

Eventually I got sober and started going to AA meetings.  I was sober for 6 months and had a few AA friends.  However I was still miserable.  I hadn’t changed a thing besides stop drinking.  So I moved to Atlantic City for a summer internship.   Lost my whole AA network, and stop going to meetings.  Was working in a new casino and my office was on the gambling floor across from a bar.  I was jealous of everyone drinking and me being miserable and suicidal.  Inevitably I relapsed.  During my relapse I found out I wasn’t just an alcoholic but **I’m an addict whose drug of choice was alcohol**.  I found some Percocet’s and got high on them during my relapse.  These were never my drugs to use but I was high on them and had an epiphany where I was also an addict.

Eventually I got back to the rooms and now am a few weeks from turning 22 and am sober.  I started making big changes in my life.  My anxiety is a normal levels, my depression is lifting, and I am starting to like my self.  The people I hang out with, the food I eat, the activities I do.  Small things did the most for me.  I would make a chart on my wall at college on small goals to achieve that week.  I would usually do most of them and now I do all of them.  It feels good to accomplish stuff.  I’ve also repaired all my relationships with my family members.  I love my family now and it feels good to let them back in my life.  I’ve been making all the right moves towards getting a PhD in Political Science to become a professor.  I’m really thankful for arresting my addiction at such a young age.  I have my whole life ahead of me now.  I am also lucky to have been able to use so many resources that most don’t have (psychologist, psychiatrist, addiction counselor, AA network, sober uncle, rich family, and even a random redditor who helped more than she probably realizes).

Well I realized I wrote much more than intended.  **TL;DR:  Being sober but not changing anything is torture.**

I'm on loans now so the clock to either bury myself in debt, or end up with a decent education is ticking.

I have to pull my gpa up from a 2.3, and start looking for internships this summer.  No more procrastinating schoolwork.  It'll be the death of me.

MORE IMPORTANTLY, I need to learn to organize myself and stop being a slob.  I let my room get trashed, I dont pickup after myself except once a week (and while I do a good job of it, it's just not often enough to live well).

I need to keep my place clean and stay on top of my work.  I need to clean up my diet and start getting real valuable exercise.

My last long term relationship ended in a less than spectacular fashion when my gf at that time cheated on me. After breaking up with her, she took it upon herself to sleep with as many ""former"" friends as possible. I say former because I just feel there should be a grace period before you have sex or start a relationship with friends ex's and see how they feel about it first. In addition my parents marriage ended during my relationship with this girl due to infidelity. The only reason I bring this up is to portray a tad bit of my relationship history.

After this, being the kid I was(not saying I have grown up much), I felt that I could not trust anyone. I felt this way for a good year or two, where I just couldn't have a healthy relationship with any friends and couldn't even begin to think about a relationship.

While in college I ended up joining the national guard, going to basic training and what not. This really helped with some of my trust issues, because it forced me to depend on others and gave me a new lease on relationships in general.

Skip forward a few months and I meet my now gf. We hit it off quite well and began seeing each other. We got to know each other quite well and fell in love. After being together for a year and a half, we both graduates with our bachelors.

This is where things started being tested. Due to her major(elementary education) she continues on with her masters. For one semester(about 4 mos.) We were 4 hours apart. Not too bad and due to being in the guard I had to travel pretty close to where she was every month, so we saw each other a couple weekends a month during that time, between my traveling there and her coming to visit.
After those 4 months, we spent the summer together while she took online classes. This fall she began her internship as a teacher about an hour away and stays closer to there with her parents.

This is where the problem begins. August when the school year started, I was away for a month unable to visit due to annual training and state active duty immediately after. During planning she began to spend time with the other teachers to get to know them, going out to lunch, etc. During this time she meets another teacher, we will call him M. M and my gf share a lot of similar interests including playing tennis which they find out during these lunches. Which I think is great, my gf has some problems finding friends and I think it would be good for her to meet people that have similar interests and she is always looking for someone to play tennis with. I never had much skill in it. 

M and my gf start talking and decide to go play tennis one day. They play for a while one evening and afterwards decide to go for a drive and end up at the beach where they kiss, she cuts it short and they go on their seperate ways. My gf told me she in no way feels romantically about him and it was a mistake that just convinced her we are right together. This is what she told me.

The thing is I found out about this after basically forcing it out of her this past weekend. The kiss happened the end of August. Since I got back from state active duty the beginning of September I noticed something different in the way she was acting. Not the cheating vibe, I've gotten that one before. She seemed depressed and miserable. She said it was the internship and distance in our relationship, which I felt was understandable. LDRs are not easy by any means even if it is just an hour apart. Being the underemployed college graduate I am it is difficult to afford travelling more often than weekends.

My gf has said that since the kiss she has not hung out with him alone at all and does not talk to him unless it is in regards to school. Due to the trust issues I have trouble believing this, but at the same time she seems to be telling the truth or atleast most of it and seems genuinely sorry. 

What led to me basically forcing it out of her was when we went to a get together of the teachers at her school. She normally doesn't go to those sorts of things but it was a Friday night and we did not have much to do. When we got there, M was there and he was fairly inebriated. She introduced me to him. Keep in mind this was before I knew. Throughout the night she kept her space from him and did not really talk to him, but he was constantly talking to me and being what I felt was overly friendly. We do a couple shots together and it puts him over the edge and he starts ranting about how great my gf was and how lucky I was and went so far as to say he liked her.
I felt fairly uncomfortable after that and decided it was time for us to go and my gf agreed. This bothered me quite a bit just the way M acted about it. I asked my gf about him and whatnot. She seemed a little off, but that was it. I attributed it to just the shock of him acting like that.

That event kept bothering me for a few weeks so I decided to just have a sit down with the gf and talk about it, because it did bother me. It felt like she was hiding something during our conversation and eventually I got her to admit to what had happened. She said she felt guilty and was afraid to tell me because she didn't want to lose me. 
I'm still in shock about this happening. The thing that I think bothers me the most is that since she says it was only that one kiss and has since avoided him except in group settings, why wouldn't she tell me? In my mind she is not the type of person to lie or cheat. Before this I have never had any cause to question her honesty. Is it possible that due to my history of property breaking my trust, she felt I would leave her over one kiss that if she's being honest didn't mean anything and was just a stupid mistake.

And to give all of you an idea of where our relationship was prior to this, I had recently bought an engagement ring and planned to propose right around her masters graduation in December.

I guess the reason I am posting is just due to confusion. I have a lot of thoughts running through my head and have a lot of conflicting feelings. Any advice or thoughts are very much appreciated.

TLDR: GF of 2.5 years kissed another guy and hid it for a couple months. How do you get over it? Can you get over it?"

What I want to know about this field is:
What kind of jobs are out there, and what kind of degree is best suited for them?

What's the pay like?   What part of the world/country are they in?

How do you network in this field?  Companies tend to look for software developers at the job fairs I attend, not so much data mining enthusiasts.

Any tips as I go through my masters?  Anything you'd like to have focused on but didn't?  How do you go about finding internships in this area when you've just decided to pursue it?

12fxwh,0,2012-11-01,I hate...,tooyoungtoquit,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/12fxwh/i_hate/,"I hate that I feel like whenever I try to start a conversation with someone, they're already trying to end it.

I hate that I'm hurt over someone who doesn't care about me, who didn't try to understand me like I did them, who treated me very poorly, who doesn't miss me, who doesn't want to see me, and I can't get it out of my head, that I still can find ways to think about them that make me happy even though I yell at myself not to. That I only ever treated them with kindness, and eventually love, and what that generated in their mind was a picture as ugly as the one they came up with.

I hate that the last person I had feelings for wasn't entirely eradicated from my heart until the next one came along, making me feel fake, like it's some sort of space in my heart that demands occupation.

I hate that I spent my last 5 days off sleeping more than half the time. That I'd get up, know I had nothing immediate to do, and so I went back to bed. 

I hate that, all my life, I never got invited anywhere, I'd always have to ask, so much that I ended up feeling unwanted, like I was imposing, and when I let it go, no one came to get me. 

I hate that I can't even muster up the motivation to watch a movie, or play a video game most of the time.

I hate that I'm either frantically trying to get something done, or killing time, waiting, for nothing.

I hate that I've fucked up my position in life, and that it's all my fault. I didn't put enough effort into classes, have gotten poor grades, and have none of that extra bullshit (internships etc) to prop up my resume. I feel an impending doom to 40 hours a week, 10-15 an hour if I even get anything. 

I hate that even when I get enough sleep I can't get myself up on time. 

I hate that I know what I want to do, more or less how to do it, tell myself to do it, and don't.

I hate that I don't treat the people in my family that do love me like I should.

I hate that I really have no reason for optimism. Even though my problems are all self-generated, for now I am completely provided for, I can't change. I want to, but I can't. I've already dug myself too big a hole to climb out of completely.

that I'm pretty sure if there were a ""don't exist anymore"" button in my room I'd probably push it within a few days. 

And a lot of other things, all of which probably just tie back to a few core issues."
12fup6,0,2012-10-31,Season 7 is terrible!,KosherNazi,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/12fup6/season_7_is_terrible/,"Alright, I just caught up on this season... what the hell is going on in the first few episodes?!  The writing is awful!

It's ridiculous that Deb is coping with this so well.  First she catches her brother murdering someone and freaks out.  Then she finds out he's a *mass* murderer and is just a little more perturbed.  I mean, seriously, within a couple days she's just decided ""oh *Dexter*, I need to keep an eye on you, mister!""  This feels like such a copout for the S6 cliffhanger, and completely unrealistic given Deb's character from every previous season.

And besides the grand story arc being ridiculous, the minor plot situations so far are unbelievable.  Dexter wheeling an unconscious guy through an airport?  Leading him down an employee hallway, and setting up his kill room in the middle of a baggage claim room, where there are clearly lots of people around?  In the middle of an airport where there are loads of cameras?

Or how about when Isaac kills the lab intern on Dexters boat -- it's broad daylight, with no cover whatsoever, and the head of a crime syndicate shoots the guy at end of a dock, where he's visible for hundreds of yards in every direction?

There's plenty more, but I think you guys see my point.  WTF is going on?  Are there new writers?  Everything seems so contrived and unbelievable, like i'm watching an episode of CSI: Miami instead of Dexter.

Episode 5 seemed slightly better, but there were still tons of terrible plot holes and unrealistic behaviour.  Please, someone convince me this show still has potential, and hasn't completely jumped the shark."

So to start off, a few disclaimers:

*1. We are High schoolers, not professionals or hobbyist with loads of free time (some people seem to forget that).

*2. We are creative, so some of our stuff is unusual.

*3. I am posting this tonight (10/31/2012) so people can ask questions and request specific information which I can than find out tomorrow (11/1/2012) during our meeting.

*4. I'll put pictures up of things ASAP tomorrow.

*5. I will try to speak in a way that reflects (mostly) everybody in our train club, but any comments made (unless otherwise specified) reflect my view of things.

*6. I like to go off on tangents, so bear with me please.

*7. I work on the design side of things, so post your questions about our trains and other rolling stock, and I’ll have our export on that answer whatever you want to know.

So let’s get things started!
**Basic information:**
Our high school is located in northwestern Wisconsin and claims (based off of minimal research, so please take it with a grain of salt or help us prove/disprove) that we are the only model train club in the country (it might not be true, but it sure sounds nice).  We go to 3 shows every year:
*Eau Claire, WI (Where we are from)
*Lacross, WI (my personal favorite)
*Menomonie, WI (my personal least favorite)
This year may be our last traveling year since we also have a permanent layout and want to get that finished (not that I care too much, I’ll be gone). The original intent was to have that open for viewing pleasure during basketball games and whatnot since we are located right above the gyms.
we have 13 members:
*8 Seniors (of which I rank)
*0 Juniors
*1 Sophomore 
*5 Freshman

(on a side note: We were really scared at the beginning of this year because we had 9 members and 8 of them are going to graduate at the end of the school year. Man, were we happy when so many Freshman walked into our door!)

Our supervisor is a wonderful person who teaches World Studies, so we tend to get a lot of history at our meetings.

(on another side note: As I said in the disclaimer, tend to do things more abnormally so here is an example. Every year, we have a theme. One year it was [disco]( http://imgur.com/Tf9am,cVbFC,8rsmk#0), and this year, we [chose the empire builders]( http://imgur.com/Tf9am,cVbFC,8rsmk#1). Basically, played around with our names to make it fit into a known dictator’s name, for example, my name is [Sam]( http://imgur.com/Tf9am,cVbFC,8rsmk#2). With permission, I may I may share some other people’s names, we had fun making them.)

Our club has little for expenses since we make a lot of stuff from scratch, but, as anybody into trains knows, even small things are VERY expensive. We are, luckily, self-funded by use of vending machines in our school that our founder had the foresight to apprehend early on. We also get surprisingly generous donations from people in the form of models and/or tools (for example, at the last train show we were at, some genalman came up and gave us a model (the name of the machine I just can’t seem to remember) that was probably worth around $40. I personally was dumbfounded by this man’s generosity).

Our traveling layout is in a suitcase model (pictures of which I will show tomorrow). When put together, it measures 10’ by 20’. There are 4 larger end modules owned by the school and worked on by our supervisor, and six smaller student-owned modules where we can do whatever. If, when a senior graduates, they have a module that they worked hard on, they are allowed to keep it and the club replaces it with a new module and gives a younger student a chance to make whatever they like. Our mascot is Tigger (from Winnie the Pooh). Our current list of layout themes is:
*Fingal North Dakota 
*Tigger Mountain
*One module is under complete reconstruction, so I don’t know yet (I’ll post pictures tomorrow).
*A turn table and farm
*A Beach Scene
*And… (my personal favorite, so drum roll please) …A Zombie Apocalypse Scene.

The one being reconstructed was previously Hiroshima Peace park, my personal project with a **Giant** flaw (but more on that later). I guess now would also be a good time to mention that we work in HO scale (1”:87’).
For materials, we use sculptamold as our main clay-like material. The majority of our stuff is built on a base of Styrofoam. We use dental plaster from time to time to make detailed stuff. We also stick build things out of pieces of wood that we have sitting around. My current project is something we like to call Tigger Mountain (and if a small child finds Tigger on Tigger Mountain, we give them a sucker).

I’ll quickly say one last thing about a question that is most likely plaguing a few of you… how do we recruit members when model railroading has a relatively negative stigma amongst teens? Well, it is not that hard actually. Many of the kids who seek the club out freshman year have Aspersers or some other obsession with trains. Others (like me) follow their friends into it. Some even join because they had siblings in the club. We do advertise for it though (around the school that is). We tend to use the catch line “it is 3D modeling and landscaping art with trains running through it”. We also tell the joke that train club is the only club in the school where you can say “please pass the alcohol,” (because we use rubbing alcohol when gluing things). We get people to stop by and respect us more for because of that. In fact, the 3D design is the reason I stayed. We have a saying in train club, whoever walks through our door will enter a world they never knew existed, and it exists in 1:87 scale.

Thank you for bearing with me for this long. I’m going to change the topic a little bit.


**History and Origin**
Our club was founded in 1985 (I think, but definitely sometime in the 80’s) by a teacher who is now retired (we still see him at train shows since he has his own VERY impressive layout). Him and a few students applied for club status and a personal room (back then, it was easier to get a room for a club). They got a room close to storage, so they also got our own storage zone. After they acquired the room, our founding clubbers then decided to build a permanent layout into the walls of their room (making it very difficult indeed to move or kick the club out). We have not worked on the permanent layout in quite some time (in fact, I’ve never worked on it) and it isn’t very far along yet. They also started a train museum for books and pictures that our club has acquired over time. That was damaged because of water leakage in the roof, but we still hold on to and add to the rich history we own. Sometime after (the approximate year I do not know) starting the permanent layout, a semi-permanent layout was built. It is on a large cart and could, I suppose, be moved elsewhere if necessary. It lies in our back corner and looks complete. We use it to test our digitracks system and cars between shows. After that is when the suitcase traveling layout was created and has been the focus of work ever since. Our original supervisor passed on the tradition found in our club down to our current supervisor and that is a basic history of the train club.

**A personal story**
Now I’ll tell my story, since you must still be reading to have gotten this far. I have a very special connection to train club, so I hope I can entertain you with the story.
Sophomore year, I had a class called World Studies with a friend who loves trains and planes. For the first month or two, the teach (supervisor of train club) and him kept prodding me to go to ‘one meeting’. I thought, like I presume most teenagers would/do think, that trains were rather boring and that I would never have fun. I did go though. When I got there, there was an open module and the teacher set me to work on designing something for it. Obviously I had to come back a few times in order to finish the order. The former model was a rather poorly made setup called “Nuclear Waste Sight in Winter” but it looked like a pond with frosting on it. I decided to replace it with a beautiful park zone model after the Hiroshima Peace Park (ground zero of the first atomic bomb used in war). I got to work by drawing diagrams, locating structures, etc. Basically measuring and mapping every inch of that park (I still have the diagrams somewhere today). I used Google Earth and its measure function to measure everything by hand and draw it on a piece of grid paper. We then tore up the old layout and started construction on the park. About halve way into it (after we had all the basic structures down like concrete, roads, and a river), disaster struck. More specifically, something I did very wrong. When I started the project (and had no clue about anything model train related), I asked our supervisor what scale to use. He said to use “one to eighty-seven”. I however took him to say “one-eighty-seven” or 1:187! As such, all my measurements were smaller than N-scale! Since we had already started, we tried to finish, but my will for the project was gone and seeing it just made me sad. We didn’t do much with it after that and it just sat around. Looking back, I find the whole thing rather humorous. And one great thing came out of it: the drawings. Because of train club (I like to think atleast), I was able to get an engineering internship job while still in high school. Those drawings provided wonderful examples of my love of drafting and my experience with applying it. Needless to say, I stayed in train club. Right now, I am tackling a project about our Tigger Mountain. It is the biggest mountain our club has ever built. The final goal is to have our trains running through it and have our Tigger plush mascot on a car being run on a timed circuit in and out of the mountain up above (it will make more sense in a picture, when I get them). Our only issue currently is how to make the timed circuit. We want him to move every 20-30 sec. or so than stop either inside the layout or on his ledge. If you have any recommendations on what to get or what to use, we’d love to hear your advice.

So for now, that is everything I have to say. If you have any questions, **Please** ask them and I will answer them to the best of my ability or find the person who can answer them.
I thank you for staying with this long, drawn out explanation and hope I didn’t bore you to death.

I'm in my last semester of college, and I've worked this internship since the beginning of summer that I've really enjoyed. The field is software/ web development for a small athletics company. I live in NYC and I'll be graduating in December with my degree in Computer Science from a well known private school in the area. 

I love my boss, the work isn't stressful at all, and we have a sick office right up the street from my apartment. The problem is that the offer they made me today is almost $20k under what I'd value myself at based on what career services at my university seems to think the market should offer me. 

I had a feeling this was gonna happen. I would love to stay and I really really don't feel like looking for another job, but that's a serious chunk of cash missing from my pocket. What do you guys think? Is there a smart way of bringing up all the concerns I just mentioned? 

I haven't brought it up with my friends because I hate comparing salaries-- I thought this would be a good starting place because it's mostly anonymous.

12fnjm,5,2012-10-31,Questions on job outlook and how to get started,ro1249,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/12fnjm/questions_on_job_outlook_and_how_to_get_started/,"Hey guys. I'm currently a sophomore in undergrad and studying at a University that has a pretty solid Accounting program. I've currently only taken two accounting courses (Principles of Financial and Managerial) but have done pretty well. While I believe the average is in the C range for both of these classes, I've gotten high A's in both. Not only did I do well in these courses, but I've actually enjoyed the material as well. While I understand that success in basic Accounting classes may not mean that I will do well in the more advanced Accounting classes, I still feel that Accounting is a good fit for me. With all that background set aside, I just have a few questions on outlook and how to get started. 

1. While money isn't everything, it still is very important to me. I want to be able to provide well for my future family. How does the compensation of an Accountant relate to other professions? I know that Partners can make a lot of money, but what about the average Accountant? Also, how are the hours? I know it can get crazy around tax season, but how is it in the offseason?

2. What should I be doing right now as a sophomore to set myself up to be a good candidate for Accounting jobs when I graduate? Is it too early to be seeking internships? Or should I just be focusing on my grades? I currently have a 3.85 GPA (4.0 Accounting GPA). 

3. What is the normal career track for an Accountant? Associate-Senior Associate-Manager-Partner? I hear a lot of people start out in Big 4 Firms and then leave after a few years. Is it beneficial to do that, or to stick around in hopes of becoming a Partner? 

Thanks for all the help in advance."
12iw3z,4,2012-11-02,Randomly broke into tears today... ,omgwtfbbqpanda,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12iw3z/randomly_broke_into_tears_today/,"So I don't often cry (save the times that I am watching a Disney movie, then I am pretty much guaranteed to) and today I randomly burst into tears after eating my lunch. I have no idea what triggered it but I think I know why it happened.

I have no idea what I am doing with my life anymore. I am about to turn 27, just got married two weeks ago (yay!), and I have no idea what I want to do for a career.

I was a high school science teacher for 2 years but I hated it so I left to pursue what I thought was my true dream. I got a job in zoo keeping. I did it for three months and realized that all the internships I did in that particular field glamorized the job. It really is a dead-end career with very little pay. Barely enough to survive on. I couldn't stand knowing that I would be in the same position for the next 20 years without any room for growth. So I left zoo keeping. 

Now I am a substitute teacher (because honestly that is all I have left). I have my bachelor's in biological sciences but I don't want to go into a medical or research field. I don't know what to do. 

My family wants me to go back to full-time teaching but those two years were some of the darkest times I've had in my entire life. I hated it and hated the person I had become while doing it. Subbing is still pretty bad but at least I can be in a different place every day. 

I have had thoughts of going back to school but I have no idea what to go study. And that costs quite a bit of money. 

Anyone else out there have no idea what you want to be when you grow up even though we are supposed to be grown ups already?

Thanks for listening TwoX, I always appreciate your help.

TL;DR - Broke into random tears today. Probably because I am 27 and don't know what I want to do when I grow up. "

I am currently a second year law student in Missouri, but I am seriously interested in breaking into the Montana legal market.  Big Sky country is beautiful and wide-open and I really love to be out west nearer to mountains and where it is less crowded than the cities in here in the Mid-West.

That being said, I don't know where to start.  Which cities would be the best to look in?  Obviously, the population centers like Billings and Missoula would be good starts, but any other suggestions would be more than welcome.  Also, what are the job prospects (both internships for this summer and full-time post-graduation) out there for out-of-the-region law students?  

As far as lifestyle and living go, what can the denizens of /r/Montana tell me?

I was thinking A game company was actually giving me a chance to show my potential and my ability as a programmer and developer. I have yet to get a job anywhere as an official software developer.  Didn't realize until much later that Epic and Epic Games were two different companies...

I mistook the company Epic in an email for the company Epic Games.

12l55y,0,2012-11-03,My friend told me she's cheating...,grey_poopon,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12l55y/my_friend_told_me_shes_cheating/,"Posting using a throwaway on the off chance someone can figure out who I am and figure out who I'm talking about (slim but crazier things have happened). I'm writing about this because I can't talk about this with anyone I know. 

So, I go out for drinks with a friend of mine. I haven't seen her in a while, she's in college, works part time, and has an internship. I'm friends with both her and her boyfriend, and they've been together for 7 years. They seem to love each other, and compliment each other well for the most part. My friend and I are talking about all the things going on with us (I'm going through my own stuff, but that's unrelated to this post). She starts talking about school and how she's close to graduating and such... and after a couple drinks she asks me if she can tell me a secret.

before I continue, I should be clear that **I am not going to get involved**. Their relationship is their business, not mine. 

Some side info that's relevant to this, my friend's mother has been dying for over 10 years. She has a brain degenerative disease that's like Alzheimers but attacks different areas of the brain. Her mom is currently in a facility that can take care of and manage her condition. She can't speak, she can't walk anymore, and her muscles are tensing against each other so her neck is contorted and forces her to press her chin against her chest constantly. My friend's father, and her maternal relatives have done nothing but bicker and refuse to take responsibility, so my friend has done all the legwork to see that her mother is cared for. She no longer speaks to her grandmother and aunt because they blame her father for what happened to her mom. Her father has had extreme difficulty dealing with the situation, and has spent much of it in denial (that she was going to get better). Since she entered the medical facility that now cares for her, he's gotten to a point of acceptance. He's now reconnecting with his first wife (my friend is from his second marriage), and is moving out of state to be with her. My friend has encouraged him to date, and to reconnect with her sister, but in all that she's done and had to deal with she feels abandoned by her family. 

Her boyfriend is a good person, but often acts like a kid. There was a time that she had to help support him, and she still takes care of him in a way. That's part of her nature, she likes to take care of people. Right now he's financially supporting her as she finishes up school, but because of their schedules they don't see each other often. When ever their sex life is brought up, she makes it sound like she's frigid. She grumbles about sex, while he laughs it off. Despite this they seem happy together... but there's always underlying issues.

My friend spends much of her time on the college campus, and a couple nights a week she goes out and has a few beers after class. Her man knows she's doing this, and they both trust each other. I should mention he has developed a close relationship with one of his female coworkers, and my friend is mostly ok with this. It was somehow during the past few months that she ended up making out with someone she goes to school with and hangs out with. 

The odds he will find out are low, the guy she's cheating with doesn't run in the same circles as they do, and knows to not call her. She feels guilty because she loves her BF and wants to be with him... but the problem is, she wants to feel desired, wanted, loved, and he doesn't make her feel that way. She is concerned that her BF is with her because she's there, like a convenience. She likes rough sex, (choking, dirty talk, surprise sex, etc), and he's more of the 'make love' type. She told me sex is fun with him, they laugh a lot, but it doesn't have the same flash and passion that she's had in the past and now misses. The guy she's messing with is very sweet and nice, but when given the go-ahead he's very aggressive. The kind of guy that will whisper in her ear in public vulgar things he wants to do to her later. He takes her with passion, and it's reminded her that she's a sexual being, and she doesn't want that to be over for her (she's only 32). She knows this is short term, and she wants to stay with her BF, and she knows how much this would hurt him if he found out. 

It's kinda nuts, finding out a couple your friends with is having such trouble. I told her to talk to him about her needs and wants more. She does that thing lots of people do in relationships: expect their partner to be a mind reader. After we went for drinks we met up with him, and it's obvious he has no idea. He's very traditional with how he sees relationships, opening it up probably wouldn't be an option for him, and he would see this cheating as a huge betrayal. Personally, I think she needs to be more forthcoming about her needs. Like, she gets upset with him when he asks her to do something naughty in public, not because she's against it but because she doesn't want him to ask, he wants him to just go for it. Most guys wouldn't do that even if they thought it was hot because that's a dick move, and he especially isn't going to do something like that. I think if she just has her fling and tries go to back to him the resentment will fester, and she will sabotage the relationship. 

So, that happened. I have never seen cheating from the inside, so it's an interesting perspective. I hope she talks to him, and I hope they can work it out... but I think if she continues eventually shit is going to hit the fan at some point, and I think she knows it too. 

Whats weird about this is I totally understand her reasoning. She's tried to talk to him here and there about being more rough and passionate towards her, but he's uncomfortable with it, and when he tries he doesn't do a good job (like loosely putting his hands on her collar bones for choking). I don't think she's laid it all out though before. 

I am not pro-cheating, but I understand what got her to this point. 

So yah, that's my rant. What are your experiences with cheating?"

12kfz7,7,2012-11-03,A little over 4 months in,Bearjew42,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12kfz7/a_little_over_4_months_in/,"Hey r/leaves,

I wanted to start this update by saying you're all fantastic, and I wish the best for all of you in making a change in your lives. Its been over 4 months now since I stopped smoking daily and things have been going great. Admittedly, I have smoked a few times since changing my life over the summer, but they were planned events reserved for special occasions like visiting old friends and listening to the entirety of Led Zeppelin II, or camping by a lake the weekend before fall semester started, or my birthday. 

Going into this unknown sobriety experiment over the summer, I wasn't totally sure if I could ever smoke again or was able to control my smoking if I decided to reserve it for special occasions. NOT saying the reserved smoking is a good technique, but it has worked for me without driving me back to using all the time. Those select times that I got high were a thousand times better than when I smoked everyday, and felt special again. That being said, sobriety has also been a great experience for me. I have an internship for school starting in a few weeks that involves a drug test and I'm not freaking out about how I will pass it, or needing to quit when I'm not mentally prepared to (exams and papers the next few weeks, had I decided to stop smoking now the sleeplessness would royally fuck up my ability to do work). 

I want to reassure anyone going through the first few days or weeks of sobriety and say it does get better. Sobriety becomes the new normal, and life becomes less mundane and boring without being high all the time. Like I said before, everyone is different. Some people aren't able to smoke on occasion without it becoming a daily habit, and those people know who they are because of how swiftly their weed smoking habits escalated when they were starting out. The reason I was confident in being able to smoke once a month or so was because I used to grow my own and quit shortly after harvesting this summer which meant I was sitting on 2 ounces of dank without the desire to smoke it. 

I want to thank you all for helping me figure out my sobriety and offer any support I can for you all. I hope the best for everyone out there in the /r/leaves community and wish you all a great weekend :)

12k2ci,139,2012-11-03,65 days fap free and I'm starting to ask women out!,tuckedinthecut,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/12k2ci/65_days_fap_free_and_im_starting_to_ask_women_out/,"I first discovered NoFap ~215 days ago.  My first 90 day attempt I got to around 60 days and failed miserably....in retrospect I attribute my shortcomings to my misunderstanding regarding the flatline period.  I got impatient and needed to see ""if it still worked"" (duh, of course it does!)

I'm now at day 65 again and I've gotten past the major flatline period.  In the last 4 days I've gotten 3 girls phone numbers' and am talking to several more on dating sites.  I've been aware for a while now that I'm a handsome young man with a good head on his shoulders but due to fapping and constant self-doubt that accompanies it I've been ""hiding"" myself from the opposite sex.  

I'm 23 going on 24 soon and NoFap has helped me turn my life around in so many ways.  Looking back I've done a lot in these last 65 days besides talking to women -- I'm enrolled in a new degree program, a new internship, I pay more attention to how I dress and groom, and I've noticed more gains in my exercise.  I also smoke weed less and have more control over my impulses in general.

Tonight I was at a friend's birthday party and met a woman who was a mutual acquaintance.  While we were talking another random guy butted in trying to get her to take shots and dance.  While before this would have psyched me out it didn't even phase me because I *knew* that this random dude did not have the cajones to be doing what I am doing with my fapstinence.  I ended up getting the girls number and by the end of the night she was reciprocating physical contact with me, something I've never really experienced before :).  I'm not even really concerned about whether this will blossom into a relationship or not.  I'm just happy it felt so natural to be flirting.

There have been terrible days and great days with NoFap but it all evens out in the end.  Trust me when I say it's the little successes that will get you through to the end.  I want to thank you NoFappers for getting me on the right track.  Now when I talk to women, they want to talk to me!

TL;DR - Was terrified of women, now I'm asking them out left and right, and they all appear to enjoy it :)"

At the time, I had finished painting a large-scale mural in my apartment that I copied from a Fornasetti image of an eye that I had found on a post card. (C) LOVED that mural!

Leading up to Christmas, (C) was excited b/c over the holiday break, she was flying across the country to interview for an internship in Washington DC. The last night we were in town together before leaving for break, I slept overnight with her. She woke up early to take an 8am final while I was able to sleep in a bit longer. Well after she left, I woke up to take a shower. As I was drying off, I noticed her day planner/calender (pre-smartphone era) laying on the floor, open to the December calender. She had the date that she was flying out to DC ""for her interview"" encircled with a heart in pink highlighter. In that heart and on that date, her handwriting was painfully obvious as she had written, ""Going to see my (A)""...all complete with a heart-pointed exclamation mark!

That heart-sink, nauseating feel that you get... I was crushed!

You know how you have memory-associations with certain songs? When I hear 'Brick' (Ben Folds Five), it's of me standing in a towel in her room staring at that damn day planner.

Anyway, I then picked up the day planner and flipped through it for further confirmation. There really weren't any more clues except for when I flipped back to the address book. There was only one (A) and it was the only entry with a DC-area address... I wrote it down, got dressed, and left. I knew it was over. I had to tell her. However, I didn't want the confrontation to get into a ""You snooped through my personal stuff-red herring"". 

I met up with her later in the day for coffee. In our conversation, I got around and asked her if there was anybody else in the picture. She quickly rejected the notion, maintaining that I was the only guy she's seeing. I told her that I accepted that. She then asked me if I'd take her to the airport the following day. In my head, I thought, ""you cruel, heartless bitch."" However, I kept my knowledge ace up my sleeve... I didn't say anything about what I knew. I took her to the airport the next day. Kissed her goodbye and wished her luck in her interview. I theoretically hand-delivered her to ""the other guy"".

I drove away from the airport sick. I felt like Woody Harrelson's character in 'Indecent Proposal'. I was down...

...but I wasn't out!

I took that postcard - the one of the Fornasetti eye - the one that I copied identically for the mural in my apartment that (C) loved... On the back, I wrote, ""Merry Christmas, Bean (my pet name for (C))!"" I didn't sign my name, but (C) knows very well - my distinct handwriting and that distinct image on the front of that card. I then addressed it to her at her 'boyfriend's' address outside of Washington DC and then put a stamp on it.

I did not drop it in the mailbox... yet. First, I put a sticky note on the card that simply read, ""Please put in out-going mail"". I then put the sticky note-posted card in an envelope and addressed that to the local postmaster of that DC suburb zip code.

Several days later, while at her other boyfriend's across the country, she received that card w/ a local postmark."
12jxtq,1,2012-11-03,After working at my internship for 2 years and getting paid it feels daunting to do school work,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/12jxtq/after_working_at_my_internship_for_2_years_and/,"Ever since I started working my technical internship (programming) early my junior year during college, I've been unable to focus on my schoolwork. When I sit down to do programming for class I feel like I could be getting paid for it. Not mention, the stuff I'm doing in my internship is much more interesting than the projects or homeworks. I graduate in 1 month (hopefully) anyway. Double major in math. It's been rough 4 years to say the least. I got into some trouble freshman year and got kicked out of my dorm/school, quickly transferred right after the incident to a better school and dominated my sophomore and junior years. School was cake. Now, however, I'm plagued by even the thought of getting started and I wait til the last minute to start. I'm producing crap but still passing ±0.5 of the std. dev. so I'm not too worried, just tired of school. I've gotten some full-time offers but have yet to accept anything. Some offers are too far but pay well (80k) while others are close and pay average (60k). I want a lot of stuff so naturally the more the better.  "
12mwpr,9,2012-11-04,[25/m] I don't know what to do with my gf [21/f],[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12mwpr/25m_i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_gf_21f/,"I have no idea what my next step should be and I feel so alone. I'll try my best to stay nonpartisan because I truly could use some advice right now. I'm sorry if this is long winded but I could really truly use some help right now.

Ok, so my relationship with my girlfriend of almost 5 years (lived together for 4) has been a bit stressful because we both are on completely opposite schedules. I work full time 2nd shift with wed/thurs off and she goes to school and works part time with weekends off. She has to go to bed early, I stay up til 4am.. different days off, etc. Anyways, she started this internship a few months ago and ever since then, she has developed a very close relationship with 3 guys. I had a lot of trust in her so although I was sort of uncomfortable with her always hanging out with them, texting, calling, skyping, etc with them, I just reassured myself that I had trust in her and it was fine. Tuesday night she was supposed to travel about an hour away to her mom's to have a girl's night with her mom and her sister together which I thought was great since they don't spend time together very often.

I then find out the next day from her sister that this didn't happen at all. Upon asking my gf about it, she first tried playing like she had no idea what I was talking about. Eventually she told me the story though. What actually happened was she went to her job, picked up her 3 friends, went out to eat, went back to their place, got drunk, and fell asleep on the guy's couch. All of this she planned on completely hiding from me.

My world was shaken and I primarily felt like a fool for putting so much trust in her. She then tried hiding the fact that the trip was pre-planned a few days ahead of time and said it was just a ""spur the moment"" thing which it wasn't. This alone really hurts because it meant she had already planned on hiding this from me days ahead of time.

Fast forward almost a week and I'm having ups and downs because I feel really sad about it and she just acts like nothing happened and wants me to get over it. I'm upset and want her to at least not text message them so much (1 guy in particular) until I can feel a little more secure about it but she refuses to stop. I'm not trying to control her or anything but I feel that she should be understanding that she just lied and really messed up my trust in her. I hate how nonchalant she's being about it all and acting as if she doesn't care about the pain I'm going through, or just looking like she's tired of it already. It's making me feel like I'm all alone right now and like she could care less.

I have a really good friend that's offered to let me stay with him and I'm debating on whether or not this is something I should end the relationship because of. It's not just this, there's plenty more but we'll end it here since this is so long already.

Thank you ahead of time for any and all help.

**TL;DR: Should I leave my gf for completely breaking my trust or am I just overreacting? She makes me feel like I'm crazy for feeling this way and sometimes I actually am honestly not sure if maybe I am in fact just crazy or stupid for feeling so sad and alone.**

edit: I suppose I want to know if i'm overreacting with how I'm feeling because she maintains that she's sorry, but didn't really do anything wrong. I grew up in a VERY abusive home so I struggle with how a functioning relationship works. I also don't know if I'm putting up with her abuse because of all that I've been through, or if most people go through it. Not to mention because of all the abuse, I know I'm ""damaged goods"" and have weird quirks, mostly just regarding not knowing how other functioning relationships work."
12mdib,2,2012-11-04,boyfriend [23M] is facing depression and wants space.,notsofancyy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12mdib/boyfriend_23m_is_facing_depression_and_wants_space/,"I'm 20F. We've been going out for almost a year now. We have done long distance for pretty much the whole time we've been going out. we knew each other for about 4 months before we started going out, and were not long distance at the time. The distance ranges from 1.5 hours away, to 3 timezones away. We've always had multiple fights because of stupid things, but to be honest, there are still problems that we still need to solve.

Recently I told him that I may be taking on another internship next summer that will make us again 3 time zones away.  Building up on all of this, he told me a few months ago that he is facing a personal problem. I never really asked him about what it was initially because I was probably distracted or he seemed happy at the time. 

Recently he told me that I ignored 2 chances to have him open up to me about this problem (which I was surprised about.. so I admit I was being careless and didnt see it), and now he's decided he wants to handle the problem on his own, but because of this, he wants space. He told me that the problem is not related to me. He told me it hurts him that I am putting so much effort in maintaining everything, because lately he's been doing opposite - just doesn't feel like dealing with (more) problems. He told me I am the person that he would want to be with in the future, but right now, theres just so many obstacles. He cannot properly take care of me (or be there for me) anymore, and claims that he might not be able to go back to normal for a long time. And because of that, he was open to breaking up or 'taking a break' (whatever the term is).

But we didn't really talk about the conditions of this break. I was sort of just speechless and left, and because we are long distance right now, I wouldn't have the chance to see him in person for a week or so.

What ended up happening throughout the 2 weeks after this incident is that he would initiate messages that brought up normal things, and of course I would grab on to the opportunity to talk to him. And after awhile of talking, I would end up talking about our relationship or worrying about his condition, and he would claim that I'm being persistent (even though he initiated). He even told me he recently considered suicide, but those thoughts would stop when he thought about me. 

He has not talked about his problem to anyone, so I'm worried about him. He told me that even if I knew, I would just be more worried about him and it wouldn't make a difference. I'm baffled by that, because I know that if he told me, I'd support him and give him advice (if needed). 

Eventually I asked if I could see him on the weekend (aka. this weekend), which he agreed to. But 2 days later he calls and tells me it's probably not a good idea. So of course, my hopes were brought up and broken down. Despite this, I still tried to see him this weekend. He still refuses and I seem to have really bad timing because hes always going to a friend's house to study and won't tell me the location (so I can never find him at his house). He seems to feel that seeing each other in person will not make him feel better right now even if I dont bring up our relationship or his problems, yet he enjoys our normal phone conversations that we've been having from time to time (really ridiculous and bothersome to me, because we have been LDR for a long time). 

We were always the type to claim that we don't want to talk to each other for a long time, but end up back together again within a day. 

Many of you probably think that we should just break up, that I'm wasting my efforts and time because who knows how long he will take to act normal again. I have also told myself that I can just forget about him and break up with him, but I just can't bring myself to do such a thing. And I'm not the type to get depressed about these things for days on end. I get really occupied with work and friends, but at the end of the day, I think about him. I guess I just really want some closure (from him) in person, but at the same time, I want to continue the relationship and help him in whatever way I can. 

Sorry for the rambling and I dont know if I made much sense. So reddit, what should I do? I was planning to drive to his house today before I leave the city, but I don't think he'll be there.

**TLDR - My boyfriend wants space but did not define how long. I may have to wait a long time for things to go back to normal.**

12m2xk,1,2012-11-04,"Wife is asking for a divorce, I partially agree; how do I salvage my relationship?",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/12m2xk/wife_is_asking_for_a_divorce_i_partially_agree/,"WARNING! SUPER LONG AND LOTS OF INFORMATION!

My wife and I have been best friends for a long time, and earlier this year we began dating. Things moved pretty quickly, and about a month ago we eloped, which we have both decided we weren't ready for. She felt almost right afterward that it was wrong, because now she had to lie to her family and mine about our relationship status, and she hates lying; it goes against her character.

Before I go any further, it's important that I note that I'm in the Army and currently stationed two hours from where she lives. We used to see each other every weekend and talk as often as possible during the week. She's a grad student in her last semester to become a teacher, working full time and performing two internships while balancing time to work out in preparation for an upcoming Tough Mudder. She has a lot on her plate and I do my absolute best to be as supportive as possible, only ever voicing any concerns and never forbidding anything, I have never raised my voice, and honestly spending every penny I have on keeping her spirits up (I looked at my finances and I've only spent $200 on myself in the past three month).

I've known for a long time that she does not tolerate being lied to at all, due to some fairly awful past relationships, and I do my best to always tell her everything immediately so I can't get in trouble for lying by withholding information from her.

That said, a week or so before our marriage I began to get very stressed from work, it was almost a daily thing. I didn't tell her because it was just work related stress and I figured it'd go away eventually. I was wrong.

Two weeks after our elopement, I began to try to come to terms with the fact that I'd been raped when I was nine years old, and between bringing back 13 years of suppressed memories and my already stressful job, my mind snapped. I became depressed and aggressive almost overnight. Alone it was difficult to control, but around her I mitigated it fairly well. I told her about it the day it started, and began therapy the next day. I've really improved over the last two weeks, I'm much happier and less angry or aggressive all the time, but in that same time frame she decided she needed to be alone. Being the supportive person I am, I stayed on post last weekend and let her have her space.

We talked throughout the week, and she decided to meet at a halfway point between our residences on Friday night to talk about something in person. I asked if it was something serious, and her response was ""It's not too bad, but I won't tell you until I see you in person.""

Friday came and I packed my bags, headed to meet her, and eagerly awaited my love to explain what was on her mind. She told me she wanted a divorce. We'd rushed into the relationship too fast, and ever since I'd been depressed she didn't feel like I was the same person. She still loved me, but she didn't feel the passion anymore. 

I agreed to a divorce, and asked if we could stay together afterwards. She answered no, on the grounds that I hadn't told her about my stress prior to our elopement and she felt she'd been betrayed, tricked into marrying someone other than who she thought she was marrying, since the stress ultimately contributed a large part toward my rapid mental shift. This created more stress on top of her already full plate, and she hadn't felt any emotion for the past two weeks other than crying when she was alone. 

She said she wanted to stay friends, and that when I was finally mentally stable again, we could try again, beginning with working toward her forgiving me for lying about my stress. I have tried to explain to her that prior to filing I would like to try a separation and utilize the Army's free marriage counseling to try and get us back on track, and that if it doesn't work for her we can then get a divorce.

She is determined that divorcing and staying just sort of friends (starting back at acquaintances) is all that we have left for options other than totally going our separate ways.

I agree with her that we rushed into the marriage, and I feel like a divorce could be healthy for us if we tried to stay together after and work through her feelings, but she keep saying she has to ""go with her gut"" on this one, and that we can only be friends, that I can only see her once or twice a month, tops, and that no way will I ever be allowed to stay the night at her apartment on the couch if I don't feel like I can make the drive back here (2+ hours in the snow) that night.

What can I do to turn this around and try to get her to see that, being that we still love each other, there are other options than just giving up?

TL;DR she's totally given up and I want to try our options, how can I get her to change her mind, or else what can I do to try and salvage this on my own?"

Then one week ago she suddenly starts acting different towards me, avoiding contact with me. This started freaking me out so I asked her if she was angry, she said ""no"". She said that she didn't feel very comfortable around me but that it would improve in time and that I don't need to worry about it. She also said that she doesn't want to talk about it and that she knows we'll be really good colleagues. After reading that I was crushed and thought I just got turned down (because before I always felt uncomfortable talking to women and they detected that). But now I'm starting to read the messages again and I'm starting to think she thought that she didn't have a chance with me. I'm starting to think that the effects of my 117 days without masturbation are backfiring on me in this situation..."

I consider myself a lucky son. My parents are the furthest from the crazy, over-the-top protective spectrum a person could ask for. I'm older now(21), and I'm about to graduate college, currently I'm sitting in an airport lobby waiting on a plane for an interview on the west coast for a game programming internship. All of this was made possible by my parents.

Sadly, I had to move from my home in the country to the city for college, and I hardly, if ever, see them on a regular basis. Maybe once, twice a month if I'm lucky. But, even with distance barriers they still insist on helping me out (which is not unappreciated because I've definitely needed it sometimes). I just wish I could do more to help them out, since they helped me out so much. 

I'm willing to go the extra mile to help my parents out, I love them a lot and I'm sure they know I consider them a vital part of my life and who I am today. I feel bad because I'm sure I've not been the best son I could be, and that there are some people out there who would be more deserving of better parents.

I always call them once a day, and talk to them as long as they're willing to listen to me ramble on about school, work, girls, etc., and when I'm home I try my best to help around the house (but, more often than not they tell me to sit my ass down and let them handle it). I've told them thanks a million times, told them how much I loved them, but I just feel that isn't enough, I truly want to show them how amazing they are and how much they mean to me.

Sorry if this letter comes off as pretentious, I truly don't mean it. I'm simply asking for advice as a son who will never know how lucky he really is.

Regards,

I've been very depressed lately for a number of reasons. I had a hard time getting over my first girlfriend cause she was what kept me sane my first two semesters of college. After a summer at an internship I hated in my field things just got worse when I realized everything I had thought I wanted my whole life really wasnt. I dropped out of one of the best schools in the country halfway through this semester (sophmore year). I talked to my ex about these things hoping I could get the same feeling as I did when we were together. When I didn't and felt like my life was crumbling around me I turned to drug abuse, which just made me hate myself more. For the past few weeks I haven't been able to bring myself to do anything, getting out of bed and taking a shower was an all day process. I thought about ending it all a million times, but knew I could never do it to all the people who loved me. Now some switch somewhere in my brain has flipped and I think I'm finally ready to start putting my life back together. Just wanted to get this out there to somebody, even if it is a bunch of anonymous people on the internet.

I am a mid-20s year old guy. On the surface, everything looks great. I'm a graduate student, very successful in my field. I publish, travel to conferences, so internships, etc.

What many people don't realize is until I was about 21, I was extremely depressed and overweight, and through a combination of diet and exercise lost about 50lbs.

The thing is, I have been plateaued at around 190 for a while, mostly due to binge eating issues.

I recently started seeing a girl I met on OKCupid. It's my first real relationship, and she's a bit high strung, but I have my issues too.

However, one thing that troubles me is she loves to cook. On advice of my therapist, I do not keep junk food in my apartment. No cookies, candy etc. 

So for example, today we went to a party. I tried really hard - I only had a couple drinks and some chips. Came home mentally exhausted, stressed, and sitting on my table is a cake she made. And next thing you know - BAM. I've eaten about 2K in calories.

I don't want to hurt her feelings or push her away, but how do I let her know that her baking for me is not helping me (and is, in fact, hurting me)?

**Update: I told her that keeping junk food in my apt makes me tempted to binge, that it was delicious, but to please not bake unhealthy things. She seemed a bit sad, but understood. She also said she'd like to cook some healthy meals rather than eat out to help (since she knows that's another big trigger from past convos) - I think she's a keeper :)**

**Thanks for all the insightful replies - I know I'm not the target demographic for this subreddit, but I really appreciated the female perspective**"

Been meaning to do this for a long time.",JustNotMyDay,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12llvn/not_really_a_throwaway_account_more_of_a/,"For as long as I can remember, I've been sad. Depression, Anxiety and other mental illnesses run in my family. My cousin killed herself when I was around 12 years old, and this is when I really became aware of it. 


Rewind to my childhood, my parents split up because of my fathers' issues with depression and anger. I will always remember driving away from that house and never going back. At first me and my dad had a decent relationship. He'd come see me semi-often, I'd stay a night or two at his new place here and there. Eventually it dropped off...It started to be just Thanksgiving, Christmas, my birthday, then became Thanksgiving and Christmas and eventually just Christmas (Keep in mind I was still pretty young at this point.) I missed a few years in a row due to untimely sickness and weather/travel complications but i've kept regular attendance since. 


Back to me, I am currently in college, working a part time job, trying to manage a band and single (i'm a guy). I feel sometimes as if I only have enough energy to put towards 2 of these things, and any 2 are falling apart at any given time. 


School is my main concern almost always, it's very demanding and intimidating. Sometimes I feel as if im too immature to handle it, i'm staring internship soon as my final semester and expected to be a professional in my field (I don't want to say what that is) but at heart I feel like im still a 16 year old kid. I get good grades and pass all my classes, but the part that worries me is the social aspects of my future job because at heart, I've always been a socially awkward penguin. I don't do well in new situations and struggle to connect with new people (sometimes a little liquid courage helps but this isn't really an option in the workplace) which probably doesn't help with the depression. 


My part time job is infuriating. I get such little respect and feel so ""small"" as a human being just being around that place. My boss is so unappreciative of anything I do and goes out of his way to point out every minor flaw and in-adequacy. The hours are relentless and he does everything he can to get me working as much as possible, which often-times conflicts with band practice, relationships and more importantly school. I feel like every second of every day is planned out for the foreseeable future and this scares the shit out of me. 


Band is frustrating in essence, it's not easy getting 5 guys on the same page, but it's a rewarding feeling to play for people even if it's just a small act. I love music so passionately, I love writing and long to learn how to compose my songs better. Unfortunately I don't have much time for this anymore. We're kind of falling apart...some members are focusing more on other bands they are in, others are just as busy as I am. It's really depressing knowing the one thing I love to do is the one I have the least amount of time for. 


Last but not least, relationships. Going back to my relationship with my dad, I realize I see a lot of him in myself. I am depressed, i'm known to have some anger issues and am terrible at keeping healthy relationships with people. I worry about him, but part of me is resentful that he shows such little interest in seeing or hearing from me. I know I could always call him up...but i've become so accustomed to never hearing from him, it's just the way it's always been.


I never lacked friends growing up as much as I do now. I always had a group of friends, and in high school I even got in with ""the cool kids"" so to speak. I was never the most popular guy on Earth, but I did okay. Nowadays I find myself struggling for people to hangout in the small amount of time I do get to myself. Friends from high school tapered off, and my bandmates are starting to do the same. My closest friends I've met in college. Some ended up dropping out, moving away. The ones I still have live pretty far away so I don't really see them outside of school. I've learned that most friendships have an expiry date, or else it seems that way.


Furthermore, i've had terrible luck with dating. My last girlfriend was before school (i'm almost done my 3 year course) and I forget what it feels like to have somebody be genuinely interested in me. I haven't touched, held or kissed a girl in a really long time. I was never that bad with the ladies in the past, I've had a fair share of girlfriends and sexual encounters, but the past ~3 years have been rough. I was never the best looking guy out there but i'd say i'm about average, maybe a bit above despite my recent balding becoming a factor. I was always adding girls on facebook and myspace (ha) as a teenager and just blatantly hitting on them, sometimes getting a bite and turn it into a relationship. This is how 90% of my relationships started, and I met some really great girls this way. Once me and my previous SO broke up right before college, I decided I didn't like this method...it felt childish, and creepy, so I stopped. I thought I was getting too old for that game. I thought I would find something more ""real"" whatever that means. I was wrong.


I found a girl IRL that I really liked, she was amazing. I felt like we were on equal plains. We laughed, screwed around, made stupid jokes. She had her problems, as do I, but I thought the world of her and I knew I wanted everything to do with her. I decided to muster up the courage to tell her how I felt and I did. She didn't feel the same way, and I was crushed. I really tried to not let it bother me, but there she was, all the time, as a friend. We never talked about it again after that day and we continued our friendship for a couple years, over which I watched boyfriends come and go in complete envy. I wondered all the time what it was I was missing, ""why not me?""


A few girls that had potential have come along over the years, through playing shows with the band whatnot but none ever gave the inclination that they were interested in me. Even on a good day when i wasn't feeling especially down, and tried to initiate some kind of conversation. Why bang the weird guitar player when you can bang the lead singer right? Not that I want a girl like that, it just seems to be the mentality they all have. I've come to the point where I see a really attractive girl and I just say why? Why the fuck would I waste both of our time and try to talk to her? She's going home with that cool guy over there, or she'll just reject you, or even if she does go out with you, how long will it take her to get scared off by all your emotional problems? etc. etc.


**TL;DR** I'm generally feeling really crippled by a combination of depression, lack of self confidence and loneliness. Sometimes I wish I could just sleep forever, and i'm disappointed when I realize i've woken up to my life, with my problems and the people in it. I've told a handful of people about my depression but never in any detail like this. I seriously debated hitting submit, it felt so good just to type that all out, but I really felt I needed to get this off my chest. Feel free to ignore my wall of text."

12lash,2,2012-11-03,All I need to know about travelling!,TheOtherCumKing,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/12lash/all_i_need_to_know_about_travelling/,"Ok, so I'm going to start off by describing my situation. 

Currently, I am a third year student in Canada who is taking a year off to do my internship. My plan is to save as much money as I can over the next year, finish my fourth year of school and then go travelling for as long as I can. 

This is something I only recently thought of and am having a hard time finding all the information I need to start planning. 

So basically, what I'm interested in doing is travelling for a period of 6-12 months around Europe. I guess, what I'm wondering is, exactly what would be a reasonable budget to cover travelling costs? Are there preparations I can start making now? Such as researching about locations and what would be the best place to do it?

Again, this is something I thought of very recently but it is something I am taking very seriously and I'm just looking for any tips on where I should start from people who have experience travelling. 

Also, I am assuming this is the best subreddit for this but I apologize in advance if I'm completely off. "
12ozvt,1,2012-11-05,Automating IOS scripts with putty output. Is it possible ?(Programming),aceofskies05,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/12ozvt/automating_ios_scripts_with_putty_output_is_it/,"I work at a large retail company as a networking intern. One of my tasks right now is to go through all of the store switches and write in descriptions on ports for new AP's that have been put in over the course of a year. So I am looking at 200 stores, with roughly 6 switch stacks in each store. Somewhere in the store will be a switch that contains ports with temporary descriptions like "" Freezer/Cooler ST-AP"". My task is to go through and replace the temp description with its real AP number. This could be something like ""ST400AP60"".  Since I know the AP's number range will be AP60-AP69 I can short cut the work and do a ""show cdp nei | i AP6""  and I can filter the results down and get the associated AP name from the controller end. From here I can do the basic conf t, int Fax/x, des ST400AP60. 

Now I have gotten a significant chunk out of the way, but I started thinking that this process is the exact same. So I was wondering if I could make some sort of programming script that checks port descriptions for the temporary description and then runs show cdp nei | i AP6 and creates a script that maps port numbers with the results from show cdp nei command. 

sample out put would look like

* int fa1/0/41
* des ST400AP63
* int fa1/0/42
* des ST400AP64 
* int fa1/0/43

IT'S TUESDAY and pizza's on the menu again, this time courtesy of the Federalist Society. They're not popular here, so the competition is tame for a lunchtime slice of cheese and an 8 ounce cup of diet coke. I slide into the classroom before the line gets here, before the speaker even does, grab my share and take a seat.

It's a small victory. I've come up empty everywhere else: 2L OCI, Fall OCI, mass mails to every midlaw and shitlaw firm in every market but Alaska. ""But I go to a T-6,"" I wanted to scream to them, to those employers, to myself, to nobody in particular. ""I go to a T-6.""

In March, I gave up, emailed the nonprofit I worked for my 1L summer, attached an updated transcript with my A- in Evidence from the Fall. I called my supervisor to ask him to put in good word, reminded them that they still don't have to pay me anything. They obliged and for a few days I was elated.


*


I look up from my plate of pizza and my classmate, some board member of some significance in FedSoc, is on the podium now. I wonder if he has a summer job. He seems like a smart guy. He's introducing today's guest speaker. Mentions something about the Cato Institute. ""A real privilege,"" he says, this speaker of ours, taking time out of his busy schedule, his life, his career. I envy that this man has a career.

My mind wanders to a conversation I had last week with an old acquaintance, someone I hadn't talked to since college. Ran into him near the Halal cart on 53rd and 6th. Makes six figures at Goldman. My age.

""Yea, I know what I'm doing this summer,"" I told him.

Then I answer the inevitable follow-up question, my voice breaking slightly as I explain that it's a non-profit, that I had worked there already last summer and loved it and couldn't wait to go back.

He pretends to be impressed. ""They seem like they do a lot of important work.""

""Thanks,"" I explained, ""but it doesn’t pay much."" I pray he doesn’t pry further.

""Oh really, how much?""

""Well, actually, they don't pay anything, but I get a public interest stipend from my school.""

He paused, thinking.

""Well, congratulations!"" he said. ""That's great. You're going to save the world,"" he said, his hand on my shoulder, a mechanical gesture of comfort. A big smile stapled onto his face.

I'm less optimistic, but he insists on being polite. ""I'm sure you'll be fine,"" he said. ""I mean, your school is what, like top 10 or something, right?""

""Yea, top 6 actually,"" I corrected. I cling to the shred of prestige like a wet t-shirt does to a 19 year-old co-ed in Cabo.

""Oh, that’s right. That’s great. So you’ll definitely be fine."" I saw the pity in his eyes. He broke the tension by flipping out his Blackberry, pretending to answer another important e-mail. ""I've got to get back to the office,"" he said. ""But hey, it was great running into you."" After he's gone, I realized I'd forgotten to ask for his business card. The career office told us to work our networks. I cursed myself for the lapse.


*


Back at lunch, a few rows of people have filtered into the classroom. The board member is still going on about our speaker.

There are deadlines coming up. In a couple days I'll polish off my candidate statement for the Federalist Society elections. I need all the lines on my resume I can get. ""I enjoy going to your events,"" I'll write. Maybe I'll insert a joke about only going for the pizza. I hope they'll remember that I usually stay for the entire event.

Maybe I'll try out for a moot court team next fall. Or an externship, or a clinic. I've already got Articles Editor of my secondary journal locked up, and it gives me some solace. It has to count for something, right?

I try to think of ways to spin the work experience section of my resume so that it'll look more substantial. I wonder whether to put two separate entries for my summers, given that they’re at the same organization. Maybe I can ask them to give me a different title this time. I wonder if I can be a Senior Legal Intern. ""The same job, twice?"" I imagine interviewers next fall asking me.

That’s if they ask me anything at all, but I try not to think about that. Some say that 3L OCI is a myth. That it doesn't exist, it’s a fairytale. But I've got to keep the dream alive. I’ve got to hope.

Hope, because it got a President elected. Because it keeps me going.

Hope for a better economy, better days, better meals.

Around me, I hear applause. The speaker has finally taken the podium. I bite into my slice of cheese and look up.

12oc3q,7,2012-11-05,Relapse on Day 18,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12oc3q/relapse_on_day_18/,"This is my very first post, I've been lurking this subreddit after a friend of mine suggested that I look here as a resource

I have been a heavy smoker for the past 8 years, it began in the start of high-school, typical, and in no time we were hooked. By the last few years I have been getting high virtually every waking hour of my days, in fact it was my motivation for getting out of bed each day, most recently I had lost my appetite completely and could go 2 days without eating, I was spending insane amounts of money (1/2oz every 5-7 days) and my relationship with my family was in a steady decline from the start. 

I graduated college a few months ago with a diploma in Advertising, and my efforts for seeking an industry position namely an internship have been fruitless.. I have been working at a coffee shop as a ""supervisor"" for the last 4 1/2 years to pay my way through college and more importantly to fund my habit, anyway

I have recently made the decision to quit smoking marijuana with a best friend an we are planning to move to western canada in a month in search of ""real jobs"" We both have stopped smoking together primarily for the potential of drug testing for whatever said jobs we might find...

Yesterday marked my 18th day free of marijuana, I have been experiencing most of the common withdrawal symptoms most notably insomnia and wildly vivid dreams, actually quite terrifying, however I've been feeling terrific and very proud of myself, I have resisted many times now as all my other friends are still smokers...most notably on halloween last week I managed to resist a total of 8 times that day, my most testing day so far...

So last night on my 18th day 2 other friends wanted to see a movie, we met up before the movie after I had dinner with my parents and out I went, they produced a joint and I immediately tried to justify it as I've been having such success, so I smoked with much hesitation, although they did not encourage it, it was my choice.

I got so unfathomably high i literally had forgotten that marijuana actually possessed that kind of power, it was grade 9 all over again, i could barely drive my car I felt like I was drunk!

Now I woke up this morning with a guilty conscience... I feel like I'm back to square one in terms of my counting the days progress, that being said I have no desire to smoke again right now, and after last night I have come to the conclusion that I cant use it like before even if I wanted to, I couldn't go to work or school or be around my parents high any longer, I would have to build my insane tolerance back up to even be able to!

So it doesn't seem like a slippery slope for my situation, and I feel like it was an important step in the process like WHOA I cant even do this on a regular basis anymore and get away with it

I guess the basis for this post is to help me deal with this guilt of letting myself down! Although I still feel totally under control and I don't know if I ever want to do it again realistically, i just don't know how to be okay and stop beating myself up for slipping up and being back at day 1.

Thanks for listening, my thoughts are kind of all over the place as I wanted to provide adequate background information. By the way I am now 22 and I'm from Ontario, Canada."
12nybn,37,2012-11-05,I'm stuck in China. ,throwaway_8x8x8x8x,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/12nybn/im_stuck_in_china/,"Ok, so here is my problem... I'm stuck here. I lived in China for three years and I loved it. I loved it so much that I went back to the USA (my home) to get my master's degree in education and the plan was that I would come back to China and work. I ended up meeting an amazing man, falling in love, and he is very anti-moving. So after trying to get a teaching job in the USA I finally got one. I loved it. 

My boss retired and the person who took over hated me. That's a whole other story but it killed me in side. I deiced to go back to China for a year to clear my head and work. Well I have been here just over a month and things are not going well. 

I was told that I would be able to come here in July, but my visa didn't arrive until almost the end of September. I got here and nothing was ready for me- my apartment didn't have electricity, internet, or gas. It was filthy and several things were broken. The department of the school in charge of my visa never let the teaching department know I was here so I didn't start teaching until about 6 weeks into the semester. 

I miss my guy, I miss my family. The hurricane hit, and now I really want to go home. The school has my passport (they say I can have it back soon, but I don't trust them) and they are going to withhold my pay until the 15th. It's cold and they heat won't go on until the 14th. 

I know in China things are not like they are back home, but I feel like I am being treated like a dog. I found out the school lied about the pay rates- so now my pay is going to be lower than some of the other teachers because I believed their lie. (When I asked for higher pay they told me that it was a government regulation/ policy to offer no more than what I was getting, but I found out other teachers are getting more than me). 

I want to go home, but I have to wait for my pay... if it will ever come. I was told that I would get paid at the beginning of the month. Now they are telling me I have an 'internship' and that I have to wait until the middle of the moth to get my pay. 

Maybe when I was here before I didn't notice how many problems you can have- maybe I worked for really good schools- but right now I have never regretted something more in my life. I wasted all our money to come here- with the idea that I would be able to make more money here than back home- but now I am so miserable all I can think about is going home. 

I just wanted to share because I don't know what to do. I have run out of money, and the will to fight with the school. I am worried that they will loose my passport and my pay if I complain about anything. Normally I love China, and I guess I still do, I just really hate the school I am working for.  "
12ndug,23,2012-11-04,Been with my SO for a year and he hasn't met my family. ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ndug/been_with_my_so_for_a_year_and_he_hasnt_met_my/,"I'm 23F and my SO is 29M. 

I've been with my boyfriend for about a year now. Things are great between us; we get along, have a ton in common, he's taught me a lot, we've traveled together, spend lots of time together, I love him a lot, etc. 

The issue here is my parents. My mom is 62 and my dad is 55, if that matters. I've had a few boyfriends in the past but none where I felt that I needed to introduce them to my family. My mom has met my boyfriend, but only briefly and because I forced her to. I haven't introduced him to my dad yet because I'm seriously scared of my father's reaction. 

My dad is middle eastern, incredibly racist, illogical at times, has a horrible temper, I've dealt with some physical and verbal abuse from him, and he's been rude to several of my male friends simply because of the fact that they're male. My dad has also done things like call someone a ""prick"" for looking at me/checking me out when we were in a 7-11. It's tiring at times.


I don't really know what to do at this point. I have one more semester of school, an internship in the summer with a huge company that will hopefully lead to a full time job in the fall, and I also plan to move out (and move in with my boyfriend) in August. I have about $10,000 in the bank, no student loan debt, my own car, and I pay my car insurance/phone/health insurance by working full time and busting my ass. 
 

I don't know how to bring this up to my dad. I'm pretty sure he knows I have a boyfriend because I'm not at home at least 3 nights a week, but he never asks me and is totally aloof. My mom said ""just bring your boyfriend over and introduce him"" but I'm worried my dad will lose his temper and either physically hurt my boyfriend or just embarrass the hell out of me.  The worst part about this is that I have a great relationship with my boyfriend's family. They are warm and welcoming, invite me over for all holidays, they're all intelligent, and I love them. 


I'm sure other people have dealt with a parent like this. I just need some advice/guidance as to how to handle my dad. I don't know what context to bring up my boyfriend and how to make my father feel comfortable. My mom is no help either and totally avoids the conversation when I ask her for advice and has the nerve to refer to my boyfriend as ""my friend"" sometimes.  I'm at my wits' end here. 


tl;dr: need help/advice with how to introduce my boyfriend to my extremely conservative father"
12n7mf,14,2012-11-04,I'm making progress. And I'm happy for first time in 1 year,[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/12n7mf/im_making_progress_and_im_happy_for_first_time_in/,"I'm a 22 year old 4th year college student and was suffering from a slight depression for over a year. I was completely unmotivated and didn't really care about anything. And I smoked a lot of pot also, which doesn't help. I stopped trying hard in school and got a 3.2 for that year. I was nervous about major (accounting) because I fucking hate it and didn't know what I wanted to do in life. I became so unmotivated I didn't even look into switching my major, getting a job, getting an internship, and basically anything to help me for my future.

I became so unhappy and sad and I couldn't take it anymore I broke down and told everything to my mom, minus the weed part. I talked to her for hours and at first I didn't feel different at all. I was still sad for the first 2 days after that. My brother and father helped me out tremendously by speaking to me and letting them I can go to them with any problem I have. On monday of this week, I went to school and found out a bunch of information on my major and decided to do a double concentration in finance. I started to feel a lot better. I even spoke to some family friends who are in that field and reassured me I have nothing to worry about, just do good in school and you'll get a job and move on to get your MBA or other certifications.

At that moment, it really clicked in my mind. I wanted to be them. I wanted to be as jovial and happy as they are on the other end of the phone. They were making good money, living in nice apartments, and working. I want that more than anything. I really want to be successful and make good money and have people respect me. I can't do any of that shit without pulling myself together and acting like a fucking man. Since monday, I've got to the gym twice for the first time in 3 months. I ran 2 miles and then did weights and the most important thing about it was that I was in a good mood.

I woke up today, a little sore from weights. Decided not to toke this sunday morning. Watched the Liverpool game, cleaned the absolute shit out of my room, it's spotless. Did my laundry, some homework, and read A Storm of Swords for an hour. All the while, I had energy and wasn't tired that I had been over the last year. When I was depressed, I wasn't exercising, smoking weed all the time, not eating properly, and as a consequence, I was constantly tired.

A huge coincidence happened yesterday too. A guy with a 2012 Ferrari 458 Italia parked next to me at the gym. As I was leaving, he was at his car saying bye to his girlfriend. This fat Persian guy was super nice. I told him how his car, was my exact dream. While 458 with black top and black Ferrari rims. He left but I talked to his girlfriend and she told me how hard he's worked. He came from Iran with nothing and now he's got everything. He's got 6 other super cars as well. I want nothing more than to do what he's doing, drive around in a motherfucking Ferrari. But I can't do that if I don't motivate myself now.

I'm starting to talk to people better because I'm a little more upbeat. I'm hanging out with my friends more and even going to a bar tomorrow night after class. I've been feeling happy since Monday and I'm excited. I've not felt like this for at least 1.5 years. I even bought 2 lbs of protein on amazon because I plan on going to the gym 3 times a week.

I'm starting my old job up again next week in which I work from home for 10$ an hour. I plan on getting good grades this semester (I've finally been studying), making money from my job, buying new clothes and spending my money with friends at bars and hanging out instead of being jew about it, no offense.

Wow, I kind of wrote my own journal entry. I hope some of you guys read it. It's not going to motivate you or anything, but it let's you know that things do get better. Some days where I did nothing but smoke weed all day were the worst. I would just think, what in the fuck have I done today, nothing! My peers are out there fucking working and making it happen for themselves. I need to make it happen for myself because I don't want to be fucking 30 years old and not enjoy my life because I'm financially strapped. It all starts now and you guys will hopefully realize it too. You need a catalyst to change your mindset and get yourself out of your funk. I don't know what to tell you except it gets better. Slowly, but it does.

I grew up in a place with a lot of affluent white people, my parents were affluent at the time but we're not white. I always thought I was different and therefore ugly. My parents wouldn't let me spend time with friends. So, most of my time was spent playing video games alone. I was scared of my father who since I was 9 didn't have a job and lived off my mother, he would watch me with hawk eyes all day. I was jealous of my peers who had white skin and more freedom than me; it was unbearable.

All I could think was-- this isn't fair.

When I was thirteen we moved to another part of the country, a less affluent and more diverse part. That's when I made friends with a kid who lived at the same apartment complex as me. He was everything I wasn't. His father was a trucker and was never home, so he had unlimited freedom. His father was out of work a lot of the time and living with his girlfriend, so they were poor.

He also played videogames, a lot more than me.

We went to school together for a couple years. He had good grades, and I had bad grades, bad grades meaning B's, C's, and a D in Geometry. My parents didn't like that I was spending time with him, and accounted my bad grades to him. So they made me repeat my Freshman year at another school that was a 25 minute car ride away. My father would drive me every day.

The kids there didn't like me. My father had lost most of my families money in bad business ventures. My sister, who was just finishing up college classes in London, all paid for on credit card by my father. He didn't tell anyone. That entire year he treated me terribly, and beat me when I came home with an earring.

Finally the truth came about. My family was 100k in debt from my sister's year abroad.

The kids at my new school didn't like me, and would viciously pick on me. I was small at the time, and weak. The football players in particular were particularly nasty. I tried to tell my mother that I was pantsed by a football player; she told me it was because I wore my pants so low.

I would sneak away and hang out with my friend at my old school on the weekends. My parents wouldn't give me money for clothes I thought were cool, and my friend was poor, so we began stealing them. We were eventually caught, and I was picked up by my parents at the police station.

I didn't go out once for the rest of the year, my parents wouldn't let me. I also received another D in Math. My father told me he called my friend's father and told him that I was never allowed to hang out with him again. That's when I started to hit my father, twice in the face. We were in the car driving at the time, and he pulled over and cried. It felt good to hurt him, after all he had done to me.

My parents decided I should go to boarding school. I was then sent to a boarding school in the middle of nowhere. I had a good time for the most part and my grades picked up, and I was accepted to a decent college.

I became friends with one of my teachers who told me about his friends who owned a sex dungeon in NYC. When it came time to graduate I asked if I could work there as an intern. I talked to the owner and he agreed. For three months I stayed for free in the dungeon and ate for free all the while half naked women walked around.

My father cashed out his 401k to send me to boardingschool. And now, my mother was going to cash out hers to send me to college. I became the president of the political philosophy club. The club, funny enough, was a front for its participants--drug dealers. I started smoking weed regularly and had my first couple acid experiences.

I became good friends with a graduating senior.

I quickly became bored with college. A friend of mine was working for a company in a part of the country with a decent economy. He said if I would move out there he'd pay my first months rent. I decided to go.

I got a job working for a 21 year old with a funded company. He and I would smoke weed most days, my on boarding ritual to the company was him pulling out his bowl and packing it. This went on for a couple months until funding winded down and he couldn't afford to pay me.

I moved back home. I was angry and bitter. I didn't give my parents any information on why I had done what I had done. My father didn't talk to me. I began smoking weed in my room every day. My mother agreed to paying for me to take community college classes. I signed up for 2.

I was angry about my life and decided to write down all my most violent memories. They were mostly about my father, who was watching tv. I brought the list to him and demanded we talked. He tried to brush me aside, and I started screaming, telling him that I really needed to talk some things out with him. My mother heard the screaming and joined. I told them I just wanted to talk some stuff out. She said she didn't want to talk and she and my father tried to walk away. I then grabbed my father around the waist and started squeezing him screaming for him to apologize. My mom called the police.

The police arrived and told me I could either go to jail or I could go to a psychiatric evaluation, if I didn't go to the evaluation my parents would push charges.

I agreed. For the next 4 days, I was in a psych hospital. If I tried to leave they would put me on a ""hold"", meaning they have the right to hold me indefinitely. They had me on 3 different meds, I've never been suicidal in my life, but that combination of medications made me suicidal exactly 45 minutes after taking the third one. I couldn't tell this to the psych ward otherwise they would put me on a hold.

I passed the ""sociopath test"" the head psychiatrist gave me after asking why I showed no remorse for what I had done. I told her my dad had beaten me and I didn't feel bad, she then said such hurtful things that I cried--apparently I wasn't a sociopath.

One of my friends back where I was working agreed to pay for me fly back to where I was working. But apparently someone needed to physically pick me up. One of my friends was willing to drive 9 hours to pick me up in person. But my mother said she would pick me up and take me to the airport. So I told him no. She ended up not picking me up, and I endured another night of suicidal thoughts caused by the psych wards meds. My friend called and said he would come and pick me up. My parents realizing that keeping me there was futile decided to finally take me to the airport.

I am now living back where I was previously. I have a new job, I started a side venture, and am working with the guy I worked for in NYC on a site hoping to revolutionize porn. I realized a while ago that I am not ugly, I'm actually very handsome. But I am different, and I will not apologize for who I am.

Thank you for reading."

I would like to tell you how my experience with NoFap has given me the opportunity to straighten out and focus my life-energy. 

.


I think horniness is a blessing and a curse. 
It's a blessing because it get's you motivated to do epic stuff. Lift heavy weights, work like a horse and party like an animal. 
It is, however, also a curse. 
[Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy BOOBS Pussy Pussy Pussy Pussy](/nsfw)
That's just an average thought that crosses my mind ever so often. 
Let me be clear, I had a LOT of sexual energy that translated well into other activities I was doing like weightlifting and working on a boring paper for school. 

.


Ahh, then the bliss of the flatline.
Well, bliss, It's pretty scary at first.
Gone are all naught thoughts, sexdrive vanishes like snow before the sun, rainforests worth of wood gets cut down. 

""Damn, I kinda liked being horny all the time, I felt alive!"" ""Should I fap again to kickstart my libido back to old levels?"" 
Those were thoughts I regularly had in the first week of flatline. However I persevered and ventured into uncharted territory. 


.

Fast forward 2 weeks to today. 

Today I 'broke up' with a semi-serious sexual relationship with a girl. 
I was involved with her since the begin of NoFap, so 44 days ago to be exact. (coincidence) 
She was not amused, she was getting more and more emotionally attached and so was I to her. The sex was plentifull on the nights we spend together. [I'm talking like 4 to 8 times per night](/nsfw) I never experienced ED or other problems in those nights. 
Needless to say, horny me was pretty pleased and thought he had it pretty well together. 

.

In comes flatline me. 
For the first time in my life I have been able to see past all lust and biological attraction for women and this has revealed what I kind knew all along.
I had no real connection to her. I wasn't really interested in her as a person, as a human being with emotions, ambitions and a personality.
All I saw before , and what attracted me to her, was pure flesh. 

This is not a good sign if you are about to go serious in a relationship. 

So I made the decision to tell her of my new discovery and end it. 
I don't want to be involved with women that I can't connect with emotionally. 

.


Flatline/NoFap as freedom from sex. 
I have come to the conclusion that it's actually not that bad to not have sex! It's actually not that bad to not fap! It's actually a liberation!
Freedom from sex, freedom from the pursuit of women. Freedom for me! Freedom to express myself and invest in non-sexual pursuits like finishing my paper, study for upcoming events and internships, put more hours into playing the piano, working out more and looking after my diet more. I'm going to try to talk to women without sexual undertones or without sexual interest from my side. (that will be a first :p ) What the heck! I don't care , it's all my very own experiment!
(i think every pursuit has a sexual root but you get the point)
Not thinking about sex all the time clears the mind to pursue other worldly things.


.

One thing I have noticed as well is that you have to listen to your dick, sometimes it tries to tell you something.
It might sound strange but let me elaborate. 
Remember when I told you that I never had problems with ED? 
Well I experienced my first ED last week. It was during the first night while flatlining together with my ex. Mini-me didn't want to cooperate at first. Later it was cooperating but didn't want to finish the deal and felt kinda numb, if you know what I'm talking about. ( I guess he just didn't want to impregnate her)

I think that sometimes your dick tries to tell you that he simply doesn't want to have sex with some person. Sometimes it doesn't want to get up and work simply because the job just isn't right. 
I guess it's your instinct trying to communicate with you. 
My instinct about my ex has certainly done a good job the last couple of days. 

Listen to yourself! That's my lesson from that experience!
If you have doubts or aren't having something with a girl with all your heart, just cut it off before it gets out of hand even more and more feelings end up being hurt. 

Flatlining makes it a LOT easier to look past all feelings of lust and discover if the real emotional connection is good or not. This makes being honest with yourself easier. 

Guys, before you get too scared, your little friend still works during flatline. But the tendency to go on strike when he doesn't like the girl gets bigger as well. Consider that a favor. 

.


Ending:
As I said in the beginning, this was going to be a stream of consciousness. I hope you picked up something valuable from this post.
NoFap has been an enriching and very interesting experience for me up to now. It has helped me to look past the flesh and to focus more on human connection. 

.

My sexual fire has been burning slow for the past month but other types of energies and urges have only grown.
The urge to be free, to live my life how I see fit, the courage to stand up for myself and speak the truth.
I have dreams of being a cowboy or a settler on the open unexplored prairies. I have dreams of getting on steamboats from the Holland-America line from Rotterdam (I live in Rotterdam) to go to America when I still was a free country. 
Those dreams, those urges, are supremely masculine. I think I am on the verge of discovering a new kind of masculinity for myself. Not the hypersexualised one that we see in porn or popular culture, but a oldschool, rugged and strong kind. We'll see where I get with that! More about that in a later post...

12sknl,105,2012-11-07,My Fiancée [f/25] has been and still could be a Secret Escort. I [m/26] am lost and scared and I don't want things to end. Please Help Me,myotherme-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12sknl/my_fiancée_f25_has_been_and_still_could_be_a/,"My girlfriend, now my fiancée has kept a rather important secret from me which I discovered at 02:30 this morning and now I'm scared, lost and confused. This will take some explaining so I'll break it up into chunks. Here is the back story. 

**TL;DR: I just found out that my fiancée who I love so so much has been an escort and this has continued into our relationship and she didn't tell me even though I gave her many chances to open up**


(Gloss over this chunk. It is really long but I feel you need to have context)

**Our Wonderful Relationship**

We have been together for almost a year and it has been completely blissful. I love her more than I have loved anything and from what I can tell she really loves me too. I try really hard in this relationship, not to the point that I'm possessive and controlling, she has as much freedom as she wants.

I will always make her a cup of tea when she needs it, cook most of the dinners, roll her cigarettes in the morning, meet her when ever and where ever she wants, will always listen (without butting in), excuse her occasional laziness around our home and do most of the cleaning (without being a dick about it), I earn quite a bit more than her so I generally pay for things and I'm doing this to help her get on top of student debts and stuff. Most of all I respect her, I think she is a truly wonderful and strong woman, we're both pretty serious feminists. You get it, I'm the perfect fucking boyfriend (jokes, but I really do try to be as good as I can for her, I just like doing it, it makes me hurt with smiles when I do something special or even just a bit thoughtful and I can see her appreciating me). 

We have never had any arguments really, only minor disagreements, neither of us have ever raised our voices with each other or been violent in any way. This is pretty great considering the intensity and speed of the relationship, we hate spending time apart and haven't slept in separate beds since February 13th (I know it's sad that I know that but she does too and we giggle unbearably when either of us mention that). 

Oh my god don't even get me started on the sex! It is amazing, she get's my kinks and I get hers, we have sex often and it is consistently incredible with multiple orgasms all around. We rent a flat together, own a cat together, are spending Christmas together, getting married in June and for after that, planning to move to New Zealand and having kids. Neither of us are new to this relationship business or feel like we are rushing, we have both had a couple of serious relationships in the past (I was with a girl for 7.5 years) and she was engaged to a dude who didn't really treat her very well, as long as her having a lot of fun whilst she was at Uni!


**How I Know What I Know**

Back in April I was laying in bed watching my beautiful SO getting ready for work, I asked if I could look something up on the internet using her phone as my battery was dead and she agreed. I unlocked it and saw a strange message from a man using only his and her initials in the text saying ""Looking forward to seeing you again later on today, I'm at the Apex hotel, I'm in room whatever..."". I scrolled up to get some context and couldn't make sense of it, All I could see was that they have met before in hotels, have a long text history. 

To be perfectly clear, that is genuinely how I saw the message, I'm not a snooper. The previous time they met was at a hotel in London in February when she told me that her and her friend Jess (not her real name) were going to an opera and she was staying with her friend and she also had some freelance calligraphy work to do down there (this is something she said she used to do before we met and she has not travelled away for it at any other point in the relationship). I freaked out thinking she was cheating on me, I hadn't pieced together much of anything then, all I knew was friendly man meeting my girlfriend, secretly, in a hotel. 

When I bought this up with her she later on (instead of stalking her and calling the number of the guy texting her I might add), she said that I have completely misunderstood the situation. She used to do some free proof reading for a human rights lawyer and from time to time he asks her to help him out on the cheap and it's apparently very illegal and that is why she didn't want to say anything. She explained that that was all London was and that the dude had paid her well and given her a gift because they go back to when she did an intern-ship with him whilst she was at uni. I told her I would have understood but she needs to understand why that freaked me out and just asked her to be more honest with me in the future. No shouting was done, I felt a little hurt but put it to the back of my mind. Besides, it was cool that we scored a few hundred quid and we got a pizza.

Cue a couple of months later. Same dude, similar situation, different hotel. I found out this time because I was being a bit playfully nosey whilst she was using her phone and snuck up behind her saying, whatcha doin', or something like that. I saw enough in those few seconds to know what was going to happen. I asked her about it, got a little upset saying that I asked her just to be honest about this in the future. She said she was going to tell me but it just hadn't crossed her mind.

A couple of months after that, her friend Jess moved up to our city. Jess is a cool lady and they get on really well. I had suspected in the past from hearing bits and pieces that she was an escort which made me re-think my lovely ladies rondez vous with mystery man for cash and the way that there seemed to be some weird unspoken history between the two but I put it to the back of my mind. I tried to give her a few opportunities to say if something was up just asking generalised questions when we had been talking about prostitution and that (we have lot's of interesting political-ish discussions) and she said nothing. After a short while she finally explains to me that Jess is in fact an escort and was I still cool with that and her. Of course I was, she was still Jess, the good friend of my fiancée who has been nothing but nice to me. Who am I to judge? I even gave her another opportunity in the nicest possible way whilst having a walk saying, be honest, have you ever done or considered doing escort work. She laughed and said of course not, she didn't think she'd be capable of doing it.


**The Climax of How I Now Know for Sure**

I overheard my lady and Jess talking about something at a party whilst a bit drunk. I didn't hear much but I heard them talking about a ""Stan"" (not his real name) and an initial (not ""S"") in the same breath, the same fake name and initial combination going on in the messages I once saw. There was mention of some problem, something about remembering, and I thought I heard that he was going to be coming up. This all happened on Friday. I didn't want to be that paranoid boyfriend, I didn't want to just start answering ridiculous questions again. I just sat on what I thought I heard and tried to be skeptical and rational about it. Every time I went over anything in my head I remembered how she acted slightly strangely with her responses and I thought at the time that could be a sign of lying but I wasn't sure if I was just remembering this wrong. 

Finally, after going a bit quietly mad and not wanting to bring things up again, we were up late watching the US Elections last night (we live in the UK) both hoping the Americans would do the right thing and re-elect Obama. She fell asleep and I was staring at her phone with all this shit going on in my head so I did something inexcusable and I opened it and went through her messages. I feel awful for this and I don't handle guilt well.

I saw messages from Jess about this Stan guy where she said that the hotel she was taken to in London recently with another client was really nice and quite a lot like where Stan used to take them, and that Stan was going to be about in our city soon. I saw that Jess at some point in September had a companionship job with a couple of really rich guys where she just hung out, did she want to go with her the second time round, ""I know you are spoken for but I thought I should ask"", and ""They weren't expecting anything, well at least not the previous night but things might change"", and ""I will obviously give you cash for this"". I froze and felt sick. She replied saying she wasn't sure if she would go but then said, ""only if you come round and help me dress up"". I checked out the dates that this went on and I honestly think she didn't go ahead with this. I can't remember exactly what I and we were doing that evening.

I looked further through her messages and read the single message on her phone that was there by Stan addressing both my fiancée and Jess by their initials, saying he was going to be about, they should all meet up together again like old times and maybe this time try something new. She hadn't replied to this message.

I didn't know what to do at this point. I was guilt stricken because I couldn't trust her enough to not go through her phone but at the same time distraught about the whole escort thing. I woke her, I couldn't do anything else. She seemed mad at me for going through her phone and got very pissed off. I apologised a whole bunch and properly broke down with the stress of it all. I didn't ask her right away about everything because she clearly wasn't in the right mood to discuss it. She said she was angry and tired and wanted to talk on a clear head. By this point I had already sobbed a whole bunch and couldn't have made it any clearer to her how sorry I was. She said that she was also hurt because I had been keeping this to my self instead of speaking to her and whilst doing that telling her how great everything is, she thought I was being insincere in what I had said. I explained that I genuinely meant the nice things I had said and there was some cognitive dissonance going on.

When any specifics came up she was reluctant to say anything too specific. We talked it through without actually really mentioning the whole escort thing to a point where we were both saying we love each other and that we both want to try to make it work and it sucks. I was scared she was going to leave me. I asked her if we could still talk about the escort thing when things were more calm, even though I had betrayed her trust and she said yes. We have cancelled our cinema double date tonight to talk about it.

We finally went to bed, and she opened up a bit and said that she didn't go ahead with that paid date and then whatever job because she would have felt icky. The fact that she considered it and got back to Jess is enough to upset me. She still wouldn't talk about the hotel meetings though and remained vague, she repeated to me that she hadn't cheated on me though. I remember so clearly her story of her London trip changing with each bit of information I gave her about what I knew and how odd that felt.

The really upsetting part is that it is my birthday very soon and we were going to go away for a weekend starting with a gig. She became quickly reluctant about this about the time the message from Stan came saying she wasn't sure if she could get the time off work to leave early enough and seemed weird when I said I didn't care, I'd pay fer her train down and we could meet after the gig and have our weekend then. This weekend exactly when Stan is in town. She still has one of the days off when we are not away but I am working which was a suggested date by him.

You know what, I think I could forgive her but I don't know if I'm being a fool. I still love her and our relationship has been practically perfect except for this. She stresses a lot about money thanks to 2 student loans and an old flatmate leaving her in more debt so I can see why she would do it. She gets upset that I pay for most things and has said to me on a number of occasions that she doesn't want me thinking that she is taking advantage of me. I don't, I just want to help her help herself so we can get on with our lives together and not have to worry about past debt. If there were truly no feelings attached and it was just a job I could be accepting of that even though I wouldn't ever want her to continue doing it. The biggest thing I feel is the betrayal, not telling me straight up, even before we started getting really serious, even when I gave her a number of opportunities framed with the sincere phrase, ""I wouldn't be angry with you"".


**My Question**

What the fuck do I do Reddit? I am lost. This relationship means everything to me. She seems so honest and sincere in all the nice things she tells me and tells her friends. They all get on with me really well and are so lovely to me because she truly does speak highly of me to everyone (which means she really cares right?). I don't think any of her other friends know about any of this and though Jess is a good friend, they are not BFF's or anything. I needed to write all this down just to help me process this. I'm so sorry it is really long. I am typing this whilst shaking and choking back tears in my office at work completely unable to get on with any thing.

How should I approach talking to her? She doesn't do arguing well so I don't want to be on the attack otherwise she will end up being on the attack or become to upset and we won't get anything sorted. I hate conflict so much. How can I make it up to her for reading her messages? I guess my biggest concern is that she has had some emotional problems in the past and I really don't want to trigger another downward spiral in her, what ever happens. She has been good and pretty consistently happy since me (well at least on the surface) but she has been to some dark places mentally and I don't want her to return there. I love her.

Just fucking say some words Reddit. I need something right now.

Thank you so much for being there.



**REALLY IMPORTANT EDIT MESSAGE:**

**A lot of people are saying that she is sleeping with loads of guys behind my back. I really do not think this is the case. If anything I believe it is an old client or something. I spend enough time with her and know her work friends well enough to know with some confidence that her sleeping with a tonne of people isn't the case**

12scgo,3,2012-11-07,"My father hurt me emotionally, so I left home, and now I don't know what to do...",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12scgo/my_father_hurt_me_emotionally_so_i_left_home_and/,"I [F 20] live with my father, because my relationship with my mom is fucked up too, so I moved out of her house about two years ago.  They've been divorced since I was four, and they spent their lives treating me like currency, in court battles and lying to me about each other.  My mom was especially controlling, and my dad tends to be arrogant and patronizing.  I'm in college, graduating this December, going abroad in February for an internship.

A few days ago my dad started mocking my constant back pain, which is the result of years of ballet and a few injuries, which include falling down a flight of stairs a year ago.  He claimed it was all in my mind and that I do it for attention, which he qualified as immature.  I was upset at how insensitive and bully-like he was being, so I walked to my room and locked the door.  If it had stopped there, I would have been fine the next morning.  He is, after all, condescending like that.  However, around 15 minutes later, he found a way to unlock the door and came in.  I told him to not take a step further, which he brushed off.  

My anger issues are pretty bad, but I'm usually able to control them.  I went batshit insane, like I hadn't since before middle school, when I was treated by a child psychologist..  

I started screaming at him, pushing him out.   The more he insisted the more violent I became.  He got stuck on the door and I just kept pushing and shoving and screaming, completely losing control of my actions and body.  I'm pretty sure I must have scratched him with my fingernails, etc.  Then he left and I blocked the door closed, and fell asleep.  The next morning, he had already left for work, so I ate, packed my laptop and some overnight basics, went to work, and then stayed the next night at my grandmother's (on my mother's side).  I didn't tell her the real reason I came over, because I don't want her to worry and I don't want the situation to keep blowing up.

He texted me that day to ask if I could pick up my little sister at school, then later to see what I was doing, to which I replied I was staying over at my grandmother's.  A few hours later he texted ""sorry, I have no excuse, I was stupid"".  He himself has always claimed that apologies aren't worth anything because they don't repair the damage, yet all he offered was an eight-word text-message apology.  This made me feel even worse, because it was pretty evident he was trying to clean up the mess without really repenting.  I don't think he understands how bad he fucked up.  Since I wanted to give him a chance to apologize, and I thought that maybe by leaving I hadn't been fair to him, I went back the next day, but he acted like nothing was wrong, making small talk.  I packed up even more bags and returned to my grandmother's.  I know he saw me leave, but he pretended not to, and hasn't contacted me since.  He doesn't know where I am and doesn't seem to be worried about it.

The car I use belongs to him, and I pretty much depend on him because being a student made me poor.  The credit card I used to pay for my internship flight is in his account, and he asked me to pay him back, which I haven't, so I'm afraid he'll ask for a refund or fuck up that opportunity somehow.  I intend to go back and try to talk to him, but I'm afraid he'll just lie through his teeth about being sorry.  I want him to repair the damage, because I know I won't be able to trust him again if he doesn't: it was an extremely traumatic experience.  However, if things keep getting worse, I'll be in danger of losing my internship, and will move out.

What should I do?  How should I initiate this conversation?  What can I expect of him, if anything?

Thanks.

EDIT:  Commenters are somehow getting the idea that I'm some whiny American princess.  Extra information:

He doesn't pay my college, I'm not in the US. I get grants, and work, and get a second job during summers to pay for what the grants don't cover. He's never chipped in for anything because he claims to have huge debt. I even buy my own set of groceries. Only thing he pays is housing and utility, which he splits with his girlfriend. 

Additionally, there is no ""ride your bicycle"" in my country. I live at the top of a mountain, and have to take two highways just to get to campus. And I don't use his credit card, except for purchases he has approved, like the plane ticket. I use my own credit union card with my own savings. So, I do pay for my own shit.  I just used his credit card once for a big online purchase because I don't have a credit card."
12rlip,7,2012-11-06,Finding a reason to quit is the hard part...,[deleted],leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12rlip/finding_a_reason_to_quit_is_the_hard_part/,"I don't have money problems. I don't need to really work other than manage my assets, which involves sitting in front of a computer.  I never run out of good weed, I live in an mmj state.  As a matter of fact I've been smoking private reserve og for the past 2 years wake n bake.  I was afraid I'd gamble away my assets when high, but actually I had fun sitting in front of some fucking numbers and charts. It made life livable for me, it was fun exciting, and I haven't felt an openness to explore new ideas since middle school.... until the honeymoon was over. You know what I'm talking about.

From middle school, high school, college, internships, work to now (mid 20's), everything seemed like a giant slide show.  Everything was new and interesting and just happened without a hitch until recent years. I was stupid, I didn't know how the world REALLY worked. You have no idea, that's why you vote Obama and I vote Romney. I know he's a liar, I know he has an agenda.  His lies just don't benefit you, and his agenda doesn't align with yours.  I came from a humble past so I am Democrat by virtue but Republican by practice.  I keep running and running in this fucking rat race of a society.  But we are all in it.  Some people just want to walk it but can't stand to see others sprint it and win. Others want to run, but don't want to step on the toes of others. And others just don't give a damn even if they step on some toes. Sometimes you can't even move forward without stepping on the toes of others and you don't consider yourself a toestepper until you become one, it's just how it works.  

Life is the same whether or not you smoke. You eat you shit you sleep you die.  How in control are we really? Are you in control when you decide to spark up? Are you MORE in control when you decide to quit?  So is it a battle of who is more in control, YOU or the WEED?  More accurately, I think it's a battle between money and weed, or societal status and weed, or what your parents and friends say vs weed. It's never between you and the weed because Mary loves you and you love her back.  

Nah, you're not in control at all. You *think* you are in control when you attribute weed to problems in your life.  You can't find a good job because you always smoke? Your expectations are too high. There are always people better than you. The term good is very subjective. And btw, it's not the weed that's STOPPING you from doing something.  Quite on the contrary, it's the MONEY that's driving you to QUIT weed. It's like blaming your girlfriend for burning the food while cooking... shit, you weren't gonna cook anyways, why you gotta blame her?!?!? Oh that's right, she burnt a bit of the food, and you are too pussy to intake some carcinogens. Yeah fuck her right? Right... 

Here's a lesson on control: You are not in. Lemme tell you, neither am I. You'd think that with such an easy life, I'd be happier. Fuck you. I wish I was a kid that grew up normal, went to a normal job, had a normal life, and DIDNT ASK SO MANY MOTHERFUCKING QUESTIONS.  Because I found the answers to those questions, and all I ended up with was more and more questions.  Mary didn't really answer my questions as much as it helped me realize that everything is futile.  To a space creature, we are as insignificant as a space slime mold that creeps along the earth until we stretch to other planets and solar systems, but to us you know, this is like... everything and all things, God, the Devil, the whole 9 yards.

We eat, shit , sleep and die. Once we reach the last step, we can't even be sure if anything was real at all in the first place or an illusion.  

So why quit? I don't fucking know, it's like one of those tendencies to step on the cracks and grooves of sidewalks, it just feels like the natural thing to do at this stage.  I think we can all agree on r/leaves that we all believe it's the natural time to quit/cut back/change perspectives regardless of the situation we came from which is basically 'I SMOKE TOO MUCH WEED'.  
 
Yeah, don't let the media and other ents fool ya.  This shit is MAD addicting. Good luck in your endeavors, not only with this but with the other shit going on in your lives as well.

Lemme know how it goes. I want to hear you fail so I feel better when I fail. I want to hear you succeed because that might just be the catalyst for change in myself or other members or r/leaves. I know I'll probably relapse tonight, I'm on day 1 of many day 1's. I just can't find a GOOD reason to quit. Just like how I can't bring myself to learn juggling, I simply don't give a shit enough to try. Yeah sure I can read some wiki's and watch some youtube tutorials on how to juggle, but at the end of the day, I simply don't give enough of a shit.  Ideas are dangerous, if one thing is pointless, all things are pointless, and life just becomes depressing when there is nothing to strive for that interests you. So we just go out and find interests, right? Yippee. Or let ourselves be manipulated into liking something we don't really like by a shrink or family? See, look what my 12 hour tolerance break has done to me. I came out of lurker state to post some depressing shit.

I can't even tell what's worse, the weed or no weed :(

-edit-

fuck weed seriously. as soon as i submitted this, i tried to convince my gf that i needed to pick up a gram (JUST A GRAM YO!) to reward myself for trying to quit. i have never wanted to quit this badly in my life. tbh, i have never wanted to SMOKE SOME so badly in my life either. it's only 6pm. this day is way too long...

-edit 2-

my go to dispensary is closed. day 1 over. anxious as a mofo, but kinda glad on the inside I pulled through today without too much hassle. reading people's struggles on r/leaves really helped. DAT STRUGGLE YO!"

I smoke weed almost every night, sometimes I will during the day, but I like to cap my night off with it. Sativa strains help my stress and anxiety a lot until I begin to think about my ex-girlfriend (she broke up with me 2 weeks ago, was with me 1.5 years), then I get extreme anxiety for a little bit. Indica is even worse for me, because all I get is a body high and get tired and go to bed, and I don't like that feeling very much. 

I'm a freshman in college, I work about 25-30 hours a week plus my 13 credit hours (4 classes). I get pretty stressed out sometimes when I have a test or something and about money, but I make good grades and stay focused on what I need to do. My parents and family do not help me out financially, so I do actually have to work. I have an awesome internship next semester, and I'm worried that when I start that I won't be making enough to get by, and that makes me EXTREMELY nervous, so I've picked up selling a little bit to a few friends and their buddies (like 1/8 or 1/4, nothing big). 

I think I'm going to go to the doctor on my campus, but I just wanted a little advice. I'm a very healthy individual, but I just don't know what to do about these little anxiety attacks. I get so worked up sometimes that I get PISSED and generally overwhelmed and want to rip my hair out. This could also stem from playing football for 12 years and not being able to release stress that way anymore. I've picked up fighting (boxing, jiu jitsu), and that helps a little, and I lift weights every day. Just some thoughts would be helpful. 

A few questions I have are below:

What's the difference between stress and anxiety?
Is it good to smoke weed when I'm feeling like this?
If anyone else has been through something similar, could you please share your story?

TL;DR: Not sure whether I'm having stress problems or anxiety, but I'd like it to stop. "

I'm a male, 24 years old, my girlfriend is 25. In a few days it'll be 1 year since we met. I've had a lot of women in my life, but when I first met her I knew she'd be one I'd love to settle with, eventhough I'm quite young. We had the most perfect start of a relationship, she felt the same, we bonded really well. 

At new year's we decided to do shrooms, it was an incredible experience for both. To cut the story short, two weeks pass and she's in severe psychosis. At that time I needed to graduate as software engineer and go on a half year internship. I postponed to stay with her and help her. Except for medicine, she didn't get any professional help. It's been a very stressful half year for me, constant depression and suicide threats on her part. I stayed with her no matter what. Quite soon I started to develop severe hypnagogia due to the extreme stress. This goes on a few months and she finally is entered into a psych ward where she could get proper treatment. The same day I start my graduation internship, I visit her every day. The stress of my internship and her situation is really getting to me at this point, I'm starting to feel confused and notice I'm having delusional thoughts. This goes on another two month. I finally crack after several panic attacks mid-day, my doctor diagnoses mild psychosis. We decide it's better if I stop visiting and focus on my internship. 

She returns home from treatment a two months later, we decided I need my space to get myself together. She's on anti-depressants and is doin g alot better, she's improved herself rapidly. With that load of my back I'm still struggling, as last resort (I tried multiple things) I start to smoke weed, figuring the Cannabidiol will work as antagonist for the THC my brain naturally produces. It works, my thoughts get clearer. I come home from internship, eat at her place, go to mine, we sleep together (we live in the same flat). We get by and times can be fun, but we regularly argue and it always ends in me telling her that I sacrificed a great deal for her wellbeing and her telling me I bailed on her when she was in therapy (stopped visiting).

To cut this long story short again, few weeks ago I decided to stop smoking, it's obvisouly having an impact on our relationship as I've become very apathic due to the weed. We decide to stop eating together and only sleep together on weekends. We're starting to have a better time again. Instead of being forced to be together I actually like spending time with her again. Last night we argue again, she says she needs time to think about our relationship. I can tell shes very keen on breaking up.

What do I do? I know it might be better to get out of this relationship but there's so much invested she doesn't even recognize. I know I've made mistakes and been very apathic and really did bail on her in some way. I'm about to graduate in a few days and I'm sure afterwards we could spent better time together.

Can do graphics, office work, run errands for you, watch your kids, walk your dog, whatever else.",[deleted],london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/12vakj/for_hire_i_think_this_got_eaten_by_the_spam/,"Hey. I'm a 20-year-old student studying abroad in London, and as the semester nears its close, I've found myself broke as hell. I've adapted a rice-and-pasta cheap diet and cut almost completely back on going out, but I'm still just about broke. The dollars-to-pounds exchange has got me, plus the fact that while here, I just have been attending classes and doing my unpaid internship for credit (which has resulted in, obviously, no income since I've arrived.) I'm here until December 16th, though, so I can't just wait it out.

This is where you may come in, if you are so inclined. I can do lots of things, and have, and here's a few:
	
* 1. **Graphic design**: I'm an art direction ad major at school and can whip up nice-looking flyers, logos, brochures, etc. for way cheap. If you want to see a portfolio, let me know. I won't claim that I'm a seasoned designer, but I know what I'm doing--I've been using Photoshop since I was ten years old, and have made loads of billboards and flyers that people have liked. I can make your band's concert poster/office luncheon flyer/business card/whatever else look pretty spiffy, at a really good price.
* 2. **Dog-walking**: I've been a dog owner (of a huge Plotthound mix) for 8 years and dog-walked professionally this summer. (Let me know if you need a reference.) Have a dog? Want it to get exercise while you're at work or away? I will gladly walk that dog, play with him/her, feed 'em, the whole lot.
* 3. **Babysitting**: This is a long shot, since I haven't seen a single ""babysitter for hire"" flyer around, so I assume people in London primarily use special babysitting services. But, I do have references. I cared for a 3-month-old infant this summer (well, she was 4/5 months by the time I finished, since she aged with time--odd, I know) and took American Red Cross babysitting courses back home. I have done lots of work with kids, including working at a camp with 5-9 year olds and working a kid's birthday party place. Kids love me and I love 'em. If you have a child, I will watch him or her for you while you go about your life. I can also be a ""mother's helper,"" (or father's helper) although I don't know if that phrase exists in the UK-- basically, I can watch your kid/s and help you out if you are home and very busy (entertaining guests, throwing a kids' birthday party, working on something.)
* 4. **Copy-editing:** This Reddit post doesn't exactly show it, but I'm very good at catching other people's typos and grammatical slip-ups. My dad's an editor in America and has drilled his skills into my head over the years. I have experience doing this for pay, as well (once again, ask me for a reference if needed.) I can read through your large blocks of text and make sure everything is readable, grammatically sound, and typo-free.
* 5. **Singing:** No idea how this would come in handy, but I am a trained singer and can perform for you if you need someone at a party or something. (...Can you tell I'm grasping at straws?) In case you see this and actually need a performer for an event or to sing a jingle or something, let me know and I'll send you some videos of me doing my thing.
* 6. **Office work/errands/assistant:** I've had a ton of internships in my relatively short life, and all of them have involved my carrying out the commands of people. I can type things up for you, (I can type extremely quickly) file things, run errands for you, organize shelves or something, get you lunch, make phone calls, or whatever else it is you need. I've got a good amount of work experience with things like this, so you name it and I'll help you out.
* 7. **Whatever else:** Let's say you've really needed someone to paint your living room walls, or water your plants, or label your salt and pepper shaker collection by color. I'll do it. Look no further.
If you have anything even tangentially related to the things I just talked about, let me know. Any help is appreciated. Even a one-off thing would help me. I love this city, and it's a bummer being here with only a few pounds in my pocket. I've got a positive disposition and I promise I'm pleasant to be around.

Thanks for reading :)

",robotrock1382,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12v1q2/reddit_its_getting_to_be_a_little_too_much_for_me/,"This is my first post, and if it goes for awhile I apologize. For most of my life I've struggled with depression. From age 3 I stuttered. From the time I entered school to before I began to become comfortable with myself I was bullied and picked on. Most days of high school I was beaten up and called every name in the book. It culminated in me not going to school my junior year for about 3 months because I couldn't handle the stress. About six years ago i tried to kill myself. This wasn't the first time. In 5th grade I told my mom I planned on hanging myself when she went to bed. Six years ago I met the absolute most amazing person ever. We plan to get married next year. Herein lies the problem. I'm currently in school for a Process Enginerring degree. I'm supposed to graduate in May. For the last year about I've been unemployed. About a month ago I finally found a job at Domino's Pizza. Not the best job but i was optimistic this would help as I continued in school and trying to find an internship with a chemical plant. This hasn't been going well. I quit the Pizza job because I suspected my manager of stealing my tips ( One night i was $70 short ). I also do alot of work for a major non profit group and its amazing. However, things seem to be piling up. For the last 3 years while in school I lived with my father and grandmother. Her and I were EXTREMELY close. In March, it was my birthday ( 30th ) and that same month we had to piut my Grandmother into a nursing home. This was difficult on us, but on me and my aunt especially. I went most days to spend time with her, knowing the end wasn't far off for her. When her health got even worse, we started making plans. Right now I'm still sharing her old house with my dad. Our relationship is ok, but he is very hard to deal with. His life is also falling apart. He's been told to expect to lose his job in the next few months, and as much as he wants to try to buy the house from my aunt and uncle, he likely will not be able to. 3 Saturday's ago my Grandmother passed away. My uncle, who's in charge of the fianancing, is pushing immediately for the house to be put on the market and sold ( it got appraised 2 days after her service.) It seems obvious that in the next few months I likely won't have a place to live. Next, on my way to school yesterday my car basically stopped working and i had to pull over. I'm pretty sure it's the transmission. Maybe you can see where this is going. I have literally no money to pay for this, and I'm terrified I will have to drop out of school. Also the fact that I'm trying so hard to find a job and graduate and help pay for our wedding is mounting in my head. I literally have almost no one to ask for help, but i do have some support. Everyone is telling me to be positive, which I am trying, but I feel like I'm the only one being even remotely realistic about my current situation. Yesterday I told my fiancee i was thinking about taking my own life, and naturally this upset her very much. I tend to go to the worst place with things go wrong, but this time it just feels different. I don't see anyway out of this. Usually I can wake up with a clear head and do my best to resolve this, but I fear my resolve to fix this and the inner strength I've had has been taking away. After the episode yesterday my fiancee forced me to find a grief counselor online for free ( which was a good idea ). Even that fell short though because the numbers I found were old and disconnected and apparently Grief counseling isn't cheap. I'm not looking for a hand out or anything else, I just need some advice and to be able to get all of this out. I'm having a really, really difficult time and my options are closing in on me and I don't know what to do. Thank you reddit for listening"
12ugt2,6,2012-11-08,"I Don't want to give up on my life-long passion, but I see no other option.",PassionForPropulsion,aerospace,https://www.reddit.com/r/aerospace/comments/12ugt2/i_dont_want_to_give_up_on_my_lifelong_passion_but/,"I graduated from a University that sits easily inside the top 10 in the country for engineering, top 5 if you look specifically at aerospace engineering. The problem is, I struggled to get through almost every engineering-specific class I took, with the exception of a select few that I was extremely interested in (mostly related to propulsion). I would have switched majors, but I have never wanted to work in any other field, anything else would be giving up on my dreams, and therefore, life. I looked into internships, but when the summers came around, I ended up staying in summer-school to help me graduate without putting myself and my family into a crushing amount of debt. As a result, I haven't had any internships within the industry, and I'm finding out now, that companies won't give them to you unless you're actively enrolled in school.

I graduated with a GPA of 2.04, and have been living at home in a state with zero aerospace opportunities, saddled with insane amounts of out-of-state debt, working for a paltry $11/hr doing retail completely unrelated aerospace, for over two years now. I've been looking, and networking, even spending the little I can afford to go to aerospace conferences to network, and hopefully try to find someone within the industry who will give me a chance. 

I've known since the beginning of my sophomore year that my grades weren't going to be my strong point and spent the rest of my college life doing everything I could to make up for that. For four years I was on a team that worked to develop a rocket entirely under sparse sponsorship funding with the end goal of making it past the Kármán line, I've designed components from the ground up, analyzed failures, made significant advances in total integration, and redesigned entire systems, all as a part of an extra curricular activity. I was even the team leader of my senior design project. I stand behind the fact that even in comparison to my peers who had far better GPA's than me, I have hands on experience that was invaluable to my understanding of aerospace and its application far above what they learned in school.

So here is what is going on for me, 2 years out of school. Last December (2011) (1 yr, 4 mo out of school), I ordered 10 grams of synthetic cannabis online wanting to try it as I had been abstaining from any substance due to drug testing in the industry. I had smoked natural cannabis while I was in school, mostly on weekends, and some nights after class as a way to relieve stress and anxiety from all the pressure.

A short synopsis of what happened next:
The Department of Homeland security intercepted my shipment in December (before the substance I ordered was actually illegal), and held onto it until January (once it was made illegal). Right before February, the local police executed a controlled delivery and subsequently a ""no-knock"" search warrant on my home where I was living with my father. Thankfully I was the only person home, but I had 5-6 police officers pointing loaded weapons at my head with 3 of them screaming conflicting instructions at me. I'm lucky as hell to be alive.

After several months of legal battles with a privately hired lawyer (I would have been *completely* screwed with a public defender), I am now on a program referred to as ""first-offender probation"".

The way things stand now, as long as I make it through these two years, my record is sealed (not expunged). Apparently, they made synthetic cannabis a felony as apposed to a misdemeanor (it took months of negotiation to even avoid 3 months of jail). For a while, I faced a 1-3 year sentence.

Regardless, my situation at the moment is untenable. My father lives with his girlfriend and son, and is constantly quick to anger over minor problems, thereby causing me anxiety-attack inducing stress. I need to be able to afford to live on my own, and soon.



Right now, I have stopped applying for aerospace jobs. If a company does a background check on you and finds out you're a felon, there is absolutely no legal recourse for you to have that removed from their private system. Publicly, It's a sealed record, but before it's sealed, the company can save your record in a database and forever prevent you from doing what you love.


So, after the most long-winded explanation ever (there are still more details), here is where I'm at.






A Place in my hometown is extremely interested in hiring me, I've got a really good shot at getting this position because it's a family company, and one of the two owners has been in a situation very similar to mine. The problem is, this company is entirely unrelated to aerospace, and I'm not sure how I would ever get back to aircraft/spacecraft design after the 3-5 years I would owe them. The starting pay is ~40k and currently that is 2-3 times what I make with my hourly salary over a year. It would be enough I could at least move out of my fathers house and start a life of my own.

My major conflict however, is the person I have been speaking to at a major aerospace company for the last two years. This is the one networking connection that I can say has gone extremely well, and he has recently been placed at the head of a hiring committee for said aerospace company. We have a good relationship, but my worry is that if I tell him everything that has happened, it will ruin it. At the same time, however, if I tell him, he could be the person who gives me the chance I need.

What I am worried about, is if he selects me as someone who he wants for the position the company will certainly do a background check, and the company will have that on file for the rest of my life.

So, after much explanation. Is it better to take a position completely unrelated to your passions with the hope of eventually getting back to what you have always wanted to do. Or is it better to hold out until any legal fuck-ups are behind you and then try to apply again being many years out with just the promise that you will do an excellent job for them.

What should I do?

Tl;Dr: Please just read it, yeah, it's long as hell, but it's the only way to understand the choice I'm looking for input on.


EDIT: Thank you all for your responses and support. I honestly had no clue how this self post would turn out or what I would hear. I really appreciate all of the reassurance that this is not the end of the road for my aspirations.

It's taken a long time to try and get past the initial shock of everything that happened and the ""My life is ruined"" feeling of it all. I've got my last interview with the local company coming up next week. I'm not going to turn down any opportunity at this point. If all goes well, after a few years I can start reasonably looking at grad school and future employment without the legal record."
12ugcp,10,2012-11-08,I can't.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/12ugcp/i_cant/,"Seriously, I just can't. I can't handle any of this shit. I can't handle work and classes and being involved in activities plus all the psychotic things going on back home. These classes will be the death of me. I realize computers are something a lot of kids are passionate about, and that a lot of them have taught themselves practically everything there is to know. I've taken the prereqs for the damn course; I don't know anything that anyone's talking about. All the other kids in my group do, because they've spent who knows how much of their free time previously (not this term, like in high school and at internships and stuff) learning it. There's no way for me to catch up. There's way too much and since it's group-directed, I can't even ask the professor or TA what I should read up on. My teammates said I shouldn't be taking the course if I haven't had an internship before- THAT IS NOT A PREREQUISITE.


And I can't *help* any of the crazy things going on back home. It's not my life, and there's nothing I can do to convince him not to take his. I was going to actually get some things done tonight since I'm busy tomorrow from 9 a.m. straight through 1 a.m. but then he drunkenly Facebook messaged me and of course I had to talk to him. 


He's my recently (in the past, or so I thought) suicidal brother, damnit. If he wants to talk, be it about mindless shit or not, I'm going to talk to him. Then his best friend, who absolutely hates my guts, messaged me. Telling me he was worried about my brother. By the time this guy is messaging me, things have gotten serious. I had thought he was mostly better. I was apparently mistaken. 


Now I can't focus and I spent a good 2 hours talking to the 2 of them. I don't think I can get everything I have to get done done. I'm worried sick, trying not to relapse into bad habits myself, and there is nothing I can do to help him. Believe me, I tried everything before. I *tried* for fuck's sake. I'm trying. What the fuck more does everyone want from me? What more do I want from myself?"

My first love and I are going to be attending the same program and I just don't know what to think.,Burned_by_Burn_Victm,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12ub6m/how_would_you_want_a_guy_who_you_have_a_weird/,"We're both 20

To make a long story short, me and a girl were really close friends, started hooking up, and then she freaked out and basically stopped talking to me. At the time I didn't really have a lot else going on in my life, and the way our relationship had gone devastated me every minute of every day. She was my first love. You can read some post I made at the height of my depression/angst about the situation here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/sllap/i_got_really_close_to_an_emotional_burn_victim/

Anyway, a lot has changed since then. Over the summer I devoted my self to all sorts of self improvement stuff, a lot of which was about being more social and getting out more, and this semester I've been very successfully implementing all of that. I'm a lot happier now, but this girl still crosses my mind almost every day. She's really friendly when she sees me around, and we've hung out (with other people) but she still won't talk to me alone for more than a few minutes, and we haven't at all brought up anything that happened last year. 

So as it turns out, we're both going to be leaving this campus to go to the same program next semester. We're going to be living in the same dorm (these are small dorms, that will only house like, 30 people.) We're going to be in some of the same classes. We may even be in some of the same research internships. 

I just don't know how I'm going to be able to handle this, and more importantly, I don't know how she wants me to handle it. Does she want me to remain silent about last year? That makes me uncomfortable, but seems to be her intent. I guess my question is mostly for general advice, but really about how I should confront this situation. Thank you."

12uaeg,28,2012-11-07,How do I finally have that conversation with my dad that's way overdue?,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/12uaeg/how_do_i_finally_have_that_conversation_with_my/,"So, some back story is probably needed. My dad was adopted, grew up in a home where love was scarce, but discipline was high. He's always felt cheated that he didn't get what he deserved out of a father, and I guess in a way, that's how I feel, too. My dad's a unique one. When I was two, he and my mom divorced because he was cheating on her and was physically and emotionally abusive. His mentality seems to be firmly rooted in partying like it's '82 and he's still in high school. He's quick to anger and takes out his frustrations on his loved ones. Growing up, he would see me once every other weekend. I'd spend the weekend with him, and unfortunately, the memories I have aren't great. He would leave me outside of the house his drug dealers lived in while he got fucked up. As I got older, he would work with me on baseball and football. He wanted me to be a stud, as he saw himself, and I did have some athletic talent. He would be abusive in his learning methods, however. I loved baseball, but to this day, I can't step up to bat even in a recreational softball co-ed league without shaking slightly. He scared me shitless. 

When we would practice, if I did something wrong, he would go off the handle. He would throw balls at me at full speed. He never invested in building me up in a healthy manner. He never sat me down and taught me how to be a man, because he himself didn't know. He talks now of the ""fun"" camping trips we used to go on. It was never fun. He was always drunk, and it scared me. He got into fights with me around, one time, almost getting shot in a road rage incident. I was so afraid of him. I dreaded weekends with him. Once, at a little league game when I was about 12, I struck out. I came back to the dugout, shaken and scared, and my dad was in a rage. He started screaming at me to suck it up, to stop crying. He pinned me to the fence, and my mother and grandparents had to come to my rescue. It was a huge deal. It embarrassed me and my family so much, we never returned to the park, even though I was being scouted for a travel team. Coaches didn't want me on their teams because he was a liability. He would cuss them out, attempt to fight them, and ruined any shot I had at going anywhere in my area with sports. 

Fast-forward to being 15. I had stopped going over to his place on the weekends, and he got diagnosed with Leukemia. I didn't see him much. I hated going to visit him at the hospital. He always accused me of not loving him and not caring and not visiting enough. I stopped contacting him for a few months. He recovered from being sick, but his mental health degraded. He stopped working and collected disability. He became abusive to my stepmother and my half brothers. He drank constantly.

I finally reestablished contact with him, in the weirdest way possible one night. I had always known after about 12 that he was a big pot smoker. I didn't hate it, because when he smoked, he mellowed out and was decent to be around. I had tried pot a few times, but this time, I smoked way too much for my own good. I had a massive anxiety attack, and called him around 3 in the morning, and had a friend drop me off. I was seeking his fatherly advice, his comfort, his leadership. Instead, he told me to drink a glass of water and sleep it off. The next morning, we smoked. It was weird. We bonded, but I lost all respect for him as a leader and a father figure. We smoked occasionally, and would play madden. A weird friendship formed. 

When I was 18, he relapsed. He once again had to face the painful chemo and thought he was going to die. His mental state yet again degraded further. I didn't see him much because I was just starting college, and he yet again blamed me for not loving him and caring. One day, I tried to have the conversation with him about our past and how I felt, and he dismissed it. He got super defensive, saying I was ungrateful at how hard he tried. He wouldn't let me say my peace, and I was afraid that he would die, and our relationship would go unresolved.

During this time, I started to have my own bouts with depression. I felt like I had no leader to turn to, that I was worthless and broken, that something was missing that was supposed to drive me forward and guide me in my quest in becoming a man, and this time was crucial, and he wasn't there, nor in any capacity to lead. I sunk and almost flunked out of college, I got into bad habits with pain pills and alcohol, and I tried to wash away my pain. 

He survived his second bout with cancer. I was relieved, but our relationship was still weird and fragmented. We would smoke occasionally and hang out. I finally had a life changing night with some friends that made me shelve my anxiety, my depression, my worthless feelings, and start to lead myself, so to speak. It was the breaking point, do or die. I got my grades back up, I kicked the pills and drinking to the curb, and I realized my goals in life weren't going to be met if I didn't clean up. I also came into some financial hardship, and for the first time in my life, I found myself living with my Dad, as it was closer to college than my Mom.

Things got interesting. We would smoke more, and we had a good buddy buddy friendship going. But it wasn't a father son relationship, and it was still hurting me. I wanted to be able to look to him for leadership, instead, I found myself taking the responsibilities as man of the house, leading my brothers, and helping my step mom with my deadbeat drunk of a father. He and I clashed occasionally, but nothing major. 

Finally, at about 21, I had a new relationship, school was on track, and I was getting things done. I had started to give up on the want and need of having a father son relationship, and embraced the fucked up friendship we had. One night however, I had worked a double and asked my step mom to save me some food. When I got home, there was fat dad, sitting on the couch, high, eating my dinner. I asked him if there was any left, and he said ""nope! Haha!"". The combination of tired, hungry, and years of emotional abuse finally overwhelmed me. I called him out on everything I could think of. I lost myself in emotion, and he responded equally in kind, saying things like, ""Well fuck you fatass, you'll never be as great as I was at your age."" ""I was fucking women left and right and my bench press and squat was x and y, you're just a fucking pussy!"". I told him to fuck off, went into the garage and grabbed a gatorade, resigning myself to have it and a smoke for dinner, and go to bed. When I re-entered the kitchen, he was waiting there. He threw a glass at me, and I dodged it and returned fire with the Gatorade. I have never felt more blinded by rage. My blood felt red hot, time slowed down to a crawl, and I could feel the tension in my muscles building like a cascading wave of destruction. I closed the distance of about 10 feet in what felt like less than a second, and let loose a right hook that would of made Ali proud. I caught him, square, right across the right cheek, and made sure to punch through my target to inflict as much pain as I could. I channeled the years of abuse, the anger I felt toward him abusing my mother, the anger I felt toward him abusing my step-mother, my brothers, the life he cheated me out of. I threw every ounce of rage into that punch, and I knocked him out cold.

My brother was standing there watching, shocked, not knowing what to say. I told him to call me if there were any problems, gathered my clothes, and let the tears stream. I grabbed my keys and left. I had one of the hardest nights of my life that evening, wrestling so many pent up emotions back down, or trying to release them. I wanted him dead, I wanted to beat the life from him, but at the same time, all I wanted was his approval, his love, his direction. I wanted a father, not a smoking buddy.

A few weeks passed and he called me. He said we were cool, shit happens. Ever since then, it's been really just kinda of chill. I think the punch helped me escape some demons temporarily. However, this last year of my life has been particularly trying. I've been finishing up college, working two jobs, and had an internship. It's been hard to stay motivated, as I'm trying to teach myself discipline. My dad's mental state has continued to deteriorate. He calls me once a week telling me he's going to kill himself, breaking down into tears about how no one loves him, and I just feel empty. Of course I love him, *he's my damn father*, but only by title. He's never acted the way that I see my friend's fathers act. They are the undisputed rulers of their household. They instilled great work ethic and other qualities into my friends. They're great husbands. Why couldn't he of done that? He was completely capable. 

I find myself now on the cusp of starting my own life. I'm 23, about to graduate, have a 4.0 this semester, and interviews with two companies a week for a job after school. I'm in the gym and losing weight. I'm trying to teach myself good habits. Still, the pain and the emptiness is there. Some days, after a week of balls to the wall effort, I crash. I have no motivation. I can't find it to strive on. All I want in those times, is to have Dad to call. When I think about that, it crushes me. I'll never have it.

I want to express these things to my dad. I want to talk to him and find comfort, find refuge and healing. I want a father, not a friend, but I'm not sure he'll ever be capable of recovering. His mental state and alcoholism have ruined who he is. He no longer scares me, but he crushes me without even knowing it I guess. How do I do this? He's damn near unreachable. He's throwing away everything. My brothers hate him. My step-mom is trying to figure out how to rid him of her life. He has no one else. He's chased away everyone that has ever loved him, and I just want him to stop. I want him to turn it around. Any man can fall a number of times, but the crucial part is getting back up.

TL;DR - How do I get him to get back up, to express my feelings to him about the issues from my childhood and recent years, and get him to start acting like a real fucking man?"

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12snka/quit_smoking_318_days_ago_started_running_in_june/

I was told that you guys might want to hear my story.  Also I got quite a few questions about how I quit, so I'd rather direct those people here than give half-assed responses.  I also heard that some people don't like the term ""quit"" and prefer ""stop"", so forgive me, you know what I mean.  I'm sure I'll forget something here, so feel free to ask for clarification and I'll be happy to expand.  I hope this can help someone, or at least not hurt anyone...

I started smoking freshman year of college and pretty much went right to a pack a day, where I stayed for about 6 years (I smoked more when beer was involved, which was and still is often).  My mother smoked when I was young, but she quit cold turkey.  One of my sisters smoked for years and she was able to quit.  My Dad picked up smoking during the time that I smoked, so that was weird.

This was NOT my first attempt at quitting.  I've tried a variety of things, mostly nicotine replacements.  They ALL have their disadvantages.  The patch is great for getting you through the whole day/night, especially if you wear it through the night, that way it takes away the morning craving.  BUT it gives you Die Hard dreams.  No joke.  The gum/lozenges will give you miserable hiccups if you swallow too much.  The e-cigarette was fun, but my friends also found it fun on New Years Eve when we were all drunk, so that got lost.  Next morning I was screwed and bought a pack.  Chantix was an insanely difficult prescription to get.  My college's health center refused to prescribe it, saying they didn't believe in ""miracle drugs"".  A nurse practitioner finally gave me a script and it got me down to 1 cigarette a day.  It was fascinating, the way it made you feel sick while you smoked.  Really the only thing that compelled you to smoke was habit, not addiction.  The side-effects can be intense, and I made them the scapegoat around finals time and ditched the meds.

I didn't give serious thought to quitting again until one of the maintenance people at the building where I had an internship asked me ""what are you going to do when you get a real job and can't smoke all the time?"".  Of course, I've been begged by family and friends to quit smoking for years, in all matters of coercion and bribery, but there was something about that matter-of-fact question that shook me.  So I vowed to quit on xmas day (partially so i could call it a gift to my family, but I was poor so that was just an excuse.  You have to quit for yourself), which was a few weeks away.

I told everyone at work and all of my family.  My family was cautiously optimistic, but supportive.  But for some reason I really wanted to be able to come back to work and tell those people that I did it.  That gave me some fuel.  I didn't crush up my remaining cigs, and I kinda hate when I see that.  I did that once and ended up digging them out of the trash and trying to smoke the ends.  Smoke your last cig, plan for it.  Enjoy it, remember it.

That first day is the hardest.  The second day is the second hardest.  The third day is the third hardest.  You get the idea.  But each day is a day you NEVER have to go through again if you stick with it.  Think to yourself, ""man, this sucks today, but at least I'll never have to do it again if I can get through it.""  Before you know it, it gets way easier.

I did end up using the gum.  But I cut the amount of nicotine in half from day 1 (so from 20 mg from cigarettes to 10 mg from the gum).  When I did use the gum, it was only for temporary relief.  Never use it to satisfy.  I used to make a game out of seeing how long I could go without using the next piece.  You'll surprise yourself.  That game can last you anywhere from another 10 minutes, 2 hours, 12 hours, a whole day.... it just compounds!

The hardest challenge was driving back from my parent's after the holidays, which was a 13 hour drive.  I was definitely a chain-smoker on road trips, so this was tough.  But I used the game of stretching out my pieces of gum to get through it (NPR helps too!).  You'll always have to learn how to do stuff without cigarettes, so don't let that be an excuse.  Soon it will turn into a positive thing.  For example, this weekend was the first time I got sick since I quit smoking, and I recovered much faster than I would've as a smoker!

For the next month, I let myself go a little.  I got obsessed with an MMORPG called Star Wars: The Old Republic for more than a month (which is a little uncharacteristic of me).  I ate terribly, but it kept me quit.  Once I hit the level cap in that game I got frustrated and rage quit.  That was a turning point in which I realized that I could start exercising again and actually see some results from quitting.  I started making little changes in my diet that I could sustain.  I started reading lots of NerdFitness.com and trying different workouts to find what I liked.  By June I discovered running and I haven't stopped since!

Quitting was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it's given me the power to change anything I want in my life.  These changes have just piled on over the months and I'm a totally different person!  I think there's a lot of shame involved with being a smoker today, and don't let that get to you too much.  By overcoming the addiction, you're not just becoming a non-smoker.  You've overcome one of the most difficult addictions out there, and now you can do anything you want!

But don't worry about that now, just do what you need to do to quit."

12txgc,3,2012-11-07,Where do you expect to meet guys you want to be friends with?,mypasswordisnot1234,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12txgc/where_do_you_expect_to_meet_guys_you_want_to_be/,"I'm a graduate student, recently turned 25, and I haven't really been with any ladies since high school. For the most part of my college career I was fine with it, most of my classes were hard and I just didn't have time to be with a girl (don't have a job for the same reason, except for internships during summer break). Now that I'm getting close to finishing school I want to improve my social life that has taken a nosedive recently. For some reason I just can't make friends with people unless I know them through school, and when I started my graduate program many of my old friends went on to do other things, so I'm starting to feel a little lonely right now. 

* **School** - There are almost no girls in my classes, and while I had no problem getting to know the few I see all the time, they all are in healthy relationships. I spend time with them outside of school, but only as a group with other friends, no situations where it's just the two of us. I did go to the movies a couple of times with one of them, but that's different since we don't have to interact, it was just so we didn't have to go alone.
* **Bars** - I have been to bars near campus with my friends a couple times, but when spending time with my friends I don't really notice other people. Because of this I also don't know which bars are popular with people my age. Tried going to some of them on my own, but it's mostly older people there, plus groups of students celebrating someone's birthday, which makes it impossible to get involved for me.
* **Clubs** - This is the hardest one for me, for a couple of reasons. I'm fine with my looks, but I'm not overly attractive (5'9"", about 120 lbs, not too skinny but not really athletic either, glasses), and clubs are mainly about looks. Usually there's too much going on to just talk to someone, so looks always come first. Also I realize most of the time women don't go to clubs all alone, in general a good idea, but this makes it hard for us non-douchebags to approach them. Girl is with a guy, looks at me, all smiles, I go talk to her, guy gets mad at me. Girl is with a group of friends, doesn't even notice me. Girl is with another girl, all they ever do is look at people and giggle. And I'm not sure if I actually want to be with girls that expect to find their friends at clubs, I'm not into partying hard, drugs, excessive amounts of alcohol and all that stuff. 
* **Everyday life** - Situations are coming up all the time, but they pass just as quickly. In closed spaces, bus, train etc., I feel like a creeper when talking to women, because they're basically trapped, if they don't like me they can't get away. And just walking in the streets they are gone before I can even say a whole sentence, unless I have something to hook them, which I usually don't. 
* **Internet** - I live in Europe, English is not even my native language, so spending time on (mainly) English communities is not helping me finding real friends. There's almost noone using okcupid in my country, and while we have professional dating sites they cost money and are mainly targeted at 30+ yo people. I'm not a big fan of social media, I don't even have a facebook, only a few IM accounts to stay in touch with my internet friends from all over the place. But it's hard to find people near me this way, so I never get to meet most of them. Very few are female and my age anyway, so I'm not expecting to hook up with someone I meet on the internet right now.

**TLDR** I'm the smart guy people want to spend time with in school because they can always come and ask me, and I'll make sure they pass their classes, but I have few friends and especially no girls that just want to spend time with me when it's not about school. Women of reddit, where/how would I meet you (when you're not on reddit obviously)?"
12xulp,11,2012-11-09,Question regarding internships before accounting classes,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/12xulp/question_regarding_internships_before_accounting/,"Hey /r/accounting, I've been lurking here for awhile as an early accounting student and I've come upon a situation where I could use some of your input.  

My situation: I'm a 25 year old junior, and I've recently been accepted into the accounting and finance degree programs at my university.  Both of these fields begin with sequenced classes starting fall term, and I've been accepted going into winter term.  So, I won't really be starting my accounting or finance degree classes in earnest until fall term *next* year (then slated to graduate end of winter term - March 2015).  

My question: My advisor today suggested I should try to find an internship for this coming summer - though it's *before* I actually start External Reporting in the fall.  Do any of you have any recommendations as to what type of internship I should be looking for?  From what I understand, most of the internships in this field are geared towards students that have completed their first year of the accounting series.  Should I apply to more general internships, or are their some accounting or finance options I should explore?

Any help is greatly appreciated.  This sub has been an excellent resource to me, so regardless of this particular thread, I have to say thanks to all the contributors here!"
12xnq9,1,2012-11-09,"20 year old student abroad and broke. Can do graphics, office work, run errands for you, watch your kids, walk your dog, whatever else.",[deleted],london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/12xnq9/20_year_old_student_abroad_and_broke_can_do/,"Hey. I'm a 20-year-old female student studying abroad in London, and as the semester comes to a close I've found myself broke as hell. I've adapted a rice-and-pasta cheap diet and cut almost completely back on going out, but I'm still just about broke. I'm here until December 16th.

This is where you may come in, if you are so inclined. I can do lots of things, and have, and here's a few:
	
* 1. **Graphic design**: I'm an art direction ad major at school and can whip up nice-looking flyers, logos, brochures, etc. for way cheap. If you want to see a portfolio, let me know. I won't claim that I'm a seasoned designer, but I know what I'm doing--I've been using Photoshop since I was ten years old, and have made loads of billboards and flyers that people have liked. I can make your band's concert poster/office luncheon flyer/business card/whatever else look pretty spiffy, at a really good price.
* 2. **Dog-walking**: I've been a dog owner (of a huge Plotthound) for 8 years and dog-walked professionally this summer. (Let me know if you need a reference.) Have a dog? Want it to get exercise while you're at work or away? I will gladly walk that dog, play with him/her, feed 'em, the whole lot.
* 3. **Babysitting**: This is a long shot, since I haven't seen a single ""babysitter for hire"" flyer around, so I assume people in London primarily use special babysitting services. But, I do have references. I cared for a 3-month-old infant this summer (well, she was 4/5 months by the time I finished, since she aged with time--odd, I know) and took American Red Cross babysitting courses back home. I have done lots of work with kids, including working at a camp with 5-9 year olds and working a kid's birthday party place. Kids love me and I love 'em. If you have a child, I will watch him or her for you while you go about your life. I can also be a ""mother's helper,"" (or father's helper) although I don't know if that phrase exists in the UK-- basically, I can watch your kid/s and help you out if you are home and very busy (entertaining guests, throwing a kid's birthday party, working on something.)
* 4. **Copy-editing:** This Reddit post doesn't exactly show it, but I'm very good at catching other people's typos and grammatical slip-ups. My dad's an editor in America and has drilled his skills into my head over the years. I have experience doing this for pay, as well (once again, ask me for a reference if needed.) I can read through your large blocks of text and make sure everything is readable, grammatically sound, and typo-free.
* 5. **Singing:** No idea how this would come in handy, but I am a trained singer and can perform for you if you need someone at a party or something. (...Can you tell I'm grasping at straws?) In case you see this and actually need a performer for an event or to sing a jingle or something, let me know and I'll send you some videos of me doing my thing.
* 6. **Office work/errands/assistant:** I've had a ton of internships in my relatively short life, and all of them have involved my carrying out the commands of people. I can type things up for you, (I can type extremely quickly) file things, run errands for you, organize shelves or something, get you lunch, make phone calls, or whatever else it is you need. I've got a good amount of work experience with things like this, so you name it and I'll help you out.
* 7. **Whatever else:** Let's say you've really needed someone to paint your living room walls, or water your plants, or label your salt and pepper shaker collection by color. I'll do it. Look no further.
If you have anything even tangentially related to the things I just talked about, let me know. Any help is appreciated. Even a one-off thing would help me. I love this city, and it's a bummer being here with only a few pounds in my pocket. I've got a positive disposition and I promise I'm pleasant to be around.

Thanks for reading :)

12x4gq,1,2012-11-09,[25M] lost with with older [31F] after recent conversation.,MusMuc,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12x4gq/25m_lost_with_with_older_31f_after_recent/,"I met this person while they were an intern at the same company we are both currently at. We talked and hung out with the group after hours and outside of work. I started to like her and could see she felt the same. When we were alone I asked her what the deal was and she laid out that she didn't think it was fair to date a co-worker and she has been burned in the past by younger guys.

She was honest and I understood. We remained friends and kept talking. We had gotten to the point where we were talking every night and hanging out 2-3 times a week outside of work. It seemed that she was starting to open up to the idea and the possibility of getting physical soon. We were going to have our ""first date"" this weekend.

Yesterday everything stopped. No communication, nothing. I found out through a friend that at lunch she had asked him if I had anyone living with me and he answered yes. She shot me an email asking how much luch was and how my live in girlfriend was. Major WTF moment, I replied that I had a friend staying with me due to issues she was having with her roommate. I ran into her a few times and she won't even look at me.

Basically I don't know if I should just let it die or try to talk to her?

tl:dr:
Started off as friends, became closer, and now nothing after she found out another girl was living with me for a short time."

My school has a requirement that you complete 12 weeks of 'vacation work' before graduating and so I am beginning to worry. I do very well academically as I am in the top 5% of my classes with a weighted average score of 78%. I applied to about 20+ jobs this year and only received 1 interview which I was unsuccessful in despite being told that I interview very strongly. I later spoke to other applicants and learnt that 2 of the 5 positions went to girls with scores of 62% and 65%. I am confident in my resume as I have attended countless workshops with HR people in an effort to polish it up and I put in lots of time and effort into every application so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Next year I am going to have my hands full with my thesis and design projects so I can't imagine this application process going any better then and I'm worried I might finish all my coursework but I won't even be able to get a job/ degree out of it leaving me with 4 years of student loans and nothing to show for it. What should I do?

So I need to get something soon or I will probably fail the year, lose my grant, become homeless etc. I've been trying around but a lot of places seem to be iffy about it not going through the college coop office, and the bigger companies I cant get at.

12wgxc,2,2012-11-09,Would any Atlanta area filmmakers like to co-produce a documentary with me? (x-post from r/Atlanta),LovableContrarian,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/12wgxc/would_any_atlanta_area_filmmakers_like_to/,"Before I get into my proposal, let me tell you a little about myself. I could go on for hours talking about how I always wanted to direct movies as a child, but that's boring. Here's the specifics: I took 4 years of film classes in high school and always assumed I would to go film school. At some point, I realized that film school wasn't what was necessarily needed to be a filmmaker; making great films was about the ability to tell a story, not the ability to frame shots and hold lights. So, I recently graduated with a degree in International Relations from Emory University. The film bug never stopped biting me, however.

With that boring (albeit brief) self-bio out of the way, let me get to the meat of this post. After graduation, I applied for several grants, scholarships, internships, and apprenticeships. The funny thing about these, though, is that they are all very long-term in nature (as well as being extremely flaky). So, I found myself graduated and waiting for a career (the next closest internship makes their decision in 6 months). One thing was clear; I needed a part time job.

A friend of a friend of a friend owns a non-emergency elderly transport company. In a nutshell, he owns a fleet of vans that pick up elderly patients from their homes or nursing homes and takes them to doctors appointments. They wait for them in the waiting room, then take them home. Five days ago, I joined this company for part-time work as I wait for my ""real career"" to come through (a prospect I am sure most recent grads are all too familiar with).

So, now I get to my point. Every morning, I wake up, pick up elderly people, and drive them to their doctor's appointments, their family's homes, or even to restaurants to meet friends. Sometimes these rides last 15 minutes, sometimes I drive across state lines and drive for hours. In this time, there is nothing much else to do but chat. I talk to elderly folks about their families, their old jobs, their lives, their missed opportunities, their dreams, and overall, the meaning of life. I've only been on the job for 5 days, and already, these people have changed my life. Young people are desperately searching for the meaning of life, but these older people have already lived theirs. Sometimes they have stories of extreme regrets, and sometimes they have stories of extreme contentment and happiness.

Having a history in film, I felt almost selfish for listening to these stories myself. Many of these patients sit in a nursing home, alone, for weeks at a time. When I show up to drive them to the hospital, they jump at the opportunity to share their stories and wisdom with me. They know and understand things that young people could never know, and sadly they are often ignored in western culture. I want nothing more than to help these people share their stories with the world. If film audiences are anything like me, many of these stories and pieces of advice will move, inspire, and educate people on unexpected levels.

I may be a recent graduate with a part-time job, but my current mission has become clear. These stories need to be shared, and I am confident that a captivating documentary could result from simply setting up a camera in my van and ""interviewing"" these people.

Like I said, I have a background in filming, lighting, and editing. At the moment, though, I am a poor recent-grad with no film equipment. I am hoping that someone who owns this type of equipment could help me co-produce this documentary. I want to make it clear, though, that this is not a ""business"" proposition. I am not asking you to sign contracts and lease equipment; I am asking you to go on this journey with me. Depending on what we decide together, you can feel free to ride along and film interviews yourself. Decisions will be made together. Editing will be done together.

This is not a financial proposition. I am asking for interested parties to assist me in sharing the stories and wisdom of the elderly in the Atlanta area. I so desperately want to record the wisdom of these people before its too late. And, if you would spend a single day in my job position, you'd know (like I do) that the stories are engrossing, and the content is immense.

I realize that this concept is rather vague at the moment, but I am sincere and determined to complete this project. I am also rather well-versed in marketing, and I plan on taking this documentary to film festivals across this world when completed.

Yes, this is early in the process. But, this WILL happen, and I am asking for your help. My main goal is to start with filming as soon as possible, as every trip without a camera is a story lost.

Thank you for reading, and please respond or send me a message if you have any advice/comments/interest."

12wefu,1,2012-11-09,Sampling and estimating population proportions question,orichrome,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/12wefu/sampling_and_estimating_population_proportions/,"Hi there. I'm an undergraduate statistics student, currently working in analytics as an intern at a tech company. While working on a problem the other day, I used sampling to simplify, and was wondering if the reasoning behind my approach was legitimate.

Suppose we have a large population of people who may or may not perform an action in a day. We are interested in the percentage of people who perform the action in every hour of the day. A person can perform the action multiple times in a day, but are only counted once per hour. 

Here, I used the error term in the normal approximation binomial proportion CI as my sample error (seen here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval). Assuming the maximum variance (setting p-hat to be 0.5), and having a sample size of 10 000, solving gives a maximum error of 0.0098 with 95% confidence (z = 1.96). 

So, what I'd like to know is if this methodology is correct, and hence, with a sample size of 10 000, will I get the sample percentages to be within 0.98 percentage points of the true population percentages (95% of the time, that is)?

Thank you!"

12yu7n,0,2012-11-10,Sea Sheppard,[deleted],humor,https://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/12yu7n/sea_sheppard/,"
As Paul Watson’s head hit the pillow, the noise in his mind became louder. “How can I motivate these young Sea Sheppards?” he thought to himself. “What will it take for them to have the same zeal that I have”? Our world is being destroyed in front of us, and while there are plenty who are willing to help, we need to further our initiatives. Paul could feel the rocking of his boat as he pondered the day’s activities. The ship had been named “Steve Irwin” in honor of the deceased Australian wildlife expert and conservationist. A poster of Irwin hung on the walls of Captain Watson’s quarters. Some of the interns would mumble quiet whisperings about Waston’s strange attraction, seemingly sexual, to Irwin’s memory.

Earlier in the day, Watson could tell the motivation and moral of the ship crew was suffering. They had been out to sea for nearly three months, chasing down Japanese whaling ships in the Antarctic seas. It was cold, dangerous, and physically exhausting work. There were short spurts of excitement, usually dangerous in nature, followed by long boring sessions of inactivity. The crew was dedicated to its endeavors, but after all, most of them were volunteers, and growing tired of the unforgiving sea. The crew desired some personal space, a hot bath, and something to eat besides sea rations. The crew was quite skeptical of their Captain, as no matter how long he stayed at sea, he was always able to maintain his overweight stature. Surely he must have his own food stash, they would say. There’s no way he’s packing around an extra 100 lbs eating this canned garbage we attempt to hold down.

Watson awoke the following morning feeling less than refreshed. He knew something spontaneous, exhilarating, and moving would be needed to steer the crew back on track. Captain Watson reached under his bed, pulled out a box of Bugles chips, and began to place the corn cone shaped chips on his fingers, ever so slightly. When his fat fingers would crack the hardened chip, he would feel the same disappointment in himself as his father felt in him, when he was a young boy always being picked last for team sports. “Carefulness is of the utmost importance. When I am careful, father is happy, and will not berate me over dinner” he muttered to himself, as he placed the last Bugle Chip on his pinky finger. Watson gleamed with pride, and picked the Mr. Rogers bobble head doll from his nightstand, giving it a good shake as he sang “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, oh won’t you be mine”? He placed the toy back on his nightstand and sat giggling as he nibbled the Bugles from his fingers.

The crew began to stir, slowly. Watson could smell the coffee brewing, and he knew it was time. He sprang into his closet, and began to search through the many outfits. Today would require something special. Watson grabbed a camouflage ghillie suit. Ghillie suits are often used by military snipers when hiding behind enemy lines. He threw the suit over his massive frame. Next, he grabbed his globe. It was an old paper mache globe, similar to the ones you see in elementary class rooms. He tore the globe in half, and placed it over his belly, fastening it to himself with a string tied around the globe, and his back. Watson looked around, his eyes settling on a bamboo stick décor, resembling the horns of an animal. Fastening the mess to his head, he turned to the mirror.

You are men and women, who will no longer stuff your junk back in your pants. Today, from now on, you will make love with passion and lust, and you will do so while screaming down the stairs to your mother that you will require a hot meal when you have completed your task”!

The class has gone over such topics as Html, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Python but more importantly has gotten me back in the programming scheme of things.

During my free time, I have been teaching myself Java, C++ and a little bit of C#.  I have managed to make a couple small applications or games from following tutorials.  To be honest , I still cant programming by myself, as I always have to have a guide to follow.

I am looking for either an intern position / part time / full time entry level job with a company that is looking to hire. I have a resume ready and willing to provide more information if needed.  "

As Paul Watson’s head hit the pillow, the noise in his mind became louder. “How can I motivate these young Sea Sheppards?” he thought to himself. “What will it take for them to have the same zeal that I have”? Our world is being destroyed in front of us, and while there are plenty who are willing to help, we need to further our initiatives. Paul could feel the rocking of his boat as he pondered the day’s activities. The ship had been named “Steve Irwin” in honor of the deceased Australian wildlife expert and conservationist. A poster of Irwin hung on the walls of Captain Watson’s quarters. Some of the interns would mumble quiet whisperings about Waston’s strange attraction, seemingly sexual, to Irwin’s memory. 
	
Earlier in the day, Watson could tell the motivation and moral of the ship crew was suffering. They had been out to sea for nearly three months, chasing down Japanese whaling ships in the Antarctic seas. It was cold, dangerous, and physically exhausting work. There were short spurts of excitement, usually dangerous in nature, followed by long boring sessions of inactivity. The crew was dedicated to its endeavors, but after all, most of them were volunteers, and growing tired of the unforgiving sea.  The crew desired some personal space, a hot bath, and something to eat besides sea rations. The crew was quite skeptical of their Captain, as no matter how long he stayed at sea, he was always able to maintain his overweight stature. Surely he must have his own food stash, they would say. There’s no way he’s packing around an extra 100 lbs eating this canned garbage we attempt to hold down.
	
Watson awoke the following morning feeling less than refreshed. He knew something spontaneous, exhilarating, and moving would be needed to steer the crew back on track. Captain Watson reached under his bed, pulled out a box of Bugles chips, and began to place the corn cone shaped chips on his fingers, ever so slightly. When his fat fingers would crack the hardened chip, he would feel the same disappointment in himself as his father felt in him, when he was a young boy always being picked last for team sports. “Carefulness is of the utmost importance. When I am careful, father is happy, and will not berate me over dinner” he muttered to himself, as he placed the last Bugle Chip on his pinky finger. Watson gleamed with pride, and picked the Mr. Rogers bobble head doll from his nightstand, giving it a good shake as he sang “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, oh won’t you be mine”?  He placed the toy back on his nightstand and sat giggling as he nibbled the Bugles from his fingers. 
	
The crew began to stir, slowly. Watson could smell the coffee brewing, and he knew it was time. He sprang into his closet, and began to search through the many outfits. Today would require something special. Watson grabbed a camouflage ghillie suit. Ghillie suits are often used by military snipers when hiding behind enemy lines. He threw the suit over his massive frame. Next, he grabbed his globe. It was an old paper mache globe, similar to the ones you see in elementary class rooms. He tore the globe in half, and placed it over his belly, fastening it to himself with a string tied around the globe, and his back. Watson looked around, his eyes settling on a bamboo stick décor, resembling the horns of an animal. Fastening the mess to his head, he turned to the mirror. Watson gasped, and quietly but confidently exclaimed “It’s beautiful”. Watson reached into his top dresser drawer, dug to the bottom, and carefully removed the final piece which would complete him; a dried peat moss brassier. Fastening the clasps in the front, and then sliding the bra around, promptly placing his fat man tits in the cups of the bra. The peat moss felt itchy against his bare skin, as he said “There but for the grace of Earth, go I.”

I'll be flying there so I think I have two options:

1. Take it with me on my flight. A friend said he did this from Seattle to Indianapolis. He simply used a very large suitcase and brought it on the plane with him. He said it wasn't a problem. Only problem with that is the price of the suitcase seems like it could be large. Also, he recommended taking the hard drive and video card out and carrying them separately. 

2. Have a family member ship it. This could be less pricey than a suitcase but I also have the risk of something breaking while shipping. (once again, I should probably take the hard drive and video card out and either ship them separately or take them on the flight with me.) 

Any suggestions?"

A fellow redditor suggested that I posted it in public as I might be able to receive some advice on how to/if I should proceed with this.

---


I spent a long time considering whether or not I should write this, but finally I decided to – if only because I feel that we have a tendency to blindly trust in the authority of medical professionals. However, even doctors can make mistakes, as I came to learn.
But first, a disclaimer: this is not meant to dissuade anyone from seeking treatment. In most cases, treatment is incredibly beneficial, but sometimes we have to stand up for ourselves when wronged. I didn't dare to do that, and not a day goes by that I don't regret it.


A few months ago, I was suffering from debilitating anorexia that almost left me dead. I was emaciated, my blood pressure was low and I was living in a perpetual, all-encumbering haze. My life consisted of reading; or else of staring into the air for hours on end, counting the minutes and seconds until I could have my daily meal consisting of vinegar-drenched lettuce and frozen spinach.
Thankfully, I had people who cared for me. 
I was studying – albeit without much success – at the time. I'd been discussing taking some time off to focus on recovery, and the head of the department agreed. 
 One day, he stopped me outside of class and said that he'd called the eating disorders clinic about my sick leave, and they wanted to immediately have a meeting about it. I was mildly confused. This wasn't what you'd call ordinary procedure. 
Still, ten minutes later, we were driving there. But lo and behold – he took me to the ER, not the clinic.
Before I could fully grasp what was happening, I was wired up to various monitors and the like. At the time, I had no clue whose idea this was, but I'll get to that later.

The ER was a hellish experience. I was there for hours; the room was unheated, I was constantly shivering and I'd barely had anything to drink. 
Time and time again, I requested water, but was given such small amounts that I still felt parched. Initially, they forgot, and I – although completely emaciated – was left for four hours without food or water, despite asking for it repeatedly.
I was horrified, but no one seemed very concerned about me.
 When the heart monitor started acting up, the nurse just closed the door to block out the noise and I was left with the incessant beeping that testified to what I'd inflicted on myself. They repeatedly tried to take blood tests, but for some reason or another, they couldn't extract the blood despite attempting over 20 times. My arms were bruised and aching for days afterwards.
I asked for food, but it was refused. When they finally got back the results of the blood tests, I could see why they wouldn't let me eat: they wanted me hospitalised, and I suspect that they'd purposedly tried to keep me dehydrated and my blood sugar low to be able to do so without my consent.
After many, many hours there, they had to let me go. The blood results weren't sufficient to lock me up. When I got home, I ate. I just ate and ate. I never wanted to go back there again. Call it shock therapy, but I was in recovery.

I began to follow my meal plans, gaining almost a kilo per week. I didn't want to be in the hospital. I made a deal with my doctor – if I gained half a kilo each week, I'd get to stay out. My parents supported me and my decision to get better on my own. I genuinely wanted to.

Then entered Sylvia. Without my knowledge or consent, she had taken up my case and put herself as my doctor. I'd never met her before, but she was incredibly unpleasant and seemed set on getting me hospitalised, despite the agreement with my previous doctor. Still, I didn't think much of it; I didn't want to be involved in that system for longer than necessary. So despite her sometimes vicious comments and demands, I smiled, nodded and followed my meal plan.
But that wasn't enough for her. She insisted that I couldn't do it on my own, over and over again; she thought that I was cheating the scale, one way or another. It seemed like her personal mission to get me committed. What ensued were a series of ordeals that I doubt I'll ever put behind me.


 I lived roughly an hour away from the center, but she nevertheless insisted that I showed up for daily weigh-ins. I was too feeble to take public transport, so my parents had to drive me, despite them both working full time. Often, we managed to arrange transport with the hospital, but it was still a difficult situation.
The weigh-ins were hellish. She seemed to deliberately try to break me down. I can't recount all of it, but one incident stands out.
 Normally, you get to keep on a small camisole, bra and knickers when weighed. She insisted that I take everything off. Being a naturally well-endowed woman despite my emaciation – most females in my family have needed breast reduction surgery – she became convinced that I had implants. One time, she made me lie on a bed, naked, for 15 minutes, feeling my breasts and trying to get me to admit that I'd had breast augmentation and was hiding the weight of the silicone. I was struck dead by terror – after all, she had the power to lock me up at a whim – and just muttered that I hadn't had any operation. My dietician, a kind if somewhat naive woman, witnessed all of this.
Sylvia then proceeded to take my blood pressure. If it was elevated, she could hospitalise me. Thankfully I've always been good at keeping myself calm.

Somehow, throughout all of this, I was managing to keep up my recovery. I'd gained a lot and was feeling far better. 
My best friend who studies abroad had quit his university courses to come support me, and was due to arrive the next day. I just had one weigh-in to go to beforehand. 

The day prior, I'd informed them that I had no means of transport and they promised to arrange it for me.
Half an hour before the appointment, no car had arrived. I'd been frantically trying to reach the center; it was an hour away by car, after all. Then I got an e-mail:

*Hello, CarthagoEsseDelendam

Sadly we're not able to provide transportation today. See you at 12.30.

Sylvia.*

I promptly replied that I had no means of getting there. I was vaguely irritated, but didn't think much of it. Then five minutes later, I got a phone call from them: if I wasn't there in 30 minutes, they'd say that I wasn't complying with treatment and would send in the papers for my involuntary hospitalisation. Being in shock, I tried to reason with them; said that I couldn't get there in half an hour, but they refused to schedule a later appointment.

I called my father who works with mentally disabled children, explaining the situation to him. He had to leave the children alone with an intern and promptly drove me to the clinic. But when I got there, I'd missed my appointment. They wanted me hospitalised.

My father was outraged; he argued that I was recovering, but they treated him like an imbecile. The conversation was bizarre. Sylvia – the horrendous doctor – kept on saying that we couldn't question her professional authority. While my father argued, I begged. I was pathetic. I'd have gotten down on my knees and kissed their feet if I had to. Meanwhile, my friend – who had put aside everything for me – was to arrive in just a few hours.

Eventually, my father took me by the arm and led me out of there while Sylvia and the nurse shouted in the background.
He'd had enough, and he finally stood up for me. Everything Sylvia had put me through burst out: how she'd groped me unecessarily, made me stand naked while she scrutinised my body, purposedly tried to terrify me and derail my recovery. All of the harassment and impossible demands welled out of me. But then there was a witness.
My father called the dietitian for me, and she agreed that Sylvia had acted out of line. We agreed – all three of us – to file a complaint against her. I requested to see my medical papers, wherein I discovered that Sylvia had orchestrated everything since the ER. The dietitian could attest to her methods and what we agreed was sexual harassment.


But the word of an anorexic is never seen as trustworthy. While the complaint stalled hospitalisation, I was kicked out of treatment. No one monitored me anymore. Thankfully, I was determined to prove that I could really recover on my own.
Then the case was dropped. Sylvia kept her job; the dietitian was fired. I was permanently out of the treatment system and unable to receive any medical advice or tests.

  As a result, I got various physical problems that I won't go into now. I also lost my therapist, as I'd been kicked out of treatment. I still get nightmares of how she treated me. And she still works with eating disorders.
I'm recovering on my own, but her need to assert her own authority led me to PTSD. She purposedly played on my fears. I've been the victim of rape in the past and she commented on that in my medical files. She knew exactly which buttons to push.


There's no real point to this story, and maybe I'm overreacting. Still, I want to encourage everyone to question those in authority. Mental illness makes you an unreliable witness, but I wasn't the only witness.
 I'll never get over my experiences there. I just hope that no one else will be exposed to the same.


TL;DR: Was sexually harrassed by a doctor, she kept her job, I was kicked out of treatment. The dietitian who witnessed the events was fired."

1306r0,2,2012-11-11,Are my feelings sound? I want to go the extra mile but I'm not sure if I should (25m/23f),notthesurestfella,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1306r0/are_my_feelings_sound_i_want_to_go_the_extra_mile/,"Alright, so this is a weird story with what I think could potentially be a lot of negative points, but I'm hoping for some really accurate responses..

I met this girl about 2 years ago. I work with her, and the company has a strict policy of non-fraternization with coworkers of the opposite sex. Like, no communication on a personal level, no phone numbers, nothing. We can talk on facebook and things like that but anything else could potentially get us in some heat. The bigger deal is for me, I've been with them for 7 years now and have been in trouble before.. But I'm good friends with the CEO. We're more friends than I am an employee. This job is not paid, usually. Consider it an internship that I value more for the friendship and experiences.

She is in a tough spot right now because she had some car/relationship issues 2 months ago and actually just moved back home to another state 800 miles away. Initially she was planning on coming back in six months or so after she made some money working back home, but she's not sure after all because there may be no reason for her to come back other than the fact she likes it here. I'm really interested in trying to change that.

We have worked together about 3-4 times, and the job is very social so we basically talked and were able to hang out for hours at a time. We talked on facebook and other social media sites between shows on occasion, but not very often because I was trying hard to keep a professional profile. Needless to say there was some mild flirting when we were talking. At the time we met, she had a SO which was an additional barrier.

We talked again a few days ago on facebook and she told me she was leaving to go home earlier than she thought, literally two days later. I had asked the company CEO if it was ok before to simply get her phone number so that we could talk. He unfortunately said no. I respected his wishes and didn't ask. However, after a few minutes talking on facebook, she sent me her phone number telling me to text. Initially I told her I couldnt, because I was still trying VERY hard to keep a professional environment... But it was very hard. It was after she told me she wished she could see me before she left that I broke down and decided to just do it.

After messaging back and forth for an hour or so, we wound up getting into talking a little more personally and she decided to spill the beans. She told me she has been interested in me ever since she met me but she, too withheld herself because of her having a boyfriend and because we could not communicate due to work.

So it hit me like a ton of bricks--I needed to see her before she left. I didn't know what to expect, all that I knew is that I was unbelievably interested in her and now she would be leaving. Possibly for good. I have let a lot of opportunities pass me by for other things in the past and I wasn't ready to let this one go. After all, this girl caught my eye TWO years ago and I still cannot get the feeling out of my head that I want her to be mine.. somehow.

So the next day I drove 50 miles to see her. When i got there she had actually had a couple of drinks with her friend so she was a bit askew but we had decided to go get a drink anyway. We ended up sitting and talking over one drink for two hours. Talk about baby sitting a beer. haha.

Unfortunately thats all the time we had. I had work in the morning and it was late.. Yay responsibility. I took her back to where she was staying, walked her to her door and gave her a hug. She just got out of a relationship two months ago so I wasn't about to be that douche that tries to take advantage of a possible vulnerability and get into her pants. It caught me off guard when she held on longer than I expected. As soon as we let go, she kissed me. I was in shock for a minute and we exchanged a few words as she quickly disappeared into the house.

I have been single for a year and a half, and have seen 4 girls in a few month periods, but nothing serious and nothing official. None of these girls can hold a candle to how much I have in common with this girl.. None of these girls have made me feel or think the way I do about her. We have a lot of things in common that are huge to me. My hobby, music, lifestyle, even some of the things we went through with our parents. We both have a similar outlook on the types of things we want in life.

I don't know why I feel the way I do. I can't tell if my feelings are overboard, or unjustified, or just plain stupid. I don't know how she feels exactly, but I have an idea because of everything shes shown and told me so far. My biggest set back is the fact that she is recently single (2 months ago, like I said earlier) and I don't know if she sincerely means what she is saying/doing or if she is just needing the attention to get over her ex. However, one of the things she told me was that she didn't care they were no longer together. She's happy to be free.

She left home today at noon. We have been texting ever since she left. When she told me she had left it literally ruined my day. I knew she was leaving and had no real issue with it.. But once she told me she had left my whole mood changed and I really couldn't help it.
I'm afraid of the way I feel about her. I feel like the woman of my dreams just left my life. I know I will see her again, however, because her car is out here and she has told me many times she wants to get together when she comes to get it. Her car is in need of repair and she does not have the money to fix it right now. Her plan was to go home and work to get some money together to fix it in a few months and then come get it, OR her friend might help her tow it up with the trailer.

I have the ability to pick up her car, and I can fix whats wrong with it pretty quickly. I feel like I want to do this for her and tell her to just pay me back when she can. It's a very expensive repair, but I can do the work myself no problem and get it done very quickly. She could have her car back sooner than she thinks. I want to help her, and moreover I believe I want to be with her. I don't know if its a good idea, though. I dont want to feel like I'm trying to buy her. She has already expressed interest more than once in me helping her fix it (physically, not financially. she is actually a good mechanic on her own!)

I don't know what to do with myself, so I posted here. Do you think I'm reading too much into things, and possibly even just over obsessing? I feel like I am but at the same time I'm so confused I can't think straight. She is practically the girl of my dreams on so many levels.. And I dont know if I should just let it go and possibly miss the only opportunity I have, or if I should just try it. I think all of my friends think I'm stupid for being so hung up on a girl that is moving.

Do you think taking the matters of her car into my own hands is a bit too much? Financially for me it would be tricky, but I know I could do it. Money is just money, right? Do you think this would help, or would it possibly be a really bad idea and I'm setting myself up to get used?
Is there such a thing as too soon to date again? I want to take it slow with her if I can, but I think helping her with her car is almost a big boyfriend-like commitment.

I'm sorry this was so long.. It's very hard to piece my mind together right now. Thanks for reading.

tl;dr: Think I met my dream girl, some complications, need advice.. Hard to summarize. :("

Fresh breakup being drawn out.,REALAndersonCooper,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1301ky/trying_to_figure_out_where_to_go_now_fresh/,"I've [27m] been trying to work through a lot of personal issues lately but its starting to add up. I recently became single again after a breakup that has lasted the better part of three months, and will likely be stretched a bit further.  She's doing an internship overseas and I'm in our apartment until she comes back in January. I have no idea what will happen at that time. One of us will find a new place to live. But really, neither of us can afford to live here alone.

The time I'm most bothered though, is after 10 pm.  I just feel so lonely all the time now. I hate going to bed because I just end up laying awake feeling sorry for myself. Last night was the first time I really snapped though. I haven't cried about anything of substance for years but last night I just couldn't hold it in. I'm just sick of feeling so along, and like I can't reach out to anyone.

I contacted the counselling center at the college I attend but it will be at last 3 weeks before I can see anyone. I had a consultation but I didn't gain anything from it. I was told that I seemed to be getting by alright so they would be in touch in a few weeks. I don't feel like any of my concerns were legitimized, but that might have been my fault for downplaying it.

I'm also tempted to get into a new relationship in the mean time, but I know its only because I want to feel like someone else cares about me again. I just feel like its been a long time since I've connected with anyone. I've never been diagnosed with depression or any other mood-disorder. I've also never seen a counselor until recently. When I was in my teens, I had some self-harm tendencies but I haven't acted on those in years.

I'm trying to move myself forward emotionally but every night I just feel a little worse. I put off going to bed just a little longer. I've considered sleeping on the couch instead so I'm not in the bedroom every night, but I don't know what I would accomplish other than probably freezing to death.

Would love advice if you have any.",spreadreallythin,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/12zo5d/fellow_wolves_i_have_motivation_but_seemingly_not/,"A couple of years ago, I was in a rough spot: caught in unemployment, broke as hell, not sure where to go next. But I found an upside: with all that spare time, I started actively improving myself: I lost a lot of weight (~110 pounds), got a lot healthier and was on-track to getting really fit. 

Then things got even better: I found a new direction, I entered grad school, and have been kicking ass up one side and down the other. I am, if not the top student in my cohort, among the top three (and we're all good friends and collaborators, as well.) I've got a great student job that will help me enter my new profession; I landed a sweet internship that attracted a lot of competition; I'm getting some respect and notice from established professionals in my field. 

The problem is this: all of this has landed me with about 60 hrs./week of obligations, and that's before I start on my academic work. And over the last year or so, all of those health gains I made have just gone in the toilet. I haven't gained all the weight back, but I've gained waaaaay too much of it back. My general fitness level has sputtered and crashed. Every week, every day, I get up and try again -- try my old routine, try a new routine, try a new incentive, try to do *just a little bit of good* -- but more or less invariably, I fail. It's like there just isn't enough of me to deal with everything. 

And my failures are now starting to really impact my wellbeing in general. I'm succeeding pretty fantastically in one regard -- I've had a genuinely awesome and hugely productive year. But I am haunted by this constant sense that I'm failing at something even more important. And that feeling of failure is making all of my successes seem worthless. 

I know that in another year when I'm out of grad school and entering my field as a professional, I'll do better if I'm reasonably fit and not the blobby mess I am now. But not even channelling my will to succeed professionally seems to hit my brain. I've already berated myself about priorities, about discipline, about being who I want to be. But at the end of a ten-hour day, when I get home and still have two hours of schoolwork to do, and I'm just so fucking tired... it's the shitty, delicious, comforting food that takes two minutes to microwave and makes me feel better for fifteen minutes that hits the plate, and not the one I should be eating. In the morning, rather than take the two-mile walk into work, I sleep another precious half hour and catch the bus instead. But neither of those are the right choices.

I know I can do all of these things, because I am doing/have done them already. I just don't seem to be able to do them all at once. But I *HAVE* to find a way. How do I get unstuck?

I'm a soon-to-be graduate with a BA in Communications Media and a minor in English. I have also done extensive coursework in filmmaking, both through NCSU and independent coursework at local film production centers.

I'm currently working two freelance jobs. One is with a local Social Media Consulting firm, writing press releases and blog pieces for clients and managing our clients' social media campaigns and schedules. Another is working on a regional team for a national marketing group who specializes in promoting new film releases for virtually every major studio. I've done everything from guerrilla marketing on the streets to coordinating appearances by certain celebrities to standard marketing techniques.

I have had a few internships as well, sprinkled around between social media internships (wherein I got a company's social media campaign off the ground and trained every employee on how to use it) and video production (got a local firm's video production capabilities setup and helped shoot and edit the first few projects). 

I'm looking for all kinds of work... if you have projects you want to sub out, I can do it! If you need someone to just pull in a few hours a week doing part-time work, I'm there! Or, if you need someone in a more permanent, full-time position, I can get on board just as soon as I graduate in a month!

1320yw,8,2012-11-12,Salvia Analysis of Inner Conflicts,MindlessRationality,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1320yw/salvia_analysis_of_inner_conflicts/,"Before I explain the portion relating to salvia, I would like to mention some backstory which is key to this analysis.

I recently went through one of the most horrible times of my life. I never understood what it was like to be depressed, and I finally can empathize with those who are suffering it in a way. I have never been under any major stress, anxiety, depression, etc. I have never been able to empathise with people about these things, and find it hard to empathise with people anyways. I have always had a pretty bubbly personality, so this was extremely out of place. I was lucky in that it was quite a short time frame: it lasted a few weeks, but I wasn't quite aware of it until the final week and a half. During this week I underwent the deepest part of the depression. I had this overbearing sense of hopelessness and this emasculating feeling of helplessness. It was like I knew what I needed to do, I knew how I needed to do it, I knew I could do it, but I just couldn't bring myself to actually get anything done. I had no drive, no willpower. I couldn't even bring myself to read a single page of my homework. During this time I slept through a midterm, missed three quizzes, missed two assignments, Barely passed a third assignment, and missed every single lecture. I also missed a deadline for an internship and now am ineligible for the program.

On top of this lack of drive and motivation, I also found myself constantly plagued by depressing thoughts, and bleak perspectives. This is extremely out of key of my normal self, as I was always a half-full kind of person. I liked to refer to my attitude as optimistic realism. But during this time I found myself thinking darker thoughts, and even some where I found myself somewhat detached from some norms. To summarize, It was the most terrible feelings I have gone through. Now, onto the salvia.

Now, shortly into the portion of my more severe depression, but where I had yet to fully become aware, I decided to smoke some salvia before school. Now, I had a buddy of mine be my sitter and I packed a small bowl as I was interested in playing around in the lower end of the spectrum for some deeper understanding of salvia's peculiarities. Now I took the hit and put the bong down, and slowly relaxed onto my couch. There it was.

It came on so familiar, the sense of falling whilst being gently tugged upwards. My mind drifted as I pondered whether or not I should announce that the trip was starting, and during this time, salvia transitioned me to another realm.

The realm appeared to me as the back of a stage, with the lights dimmed and a blue velvet-like carpet. There I was standing (I was aware of both the perspective slightly behind me, and my own view as well), and in front of me were two figures, the best I can describe them as is my salvia-parents, and they were talking. On a stand was a toy house and I was playing with it. This is where the trip turned south.

My salvia parents tell me it is time to go and that I have to hurry. I ask them if I am allowed to stay a bit longer and they scold me and say no. I then tell them I have to say goodbye to my friends, but they insist I must leave, and I cannot say goodbye. Suddenly, I begin to panic because the toy house I am playing with is actually reality, and the friends I am referring to are friends and family in my actual life. My salvia parents were trying to take me away from reality, and never let me go back. It was at this instant the salvia had me straight up believing I was never going to see anyone I knew again. It was terrifying, so somehow I broke out of it. I ran away from the salvia trip. The world began to be swallowed by my salvia mum's mouth, and just as it was 4/5th's closed I somehow broke the trance, but it was hard. I had to spend two-three minutes mentally keeping it at bay. Anytime I relaxed it would come back clear as day and I would feel like my life was being ripped from me. 

After a few minutes, I finally was free of it. The trip had subsided, but I was shaken. I wasn't able to fathom it, it was too real. The transition between both realities was too smooth, and it really scared me. I asked my buddy how long I was out before I had stood up, and he shocked me: 20 seconds. The entire trip before I ran away had merely been 20 seconds. Most of my salvia experiences have been 4-7 minutes before breaking out. I couldn't believe it had frightened me so much in merely 20 seconds.

I went to school and then finished the day, and nothing seemed too much out of place. I was still thinking about the trip though; I coudn't lose it. It absorbed me for the next week. I lost all motivation completely, I felt as if this reality was worth nothing. It dramatically intensified the depression to areas where it most likely would have reached quite soon nonetheless, but just expedited it. I felt like suddenly this reality wasn't quite real. I didn't feel like I could continue in this fake world for the next 50-60 years of my life. It became unbearable, and I soon was becoming stressed. Over the final three days I started to suffer panic attacks and would begin to hyperventilate and shake. I would lose all ability to concentrate and would feel confused and useless. Nothing would shake the feeling, and I would be completely unproductive for the remaining part of the day. I started to find myself crying at nights for no reason, and in the mornings when I couldn't get myself out of bed. I started to get irritable and even snapped at a buddy of mine and kicked him out of my house for making a comment. I needed some help and decided to head over to some more friends of mine who lived close by and who were all tripping out on various things. While I was there I talked about various feelings I had and mentioned some of the thoughts that had passed by in the last weeks. They really helped me relax and lose the stress, and I decided to give salvia another go but this time with the intent of confronting my fears.

This time, one of my friends had decided to try some small amounts, and he was completely functional. It was crazy, seeing someone functionally high on salvia. He just kept reupping every 5 minutes and was describing it to us. He mentioned the pull and pushing feeling, and continued to describe the sense as a gravitational pull. He said it felt as if everything's gravitational force was intensified. I decided that if he was able to be completely functional, I should be theoretically able to do the same. So I packed a small amount and lit it up.

The trip came on slyly, I registered it partways in as I had gotten the first slight head rush and went to sit down, and by the time I had processed doing that, I was suddenly right back into the terror from the week prior. There I was, in that back stage room. My salvia parents were there, but this time they said that I was not supposed to come back. I had made my choice and must be content with it. Once again I panicked. I moaned out in agony of being back in a world I hated, but then WOOSH, I suddenly became aware of reality again. But it was weird. Everything had this resonant waveform-esque halo/border around them, and I had one too. Not to mention that when I touched anything I locked into it and suddenly became part of it, or possibly vice-versa. I had to get up and keep moving, I couldn't stay still or I would lock into something. I started moving and was unaware that I had everyone somewhat worried. I felt the tugging and pulling as was described, but on top of that I felt an extremely sharp feeling, and an even stronger pull emanating from people. Every person was like a huge magnet, I felt grounded near them, but if I was far away I felt like I was drifting away. And there was music which felt like an invisible fog that was being absorbed into me as I walked closer to it. I also was somewhat unfamiliar of that part of his house, so I had to rearrange it in my mind's eye similar to how a mini-map gets filled up in video games as you explore areas. But the weird part was I felt like I was between both realities at the same time, for I was constantly shifting between them, including my vision and thought patterns. This time though, I had to choose one. I had to either choose reality as it is, or dive into some unknown reality beyond. But, it wasn't fun. It was terrifying. Because, I was experiencing both at the same time, so both were real, and both had consequences, or not. I also had a sense I was being pulled between both of them, and they were exclusive. One or the other, not both. 

If you will, imagine a wire frame cube. When viewed it can be seen to appear from one angle, or another. Sometimes you can control it, whilst other times it will simply jump back and forth. This was my life, but with two realities.

I was able to keep myself grounded in this reality due to the attractive forces of my friends personalities. I began to explain exactly what I was feeling, and what it was like. At the same time, my friend is tripping out and he is getting a very similar yet subdued feeling. I suddenly realized where he was in relation to my high. If you imagine an expontial curve of intensity vs dissociation (you could also have a third axis of dose in the z), you would have a discontinuity where I was on the curve. This is what I call the ""Reality Break."" The point where you transition back and forth between self-awareness and loss of awareness. You find yourself with the ability and control to choose your destiny for your trip, but it is an extremely harrowing ordeal. You must be completely clear of mind and have comfronted your problems. You can either pause and decrease the trip and go back down the curve, or you can lose yourself and jump off the proverbial cliff.

Losing yourself is different however, when you go over the edge, you cannot suddenly jump back to reality, you are now in the abyss if you will. By abyss, I mean a breakthrough trip, loss of ego, etc. This would be the sudden break in curve: the discontinuity. If you choose to go off into the abyss, you have to experience it till the end. You sacrifice your ego, your self, to experience the other realm, but can you bring yourself to do it? I couldn't. Instead, I chose to fight my fear by analyzing the high with my friends. I was able to make it science again, and due to my friend also tripping, we could correlate our experiences in real time. This brought me back out of my depression. I was able to find the excitement I used to have for science, and math, and living if you will. I got back my motivation and drive as I was able to feel it, as only salvia can make you. My fears were now tangible and I could face them and break them down, rather than shadowy mists I couldn't explain. I could honest to god face my fears, for with salvia they are made real. But, only with my friends was I able to do this. The first trip would have helped me combat my fears, but I chose to run from it, and thus intensified my depression. I ran, because I wasn't planning on fighting my fears, as at the time, I was unaware of how big a problem the depression was becoming. But with the second time, I did it with intent to explore and explain. I was able to do so due to salvia and a strong group of supportive psychonaut friends.

The best I can say is that salvia is like any drug, different levels, different doses. Whats is different is that the route to the level is just as important as the level itself, with salvia. For example, if you slowly come up the curve you will reach the ""Reality Break"" and will have to choose to lose yourself, but rather, if you just smoke a huge bowl, you will end up in the abyss right away. You will never have had a self to lose, and thus you will not have to deal with as ""real"" a problem. Finding yourself in a dream world, and casting yourself off into a dream world are too very different experiences. One is personal(the latter), and one just is(the former).

I was able to use salvia to face my fears and conquer them in the end, but it also had intensified my depression due to my unreadiness for my problems, so be careful. You have to go in wanting to use it as therapy if you have some inner problems, otherwise it may cause more damage than solves. If you have a clear mind however, salvia will be a whole different beast, one much less helpful/damaging.

P.S. - On a side note, people have always asked me to summarize salvia, and the best I can give is this (sorry for the mathematical jargon, google it):
""Smoking salvia is like splicing into your senses, and rerouting them through a delay whereby they get convolved together along with your subconscious into one master sense which is then fed to your brain back onto each sensory receiver. So every sense is getting this new, and distorted signal that begins to tap into weird parts of your memories and emotions and evokes something entirely unpredictable which is constantly being readapted to the feeback of the result."" 

That is my analysis of salvia, and I must say I feel great since. I have completely lost all feelings of depression and have been more productive these last couple days than I have in months.

I flew to see him so I can confess that I truly love him but his response was that he couldn't really love me because of the geographic distance between us. At the time he was living in the midwest for medschool and I was going to the west coast for my internships. So after he broke my heart and an awkward good bye I did my best to move on. He kept in touch with me often but I bet he only did that because he felt guilty. I eventually I ended up staying west coast after my internships and settled into a serious relationships. 

The last time I saw him is when we both went back home for the holidays. We were having dinner with our friends and he drunkly blurted out that he didn't approve of the guy I'm currently dating. We haven't really talked since then and that was 2 years ago. 

I don't understand why I randomly think about him and every time I'm reduced to tears. 

Am I being stupid or insecure about myself?

My question is, is there anything I can do to reduce this the interest that doesn't damage my credit rating? Am I damaging my credit rating with the payments I'm making now?

I've contemplated getting a balance transfer credit card that offers low interest rates for a few months but it seems having such a low income disqualifies me from these cards. I also considered getting a line of credit and pay of the debt with that but again, I believe having such a low income disqualifies me from it.

I've also contemplated just continuing to make the payments until I get the job. 

The reason I racked up such a debt on such a small income is because my understanding was that so long as I was making payments of some sort, I wasn't accruing interest. Embarrassingly stupid looking back but that's my situation. 

I realize I'm not doomed with the amount of debt I have but I want to protect my credit rating and in general, not lose so much cash to interest.

To give you some background...

I am a 21 year old German student, studying Business Information Systems with the focus on software development. Before I can start my last year of studies, I am required to do a 5 – 6 months (payed) internship, starting March 2013. I tried desperately to find something in Australia, for several reasons. One is, that I have been to Australia before and I really like the country and especially the people. Second my SO lives in Sydney and I could finally see her again. At the moment I am in France, studying at a “Grand Ecole” for one semester. I am fluent in German, French and English (my English is better than my French).

I really tried everything, I guess. I sent a lot of applications (not standard ones!) to several companies. But no-one really looks for an intern at the moment. I am quite flexible, I focus on software development, but I had/have (e.g.) accounting lectures as well. The main language we are learning is Java. But I guess apart from that, I have some other good skills. Of course I check(ed) seek.com.au and other websites, but I can't even find an open position. If I got replies, they were all negative, I don't think most of them looked even at my CV. I am really desperate and would be glad over any advice/position/nice comment…

Thanks for really anything in advance.

Cheers!

I'm a het woman studying STEM, and I've heard that joke waaaay too many times. And then I moved to the Netherlands.  The Dutch interns use the 'gay' joke ALL THE TIME (!!!!!) about a-ny-thing. 

This dinner, an intern used another intern's Facebook to make a self-post stating ""I'm gay"" while the guy was downstairs eating (I was downstairs as well). The Dutch guys then joked about the subject while the interested was annoyed (he couldn't remove it from his iphone), then started mocking on the subject. At some point, they started calling gay the Indian guy (decent guy who doesn't do or care about gay jokes) because they like to mock him. Then briefly talked about how bad it is to be gay in the Netherlands, then went back on joking. The rest of the ENTIRE lunch.

1347zp,16,2012-11-13,Trying to break out of my foreigner shell. Expat woes.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1347zp/trying_to_break_out_of_my_foreigner_shell_expat/,"I've been meaning to post something like this for a while, but I didn't find 2x until a couple weeks ago, and I feel like this is the only real place to do it, so I'm really glad I found it. You all just seem so nice and supportive of each other, I really wanted in on the love. Also, I'm sorry that it's basically a novel. I'm at work, and I really wanted to get this off my chest so that I could get on with my work.

One year and one month ago, the love of my life proposed to me, I said yes, then the next day he flew back to Germany so he could find work, because the job market in our industry was declining, and finding work in the gaming industry with 3 months left on a student visa, was almost impossible. I had about a year  left in school, so I had to stay behind. Needless to say, it was the worst year of my life. Being without him for that whole year was awful, and we had a lot, a LOT, of problems during it. I thought that he should stay here and I would take a semester off school and work for a film company that I had prior to college, but at this time his parents still had a very huge impact on him, and told him that the best thing to do was to move back in with them immediately and look for work in Germany, and not even try in Canada. This has always been really difficult for me to deal with, his parents’ extreme rule over his life, especially since at this time he was 31. The 3 months after he left, I was adjusting to living alone (with a friend, finally after the first month) and dealing with my severe anxieties around the subject, living alone terrified me and made me feel like I had no ground to stand on, I always had a big family, there was always someone in the house, and suddenly there wasn't for the first time in my life. Huge shock. A few weeks after that my grandmother's cancer that had been managed for 30 years went into a severe downward spiral, she and I were extremely close, and my family didn't do a very good job of supporting each other rather than sending me e-mails saying, 'you'd better come visit grandma before she dies, because the doctors say that had 2 weeks.' So suddenly, I was being treated like an adult, without my mother to filter this type of information like any other time before. When she did pass away, it was at the end of my semester. I was leading a project of 20 people to present a game that we had all built over the last 9 months in front of my college, newspapers, and local TV cameras, and a week after her funeral I had the presentation. I did the presentation, it went over extremely well, then after all that was over, I took a week sick leave from school with a doctor's note. I felt such an extreme mixture of loss, and resentment for my partner who had seemingly abandoned me at the worst possible moment, but this wasn't easy for him either. It took me a long time to not feel hurt by being left by him when he did, and it took him a long time to not feel like the worst person in the world for leaving at a time like that.


After a while I got better, I was able to be social, to feel grounded on my own two feet, and I went through a period of ""I don't need anybody! fuck everyone!"" and nearly destroyed my husband. I went out late, didn't make our skype dates, didn't tell him where I was going or if I would be able to talk to him when he woke up and I was supposedly going to bed, I had convinced myself that he didn't have a say in anything I did, because he was the one who left, and I had to figure everything out on my own. During this time, the company that my husband worked for offered me an internship over the summer, which was amazing, since I could get my foot in the door and see him for longer than a week, (he visited for a total of 6 weeks the whole year ) but when the time came for me to leave, I was so caught up in my new life that I didn't want to go. I still did, but when I got there, all I saw was the person who left me. During this time his company was going through a sudden, unexpected insolvency, so he was out of work, we were struggling the entire 3 months and we lived in a village outside of the city with about 800 people in it. I didn't know anyone, I couldn't go anywhere because we lacked the money, and I missed home. I went into pure isolation, and resentment, again. By the time we got to the end of my summer internship, we were able to have numerous full blown arguments about the way we had to leave each other, and how I hated him for leaving me, but I was also able to learn his side. Things got a little better, and when I left Germany, I missed him almost more than the first time we were apart.


When I went home, I spent 2 weeks back in my next semester of school. The work i did in Germany was rewarding, and they even offered me a job. When I went back to school and started taking the first of 6 months (or more, depending on my grades) of classes that would prepare me to get a job, I thought to myself, well I have one lined up...this seems like a waste of money.  Not to mention my school was entirely for-profit, my tuition per class was almost 2000 dollars, and their ridiculous policies on payment, security and constant phone-badgering about tuition payments from their students had driven many of them away. At this time, I decided to say fuck it. I called my ever-supportive mom, told her I was going to work with her for 3 months, then go back to Germany permanently. I worked as a Bartender the entire time and made enough money to pay for my whole move, my husband flew back for a week, and we had a quickie wedding to make my immigration smoother. We had planned on getting married, and for a long time I didn't want to consider a civil service or quickie wedding to make the immigration process for either of us faster, because I felt that it reduced the sentiment of marriage, if only for the purpose of immigration. But I decided that this time, It wasn't. I wanted to marry him, and I wanted to start my life. So we got married, 3 months later I flew back to the city and packed up some of my things but threw out most of it, and stored the rest at a friend’s place until my mom could fly in and pick it up, got my 2 cats to the vet and their flight documentation together and left. Just a word of advice, for the love of god do not plan to organize an inter-continental move in 3 days. When I finally got on the plane I was so emotionally and physically exhausted that I passed out before take-off and woke up in Frankfurt.
Seeing him in the airport waiting for me, knowing that we wouldn't be apart again, was the greatest feeling I've ever felt. So many times seeing him in the airport was bitter sweet, because I knew I'd be back there again seeing him go, but not this time.  

I guess this is all a part of growing up, but I feel like I did all my growing up in the whole year we were apart, from rebellious teenager to adult in a whirlwind of 12 months. I has just turned 19 when he left. Also, it should be noted that the college I went to wasn't a university, and just in case anyone is weirded out or curious about our age difference, my husband started college when he was 29 because right out of high school in Germany he went into the military, and decided what he wanted to do with his life after the Army when he was 28, after a tour of duty in Kosovo and some random university classes here and there. My school was filled with all kinds of students aged 17-40, in my classes I was normally the youngest, the oldest being in their late 30s. I graduated early so that I could go to college for computer programming and video game design right away, because I didn’t care for high school, and I just wanted a career and to skip as much as possible. When we met, we were in the same class, more or less on the same level, every now and then we do notice our age difference, but that’s only when I’m in tear laughing at Step Brothers and he doesn't understand why I think that movie is so goddamn funny.


I've been here for 2 months now, I like my job, I was able to feel more comfortable with people that I work with and be more social. But every now and then I go into pits of severe, anger and sadness, for about a week. In reality, I really still wish we could live in Canada. Being adventurous in Germany and being able to travel is really a great thing, and I'm so thankful for it, but a part of me still feels like I put away my family and my entire life just to be where he was, like everything revolves around him. That makes me upset. But those feelings of resentment are steadily fading, it is much easier and much more satisfying to remind myself that, it really doesn't matter where I am, as long as I'm with him, because that's all I've really wanted for the last year, and since I met him, really. But, because of these periods of sadness, where every little thing just makes me hate the fact that I live in a foreign country, from big things like not having my visa yet and being unable to take state language courses so I still can't carry on a proper conversation (but thank god for the online BBC language games) to little things like just not being able to have kraft dinner or go to the grocery store after 6pm, really turn me into an angry asshole.  Then my husband feels like it's his fault, which again, makes me feel like an even bigger dick, because it really isn't, it's mine. He suggests things to try and fix it, and I feel guilty because he doesn't really understand how I'm feeling. I isolate myself when I feel this way, and in general, even on a good day, I feel extremely socially awkward with meeting anyone in the town I live in, I don't feel comfortable enough to have a real relationship with anyone in my office, and it's a real struggle for me to take a friendship past the acquaintances or 'work friend' stage. I'm also very comfortable in groups, in social activities, but when he suggests I, ""just go meet some people"" I get angry, because it's not as easy as it seems to be in his mind. When I think of the more obvious reasons to me why it's hard to make friends at all right now, even if I were back in Canada, but also, I'm in a weird limbo with my age and my 'spot' in life. I'm as old as a college student, yet all the people around me because of my job are quite older, and I'm married, so i'm sort of in between. But I can safely say that being here now, I am 1000 times happier than I've ever been, I just wish that I wasn't so damn socially awkward.

Anyway, now that my venting is over, I want to propose a conclusion. I am 20 years old, I have a career, I'm married, I don't speak the language in my country (but god help me I'm trying and as soon as I get my visa, I can take language courses that I can work around my work schedule) but I am sick TO DEATH, of being an alien hiding in a shell. I live in the south western tip of Germany, on the French border, I'm kinda shy at first but I really love to go out and do things. My job is on the stressful side, so yeah, I really dig going to bed at 10 on weekdays, but I still like going to concerts and acting 'like a 20 year old.' Also, I'm married, but I like to have fun with people who are single, and I don't think people who are single are immature, or that I am too 'far in life' to associate with them, nor the other side, for married folks. My dream right now would be to meet someone in a situation like mine, but really, I just want to be social, and it'd be nice to step even further out of my shell and try to befriend a woman. My industry is male-dominated, there is only one other woman in my office, and she's not much into being social. Do any of you ladies live near me? This one's a long-shot, but any other Canadians live near me?
All in all, this whole post was very therapeutic for me. I've changed a lot in the last year, and my marriage is strengthening every day, I'm so glad that I am here, and I'm so glad that I stuck with this. 
If anyone actually read the entirety of my post, thank you so much, you're really kind, and I wish I had the ability to focus like you do.  I feel much, much better now.



EDIT: Thanks so much to all of you, after reading this, I'm considering organizing some kind of meetup in the Baden-Württemberg area, since many of you who replied at in, or just outside of it. Offenburg, where I live doesn't have a subreddit, (I'm starting to realize offenburg kinda sucks city wise, but it's better than the outskirts of Gengenbach. lol) but I could probably have success if i choose the right sub. then cross-post here."
133mru,1,2012-11-12,what is success to me? 24m,thedtrain88,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/133mru/what_is_success_to_me_24m/,"At the age of 24, using logic, here is what I can tell you about life so far.  We come into this world with nothing and we leave with nothing.  Billions have died before me and billions will die after me, most leaving not even their name behind, only to be forgotten thru time.  So, as we live life day to day, it has come to my attention that people ultimately care about one thing and one thing only, themselves.  There is no problem with this, because in the end, all we have are ourselves, right?  No one is going to want to hear you sulk about your troubles (not continuously at least) because those people will most likely have troubles of their own and need to deal with themselves.

This brings me to speak about ourselves, more specifically the multiple facets of ourselves that interact within us and within the environment around us.  We have a tendency to be insecure, weak, fearful, scared, afraid, unsure, I can go on and on but these are generally negative words that we can all relate to.  From what I have learned, these emotions, for the most part, hinder our growth and hurt us more than help us.  These negative connotations are like “blobs” (this is the best way I can put it) that attach themselves to our logic, more so attaching emotion to our logical thought and “contaminating” it.  For example, lets say you want to ask a girl out, or even better, just talk to one.  A lot of us go think about it, but then comes to big ass train of pain that is fear, more specifically fear of failure and rejection.  Logic tells us that if she rejects, then well, there’s other women out there so I can try again, but the “blob” of fear of failure and rejection has “contaminated” my logical thought of just going onto another girl and has just stopped me in my tracks altogether.  

Now here’s the good part.  More and more I have personally seen that the more you do something, the better you will get at it.  This is why we get homework, training, internships, etc.  Why fix something if it ain’t broke?  The more work we put into something, the more we get out of it generally.  

Now, I can keep this focused on women but I feel that this can be generalized to life itself.  

Being successful in any endeavor you do requires you to go thru certain “venues.”  I could be wrong, there could be more, but for me, this is what I found that helps (not in any particular order).  One venue is the “fuck it” method, simply put, just don’t overthink, make the move right then and there and do the damn thing you know you need to do to get the job done.  Then there is the “thinking” venue, where you do actually have to think before making an action, kind of like “thinking before you speak, do, etc.”   Either way, you need to take risks and explore so you can learn and grow.  Note how I didn’t say you will better yourself.  I say this because sometimes you will take a risk on a bad choice, like skipping an exam and that will lead to bad things.  Just be smart about it.

It is said that life is 5% what happens to you, and 95% how you deal with it.  It is also said that life is a series of events.  Also, hell is a place where who you have become will meet what you could have been.  I like to combine these ways of thinking into this:  Life is a series of events that will come and go endlessly, things will happen to you and around you and how you react to it will make the difference in becoming the person you WANT to become.  It is only you who knows what to do, pull the trigger and make it happen.

Other thoughts:  
-Don’t compare yourself to others.  You are your own unique person with your own strengths and weaknesses, among so much else.  Even twins have different fingerprints.
-Adapt to situations.  Life is different for everyone everyday, when changes come along, some days will be “fuck it” kind of days and others will be “thinking” kind of days, be aware of this.
-If you overthink, try to relax yourself, use breathing techniques, meditate, do whatever it takes and be aware of yourself and what is around it.  I think that overthinking is a sympathetic (stimulating) response your body puts out in stressful situations and can be treated with breathing, to bring more oxygen into your body and remove CO2 which can ultimately decrease your heart rate among other things to relax you.  
-""fuck its"" are GREAT for AA"

So as a college student, I'm having a crazy semester.  There is stress coming from every which direction - classes, extracurriculars, first semester in an apartment, trying to find an internship- and I feel like I've reached my snapping point.

I've always had my insecurities, but as a person who does a lot of self reflection, I can pinpoint where all of these insecurities come from.  I've never felt the need to see a therapist, because what could they possibly tell me that I don't already know? Besides, over the years my confidence really improved and the insecurities have never been so stifling to interfere with my everyday life.

Until now.  Now, little things that used to never bother me can have me crying on my bedroom floor for an hour.  Little stupid things will set me off, and I'll go into this downward spiral of thinking everyone hates me, that I have nothing to offer, that I'm ugly, that my boyfriend is going to leave me, etc.  Once the episode is over, I'm back to normal, kicking myself and wondering why I thought any of those things.

Lately, this has been happening on almost a daily occurrence.  It's really starting to effect how much work I can get done.  I'm hoping once the semester is over, I can take a break and the relaxation will help me get my life back in order.  I was also on the pill back in high school for acne, so I'm considering going back on it in hopes that it'll balance out my hormones a bit.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I could use some advice on how to destress myself before I completely lose my mind!  I don't know how much more of this I can take.  Any help would be much appreciated."

1372k2,25,2012-11-14,I can run as much as I want,[deleted],running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1372k2/i_can_run_as_much_as_i_want/,"For 11 years, I was plagued by running injuries. I love running, but I could not run more than 10-20 miles a week. It did not matter how much time I took off to allow my injuries to ""heal"", how much stretching I did, how conservatively I tried to run. Something always hurt.

I started jogging in 1994, as an out-of-shape 18 year old. I jogged for a few years without problems, but then I just quit. I never logged more than 30 miles a week. I was just your average casual runner. 

In 2001 I decided to start running again. I slowly got back into it and loved it. I caught the running bug. Ironically however, a few months into it, I started having all kinds of problems with my legs. First, pain in the back of my right knee. I put up with it for a few months, but I was feeling depressed about it. My ""reward"" for going out and running was pain. Sometime it hurt while I was running, but usually it hurt a lot the day after. I saw a doctor and had an MRI. He said he saw nothing wrong with it, but was a nice guy. He told me it might just be a minor tear and that he could ""open up my knee"" to find the injury and fix it. I opted not to do it.
Over the next year I injured my left achilles tendon. I started searching online for a remedy and I found many articles praising ""eccentric calf raises"" for treating achilles injuries. I started doing them daily. My left achilles got a little better, then a little worse, and so on. The exercises did not help me overcome my injury, but in the process I also injured my right achilles. I started wearing gel heel pads that I bought from Walgreens. These helped a lot. The pain never went away but it was manageable. On days when I didn't wear them, my achilles tendons hurt a lot more. 

Again, taking up to a month off did not help. The pain would go away, but 1 or 2 days after starting to run again the pain would return. It had been a few years now, I think it was 2005. I had not managed to run more than 20 miles a week since my comeback. 

I read somewhere that wearing plantar fasciitis night splints could help with achilles injuries by gently stretching the tendon while you sleep. I bought two. Within a week my feet started to hurt. Both of them. I googled the injury and it was called - plantar fasciitis. This was the worst injury I got so far. I could run through my knee and achilles pain, but this was something else entirely. 
I took a month off from running, but then my feet started to hurt when i was just walking. I could no longer wear shoes. I had to take 2 weeks off from work. Finally, I found some foot braces that helped relieve the pain. I decided to take a few more months off from running because I was afraid I might hurt myself so badly that I'd be crippled for life. The plantar fasciitis got better over the next few months and I started running again - using the Walgreens foot braces. However, they fit very tighly around my foot, so I would have to stop every 10 minutes and take them off, because I was afraid they would cut off the circulation to my feet. After a few weeks of running they got looser, and I would only have to take them off every 30 minutes.

Over the coming years I continued to run my 10 to 20 miles a week, always regretting not being able to run more, thinking ""well, I'm just getting older and I don't have a teenage body anymore, I just have to deal with the injuries"". I was now wearing all kinds of orthodics in both shoes, but I didn't mind. The thought of not being able to run at all was just too depressing.

I saw a sports doctor around 2008. He had an intern in his office. They looked at my feet and remarked that they were not made for running. I forget the exact terms the doctor used but he said there was something wrong with my heels. He turned around to his intern and said ""you see those heels?""; he said that I would need major surgery to fix my feet. ""Do you really want to do that?"". I told him no, of course. I'd rather stop running than have unnecessary surgery.
Of course, I couldn't give up running... just thinking about it made me wanna die. So I kept running through the pain...

Now, this would have been my running story for the rest of my life, I have no doubt about it. However, in 2010 something else happened - my hands started to hurt. I have been a computer gamer all my life, and always played for hours on en with no problems. Suddenly, however, my left wrist started hurting while playing World of Warcraft.
My doctor suggested that I go to physical therapy. It was boring stuff, but I went. My wrist got better. I started wearing a wrist brace. That helped a lot. I thought nothing more of it.
six months later my wife and I purchased our own place. It was very stressfull, dealing with all the paperwork, the agents, lawyers, interest rates, etc.
While playing games one night, my other wrist started to hurt. Now, the pain in my left wrist had never completely gone away, but it only hurt a bit from time to time. So I bought a wrist brace for my right hand as well. But the pain got worse. I stopped playing - nope, still pain. It started to hurt at work. It got worse, i started using voice recognition to move the mouse and type. I was scared sh**less that I would lose my job/career. I would lie awake at night in a cold sweat, cursing myself for having ruined my hands with something as stupid as computer gaming. The pain got worse still. It seems I had something called Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). I took 6 weeks off from work. Nope, still hurt. Now it hurt just using the TV remote to switch channels, to shave, to turn a door knob. I saw some of the best hand surgeons in the state - had two MRIs, two EMGs, an ultrasound. The MRIs and EMGs showed nothing. The ultrasound was inconclusive, they told me there might be something in my right forearm. 
I subscribed to an RSI mailing list called Sorehand. http://www.sorehand.org/
Some of the people who post there have been suffering for 30 years or more. I read that most people never fully recover from RSI. It's a lifestyle. There was one other condition I had seen described as a lifestyle, on various running forums: plantar fasciitis. People just don't recover from it.

I was depressed and continued to search. I continued to run, but just barely, continued to type - just barely.
On October 31, 2011, while googleing RSI for the thousandth time, I ran accross this page created by someone named Aaron Iba. Aaron went through rougly the same ordeal I did, so I could strongly relate. He said that his pain, while physical, had been caused by stress, not by a physical injury.

http://aaroniba.net/articles/tmp/how-i-cured-my-rsi-pain.html

Aaron is an eloquent writer. He convinced me to read Dr. Sarno's book. I read in that weekend. Even while reading it my forearms started feeling better. 
My running injuries started to go away, one by one. In two weeks, most of them were gone. The odd thing is, I never questioned my running injuries. I always assumed they were physical injuries. They just went away by themselves. I feared my right forarm injury the most. It was the last to go away. 

It's been a year now. I've been meditating, slowing down.
I read ""The Divided Mind"" and ""The Mindbody Prescription"" by Dr Sarno.
I also read ""They Can't Find Anything Wrong: 7 Keys to undestranding, treating and healing stress illness"" by Dr. David Clarke
I attended Dr. Clarke's lecture when he came to Chicago a couple of weeks ago. 
I now see how stressed i was. On autopilot, basically. I learned to slow down. I still get a little pain from time to time. The odd thing will hurt. 
I've slowly been picking up my mileage. This year I will run 2000 miles, give or take 10 miles. I ran 55 miles last week, including 4 10-mile runs in consecutive days.
My legs are fine. Sometimes when I sit on the couch next to my wife and she brushes her hand against my legs, she remarks on how hard they feel. She's right. They might as well be steel. The human body is remarkable. 
I run as much as I want to now. And I'm good at it too, I can hold a 7 min/mile pace for 10 miles now. Although I've been careful to increase my mileage slowly, I feel that there is no limit. i want to run a marathon race one day, maybe somewhere fun like Hawaii. I though I would never get to run well, or play computer games again, or have a normal life.

Stress Illness, and particularly stress pain is still not widely recognized, diagnosed or treated in the medical community, which I can attest to first hand. Of the dozens of doctors I've seen over the years, not ONE ever even hinted that my pain might be due to stress (ie psychosomatic)
Which is funny, because the number one prescription drug for chronic back pain, Cymbalta, is an anti-depressant. So the knowledge does exist.
It has been my experience that most people are very skeptical when told that their chronic pain may not be physical. I would say that 95% of the people I've spoken with about this have dismissed it out of hand, without even giving the notion a second thought.

""A healthy mind in a healthy body""

Anyway, Aaron Iba was kind enough to write his story and put it out there for the world to see, and it changed my life. It is my sincere hope that my post may help someone.

A testament of triumph to female empowerment in this post-feminist world, who’s yet to meet the person who could push her down.*
*Until she finds herself tangled in a devil’s deal with Hayato, a strange man who insists on challenging her at every step as he leads her into his world of dark desires and tempting games of power. Matching his clash of wit, will, and seduction, Max begins to wonder if being empowered has to always mean being on top. If the socially acceptable, politically correct conventions, at the cost of her desires, is really the answer. She wonders if the fight—the down and dirty struggle between well-matched mates—isn’t the most exciting part of power.*
*But just as Max takes the upper hand, her games are used against her. Her play is turned into a way to punish her by threatening to bring her newfound, dark desires out into the public spotlight.*
*Max will need to decide what is worth fighting for. Her place, power, and reputation in the professional world? Or her freedom to decide how she lives and loves.*

**NaNoWriMo Week One Excerpt - Part One**

“I want my goddamned file!”

He looked up from his monitor as Max stormed through his office’s main door, Elin trailing behind her.

“I’m sorry, sir,” Elin apologized, still trying to get ahead of Max’s long, determined strides. “I told her that you were very busy today and that she’d need to make an appointment, but—”

“It’s all right,” he told her. “Call Werther and push our meeting until three and reschedule the office meeting for tomorrow. Thank you, Elin.”

“Yes, sir,” she said, leaving quickly.

After the doors shut, he turned to face Max’s sneering face. “It must be an enormous ego-stroke for you to have an assistant who calls you *sir*,” she snarled.

“It’s just a word,” he said with a dismissive shrug, knowing that to a woman like Max it was much more. “I don’t require or demand it from Elin. It’s her choice to address me that way.”

“At least you gave her a choice, Mr. Hayato,” she spat back. “Now, I want my file—the original copy and any other copies you might have made. I want all history of me wiped from your records. And,” she added with a spitfire swish of her head, “if you can manage it, *Mr. Hayato*, I’d love it if you and your little club disappeared completely, if not from the face of the Earth than at least from my life. Think you can manage that?”

He smiled, admiring the glitter in her eyes and the glow of her skin that all that violent anger lent her. It was an unforgivable cliché, but she was stunning when she was angry. “Maxine,” he chided, knowing he was tempting more of her ire, “you needn’t to be so formal.” He smiled as he saw—heard—her grind her teeth. “After what we’ve done together” —and all the things we’ll do, he added to himself— “you don’t have to call me *Mister*.”

“Well,” she shot back, planting balled, meticulously manicured fists against full, sensual hips encased in a stiff, molded skirt, “I don’t know what to call you, since you won’t tell me your first name.”

His grin widened as he let his gaze travel down the tailored length of her skirt, down shapely legs, and all the way up again to her gloriously furious face. “I told you what you could call me.”

She gave a derisive, unladylike snort. She stepped back, altering her defensive stance into something more aggressive as she crossed her arms under her buttoned-down breasts, held down and held captive by a pretty, professional jacket. “If I understand BDSM guidelines,” she said, her voice taking on the icy chill of logic and tempered tone of debate, “the title *Sir* is reserved for tops or Doms used by their bottoms.” It was wrong that her tight, tense, cold voice, that strove to conceal all her fire, made him so hot. “It’s not a label tossed out lightly. You have to earn that title.” Her cold eyes flashed fierce and hard. “I have to agree to it.”

His lips twitched as he fought the urge to grin. Instead, he sat back in his chair, leaning against the soft, cushioned back. “I hesitate to point out,” he drawled, “that you did indeed say that you belonged to me. That you were mine.”

“*Do you belong to me*?” he’d asked her that night in the club. “*Speak*.”

“*Yes*.” So soft. A weak whisper of sound.

“*Yes what*?” he’d pushed, the feel of her skin—the delicate length of her neck held tight in his grasp—making him hot and hard.

“*Yes*,” she’d said, the sound reluctant, but resigned, “*I’m yours. Sir.*”

He’d wanted so much to fuck her right then and there at those words.

He wanted to again just at their memory.

“I didn’t mean it,” Max hissed testily as she glared at him from across his desk, much of her cool reserve melting, “and you know it. It was a completely irrelevant statement, made under duress. It was either you or a night with Rand.” She sniffed. “If I’d known how difficult you were going to be, I would have made a different decision.” She made a small, almost inaudible sound of female impatience. “I swear a single night with that caveman—no matter how tawdry or how fucked-up it would undoubtedly have been—would have been easier than dealing with you.”

He gave a short, thoroughly amused laugh. “I’m sure a night with Rand would have been many things,” he said, as he eyed—studied and imagined—her body and all the secret possibilities it held, “but—or so I’ve been told—*easy* would not have been one of them.”

She huffed, her nostrils flaring as she glared dark and stormy eyes at him. “I want to know your name,” she demanded.

He smiled, still remembering their first encounter. “I like the way *Sir* sounds from your lips.” Loved the way the word tumbled from her mouth like instinct, unwilling but ingrained.

He saw her fists flex as she fought the urge to growl. He wished she wouldn’t fight so hard, wished that she would unleash herself. “There must be something else I can call you other than *Sir*.”

“*Master*?”

It was slight and he almost didn’t see it, but he glimpsed the briefest blink of amusement flicker across her face. She tilted her head at a mocking angle. “How about *milord* or *your excellency*?” she said with jibbing rigidity as she dropped into a scathing curtsy.

He laughed. “If you prefer,” he replied with a matching bow of his head before he shrugged off her disdain. “It’s just a title, Max. Just a name. A relatively harmless one at that. We use it every day in polite parlance. Is it really worth all this trouble? All this fight?”

———

Fine! Max thought, ready to tear out her hair.

What did it matter to her anyway? she thought as she calmly ran her hands over her carefully coiffed hair. It wasn’t as if she was going to see him ever again.

And he was right. She called strangers *sir* and *ma’am* all the time. And, narrowing her gaze at the live-action anime man, she knew this guy was certainly stranger than most.

Besides, she thought, maybe it would put a nice distance between them. Maybe if she started treating him like the stranger—the anonymous no one—he was, being with him would feel less intimate.

So, fine. If he wanted to act the arrogant ape-man, that was just *ducky* with her. “I want my file now,” she repeated through gritted teeth, “*sir*.”

He smiled, tapping a thoughtful finger over his thin, smirking lips, as an unease rolled over her. She did not like that look. Didn’t like the tickled, rumbling laughter that accompanied it. She didn’t know what it meant, but she knew it couldn’t be good.

“I’ll tell you what,” he finally said, “for that, I’ll give you a page of the file.”

A page? “A page?” she balked. “No, I want my file—the whole thing—and I want it now.”

He tsked. “We’ve been through this,” he said. “The file is about you,” he repeated with a shake of his head, “but it’s not yours.”

Oh, he wanted to play, did he? Well then, she thought, let’s play. “If you don’t give it to me right now, lawyer-boy,” she scolded, using her most imperious tone—the one that made her interns quake, “I’m going to bring in my own attorney and—”

“And what, Max?” he asked, interrupting her. “Make a case out of this? Making your file not just my property but evidence as well? Is that really what you want?” He settled back, steepling his finger thoughtfully. “I’m fairly well-established as an unscrupulous member of the seedy underbelly, a dirty-pool defender of the less than sterling sect of society. My reputation won’t be affected should this become public.” His hard, almost gleeful gaze bore into hers. “Can you say the same?”

She growled, the sound strangled and choked in her tight throat.

They both knew the answer to that.

No.

If that file—if the fact that she belonged to a club like Donovan’s, however momentarily and unwillingly—became public knowledge, she’d not only be deeply embarrassed, she’d be ruined. How could she expect anyone to take her seriously as an advocate and editor of feminist erotica if she had ties to a club that used and degraded women as mere sex objects so unabashedly? She wouldn’t just be fired, she’d be laughed out of the industry.

No, legal recourse was an empty threat and they both knew it. Her hands were judicially tied. She couldn’t force him to give her anything without attracting unwanted attention she couldn’t afford. Max pressed a finger to her throbbing temple. Well, shit. She shut her eyes, squeezing them shut.

“This is blackmail,” she accused.

She jumped when she felt his hands touch her from behind, wrapping gently—almost comfortingly—around her shoulders. “No, this is a compromise,” he said in a soothing tone.

Still trying to swallow her surprise—she hadn’t even heard him move—she forced herself to breathe and think. “What kind of compromise?” she asked, suspicion making her tense.

He sighed and dropped his hands, his disappointment in her dousing her doubts. “A fairly simple one,” he stated in a brisk, business-like tone that she knew he adopted for her sake. She softened a bit, appreciating his effort. “There are twenty-six pages in your original file, plus a digital copy kept in the system. I’m offering an even trade, a favor for a page.” 

“And the digital copy?” Max asked, wanting to fully understand his deal before countering.

“The same?”

“Not a chance,” she said. “I don’t want to do one favor for you, you think I’m going to agree to fifty-two?”

“I like a woman with quick math wits; too many people need calculators for simple addition,” he said with a smirk. “What if the digital file counts as half?” he asked. “Thirteen favors. Plus the original twenty-six makes thirty-nine.”

“No deal,” she argued. “The digital file takes a right click of the mouse to delete. It shouldn’t count as a favor at all.”

“And the whole file is a shredder-feed away from non-existence,” he stated.

“Exactly,” she stated, with a decisive wave of her hand. “It’s such an easy fix for you; why make this difficult—why prolong it—when it’d be easy for you to just end it?” Then he’d be out of her way, she’d be out of his, and the world could go back to the way it was before.

“Because this isn’t about effort,” he told her sagely, “it’s about worth. And you’ve made it very clear that you value this file very much.” Folding his own arms across his chest, he asked with a cocky tilt of his head, “So, Max, how much do you want it?”

Deliberately ignoring the innuendo liberally laced in his words, she sniffed and focused on making the deal. “The digital file is worth one favor,” she said. “One click, one favor. Fair?”

He shifted in his chair, excitement—and something hotter—sparking in his eyes as he watched her. “Strictly speaking, it takes three clicks—a right, a left, and an *okay*—to delete the file. Three clicks, three favors. Fair?” he tossed back.

She sighed. “Done.” She could accept that.

“Good,” he said. “The digital file will count as three additional requests on top of the original twenty-six.”

“Wait,” she stopped. “If we’re counting the digital file by how many clicks it takes to delete it, shouldn’t we do the same for the paper copies? How many button-pushes would it take to delete the file?”

“Several,” he said as his ice-blue gaze narrowed, telling her more effectively than words that he was rapidly reaching the end of his patience and leniency, “if I fed it through the shredder in huge chunks so it purposefully jammed. Are you sure that’s how you want to measure this?”

“Have it your way,” she acquiesced casually—as if it didn’t matter at all—sensing that more argument might cost her valuable ground she’d just gained. “So, that’s twenty-nine requests.” Not an easy task, but not nearly the worst undertaking she’d taken on. A good deal, she thought. “But nothing illegal,” she added quickly. “And nothing that could jeopardize my career.”

“Of course,” he said with a swift nod. “But in return, I want a time limit on these requests. If you refuse a request or take longer than three minutes to begin complying, you forfeit that page.” Tossing her a challenging glance, he added, “Agreed?”

Max bit her lip. She didn’t like the idea that there was even the possibility—the very real likelihood—that he could keep any of those pages in his possession.

“I promise not to compromise you physically, professionally, or personally,” he told her softly. “I have no desire to harm you in that way or any other. You are safe with me.”

She scoffed. Safe with a blackmailer in an all but blind deal?

But what choice did she have? She couldn’t leave here empty-handed. Besides, she thought as she studied him, I can handle anything—even him. She took a deep breath. “Agreed.”

“Excellent,” he said almost cheerfully. “I don’t suppose you’d be willing to seal our deal with a kiss, would you?” he asked mockingly.

“Sure,” she said with a shrug. “Why don’t you kiss my ass and we’ll call it a deal?”

He laughed. “Bend over;” he said with an obvious leer to her behind, “it’d be my pleasure.”

Her face wrinkled. She was sure it would be his pleasure—all his. Perv. “How about a handshake?”

“How about our first trade?” he countered.

Fine. He wanted another drink with her? Wanted to watch some more live sex shows starring her nearest and dearest? That was just fine. She could deal with twenty-nine nights of that, if it would get her goddamned file for her. She shrugged and then nodded.

“My first request,” he told her as he moved to lean against his desk, “give me your panties.”

Max stuttered. “Excuse me?”

“Your panties,” he repeated, sounding impatient, “give them to me.”

So I'm having a bad semester here at school. I'm in the second and last year of my graduate program, and I have a really busy semester. I'm working 17 hours a week and if anything, I need more hours doing that, because I'm doing it for internship credit. I'm also taking 13.5 hours of class. That might not sound like all that much, but it's basically like working full time-- the only time I have off from 9-5 is Friday afternoons, so all of my group and advising meetings end up being then-- and I have homework and club duties on top of that.

I was hanging on-- by the tips of my fingers-- up until Halloween. A close friend of mine died in a car accident right before it, which basically fucked my schedule and getting things done for about a solid week. My professors were all great and extended my deadlines, but that just means that they conflicted with other deadlines. Further complicating things is that I have tons of group projects this semester, so my performance not only affects me, but them too.

I'm desperately trying to get back on track from then, but I feel like I'm floundering; I'm just reacting to the things that come my way, instead of being proactive about getting things done. I'm having a terrible time focusing on school and homework; I end up wasting my nights and time browsing the internet or watching Netflix or whatever instead. My old tricks for getting myself to get things done don't seem to be working. I just want this semester to be over.

Before you ask, I am seeing a counselor already; I started seeing her for body and food issues as well as anxiety in September. I will be talking to her about my focus issues tonight.

Also potentially complicating things is that I switched from Lexapro to Zoloft two weeks ago.

Anyways, I would really appreciate any advice you guys could give me about getting back on track. I really love this subreddit and you have given me good advice in the past.

edit

I forgot to mention, I have been trying to do fun things too to try and ""take care of myself,""-- I've done some art therapy (omg I love painting pottery), karaoke, got laid (wooooooooo), etc.

edit Omg I forgot the TL;DR

TL;DR: Really overwhelmed by college semester and having trouble focusing.

135u2k,15,2012-11-13,"My brother is a total scum [Lame vent, please ignore]",iiRockpuppy,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/135u2k/my_brother_is_a_total_scum_lame_vent_please_ignore/,"[](/cadence) I wanna make this quick because it's way past my normal time to start heading home...

See, I work as an intern at this computer store and they trust me enough to leave a key to the store. That's how I get internet anymore. 10 o'clock is my curfew to come home, and that's seriously enforced - especially on the week days when normally I'm not allowed to be here.

More recently, my little brother has been deciding to come over. All my brother does here is play Minecraft... not socializing or using his time effectively. It's curfew now, and he's still playing. He arrived at around 7. Some days, that's all he'll do: Minecraft survival games. I mean, I've played it before and understand the appeal, but it's so outrageous to me to be playing it *all day long* and have it be the only thing you do anymore.

He also has apparently found some girls to start talking to online. Alright. At least he's chatting over the computer's mic with them and knows they're not pedos or anything... I've gained plenty of friends (many which browse the Plounge frequently) over copious amounts of MC playing, but we've all branched out of it and have begun closer relationships (meeting at BronyCon, working on a radio show with them, so on).

So, back to exactly what's transpired now... I tell him it's time to go home. He gets pissy, I ignore him until he finally gets off, *just* before 10 (normally, I leave at 9:30 so I have plenty of time to get home). So he's waltzing around the room as I wrap up my last minute dealeos. I know those Survival games take quite sometime depending on the map so I wanted him off before he got into another round.

*ANYWAY*, he confronts me as I'm taking care of my stuff and askes, ""Can you get MC on a SD card? I want to play it on "". I scoff at the idea. Reasoning: our mother's computer is already loaded with shit my brother's put on. Now, initially I was going to say just that, but in my head, I knew it was a bit cruel... So I turn to him and said, ""Brother, you know mom's computer can't handle it. It's loaded with enough crap. And I, based on what I know, you don't have a big enough SD card to hold MC and play it."" 

I gave him all the details in a very realistic and soft enough tone so I try to not frustrate him... and he just storms off, curses me out, and leaves... and he has my headphones I let him borrow to talk to those girls on MC.

So my problem here is... no headphones to listen to music on the way home.

[](/rbonbon) There! See? Totally stupid reason to get even a little bothered, but it happens all the time.

Anyway, I must be off. Goodnight every Plounger!"
135p3e,1,2012-11-13,"Living abroad for a year: after 2 months, I'm starting to hate it.",a_lot_like_you_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/135p3e/living_abroad_for_a_year_after_2_months_im/,"Hi all, this is my first reddit posting so please have patience with my writing style and general ineptitude.  If you find the topic intriguing enough, then bear with me here.

After graduating college, I had an opportunity to go abroad for a year with an internship in the field I got my degree in.  I've been studying the language for a while, but haven't had a chance to immerse myself yet, so I thought it would be a good idea.  I'm thinking about going after a doctorate in the future, but I don't know what I want to do enough yet so I figured this would also buy me some time to figure out what I like doing.

When I first got here two months ago, I was totally engaged.  I was so thrilled to be in a new place, speaking a new language, and meeting new people all the time.  I'm living in a hostel, so it was a constant influx of new faces, new personalities, and new conversations.  Every day was an adventure, because I'd be learning 10 new things at a time.

At this point, a lot of what I found exciting about this place initially has worn off.  I am beginning to hate it here.  I feel trapped.  I don't want to go home, and I am committed to getting through this because I think it is a tremendous opportunity for me to grow and face whatever habits I practice that may cause me to inflict misery on myself in my life, but it is wearing on me emotionally.   

I constantly feel like the outsider.  I am pretty good at the language, but my accent makes it obvious that I'm a foreigner.  People here can be quite nice, but I don't feel like I am really fostering any deep relationships outside of the people I know through work.  My work relationships can only go so far though, because I don't feel as comfortable delving into personal issues with people I share a professional environment with.  I can talk with my family and friends via facebook and skype, and they are nothing but supportive, but that can only go so far too.  It's not a real substitute for fulfilling face-to-face human interaction.  

The people that I meet outside of work don't seem to have all that much in common with me.  I tried going out drinking and dancing with people from the hostel, but I got turned off from that quickly.  They go out very late here, and trying to keep up with the nightlife makes me feel miserable, especially because I don't feel close to anyone.  I've never really felt like that is my thing, and this is just a struggle with no payoff.  I don't care about going out anymore, and I find it to be more stress than it is worth, but I am embarrassed about appearing like a loner or being socially incompetent so I feel guilty about not continuing to try. 

I make the effort to talk to strangers.  I have put myself out there, a lot.  I go out to the beachfront and play guitar in public and strike up conversations.  The relationships never seem to go anywhere, though.  Maybe it's a consequence of the way I approach meeting people, but I don't seem to have much deeply in common with the people I meet.  I would feel just as well not having met them.  I don't mean it in a rude way, and being around human beings can often feel better than feeling lonely, but spending time with these people does not feel meaningful when we can't communicate any common interests.  I don't feel like I share common values with them either, and I can't figure out if it is just a cultural difference or something about our personalities not clicking.

My hostel is getting on my nerves, too.  The excitement of new interactions has dulled.  I don't feel like I have a lot in common with these people, and it feels like a burden to constantly stretch and adapt to living with other people in such close proximity.  It is loud here, too.  Buses and motorcycles go by outside, and it shakes the building.  

My struggles with anxiety have flared up since arriving, and I am working really hard to get that under control but I find it very emotionally taxing.  I am getting really bad migraines, too.  I think I had them occasionally before I got here, but they are coming more frequently and they are more debilitating now than they ever have been.  The last week has been torture.  The last two days, I have come home from work and done nothing but slept because I have no energy or desire to do anything more.  It sucks though, because even if I try to go to bed early I wind up waking up before the night is through and I have to face my feelings of isolation and lethargy before the morning arrives.  

I do not know really how to deal with these issues still, despite four years of what I considered intensive counseling during uni for school-related anxiety.  I am trying a lot of things, from cutting alcohol and caffeine out of my diet to exercising and establishing a disciplined daily routine (going to bed on time, brushing and flossing every night, making my bed in the morning).  I try just about every LPT I find on reddit :)

It's not really working, though.  I am thinking maybe if I had my own place, things would be better.  I'm currently looking, although the soonest I could move out is the end of the month.  Work is really not all that bad, and there are some things that I find very compelling about it, so I think I need to focus on the good things that I have going for me.  I am starting to go to english classes here (a friend from work brought me so that I could help out), and I think that is actually a good way to get plugged into a network of people that I can relate to a bit better.  This is all just a bitter fucking struggle for me, and I don't know how it is all going to work out.  

I am optimistic about my experience and about life, deep down, but this is pretty hard on me right now.  I feel really fucking stupid quite often.  Maybe this is just what I need in my life to get me to see myself clearly for who I am, and to get over small issues I have with life and with myself and get my priorities straight, but I really do not know.  Maybe it is just a temporary discomfort, and I am blowing it out of proportion.  I feel guilty because I feel like a lot of the things I'm dealing with could be my fault, and I am sitting here complaining about what is generally a pretty good situation when other people in the world (Syria, Sandy victims) actually have real issues to deal with.

Well, if you have read through this all then I do appreciate it.  I don't think this was my best piece of writing ever.  I have just tried to honestly communicate the difficult emotions that I am experiencing here, and hopefully I have not come off as too cold or impersonal or robotic in my limited forms of expression.  I feel exceedingly idiotic about my situation, and maybe sharing my situation a bit and hearing how other people perceive it can help me to find perspective.

TL;DR: If you did read through the whole thing, then I don't think you need this.  If you didn't, then I don't think I care to hear your comment.  Thanks :)"

This semester, I've gotten myself an internship, had a personal non-fiction essay accepted for publication, applied for graduation from my 3rd college, and was informed, just today, that I've been the recipient of an Undergraduate Research Grant that I applied for.

I spent one year feeling sorry for myself, another getting my shit together, and this year working hard to build my resume and I'm hoping that next year, things like jobs and success will come my way, with some more hard work."

1396or,5,2012-11-15,I just needed to share this,ThatFeel_IKnowIt,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1396or/i_just_needed_to_share_this/,"Summary of Problem

Have you ever been driving and saw a car try to merge too early or too late into your lane and had a split second spike of adrenalin and anxiety? Have you ever been waiting in line at a bar and saw a fight start to form and watched as one of the participants pulled out a knife or gun? You know that split second of “HOLY SHIT!” and the overwhelming out-of-body surge that just screams disaster and lets you strongly sense that something bad is about to happen? Do you recognize the physical symptoms that accompany this? You know that knot in your chest, muscle tightness, shortness of breath, an overwhelming urge to escape to danger, or just en entire overload of the senses? This type of adrenalin rush or extreme panic is a healthy brain function that alerts the body to danger and muscles up energy for a chance to defend or escape a dangerous or hazardous situation.
	
Now imagine feeling those same surges of anxiety, both mentally and physically, for things like knowing you have to go to work today, worrying about where you want to find a job, where you want to live, if the new person moving into your apartment will be a weirdo. Worrying about whether or not you’ll ever make as much money as your friends, knowing you have a ton of dishes to do when you get home, wondering if you are able to stop smoking pot every day. Clearly there is a distinction between the examples in the previous paragraph and the ones just listed.  Lastly, just think about how long the previous paragraph’s episodes would last. They probably last right up until the situation is resolved. As soon as you honk at the car that swerved into your lane and assuming the car swerves back into their lane, that spark of anxiety will probably last no more than 5 seconds. If you see that guy in the bar line pull out that knife, you might decide it’s time to walk or run away since you are not part of the fight. Maybe that episode lasts 5 minutes from the time you see the fight starting to the time you run across the block. Not only do I get anxiety attacks for mundane every-day reasons, my periods of severe anxiety and terror last for weeks to months.
	
The difference between normal, healthy “anxiety” and whatever the hell I have is that I get panic attacks and the physical symptoms of severe danger where really no problems or dangers exist. I know it’s not normal to have full on panic attacks and pack-a-day cigarette binges at least multiple times in the week. I smoke weed constantly in an effort to quell the symptoms even for an hour or two. Taking 0.5 mg of Klonopin for these attacks aren’t even enough to stop the racing thoughts and disgusting pit in my stomach. 
	
I’ve always had anxiety like this and I have been on every single SSRI and SNRI under the sun but the last year and a half I have been off of all meds and it’s getting to the point where I am beginning to feel suicidal and hopeless. I am afraid that if I do not fix whatever is wrong with me, that I will have no choice but to kill myself in order to stop the pain. I am seriously terrified and dreadful that I may have some sort of mental illness that is incurable. 


Reasons why I may have this disorder:

	I have always been on the go. Even as a toddler and pre-teen, my mom always told me that it seems like I always need to be doing “something.” Anything. I’m always on the move. I could never really seem to sit still and relax (psychiatrists and therapists have always said that they do not think I have ADD or ADHD. They say this is an anxiety problem as the reason why I cannot focus is not because I am over stimulated by the external environment, but because I have too many anxious thoughts in my head and cannot focus). I have always felt that I need to be doing something. Like I need to be achieving something. Building something. Buying things, making money, being more social, spending more time with this group or friends or this group. Although these are nice goals, the thing is that since my anxiety is so powerful, I can’t even bring myself to achieve the things I seem to need.
	
Anyway, whatever I may have had in the past, my issues became much for severe when I was in sixth grade. In February of my 6th grade, my father unexpectedly passed away form a heart attack late at night when he was playing tennis with a friend. His friend said he was complaining about a shortness or breath and pain and then just collapsed. The paramedics did not arrive fast enough to revive him. My mom did not want an autopsy. She was just so upset and paralyzed that she did not think to find out what had happened. I believe he had either high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Either way, it was obviously a heart attack. My father hated doctors. He once had to have a rib removed because the doctors thought there might be a tumor. After removal it turned out the tumor was benign and the recovery process was extremely painful. I think after that, he just kind of stopped going to the doctor for checkups. I do not know if this was preventable by medication or lifestyle changes. I know he smoked cigarettes for 20 years so that may or may not have had a role in his death. There really is no way to tell. I basically have no idea what killed my father and I am also terrified that I am going to die when I am 50 from the same thing that killed him.
	
Basically, his sudden death shook me to my core and I believed something inside of me died that day. Being a sensitive and over stimulated kid already, this devastated me to the point where it still makes me cry to talk about. I think after losing a parent with no warning whatsoever, it instilled a sense of overwhelming dread about the future. I seem to think that something bad is always going to happen and unless I can strive to find the best solution possible, I am going to end up with nothing and I am going to fail or my girlfriend is going to leave me or I am going to go crazy or I will never be able to hold a job or have a life.



Things I am doing to attempt to improve

	First of all, I have decided that I am going to stop smoking pot, or at least heavily cut down on the drug. I’ve been smoking weed basically every single day for the past 6 years. I keep ignoring my therapist’s advice and other’s that marijuana increases anxiety in people who are prone to it and that it changes your thinking and makes it harder for you to clear your head, especially in times where clear-thinking is pertinent. Over the years, I have stopped for 3-week periods in the past whenever I needed to get drug tested for an internship or co-op and I do remember feeling more clear-headed and had a more normal emotional level. 
	
Second, I am going back on SSRIs. I used to be on Celexa and I’ve decided to give it another shot and evaluate the effects without drugs like weed. In the past, I’ve always come off the drugs because of the sexual side effects that affect me. I have trouble Cumming (I’m a guy) and sometimes I remember it would feel desensitized and not as good. This did not happen all the time. It was kind of a hit-or-miss each time. I have decided that although I take pride in how I fuck and in my sexuality, it benefits me more to be happy and clear-headed and I could always try supplementary drugs in order to combat those effects, as long as my doctors say it is healthy to do so. 

Goals for this thread

	I really have none. I haven’t written my feelings down on paper (or Microsoft Word in this case) in a long time and I thought it might make me feel better. Feel free to bash on me, help me, or just read. I don’t mind either way. 


EDIT: 

Sorry if the text requires you to scroll the right. I am not sure why it is doing that.

I am 23 years old and am about to graduate college. It is scary starting a life without a male figurehead to guide me through it. I feel alone and lost and I want nothing more than to find the strength and the stability to further my life and to prepare for adulthood. Right now I would not be able to work a steady job. I need the stability before I can start working and giving my job my all.

13963x,8,2012-11-15,"Not a conspiracy, just a post to r/conspiracy about life.  ",[deleted],conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/13963x/not_a_conspiracy_just_a_post_to_rconspiracy_about/,"Hey everyone.  I am 22 years old and live in the Northeast US.  I have been fortunate (compared to many others in this system) to have attended a top university essentially for free and therefore have a very valuable piece of paper on my side.  I am grateful for that since I do recognize how important that is in ""getting ahead"" and that that opportunity is not afforded to many people, many probably a lot more deserving of it than I.  Regardless, I am still very much disappointed with the world as it is and wanted to voice these feelings and get a sense of camaraderie/advice from some of you.  

For various reasons, I've lived a pretty solitary life and certainly didn't have a ""normal"" childhood.  I've always felt separate from my peers, not understanding the preoccupation with image, fashion, popular music videos, mindless tv, partying, etc.  I've been disappointed on, in my opinion, far too many occasions by ""friends"" who have been superficial and jealous beings, taking advantage of my kindness.  Anyway, like I said, I struggled growing up trying to find connections with my age group.  I poured a lot of my energies into schoolwork, understanding that hard work in school would pay off later in degrees and then a stable, well-paying, stimulating career.  This became the momentum to propel me through a pretty regimented and dull life of school, homework, tests, year in and year out, until I got to college. 

I arrived at college, already a cynic, but still pretty hopeful that it would be a far grander opportunity to meet like-minded people and finally enjoy my schoolwork since I expected classes and lectures to be less regimented, more creative in their approach to issues in the world.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed yet again by social connections, finding more of the same self-centered and exploitative attitudes in people, (I'm sorry to say, mostly in men), as well as a college environment that, by appearances, was exciting and diverse, but nevertheless had a pervasive feeling of individual competition, drone-like social archetypes and expectations, and academic tracks that were more of the same illogical, unnecessary, jumping through hoops to satisfy testing.  I was disenchanted to say the least, seeing that selling the first 18 years of my life to school and useless knowledge that would only get discarded by my brain after the test would be followed by another four years at university, and then perhaps another two to eight depending on what kind of graduate school setup you wanted to have.  All the while, you're expected to be ever puffing up your resume with internship experience and connections, in preparation for the almighty job-search.  This endeavor proves most difficult since for the unfortunate ones like myself who didn't land an internship during my summers off, the time I used to look forward to as a break, it is impossible to find a job that doesn't require 3-5 years of previous experience in the field.  Either that, or the job is unpaid or pays so low that you wouldn't even be able to sustain yourself in the area.  

I pushed through college, honestly just wanting to get it over with and therefore constantly worried that there was something wrong with me.  Why wouldn't I play the game like everyone else? Why wasn't it enough for me? All I wanted was a group of close friends, a partner, to see my family and dogs again, and to live modestly somewhere removed from the hustle and bustle of all this insanity.  Though I knew the whole while that I would only be able to do that with some kind of job to support myself, thereby focusing my attention back onto the problem.  I couldn't imagine that this is what ""the best years of my life"" were.

While the college drama was unfolding, I was also beginning to pay closer attention to oddities in national and world news.  Re-examining 9/11 was a big eye-opener for me and I began realizing that the unshakable sense that something was wrong with the world, the surreal hypocrisy and boredom I felt in the systems of daily life, could very well be the product of larger broken and twisted systems.  But whenever I try to bring up discrepancies with what the facts say and what the general public is supposed to believe and operate, I am met with frustration and dismissal.  

Like I said, I'm 22.  I know I'm young and have many opportunities ahead of me, but I am frustrated and angry at the system, and pretty lost in terms of how to proceed.  I don't know what path to follow in my life regarding what further academic track and career to sell it to and fear that if I don't take a breath of air now from just jumping through those hoops, I'm going to end up far worse later on.  I would love to hear other stories of how people have coped with these feelings and what paths they have chosen to pursue.  I know that I want to be a part of organizations that help other people, so I am looking into volunteer opportunities in my area, but I'm still lost about how to proceed in terms of a career.  I've been mulling around the idea of veterinary medicine, but like I expressed, cringe at the long requirements as being mostly useless squandering of more of my young years.  I would like to travel the world to gain more perspective, but do not have the almighty monetary funds to do so.  And I feel as though there is a big change to come within this next year regarding our country, the world, the system in general.  I hope it's for good rather than bad, but either way, perhaps not knowing how to proceed is indicative of this coming change.   I don't want to be mistaken though in waiting for things to change around me so I can figure out a next step.  Like I said, I'm very lost right now.  

I know this has already been a long post and I thank you for listening and perhaps commiserating.  "
138xj1,5,2012-11-15,"God's call on my life, and how I am responding. A wall of text guys, fair warning, but I like to think that the story of the last few months is worth the read!",ScottyFalcon,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/138xj1/gods_call_on_my_life_and_how_i_am_responding_a/,"This has been an exciting year; I'd like prayer for a few things if you wouldn't mind.

At the beginning of this year I felt God had promised me 3 things

*That he would supply me with a job so that I could live out of my parents house for my goal amount of time (1 year), he did, reached my goal, and am now living at home again for school (more on that later)

*That three of my youth kids would either give their life to Christ or get baptized (One has given his life to Christ, a few are considering baptism) but that it would be their choice and not just trying to impress me or other youth staff

*Here's the biggie - That I would meet, but not date until next year (2013) the girl he intended me to marry.

Then things got complicated.

After constant prayer this year, each of these things has either been provided or is in that process. My best friend of almost 15 years (I'm 21) went to bible school at Bodensehoff last year and met a girl that he thought would be perfect for me (shared all the same nerdy interests, is a strong Christian, etc.) with one problem, she was moving back to Calgary after school (I live in Vancouver). Fast forward to September and guess what? She moved to Vancouver to study. He invited me to a play to meet some of his bible school friends (her included) and we really hit it off. The catch was, is that I'd promised God that I wouldn't date this year in response to the third item above. So we hung out a few more times, each time I was more and surer that this was the girl God wanted me to meet. So about a month ago we hosted a Doctor Who marathon together for a bunch of friends at her place. It went great! One by one, after the marathon, each of our friends left to go home, leaving just her, one of her friends and I. We decided to go over to her school to watch a horror movie with her class mates, but when we got there, no one was there. Her friend decided to peace it, and we headed back to her dorm to watch October sky with her roommates (she lives in a Mennonite student building thing). On the bus ride back we had an excellent conversation about family and other things, the entire time my mind was at war with itself about what to do, should I tell her, or not. Once we got off the bus I finally decided. 

“So, here’s the deal” I said “I promised God at the beginning of the year not to date so I could focus my attention on him rather than girls” she got a grin on her face and responded

“Yeah…”


“I really like you” I continued slowly “And I really don’t want this to be a ‘one who got away’ situation so here’s what I propose” Her grin slowly got wider, encouraged I went on “I would like to start a kind of courting/pre-dating relationship, a test drive, if you will, with a decision in the new year as to whether or not we will make it official”

“Oh thank God!” she exclaimed “I thought I was over thinking things!”

As you may be able to tell, I was ecstatic! We are now getting on famously, and I’m hopeful for the best come new years.

Now here’s where it gets *really* tricky
In church two Sundays ago, my pastor was speaking on heeding God’s call on your life, alongside building the church. As he was using an example about some missionaries hearing God’s call on their life, dropping everything and moving to Mexico, it felt like a light switch went on in my head, “Youth ministry” now I’ve been set on being a post-divorce counsellor for a while now, and while I’ve considered this before it’s never been seriously, so after a bit of prayer, I talked it over with my family the next night. It’s important to mention at this point that I am heavily involved in my churches youth group, I’ve moved with the same group of guys from Sunday school (starting when they were in grade 2, they are now in grade 9) and I’d promised them that I would move up with them until they graduated. Anyways my family mentioned that the only school that has a degree focused on youth ministry was a school called Ambrose university, way over in Calgary, initially I objected, wanting to stay in BC so I could continue leading these kids in their walk with God. So they asked “Is there any way you would head to Ambrose before your kids graduate?” and I responded that yes, I would, if I felt clear direction from God. 
The next Wednesday I was at a church service with my life group at their church and a lot of what the pastor was saying was confirming what I now believe to be God’s call on my life. As the sermon came to a close my pastor called people to the front who felt that they needed prayer, I went up. What followed was intense, and unexpected. As he prayed I felt the Holy Spirit moving in my soul, and for the first time in years, I fell to my knees in the presence of the lord. The first thing he put on my heart was that I was indeed supposed to go to Ambrose next fall. I had two objection to this, both of which he responded to. The first was that I had promised to stay with my youth kids, and he told me that “You will do more harm than good by remaining here; I have a leader in place that is far better equipped to deal with what some of your kids are going through.” My second objection was that I now had far more close friends (many of whom celebrated my birthday with me last Friday) than I had ever had previously, far more people that I cared about, and cared about me, than I ever thought I would have. His response to this was powerful “I did not give you these friends that you would remain here” The Lord said “But that you would have the care, support, and courage to be able to drop everything and move to Calgary” At this I surrendered, and am now in the process of registering for classes there.

In the days that followed many more things have occurred to confirm what God has put on my heart. Among them:

*One of my best friends is moving to Calgary in January to live with his dad wishes to be roommates with me once I move out there, his dad may also be able to provide me with a  job.

*I am on far better terms with my family that lives there than I have at any point in my life previous to this point

*The girl I mentioned before is likely moving back to Calgary at the end of her studies in photography, which is currently congruent with the beginning of my schooling at Ambrose

*My youth pastor, after I told him of my call, offered me an unpaid internship at one of the largest youth groups in Canada, an opportunity that is both a privilege and an honour, as he is taking a personal interest in teaching me what he knows (he writes for a website called morethandodgeball.com, a youth ministry resource that 
I highly encourage you to check out.)

My prayer requests

*The only time I experience doubt in my budding relationship is when I relapse in my attempts at nofap, this has been a major problem for me, and I really need to beat this in order to have both a healthy ministry down the road, and a healthy relationship in the new year, pray that God would shine through my weakness and that God would lend me strength.

*That I would be able to get my full drivers licence, and an affordable car as it will be difficult for me to maintain familial relationships, as well as find a church that fits my needs without transportation

*I need a job that allows me the free hours to focus on the internship, while providing me with the appropriate amount of savings so that I can focus on my studies once I reach Calgary

*I feel that there are some of my friends (of whom I have been talking too about Christ for years now) that I am supposed to take with me, pray that either they would approach me, or that when I approach them that they would be accepting 

*Scholarships, I cannot emphasize how much I need these, I come from a single parent family background, and as such do not have much money for schooling put away for me. My mom saved up far more for me than I had expected, and I am extremely grateful, however it is not enough beyond the first semester.

*That whomever God replaces me with at my youth group would be encouraged and fight for the souls of my boys, they are extremely important to me, and leaving them is the hardest part of leaving for Calgary

Thank you all for reading this, and thank you for your prayers.

TL;DR - God has some amazing things in store for me in the next few years, I'm going to study youth ministry! I've also been introduced to an amazing girl, with whom I hope to develop a godly relationship with

Sincerely,
Scotty

138c2u,0,2012-11-15,To my princess...,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/138c2u/to_my_princess/,"This has been going through my head these past few days, I finally found the need to just write it out... I apologize in advance for the crappy grammar and whatnot... writing was never my forte... keep in mind this is more of a general spew of emotion for myself...

**Background:**
 I have been in different relationships for almost 5 years, and I’ve been told that I am the type of guy that just wants to be in a relationship all the time. I’ve just piggy backed from 3 relationships since high school, breaking up with my exes the first 2 times. To be honest, I never knew what love meant until I met C. We met through catering out our university and even though I was dating my ex at the time, I knew I wanted to be with her. We started hanging out more and more and eventually, I just left my ex and started dating C. We’ve been together for almost 2 years and I could be happier with our relationship. The only problem is, I cheated on her right when we first started dating, and it wasn’t with a random girl, it was with my ex. I still can’t explain why I did it… other than I was thinking with my dick, but that isn’t an excuse… She still found a way to take me back, even though I completely messed up. We spent our first year and half almost inseparable and I fell more and more in love with her with each and every day… We went to the same college, but she was older than me and graduated this summer. Our relationship was pretty amazing, we rarely fought and we got along really well. I knew that she was the one for me (and to this day I still think she is). During the end of summer, she took an internship far away and suddenly, we went from seeing each other every day to just text messages and chat, it was a tough transition. I could tell she was very lonely there, alone and by herself. She also was unsure of what she wanted to do in the future. If I was not still in school I definitely would have been up there with her.

I got used to just talking to her online, the internet at the place she was staying was not to great, so skyping was not an option. We texted back and forth every day saying silly things, making sure we had a good day every morning, random “I love you” ‘s throughout the day; it got me through the day. I even visited her beginning of this month for a few days, things were perfect. Fast forward to the end of last week; she is almost done with her internship, (finishes at the end of November) and I am super excited to see her again. However, I see that our conversations are getting less and less, almost as if she was trying to distance herself. Of course, I keep asking her what’s wrong but she just says she has a lot on her mind, specifically graduate school and then veterinary school (she wants to be a vet!) and her future. I keep trying to tell her things will work out but she just didn’t seem to talk about what was going through her head. I get frustrated and slowly get more and more saddened because she just kept getting more and more distant without telling me why. Finally, I was able to have a phone call with her Monday afternoon to figure out what was wrong.
 


**A little more background about me:**
            	I have a history of being a cheater. I cheated on my ex while dating her with my ex ex. As you can see, I’m a pretty shitty individual. This is a big reason why I’m in this situation right now; she’s always had trust issues with me and I can’t blame her. I’m also somewhat flirty (as I have been told by others). During the time C was away, I talked to a few girls online from school quiet often. I had no intention of doing anything, but sometimes when we talked online, I would be very inappropriate. I would say that I acted like this because I was lonely, but once again, that is no excuse for my actions…
 
**Back to the phone call:**
            	I asked her what was wrong, why she has begun to distance herself. She was hesitant at first, but I soon began to realize that she may have stumbled upon one of the conversations I had with one of the girls and one of my close friends(the former inappropriate and the latter just plain stupid), but I am not certain. She then began to tell me that she has not trusted me since I cheated on her two years ago and I could tell that she really was upset with the things I have been saying to girls. She told me that she gave up so much during her last year of college just so she could be closer to me, because she was scared that I was capable of cheating on her again. She gave up an opportunity to study abroad and she eliminated the possibilities of grad schools that would be too far from me, just so she could be sure that I wouldn’t cheat. She also had family issues going on to top it all off. Eventually, the conversation boiled down to the fact that she wanted to take a break. At first I protested and asked her why, how could she do something like this to me, to us. She told me that when she first went to her internship, she was miserable being so far away from me and that she just wanted to come back. But as the weeks past, she slowly began to realize that she was too emotionally dependent on me the past year, but now that she has had the time to be far away from me, she needs to set her future together first and that she should and would not put a relationship in front her professional career… In the end, she asked that we take a break so that she can figure her life out. This broke my heart… But I agreed. I respect her decision and I am willing to give her her space.
 
**Now:**
            Although it has been a couple of days…(I know it hasn’t been that long)… It just feels so difficult to not be able to talk to her. I woke up this morning and instinctively grabbed my phone, hoping for my every morning “good morning love of my life” text, it was so tempting to just say something.  Every gap I have had in the past few days has been spent thinking whether or not she will take me back. I really hate this feeling… being on the other side, where I may or may not have my heart broken. I’m sitting here, on the couch, unable to fall asleep, unsure what to expect the next few weeks. I know for certain that with each passing day, I become more and more sure that she is the one I want to end up with...

**TL;DR I just hope that I don't lose the girl of my dreams...**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sigh... well I’m finally finished... It feels nice to finally just write it out. I’m not looking for pity, it’s more of a  rant for myself and me just spewing my emotions.. I also apologize for the crappy formatting... I've never posted anything before...

*To C,
I know you surf reddit a lot but I’m not sure if you’ll see this. if you do, I hope you’re doing well  and figuring your life out up there. I apologize for making you sacrifice so much for me, you really do make me feel like the luckiest guy ever. As I patiently await for you to return, I want you to know that I love you so much and I will support whatever decision you make. I’m not asking for a reply, but I really hope you see this, and I hope I can one day gain your trust... 
Love,
R*

1385qw,10,2012-11-15,I'm losing myself...,windingdownto_,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1385qw/im_losing_myself/,"I think I'm officially in what people would call a rut.

You might say I'm already doing enough, but I know I'm capable of more. I try my best not to mention what I do to people because it often alienates them. 

I'm taking 24 credit hours, working as a teaching assistant, help actively manage a multi-million dollar fund, and spend a lot of time on reddit. Now, I'm also trying to get an internship as a banker. I honestly feel like I do the first three as fast as possible so I can spend time on reddit. All this seems great, and people around me are impressed by me, but I feel like I'm wasting my potential. 

I know I am extremely capable, but I can't seem to work for myself. I have a great idea for a small business, and I know I have the skills and the know how to make it succeed. I just can't make myself do it. 

It's funny because the business is what I believe would be my ideal life. Yet I can't seem to work toward it. I know I have an extra 20 hours a week I waste on reddit and TV shows--I know some posts and subreddits are great but spending 2-3 hours on them or just getting lost in r/askreddit or r/pics...

I think reddit helps me live vicariously through the stories I read online. I can't really remember what I browsed yesterday, but I do remember it made me feel good. An addiction.

If I stopped completely. Cold turkey. Would the boredom really plague me? I keep thinking I have more time. One and a half more years before I must commit to a lifestyle.

My excuse: ""I still need to learn. How can I have time to learn if I act?""

I'm angry at myself for not being disciplined. How can I coax greatness out of others when I can't find any in myself?

I just want to leave--changing who I am seemed easy. But I realize now I cannot simply change myself. Change within will come as I change the world around me.

Am I afraid?"
13836f,4,2012-11-14,How should I go about getting into medical physics?,IP3R2KO,MedicalPhysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalPhysics/comments/13836f/how_should_i_go_about_getting_into_medical_physics/,"Hi all,

I'm in the senior year of my undergraduate, getting a BS in Computer Science, with a minor in math and an almost-minor in physics.  I had originally been a physics major, but switched to CS about half-way through.

I've done numerous research internships in or around the medical field involving pharmacology, neuroscience, and mostly medical imaging.  Right now at my job I'm working on several different medical visualization and analysis software packages wherein I regularly interact with medical physicists and other physicians.

Here's my question:  I've thought a lot about going into the field of medical physics, and perhaps going back to school for a Ph.D..  However I feel my medical pre-reqs could be lacking.  I've probably taken most of the science courses necessary (and way more CS) except for those in chemistry and biology.  How important is it to have these done in your undergrad, and are there opportunities to complete them after I've graduated (ie continuing education, and such)?  Is this a common situation?  "

He's carrying his bag under one arm, and is looking at his room key which is in his other hand.

Scott (off camera): How does it feel coming down from that high of being backstage at your first RWF pay per view?

Justin: I wasn't on the card.

Scott: You are on the roster, though.  You're on your way.

Justin stops and turns around, he's smiling,

Justin: You're right! I'm on the roster, and soon I'll be in that ring, in front of the fans, giving it my all.

Scott: Okay, poster boy, we need to get to your room, this camera gear is getting heavy.

Justin resumes walking down the hallway then stops at a door.  The camera zooms in on the numbers.

Scott: 815, this is our room.

Justin: My room.  Anderson isn't dropping a dime on you.  Plus, it's only a single bed.

Justin opens the door and steps in, looking back.

Scott: You're not going to let me in?

Justin: No, you have your own damn room.

Scott: I'll let you spoon with me.

Justin rolls his eyes, then shuts the door.

Scott (yelling at the door): Fine, you can be the spoon!

Justin (yelling from the other side of the door): SHUT UP SCOTT!

The shot cuts to a heavy set man, sitting in front of a green screen.  He's wearing a nice looking suit, and is adjusting his tie.

Scott (off camera): I'm just going to let this roll, and get what I can, if that's okay.

The man nods: Yeah, that's fine.

Scott: Candid interview with Baltimore's Ultimate Wrestling Association owner, and board chairman, Allan Webb.

Allan: That's me.

Scott: Mr. Webb, how long did Justin work for the UWA?

Allan: Please, call me Allan.  This is supposed to be candid, right?  As for Moshe, he worked for me a couple of months in 2006, but then left and wrestled in MCW until 2008 then came back to us until early 2011.

Scott: Did he wrestle in 2006?

Allan: No.  Moshe, he helped put up the ring, run consignments, took tickets, put down wires and tape.  He was always up for doing whatever he could do to help.  I started paying him under the table early 2006, and took him on part time until that May.

Scott: Why did he leave?

Allan: When his father died, he didn't want to do anything but work.  He had an internship at his father's DC brokerage, and then he'd take a bus up to Baltimore three days a week, and I could tell it wasn't healthy for him.  I told him he could take some time off, I'd even pay him for it, and he thanked me, but never accepted and thanked me for the time he had with us.  A few months later, I heard he was in Maryland Championship Wrestling and was wrestling in their junior league matches.

Scott: Who approached who in 2008?  Did you hear he had turned 18 and you knew he was a good worker, or did he show up asking for a shot?

Allan: I was in DC doing some promotional stuff, and he had gotten wind I was in the area and literally just showed up.  I was really happy to see him, he was always a good kid.  He thanked me for making him take the time off, and he said it gave him some breathing room to really re-prioritize on his career and wrestling, itself.

Scott: How did that conversation turn into a job?

Allan: I gave him some tickets to our upcoming pay per view, and told him he should come backstage and shake some hands.  I had a World Wrestling Entertainment road agent coming in on that weekend, and though Justin could really get some networking done.  The day of the pay per view comes around, it's about noon, I'm about to leave my office and head over to the First Mariner's Arena, when my cell goes off.  It was Gerry, my crew chief at the arena, saying some guy named Moshe was looking for me.  I told Gerry to put the kid to work.  When I get to the arena Gerry is in tears laughing at how this kid is putting everyone on his crew to shame.  I find Justin sitting on a roadie's box, and he tells me he figured he'd come up a little early to help.

Scott: How does he go from setting up lights and a ring to being on your roster?

Allan: Later that afternoon, a bunch of my wrestlers are out, warming up, going over some stuff, when one of our greener guys, Dale, comes over to me and goes ""Hey, Rex is going stiff on me again.""  Now, the best way to describe Rex is by saying he is a brick wall with brains.  Rex played for the Baltimore Ravens for a season before injuring his neck, then started training to be a wrestler.  Vince wanted him, but Rex use to have a drug problem, but this isn't about Rex, this is about Justine.  Long story short, I hired Rex after six straight months of daily piss tests.  He cleaned up, so I put him on my roster.  The problem was, he was hard on the guys.  He didn't mean to be, but he was.  So Rex is out there, banging up my rookies, when I see Justin watching the warm ups.  I tell Dale to tell Justin to warm up with Rex.

Scott: Rex killed him, didn't he?

Allan laughs: Everyone there swore Justin was bruised by the end of their warm up, but he grinned and bared it.  There was this... man, I still remember the sound... Rex came off the ropes, full speed, and hit Justin with this clothesline that even knocked the wind out of *me*.  Justin sold the shot, rolled out of the ring, and played it off like it was nothing.  I saw determination in him, knew he had some in ring experience working in the MCW, so I gave him a try out match that night.

Scott: That same night?

Allan: It wasn't something I did, ever, but since I knew the kid, I figured the worst that would happen was he bombed.

Scott: Tell me you have footage of that match?

Allan: No.  I had a tight budget, so I didn't record dark matches back then.  I've come a long way since then, and I've learned my lesson, but Justin did alright.  He had a hard time with some things, but I chalk it up to nerves.  What really made me pay attention to him was the chemistry he had with the crowd.  It was like he was a step ahead of them. He knew how to keep them interested without being a show off.  The match was only five or six minutes, but the whole time, he had everyone watching him, not the other guy, one of our seasoned home town guys.

Scott: Did he win or loose?

Allan: He was pinned in the middle of the ring, but to be honest... the way he handled the crowd, how he managed inside the ring... he won... which got him a contract with us at the UWA.

We got at along fine and worked together well, but I had a gf at the time and she had a bf. However, from the moment I saw her she took my breath away.

Rewind 5 months ago...When she got out of relationship I casually asked her if she'd like to get lunch some time and her response was:
""Hey! Dang, that sounds like fun and I would love to grab lunch but I'm in this awkward situation with my ex right now and I'm not sure if it would be the best move on my part.. Lame. I know. lol""

^ Ok, hmm I can kind of accept that. She is either being honest or just letting me down.

Fast forward to present time...I've graduated and moved 35 minutes away while she still lives in college town. We like each others Facebook statuses frequently, we share common interest, and occasionally post on each others walls. Ya know nothing special but maybe it's flirting?

I sent her a message the other night to invite her to my lacrosse alumni game and her response was: 
""I totally would have gone if I was in town!"" (Creepy stalking confirmed she was out of town -_-).

At this point I'd love to respond with ""No problem, [insert witty joke]. Ya know I will be in Tampa next weekend if you'd ever like to get that lunch with me?""

What's are your thoughts, suggestions, feels, and do you have a more suave response to approach the ""hang out"" with?

Thanks!

I thought it was just an internship but I just received an offer letter and they worded it as follows:

This company reached out to my college professors, gave them some info about the project and asked if they had any students they thought would be good and both of my professors recommended me. I interviewed with this company last summer for an internship but didn't get it, however they didn't interview me again because of that so I basically just got handed this job.

The answers that I got boiled down to

* I was personable and great to talk to

* My credentials and technical ability were at the level they were looking for

* a bit too stiff and guarded during interview (isn't this kinds of conflicting with the first bullet point?)

* don't appear to show a lot of enthusiasm for the actuarial profession

The a bit too stiff and guarded part I could definitely see and work on, but I was wondering what the 4th bullet point meant. How do I show that I'm enthusiastic about this profession? I like math, I switched careers from life sciences to math, I probably have more exams done compared to many other candidates, what is it that I'm missing?

(http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xxvrf/i_am_jerome_glenn_ask_me_anything_about_running/).

Mr. Glenn is without a doubt one of the most knowledgeable people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He frequently travels all over the world and meets with foreign dignitaries and leaders to promote The Millennium Project and its goals. On a personal level he has worked with Herman Kahn, Isaac Asimov, and Doug Engelbart (inventor of the computer mouse). He invented the ""Futures Wheel"" and concepts such as conscious-technology, trans-institutions, tele-nations, definitions for environmental security, information warfare, nodes as a management concept for interconnecting global and local views and actions, and coined the term “futuring” in 1973. Saturday Review named him among the most unusually gifted leaders of America for his pioneering work in Tropical Medicine (national Leprosy system while a Peace Corp Volunteer), Future-Oriented Education, and Participatory Decision Making Systems in 1974. He was instrumental in naming the first Space Shuttle the Enterprise and banning the first space weapon (FOBS) in SALT II.

Please feel free to ask anything you want about The Millennium Project, our forthcoming Global Futures Collective Intelligence System, or any topic you would like to learn more about. He will login to this account and answer your questions starting at 4pm EST.

If you enjoy this AMA and want to stay connected please also subscribe to our Twitter and Facebook pages, proof will be posted on both:

I graduated back in June with a film &amp; video degree, and I've been finishing up projects and searching for jobs ever since. Been using Mandy, entertainment careers, and craigslist, but all I've gotten almost no results.

He read slowly but with a poise that could be attributed to a flask in his jacket pocket, filled with single malt whiskey.

 

""Good night America""

 

As the credits rolled, Martin sat with a forced look of contention; the skyline of Washington D.C was pink on the green-screen behind him. The credits finished and Martin took a small drink of his whiskey and then fumbled his notes around until they were straight. Martin condemned speculation and opinion in the newsroom; he was a man of noble stature and he would often give long talks to interns about the truths of journalism:

 

""Possibility of tenure here at The Maverick will be based on character and willingness to subjugate any pre-conceived notion about anything and everything. You will replace opinion with fact. Only then will the possibility remain of any of you becoming journalists.""

 

He spoke with assurance, tugging on the skirts of his sports-coat each time his voice would raise in pitch.

 

Martin shifted his weight to the soles of his feet as he laid his black shoes to the floor of the broadcasting room. Standing with grace, he glanced around the room, making sure he could put a name to each face he saw. He wasn't the type to show fear, nor did he believe in it. Still, Martin was assigned a bodyguard to follow him until the threats subsided. It made him feel better knowing that these threats were widespread and not directed towards any single person. Every news agency from Tallahassee to Denver received them and now his station in Manhattan.

 

Martin joined his fingers together and raised them to his forehead, shooting his bodyguard, Landry, a quick salute and a smirk. Landry had served in the gulf war and used to be an amateur bodybuilder. Landry's bald head shone in the fluorescent lighting of the studio. He shot a quick nod to Martin. All the workers of the studio cheered and clapped when Martin would exit the broadcast room and entered the hectic newsroom. Tonight, however, they were less enthused. Martin made it a mission of his to shake each and every person's hand in the room. He'd always say that respect is what made The Maverick great.

 

Martin and Landry made their way out of the newsroom after mingling with the staff and congratulating them on a job well done. Stopping by his office to grab his coat, he noticed that there was unopened mail on his desk. Quickly, he grabbed the scattered letters and stuffed them in his suitcase.

 

""Let's roll, Landry.""

 

""Aye aye, sir.""

 

 In the last few weeks, Martin and Landry had become friends. Often they would talk about baseball. Martin was a Mets fan and naturally, Landry would tease him about it.

 

 

 

The two of them made their way down the stairs, and past two men putting up a plastic Christmas tree in the perch on the overpass above the lobby.

""Where's the Menorah, gentlemen?"" Martin jested.

 

""We were only told to put up this Christmas tree, Sir""

 

""How do you think the Jewish staff would feel about that?""

 

""Sir, it's nearly Twelve A.M. Where are we going to find a Menorah?""

Martin nodded his head and pursed his lips; the man's point was valid. Martin and Landry continued to walk down the festively decorated hallway. Before reaching the winding glass stairs, Martin turned around hollered at the Gentlemen, ironically quoting the Bible:

""Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds."" He held his arms out, extended on both sides, smiling and proud of his wit.

The men chuckled: ""You got it, boss""

 

It was rainy on the streets of Manhattan. Heavy black clouds rumbled, dipping down and touching the tops of buildings, making the air cold and the windows opaque. A limo was waiting for Martin and Landry. They hopped in, brushing still drops of water off their expensive suits and embracing the warm interior of the limo. The driver closed their door.

 

""What's the thread count?"" Martin said to Landry, jokingly raising his eyebrows and smirking.

 

""220""

 

""Ha! Landry you always know how to make me laugh""

 

Martin turned back to the driver: ""95 Worth Street""

 

""Yes sir.""

 

Martin had never seen the particular driver before.

 

Landry spoke: ""Not going out tonight, Boss?""

 

""No Landry I think I'll just stay in tonight. Radical Christians sending death threats to half the country's news outlets, another war in the Middle East, and the Mets lose to the Astros. These are tough times to be an American. Have we learned anything else about these scumbags sending out the letters?""

 

""Well, we haven't been able to recover a fingerprint and all we have to go with from the notes is that these guys are Christian fanatics who like scripture and dislike the media. They sent out a DvD last year condemning anything and everything about the media; they said the word of god is the only things people need and that the news is an abomination.""

 

""Something tells me I wouldn't want to take one of these guys' daughter's out on a date,"" Martin said, unfazed. They both laughed.

When they arrived to their destination, Martin got out and Landry followed him. As they made their way to the doors, they heard a voice.

 

""Hey! Mr. Burrow! Martin turned around to see the driver looking at him through a half cracked limousine window.

 

""You forgot something!""

 

The driver reached behind him and pulled something slowly from the back seat. Martin immediately tensed up, as did Landry.

 

""You left your suitcase!"" His voice was soft beneath the pounding rain.

Martin was alleviated:

""Why didn't you just say that the first time?! Landry, would you please go get my suitcase from M. Night Shamylan over there?""

""Sure boss.""

 

Walking into the lobby, Martin looked at Landry:

 

""You can go home now, bud. I'll see you tomorrow.""

 

""Aye Aye, sir.""

 

The two shook hands and went their separate ways. Martin smiled at the cute receptionist as he made his way to his loft.

 

Martin opened his door, poured himself a stiff drink, and flipped on the t.v. He turned the channel from CNN to Sportscenter and propped his feet up on his coffee table. Eventually, Martin dozed off and sometime between then and now made his way to his bedroom in a drunken haze. Martin slept easily; no dreams.

 

The next morning, Martin woke up feeling great. He made a strong pot of coffee and showered as it brewed. He only ordered exceptional coffee beans.

""Nothing can ruin your day like a bad cup of coffee,"" he'd always tell his co-workers.

 

Martin finished getting ready and then locked up. He stepped onto the elevator, smiling and appreciating the morning. His limo awaited him outside.

Martin made his way through the lobby and went outside to his limo. The same driver that had startled him the night before opened the door for him.

""Good morning, sir,"" the driver said.

 

""Hey! No more surprises, alright guy?"" Martin slapped him on the shoulder.

 

""Of course, sir""

 

""Just kidding, let's get this thing moving"" Martin hopped in the limo.

 

It was a clear day and people were out walking quickly down the streets of Manhattan, never enough numbers on their watches. Upon arriving to his studio, he noticed an incensed group of people with picket signs outside of it. The driver opened Martin's door slowly and with caution. The people were protesting an abortion clinic that was in the same building as Martin. Martin brushed it off and went inside, flashing the people his news credentials so they didn't become more enraged thinking he was a doctor.

 

Martin said hello to the blonde receptionist working in the lobby. She was the daughter of a friend who couldn't find a job once graduating from college.

Martin stopped to chat:

 

Hey Allison, how are you?""

 

Oh, Mr. Burrows! I'm fine! I just want to thank you again for getting me this job!""

 

""Not a problem, Allison. I'm glad to help; what was your major again?""

 

""English""

 

""Oh well I guess we can't all be mathematicians, right?""

 

She laughed without enthusiasm, changing the topic:

 

""They sure are mad, Mr. Burrows""

 

""Hmm? Oh yeah. much ado about nothing, right?""

 

""What?""

 

""Nevermind, Allison, did I get any mail?""

 

""Oh, yep, just this package.""

 

Allison handed Martin the package and he departed from the reception desk.

Martin said hello to the staff and entered his office, closing the door behind him. He whistled an old song as he reached for his pocket knife under the desk. He cut the tape on the package and was glad to find his coffee beans, vacuum sealed so they stay fresh. To his surprise, he also found a letter on top of the beans. Intrigued he opened the letter to find a short passage written in small, fine print; it was a bible verse that he recognized; Ezekiel 25:17:

 

""Martin Burrow, your filth and vile slander will not go unpunished. For the lord, God, is all righteous and all knowing.

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

You and those like you are bad men. You are filth indoctrinating the children of this nation into believing your fallacies. For detracting from God's glory, you will pay. Only God can judge you now.""


Martin laughed for a few seconds. He noticed the temperature in the room was rising. Suddenly, he felt a lump in his throat and noticed a strange smell emanating from the coffee beans. Then, he fainted.

Seconds later, Landry entered Martin's office and once seeing him and smelling the strange odor, yelled for the building to be evacuated.

A simple autopsy would reveal that Martin was exposed to a fatal dose of toxic agents that contained cyanide and arsenic. He was poisoned by the same domestic terror group that had been haunting the entire nation. However, he was the first and only victim.

 

If Martin were alive now he may wonder how a life devoted to objectiveness and fairness could be met with such resistance and hate. Now, however, Martin lays dead; a victim of generalizations and shoddy interpretation; a deviant, on the path of righteousness."
13epa9,16,2012-11-18,"Java Certification, good idea? ",Sillyace92,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/13epa9/java_certification_good_idea/,"I've been looking at this more and more lately to get my foot in the door for other opportunities. I'm currently a community college student majoring in Computer Science about to transfer to a university. I've been looking for some sort of internships or working positions that have any relation to programming but every time I find one it requires prior experience or that I have at least a bachelors already, which I don't have either. I just want to get involved in some way right now, or the very near future. So I have a few questions.

1) Is it a good idea to get certified or is it just a waste of money?

2) Which certification path do you think is good a good one to follow? Right now I'm thinking of getting a ""Professional"" cert

http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=458&amp;get_params=p_track_id:OCPJSE7

and then getting a Java EE cert.

3) A big problem is that before I can get a ""Professional"" cert I have to take the ""Associates"" cert first, according to them. And each cert is $300, so $600 just to get to the ""Professional"" level and I'm a college student with no money. I'm already familiar with all of the ""Associates"" and most of the ""Professionals"" subject matter, so is there a way to skip over the ""Associates"" and go straight to the ""Professional"" cert? 

That's about it, are there any other recommendations that you have that I should pursue instead? Oh and I'm in the Northern Virginia area too.

13ej7k,6,2012-11-18,My recent ex-girlfriend(23 F) thinks I (24 M) used her - I still care. How do I handle this?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13ej7k/my_recent_exgirlfriend23_f_thinks_i_24_m_used_her/,"Hello, /r/relationship_advice. This is my first time posting here, I don't know what to do. I'll start from the beginning. 
  10 months ago, I met ""A"". She was everything I wanted from a woman, and more. We grew fond of one another quite quickly and had a couple of awesome months. Unfortunately, I was at a standstill in both my career and education, and I had to make a decision. I went back to live in my home-town, three or four hours away from the city where A lives. We agreed to keep having a relationship, and we would both visit each other weekly. I was reluctant to yet another long-distance relationship but it all turned out well. After three months of staying in my home-town and trying to get a decent job and perhaps start taking classes at the local University, nothing worked out right. No job, no money for University, it all went to shit. A friend (""G"") stepped up and proposed I'll move back and I would stay at his place, and learn web programming with his help, and get all my shit together. 

""A"" received the news with great joy, and said she will support me as long as I need, and then when I get better pay, she'd leave her job as a waitress and I would support her until she finds a better job. The plan was awesome, but after I came back, we began to fight a lot. Having little money, I sometimes depended on her for food and an occasional beer when we went out. I felt like shit for the entire period, but I helped her too in any little way I could, making her feel comfortable and loved, getting passed all the tiny annoying small dramas she'd throw at me from time to time. Friends were admiring my patience, and thought I lost my dignity, accepting all the shit she would do. I told them she's a good person, I love her, and it's just the stress from her job and it will all be okay.

Fast forward 4 months and I get my first job, a two month internship at a nice IT Firm, doing what I prepared for since I arrived back. The pay was small, but enough to cover a bit of rent, so myself and ""A"" decided we should start thinking about moving together. We ended up finding a nice apartment, but could not afford it on our own. By coincidence, ""G"" had to move as well, so we all agreed we would move together. All was fine, but the fights started to increase in both frequency and intensity. She slowly transformed from what I thought as a balanced level-headed woman, in a sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. She was caring and loving but from time to time, she would burst out and become increasingly violent. We had a few major fights, but we were OK until two weeks ago. We had a huge fight, and she (very drunk) started throwing things and shouting at 2 A.M. in the morning while I was pleading her to lower her voice and calm down so we can talk. I got scared, but I thought it was just stress, and it's my fault, maybe I wasn't as supportive as I should have been. We made up and talked the second day and we would slowly come back to our bumpy, yet happy relationship. The end of my internship was coming, and with it, better pay, and a steady job.

We were so happy, and we avoided having many fights since the last one was so psychologically demanding. We were tired of fighting... The next couple of weeks were great, until Wednesday. We were supposed to go out with some friends, and I popped in at ""A""'s workplace, as she was about to end her shift and go meet our friends. I arrived a bit to early, and stood patiently as she would constantly ignore me. When I usually stopped by the bar where she works, I would have a great time and she would talk to me and bring me beer and cigarettes and constantly apologize for not being able to stay a bit more with me, so I was kind of sad about her strange behavior. When she had one hour left of her shift, she started drinking again. Shots and long-drinks - I don't judge her, it's hard work being a waitress. She then finished her shift and we were on our way. I was kind of sad, and she picked it up, so she asked me what was wrong. I told her I felt kinda shitty for her ignoring me all the time I was there and then she flipped out. She started calling me a loser that she supports both financially and morally, and began shouting hurtful things. I lost my temper and said she shouldn't be talking to me like that, I work too, I'm giving my best. I then proposed we would go and meet our friends an relax a bit, as planned. She was drunk again, from work. She came and embarrassed me in front of all our friends referring to me as a retard, a loser. I kept my cool and made some jokes so she wouldn't ruin the night for everyone. All this time, she kept drinking. I know it was going to get worse, so we all left to another place so she could dance and sweat the alcohol out, or maybe just get tired and would want to go home. She didn't. I proposed we left and she said she was going to stay with one of her friends and dance. I was tired and ashamed, so I put my tail between my legs and went home. She came home at about 2:30 AM, pissed and drunk as fuck. Started to make random loud noises and throwing shit about. ""G"" got scared and left home, so we could talk. I would beg of her to stop shouting and go to sleep. I told her she was drunk and she needed some rest, we both need to wake up early. We're going to talk this out. But she would have none of this. She went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and pointed it towards me, while shouting. I remained calm, quickly took the knife from her hand and threw it away. I covered her mouth with my hand and begged for her to stop this, and come to bed. She then started throwing pots and plates and forks towards me and making loud noises, disturbing the neighbors and fucking me up a bit. She then told me she needs to stay alone for a while, and smoke a cigarette. I left her staying in the kitchen, but I soon heard her crying. I quickly went in and saw her with a knife in her hand, cutting on her wrists. 

Fortunately, it was just a bad scratch. I panicked and took the knife away from her, took her in my arms and took her to bed. Tried to tell her to stop, it's not worth it. She kept telling me how I'm just a loser, I haven't done anything with my life, and hitting and screaming. I told her to calm down, so she went on and starting taking a bath. I just stood at the other side of the door, listening. She would then start talking, laughing like she was talking to someone. But her phone was not there, she was just talking to something? I knocked and entered because I was too scared to leave her alone. While she was lying there in the bathtub, she kept on screaming how I'm a loser and she doesn't need my help. She told me she already knows who her next boyfriend will be and that he'll be way better then me. I just stood there and listened, trying to keep my cool, and keep her quiet. She then grew tired. Still in the bathtub, she would fall asleep and slide in the water, but I would get her out and try to open her eyes, and she became conscious again. After two or three of these black-outs, she decided she's going to bed. I took her to bed and would go and check on her from time to time. This ended at about 4 - 4:30 AM. In the morning, she made coffee, and offered me some. I wouldn't have it. She came and embraced me and I said ""no"", and she left for work.

I was scared for her, and decided to break up. I can't have all this shit in my life. I respect and appreciate what she did for me, but I was too hurt by what she had said. So I talked to her the next day, and told her we can't be together anymore. I told her I'm too scared to do this and that I can't go through this again, and I think she can't, either. I told her she could stay here for as long as she likes, and quit her job, and I would pay for rent, food, and utilities while she would invest all her time in finding a job. I told her I would take care of her, because I care about her, but we just can't be a couple anymore. She would live alone in that room and I would sleep on a makeshift bed in the hallway or in ""G""'s room. She told me she was sorry and that she didn't meant what she said yesterday, but I couldn't get over it. She was talking like those were the things she would think about daily, and that she researched in having a new boyfriend, and thought of me as nothing but a parasite. I could try and get passed this, but the relationship would never be the same. I was scared, I think she has some mental issues, I urged her to just talk to a random friend about what happened between us and that she would feel a lot better. Maybe she would let her friends help her.

She said she will be moving with a friend of hers, and she can't let me help her in return, it's just not right. I insisted and still do that she at least let me pay her rent to where she moves, for a few months, but she says no. Friday she left to her home town and we haven't spoken until earlier today. She now calls me and tells me that she spoke about our situation with some friends of hers and her mother and they all say I used her until I got a decent job, and now I'm losing the ""dead-weight"". She says I'm a horrible person and she shouldn't have trusted me ever, because I broke up with her just as I got the promotion. How do I make her feel better and let me help her? I care about her, I want her to be OK. Maybe this is why I decided to break up. Obviously, I wasn't what she wanted, and made life worse for her. I just want her to be happy, what do I do? Am I a fucked up monster? I'm confused, help.


*EDIT:
Thanks for the replies, guys, you really came through. I feel much better, and stable. Will try and get help for her."

I graduated back in June with a film &amp; video degree, and I've been finishing up projects and searching for jobs ever since. Been using Mandy, entertainment careers, and craigslist, but all I've gotten almost no results. Part of me believes this is because I don't have any previous post production jobs, but I have a ton of independent projects including a feature documentary that's being released nationally in a few days. I know I have the experience and the ability to handle an entry level post production pa or assistant editor job, but I feel no one really wants to give me a shot without having the big names to attach to a resume.

Do you guys have any tips on how to make yourself standout, or where to look besides the same places that hundreds of others are also looking? Student loans are crippling me right now without any income, and I won't be able to afford an unpaid internship with the commute and loans ontop of that.
I'm starting to get extremely discouraged, and not sure where to head from here... Any help or tips you guys can give me would be super appreciated."

If anyone else has experience with TI/the area around, please let me know. They were pretty generous with their relocation budget, but they did recommend I'd need a car down there. Is that the case, or is public transportation alright? Any particularly good areas to check out living wise for a summer?

I'm afraid this could get quite long, but I'll try and keep it short! Annnnnd I failed.. Sorry!

**Background Information**
Me and my GF met and started dating when I was on an 6 month internship in a town 8 hours from my school. She went to school in this town and we met at a party and hit it off.

We dated all summer long, 4 months, with her living about an hour away during the summer, but it worked for us.  Then fall came and I had to head back to school 8 hours away, and thus starting the long distance. While at school I got the opportunity to go to California the next summer for another internship, and then followed up by getting the opportunity to study in Europe the following semester (Now).

To kind of put things in perspective, when we met I had just gotten out of a year long relationship where the girl had cheated on me, and she had had a really tough final year of school (her mom had cancer). So my point here is we met when we were both pretty desperate for a relationship, and I am actually her first real boyfriend.

She fell in love with me very quickly, and we were really happy, however I didn't feel quite as strongly at first, and in spring of the year at school I had tried to break up. I knew that I was going to California and then Europe the following semester, and it was going to be hard for both of us.. But, she really convinced me, and I really did have feelings for her, and we ended up staying together. I decided to myself I hadn't given her a real chance up to this point, and from then on out I was going to let her in.

Well over the summer I really fell for her. I flew back for the 4th of July for a week, and she flew out to California and we took a 7 day roadtrip back. (Talk about a relationship tester!). And at this point I had to head off to Norway.

**Current Situation**
We hadn't spent more than a month and a half without spending at least a weekend together up to this point, and being in Europe was the first time we wouldn't actually be with each other for the more than that time. About a month and a half in, I can tell she is getting really lonely, starting to miss me a ton, frequent crying conversations about how we wish we could just be together.  Top this off with I am starting to job hunt and don't know exactly where I will end up while she has another year of school.

Anyway, last week we had a talk, and she explained to me how this long distance is really really tough on her, and how she just needs a break from it all.  And so I try to clarify by asking ""so your breaking up with me?"" to which she would exclaim ""NOO"".  And we have a lot of plans for when I come back from Christmas break (involving me staying at her house with her parents), and she is telling me she desperately wants to keep these plans. And that she still loves me and cares about me, she just needs a break because she is so lonely..

Obviously this leaves me quite confused, and I don't know if we are broken up, or what is the term for on a break.. She insists she isn't seeing anyone else and she doesn't plan to, and I actually believe her.. Although she brings up quite a bit how I am her first boyfriend and she doesn't know how these feelings are supposed to feel and she is scared. But at the same time both her and her mom (they are really close) have been telling me that she has feelings for me and just needs time.

**Adivce?**
I'm just wondering what others think they would do in this situation. I really do love her, and I hate to see her in pain like this.  I feel like an asshole for going away for so long, but the decision was made so long ago, and I can't do anything about it now. We've been emailing back and forth since and I've really been explaining to her how I felt about her(which admittedly I didn't do a good enough job of before this happened)..

Anyway I'm going to end this, if you have any questions for advice just leave them I'll answer for the next few days..

So what would you do in this situation? Has anyone had a long distance thing like this work in college.. I'm just miserable right now and really don't have anywhere to turn, so here I am!

**TLDR: I'm in Europe and girlfriend wants a break, but insists she still loves me and still wants to see me when I get back and reevaluate our relationship then.**"

I(21) have been living with my bf (22) for 2.5 years. We have been in a relationship for almost 6 years and known each other for a couple more years. 

Immediately after I finished school, I moved in with him. Until then, I had only ever lived with at least one parent and 5-3 brothers; I have absolutely no clue how to live on my own :)

About a month ago, he moved 220 miles away for a really great internship (which is going to be over in April 2013) and I fully support him doing things that are important to him and for his career and stuff -but it just sucks! 
Apart from the fact that I feel hopelessly unable to cope with this rather big apartment, cooking and caring for our cats (I would never neglect them, but since he is gone, they are alone for at least 8 hours every day and I feel that they are soooooo bored), working 40 hours a week and studying for very important exams, I just miss him so damn much!

Since this is a rather stressful time for me (I will have to work and study even more until the end of January) I´m *sometimes* a little bitchy when I finally have some time off - and of course I can´t even control myself when he comes to visit every second weekend.

So, other than letting me vent, I wanted to use this post to ask for a little advice:


* How do you cope with mood swings during your visits? Is it best to try to swallow your bad mood or should I tell him right away?


* What is the best way to make the best out of a whole Saturday and a Sunday morning? I often feel like just staying at home and cuddling, watching a movie we have already seen so I can fall asleep at his side.... but shouldn´t we use the one evening we have to go on a date and do something fancy?


And last but not least, I want to thank you for reading. I realize that there are so many of you who make situations work, that are way more difficult than mine.
Thank You!

Over the past few months, I've been an intern with my City. I'm using Microsoft Access to create a database filled with useful information on our downtown area's commercial properties. I have quite a few fields in my main table. Several concern the property's characterostoc (parcel #, Address, legal description, suqare footage), several concern the property's purpose (uses, zoning, whether or not its vacant), several concern owner and leasing agent information (owner address, phone number, email address), and several concern tax information. 

Considering this isn't my only project, it's taken quite a while to come up with the appropriate fields, gather all this information, and organize it. 

The purpose of the database is for our Community Development Office to have all the information they need readily available if investors ask for it. For example, if someone wants to open up a restaurant, and needs at least 2000 Square Feet, somebody with the City can find the information in minutes and say, ""it looks like four properties fit your criteria, but only two are vacant, you can reach the owner here..."" Suggestions?

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just asking the internet to do my homework for me. I've gone through some online tutorials, but none of them have presented the information in a way I can understand and relate with this current project. 

tl;dr: I've organized a lot of property information in a MS Access database, but now I don't really know what to do/how to utilize/what are the Access' useful applications.

In a thread on r/techsupport, people have suggested I also, generally familiarize myself with Access.  Does anyone know of any good tutorials?"

I'm going to save you guys the sob story about the relationship and the break up; if you wish to read more into the history of the relationship (which gives some background to the current crisis), go ahead and read the posts that I submitted to r/relationships:

Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11yno7/22m_having_serious_issue_with_violent_girlfriend/

Second update:
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/124kev/update_2_22m_having_serious_issue_with_violent/


The situation currently is this. She has informed me that she is a month late on her period, and that there is a good chance that she's pregnant. I went over to her apartment last night to witness the pregnancy test being taken and view the results myself. The result was inconclusive. She used a clearblue test, which gives a + if pregnant and - if not pregnant. The result was |, which I have no idea what that means. Possibly a bad test? Error? 

Either way, after the test was taken, she beat the shit out of me. I did nothing to instigate this, and at no point did I lay a hand on her. I left promptly when she told me to ""get the fuck out"" of her apartment (which the utilities are still in my name, and the paperwork is not complete yet that finalized my name being off the lease).

I currently have several bleeding cuts all over my face, neck, ears, and chest. There are also more than 10 ""scratch marks"" that are also bleeding, and my roomate who interns at the police detective's office described as 'lacerations'. She also threatened to stab me. 

My primary concern at this point is the safety and well-being of my (possible) child that she could be carrying. For obvious reasons, I do not want my child to have any contact with this woman. If she is capable of doing this to a grown man, I do not want to imagine what she would do to a child.

I have medically documented evidence of the bite that she inflicted on my leg that resulted in the break up and me moving out. I have pictures of the rest of the cuts, bruises, scratches, etc. that she's left on me. My co-workers, friends, and family have seen them, and they know that she inflicted them. My co-workers will see this round of stuff today at work, and will know exactly what's going on. Also, I'm sure the neighbors in that apartment complex have heard some of this stuff. 

I have not filed a police report yet for a few reasons. The first being that I do not trust the legal system or police to be on my side. Although I've never laid a hand on her, it would be all to easy for her to lie and claim that I've done something like that. The second being that the advice that my roomate has given me says that the police department here will only go as far as putting a no-contact between us. I don't see any benefit of voluntarily putting a restraining order on myself, which would inevitably prevent me from witnessing/trying to prevent any behavior that she displays that would be harmful to a developing fetus. 

Please give me some advice here, because I honestly have no idea what to do.

The situation currently is this. She has informed me that she is a month late on her period, and that there is a good chance that she's pregnant. I went over to her apartment last night to witness the pregnancy test being taken and view the results myself. The result was inconclusive. She used a clearblue test, which gives a + if pregnant and - if not pregnant. The result was |, which I have no idea what that means. Possibly a bad test? Error? 

Either way, after the test was taken, she beat the shit out of me. I did nothing to instigate this, and at no point did I lay a hand on her. I left promptly when she told me to ""get the fuck out"" of her apartment (which the utilities are still in my name, and the paperwork is not complete yet that finalized my name being off the lease).

I currently have several bleeding cuts all over my face, neck, ears, and chest. There are also more than 10 ""scratch marks"" that are also bleeding, and my roomate who interns at the police detective's office described as 'lacerations'. She also threatened to stab me. 

My primary concern at this point is the safety and well-being of my (possible) child that she could be carrying. For obvious reasons, I do not want my child to have any contact with this woman. If she is capable of doing this to a grown man, I do not want to imagine what she would do to a child. She abuses prescription drugs(takes 200+mg of adderall daily for days at a time, then withdraws), smokes, and is clearly mentally unstable.

**Update**

She called me at about 6:30 this morning and told me that I needed to come over. She took the other pregnancy test in the pack that was digital (the clearblue pack that I bought had an old-school and a digital test). The digital test was conclusive. She is pregnant.

I would like to serve following graduation as an Information and Communications Technology volunteer. I read some comments in this subreddit about the ICT programs getting phased out in a lot of countries and I was wondering how much truth there is to that and how many ICT volunteers are currently serving and how likely it will be to find an ICT position in the future. I should also be qualified to serve as a secondary Math/Science teacher, but ICT is much more directly related to my passions and life career goals. I think I would make a great ICT candidate, if it matters: Eagle Scout, solid GPA, 4 yrs of HS Spanish and a semester of college Spanish, engineering internship experience and plenty of volunteer hours. I'm really flexible about where I serve and, ultimately, I would probably accept any program I get placed in... I just think I would put my skills to best use as an ICT and well, to sound a little selfish, it would be a better career stepping stone than secondary education."
13fuqk,1,2012-11-19,"I have a low level of anxiety about my health most days, and have had a few of panic attacks this year. However, for reasons I don't fully understand, I don't want to see a doctor about it. ",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/13fuqk/i_have_a_low_level_of_anxiety_about_my_health/,"I have what I assume to be hypochondriasis. I worry about my health all the time. I think I developed it because both of my parents were doctors. 

Every time I get a headache, a fast heartbeat, or a pain in my body, I start going through all of the possibilities of what it could be, and start getting worried about it. The thing is though, I also do actually have diagnosed disorders that can account for many of these symptoms. I have migraines which account for the headaches and other neurological symptoms, and I also have PSVT (google it) which accounts for the fast heart beat.

So I logically know that these are things I should not worry about, and so therefore don't go to a doctor about them. I chalk my problems up to anxiety about non-issues and that works most of the time.

Until recently...

A couple of weeks ago I had a panic attack in class. I'm in physical therapy school, and we invited some students from another program to come and have a sort of meet and greet. At first it was going well, then out of nowhere my heart starts racing, and my face is feeling numb. Normally I would just get a little anxious about this, but I am mid sentence talking to a total stranger. I start freaking out that they are going to notice something, which makes my heart race even harder. I try my best to keep talking casually, but on the inside I feel like an air-raid siren is going off. I felt trapped. Because I could not escape it just kept getting worse and worse. I thought I was about to fall over and have a seizure or something right in front of everyone (because how embarrassing would that be right?) 

As soon as the meet and greet is over I bail...fast. As soon as I get to the safety of my car, I begin to feel better. But ever since then I have begun to worry that this is going to happen again in an even worse situation like during an internship or some other professional situation, and I am going to fuck up my career because of it.

But even with that motivation, I am still afraid to go to the doctor for some reason. I ask myself why I have that fear, and it always feels like I am making up an excuse like ""You probably don't have anxiety. It's just your heart problem. They are going to tell you that, and tell you it's nothing to worry about. Then you will have just wasted your time and money."" or ""They'll just think you are there looking for drugs. You won't get any help, and they will tell you not to come back."" or even ""See how you feel tomorrow, and make an appointment then..."" [lather, rinse, repeat]

I know it's not rational, but that is how I think nonetheless. 

Can anyone relate, or offer advice?"

One of my first major projects is building a database of local office buildings (mostly high rises in the city) and building a spreadsheet including name of company, suite number, sq ft, price per sq ft, and rental lease expiration date.

I have physically gone to the buildings to get the name of each company and what suite they're in, and back at the office, have been calling or emailing to find out the info I need.

The problem I'm running into is twofold... A) the person answering the phone usually has absolutely no idea about square footage or when their lease ends, and B) if I can get them to transfer me to the proper person, I've been getting some resistance getting the info from them (understandable, as they have no incentive to answer those 3 questions).

Does anybody have ANY suggestions on how to get this info? I'm going to attempt to physically go from suite to suite instead of calling, but I still feel like I'm going to get shut down a bunch.

I just don't want to not be able to complete my first project as an intern, I don't want to give them an incomplete spreadsheet and excuses.

13fcpz,3,2012-11-18,Paula Broadwell,TheQuietMan,bestofthefray,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofthefray/comments/13fcpz/paula_broadwell/,"For the most part, you're mostly wrong about her.  Now the affair has been exposed, your disdain for her, and its sexist overtones are duly noted and not surprising, but nevertheless dismaying.

It starts of fairly simply here - let he who is innocent cast the first stone.  (No - I'm not the original author of the line...).  The numbers give me some degree of confidence in predicting those so willing to judge Ms. Broadwell haven't exactly been puritans.

http://surviveinfidelityhq.com/men-women-emotional-affairs/

Who knows if the survey is right. But the infidelity numbers are too big to justify your wagging fingers.  So - let's try to start with some simple premise here - around half, maybe more of the adult married population cheats on their spouse at some point in their lives.

That's a lot of wagging you're doing if you're being consistent, and if you're in the minority of non-cheaters.  This is an old argument, but it serves to set the context of putting you in your place.

Let's dig a little deeper.  A large percentage of married people are unfaithful.  Well you have to figure out that a large percentage of married people who don't cheat, couldn't find someone to cheat with.  These will include the physically ugly, really stupid, twisted personalities of the world.  Not saying they all can't cheat - just that its a lot harder for them.  Not surprisng that not everyone cheats.

Here's a thesis:  the hotter you are the more likely it is you will be unfaithful.  Just a guess.  The higher rank you have in business or life - the more likely it is you will be unfaithful.  The smarter you are - the more likely it is you will be unfaithful.

My reasoning is straightforward - generally, being smart, being successful, and being good looking are sexy traits.  Your opportunity will be greater.

General Petraeus has all three qualities.  I don't know that Ms. Broadwell was so unhappy in marriage that she was out looking for an affair.  But it doesn't surprise me that she quickly became sexually attracted to him.  What's there not to be sexually attracted to with his attributes?  

Successful?  Way successful.  Good looking?- yes, reasonably so - seems to be in good shape.  Smart? - very smart.  Add to this the seductive nature of being connected.  And he's very articulate.  He has a great way of making a point - he gets to the heart of the matter and shows great depth in analysis.  You want to be near him just to hear how he thinks.

I can see how someone would find that very sexually enticing.  Intoxicating.  And the opportunity would be greater as she had access to him - and had this access often when his wife - the main competition - wasn't around.

Don't play the old man/ young woman card - please.  It's just ridiculous.  There's 20 years difference between the two of them and there's nothing wrong with such an age difference.  Just cut it out.  If you were single, you wouldn't let it stop you - tell me otherwise and I still will choose to not believe you.  Two adults can do what they want.

Let's now also point out another main tenet:  All's fair in love and war.  The fact is, while perhaps literally untrue - you know there is a lot going for the point.  Angelina saw Jennifer as the competition.  She had nothing against Ms. Aniston, except that she was married to the guy she wanted.  As Nietzsche pointed out, the vulture has nothing against the sheep either - to the contrary, the vulture finds the sheep tasty.

Ms. Broadwell had nothing against Ms. Petraeus - she just wanted her man and at some point wanted him enough to act.  She wanted to win; get what she wanted.

It's not very surprising that General Petraeus was interested in Ms. Broadwell.  She's not only attractive - she's reasonably articulate, bright, and was likely making it plain she wanted him.  He wanted her back.

Because they are adults, they carried out their affair clearly not wanting to hurt their respective spouses.  There was no malice on their part.  Life is short.  When the opportunity for passion comes your way, you are going to consider it.  Hume said ""Reason is the slave of the passions"".   That implies many things, and fits well here.

I had thought he showed weakness in emailing Ms. Broadwell back and forth, and this is what exposed them.  Turns out, he's smarter than I was giving him credit for.  He was concerned about this possibility, and the two devised a strategy apparently also used by al Qaeda(!) to message back and forth, using one email account only and a filing system.  They actually didn't send emails to each other.  they just added to a file.  Clever.  

Ms. Broadwell likely made a terrible blunder in her correspondence with Ms. Kelley.  Relationships do come with risks - I'm not denying this.  Sad it has come to this though.

Please understand I'm not condoning their extramarital relationship.  But I'm not condemning it either.  I find some of the reactions here prudish and sexist.

For all its glory, Western Society remains composed of hypocrites.    He was too good to be true, you're telling me, implying you now see him as flawed.  (As if you've learned anything about him.)  She got past his age (and therefore looks) because she lusted to suck off a guy who had power.  You've got her pegged, and yeah, I'm sure your different.

Honestly, get over it.  If anyone crossed the line, it was Bill Clinton, because he had a duty to the intern that Petraeus didn't have with Broadhurst.

And sure, both violated their duties to their wives.  But given the number of apparent violators here, this particular duty simply isn't taken all that seriously, except when you feel like discussing something salacious.

Petraeus resigned by a Gentleman's Agreement - an unspoken covenant.  He has to do his time in the jail of your imagination, and you'll be wanting to keep his ""transgression"" in your back pocket for future use.  You, not he, make me sad."
13indx,38,2012-11-20,My Girlfriend says she doesn't like serious relationships after I moved across the country to be with her (F19) (M19),zer0small,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13indx/my_girlfriend_says_she_doesnt_like_serious/,"We met online in August of this year so it's been about 4 months going on 5 and things started moving very quickly. I was in a very vulnerable place because I have no friends where I lived and am extremely lonely all the time, so meeting someone that made me feel as good and loved as she did was overwhelming.

I went to visit her after a few months and it went better then I ever imagined it could. The day after I flew back home, I packed up all my stuff in my car and left the following day.

Flash forward to today, where I live near she does and she is currently enrolled in College. She doesn't like it and has dropped most of her classes. The only reason she hasn't dropped all of them is because there is an internship she is going to do for Disney in Florida, because she is a die hard Disney fan and it has always been her dream.

The main problem i'm having is that since this has been the first time living on my own and i'm away from everyone else I know, family friends, it poses some real big issues that I believe anyone would have to deal with in this situation. Whenever I come to her with problems or she can tell I am upset, she says she doesn't understand why people worry and she doesn't help me through it like the other person in a relationship should do. It really hurt when she did that at the beginning but now I tend to just not tell those things to her except when I really have to.

Since she is moving to Florida, the plan was for me to move there to so I can still see her sometimes. But after feeling like she never cares about any of my problems after I do everything I know to care for this girl, I just can't justify doing it in my head and am wondering if I should just move back home and go back to the way things were considering like I said in the title, she confessed to me she is afraid of commitment and that she doesn't like ""serious relationships"" and me moving to Florida with her would be just that. But she also says she wants me to go there with her.

I'm planning on talking to her today about us and about things but I am so confused on whether to fight for this girl or whether she just isn't right for me. Help?

TL;DR: Moved across the country after a short time knowing someone and now having problems with what we both want out of the relationship."

We had been dating for 2 years. I kind of initiated the ""break"" over the summer, as she was going back to school and I felt she didn't spend much time with me. She claimed her parents didn't like her coming to see me, as I live in a not so great area, and her mother is quite controlling. 

A week afterwards, my friend saw her out to dinner with a male. I called her up about it and she claimed that he was from her internship and that they were going to meet with others afterward, but that she left after because she felt bad. It hurt me that she did that but, I trusted her on it and moved on.

Over the next 2 weeks or so I reached out to her to see if something could be worked out, as I never liked the concept of a break and still did not. She then told me she has been having issues and was/is not happy. She has always had some insecurity, anxiety, and issues with her family. She told me that she needed time to herself and that she wanted a future with me, but couldn't handle the stress of a relationship while she tried to regain control of her life. The bottom line is she wanted time to herself and didn't want to see other guys and didn't want me to see other girls, but understood if I couldn't wait. I agreed because I really care for her and know I made some mistakes that added to her stress and understand to an extent, although wanted the chance to make things better.

For the past couple of months, we have been in communication sparingly. I saw her once and we had sex and everything was good for the weekend, until I left as nothing had changed. I talk to her maybe twice a week, sometimes it doesn't end well, and as time has gone on it has been getting worse. I just truly don't understand what we are doing anymore. I want to be with her, but she claims she needs more time. She says she still isn't happy. All other aspects of her life are the same, except I'm not in it. I see her in pictures going out with her friends and having a good time, so she clearly doesn't sit at home depressed or anything. 

She tells me she loves me, but I don't see how she can say she might need 6 months to regain control of her life and not see me if that is the case. All the time she tells me she understands if I can't wait. She would rather not ever be with me again than risk being with me and it going wrong, she says.

I am getting increasingly paranoid that she is just keeping me on the backburner, maybe until she graduates. If she makes me wait until she graduates, I would not trust her. I also don't think its fair that she is putting it on me in the sense that: She knows I still love her &amp; She tells me that she isn't doing well, but understands if I cant wait. It almost seems like she is trying to martyr herself. If it ends, it's because I can't wait, although right now I still want to be with her.

Am I an idiot if I continue waiting?"

We talked online pretty thoroughly for a month until we were both comfortable with each other, then met up IRL. We had a great time going on dates before deciding that we might make a good couple, so we became officially bf/gf and continued dating.

As our relationship continues (Started dating early October) I'm finding out more things about her that may have laid below the surface. I've just discovered that she suffers from anxiety when she's in relationships, and was a large factor when her last relationship ended. She is studying for her PHd in Psychology, on top of an internship and a volunteer job, impressive career-wise but is adding a large amount of stress to her life. The fact that this started as an Internet relationship is adding to my worries. She told me that she has found a therapist and is trying to work on her issues, which may include more than just anxiety, which is a blanket term from what I've read.

I'm trying to be a nice guy here, she's done a lot of nice things for me and I really appreciate it. However I am also cautious of this situation and what our relationship could become. Should I try and help her through the therapy or should I give her time to recover on her own? I know I also have to consider my own well being, and that putting myself in this scenario opens me up for hurt.

Something that I am also considering is that we are young and have barely started our relationship.

What should I do?


**TL;DR:** New girlfriend is entering therapy to work on problems that destroyed her last relationship. I am conflicted on being supportive and helping or giving her time to work on her own.

Just talked to my RA and he says I'll probably have to go through a drug test sometime soon. I'm assuming this will be 6 days from today, the earliest. 
**I had done drug test for my internship in Late Aug (3 months ago) and passed. From then on, I started smoking 2-3 times a week in Sept, Oct, and 4-5 times a week this month. Last time I smoked was two days ago**, which is when I got busted. Do you think I can pass the test if I try every possible tips out there?

Has anyone gotten drug test done after getting busted smoking on campus?

* it getting much colder outside so not wanting to/being able to go running (even if I had the time)

* feeling the consequences of these binging cycles and needing to take more time getting dressed to hide the issues, resulting in being late and having to drive instead of walking

* the worst part: being conscious of how messed up all of this is, and how I know I CAN do it well but just feeling like I'm getting sucked deeper into the hole every time

I'm sitting here looking at my stomach right now which I convinced myself was fine after the first time I binged - no big deal, get back on the horse, won't kill you in the long run. But it has turned into these 4-7 day on/off cycles of good eating/bad eating and I can absolutely see the consequences right now. 

How do I get out of this rut? I'm driving myself crazy knowing full well that what I'm doing is wrong and that I'm paying for it but the sleep/academic stuff is killing me."

I've just discovered this sub, so if the answer to my questions is well-known and obvious, please link me to that and go ahead and downvote.

I'm finishing up my BS in Computer Science at a well-known university, while doing an internship which is lined up to be a full-time job after this Spring.  While completing my degree, I've taken many courses and done research focused on medical image analysis and processing, including my job where I develop software for medical imaging and visualization.  During the course of said research and employment, I've worked with medical physicists as well as physicians and surgeons on an almost daily basis regarding their needs, and I've become interested in pursuing a career in medicine.

Before I was a student of Computer Science, I studied physics, so almost almost all of the premed prereqs have been taken: Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Gen Chem I and II, English I and II, plus many more math, physics, and CS courses which are not required.  

My question is, what would be the normal path for continuing studies into medical school?  The company I work for is well-known for helping employees obtain PhDs or higher education, but I don't know if this is a standard situation.  How should I go about finishing the medical prereqs ( Organic Chem, Bio )?

tldr; I'm passionate about medicine and will end up working in the medical field either way, but I'm considering changing the trajectory of my career and would like some advice on pursuing medical school.  Thanks!

I will be moving to the Shelton area for a 6 month internship.

I've been looking at apartments and all that stuff and I've noticed a trend of very little internet providers servicing the area. Those that I can find service are very slow around 3-5 mbps. Is this typical of the area or Connecticut in general? 

Any advice on finding good internet in the area? or on moving to the area in general?

I'm used to 50 mbps for around $80 in NY so this is shocking to me. Also I predict not having many friend for 6 months so I'm in need of a good internet for entertainment. "

how do you code things for project deadlines that are enormous projects
without understanding most of the tools
and are also crazy about making sure your program is structured perfectly and is perfect to the set of specifications defined by the language
which means i need to understand the language completely which i don't

how do i do that

everyone says iteratively but i get overwhelmed
howwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

why am i doing work on thanksgiving
because there is nothing else to do
i should spend time with my family

so, this is my first job, it is an 8 week project. i am in an intern. i just got kicked out of a phd program for 'falling in love' with my phd advisor. i also somehow became crazy about the security of my code as a result from studying his work so much. 

the project is an enormous project. i don't think my manager or boss understands how big, because the only developer other than me is a guy in india who doesn't comment his code and even his code isn't working. i complained about how we need to use svn so we can make sure our code is integrated but now all i do is have a headache from trying to read someone else's code that doesn't work and trying to debug why.  i have experience with eclipse but it is minimal so i find myself having a bigger headache navigating around eclipse than i do using the servlet.

also, my project manager was hired after me. that means i usually know most of what she is trying to say when she sends me new things because i studied most of the material she is looking at. it doesn't take me that long to review anything new she sends me. all she does really is tell me to relax and all that does is make me freak out that they are going to get a new developer when this is done because i have a tendency to take things very critically. it also interrupts greatly my work flow, so the only way i feel i can get work done is by doing it at home. but then i get distracted by doing it at home by focusing on all my 'issues'. and i am tired. i am tired i get no sleep i get barely any sleep because i have so much anxiety. 

i feel like i am doing everyone else's job and all i want to do is code. i help the girl next to me at work with her UI stuff sometimes. i ramble to both of the girls about code stuff that one of the girls seems really interested in but has issues with thinking she is bad at math probably because no one ever tried to teach it to her. i also listen and bitch to and my boss won't listen to me about anything. most of what i actually do, is record myself in video and play it back so i can figure out where i am making mistakes with my thinking.

i am just complaining. i know i should be happy i have a job. but my boss said from the onset, we will pay you intern salary. then he says 'we will bump you up in pay later'. then he says, 'make sure you document stuff for when we have new people come in'. so all that tells me is that he doesn't plan on keeping me as a developer for longer than this project and then he's just going to hire a new intern. so then i get worried about that, but right now i am trying not to concern myself with that. 

is there any hope for me to continue in CS? i got a master's degree in computer science, not copy paste other people's code programming. i feel very under-challenged when everything i say about the real CS stuff is brushed off to ask some other people and all i am told to do is code in a way i have very little experience coding - step by step on large scale projects. which i do have some experience with, i am starting to recognize this problem as an analogous problem to one i did maybe 4 years ago in a data structures class but then i have issues with the IDE because all i did was program in VI and compiler on linux and i have serious issues with GUIs (i also paint and draw so my set of aesthetics is very specific and if something is hard to find in a GUI i am instantly pissed off). so then i complain about not having linux on my computer but then when they say okay, put linux on, then i don't feel like doing it because that overwhelms me about breaking my work computer. i talk to my computers. i literally talk to them. like i say ""why are you doing this computer that is very mean of you to do"". ""why won't you work computer, you are very mean"" ""good computer! you compiled"" ""yay computer! right output!""

my job seriously just feels like copy paste to me because i don't have the time to understand how most of it works (which is awesome because that means it will break later), it is literally just me searching on google for the right library and pasting it in in the right configuration on a servlet. which is still coding to a degree but it doesn't feel like it because i didn't get to write it myself. and i don't know either if it's the best way to do it.

i really seriously just want to go back to college in academia because it was coddling, but i barely have the time to write out something about me and also look through all the colleges i might want to go to. i am horribly overwhelmed, does it ever stop? does it get better? 

and i also have no self confidence because for the last class i took that i actually liked, i did look the answers up to most of the problems. because i skipped into a class and lied about knowing functional programming so i wouldn't hold other people back. all starting working on a phd and not getting it, made me do, is question everything i know and everything i ever did. 

i feel completely paralyzed at getting anything done, always. i never have confidence in myself to do anything. but i have this long list of 'achievements' and 'grades'. do they mean anything at all? it means i have to trust other people that they graded me right. but i know i cheated sometimes. i know other people did too. i know i at least tried to understand as best as i could at the time though. i worked with other people when they said not to. i looked at examples in other texts to try to understand what i had to do. i feel like i don't deserve my degree. 

timelines in school are bullshit. seriously. i love learning, basically all i do lately is spend my time on wikipedia, read books, try to find people to talk to about math and other cs related things, but all having to do something by a certain time does is make me procrastinate on enjoying doing it because i just keep thinking it won't be perfect enough (i like to do my coding thinking first, then program). i know it's supposed to prepare me for the real world.  i hate the real world. it is scary and i am having a very difficult time managing all the stress. that means i need to go to therapy. 

ok, how the fuck am i supposed to go to therapy when i don't have the time to work my schedule around and i don't have health insurance. i am on fucking charity care because i am an intern. so i go to a special place that takes it, and then i had to cancel my appointment because of the hurricane. and then i feel bad because there are people without homes and their things are destroyed so why should i be dwelling over myself. i have it good comparatively. except i don't, because my father has to go for a biopsy soon. and my mother acts like she hates me. i keep trying every single way i can to deal with her. tell her i love her. tell her i don't want her money (even though my teeth are literally falling out of my mouth because i had an eating disorder for 10 or so years, and they give me a lot of pain eating now - irony right). my mom can't see past the point that all she is doing is literally hurting me because when she looks at me, she sees a big college loan debt. i even offered to co-sign my loans for my sister (can i do that with debt myself?) so she doesn't have to go through the same bullshit as i do.

but my father is great person, but he is very unhealthy and all that does is make me worry i am going to not have him in my life for much longer. but he actually changes when i say, i don't like when you yell at me. he has gotten better. my brothers are amazingly smart - and my younger brother is awesome - he is way smarter than me. i try to teach them things like, finding the optimal solution in a game of uno, and they teach me what they are learning in math class (which is really crazy because it's basically using set theory to teach algebra). 

i am trying really hard to look at the positives in life but i just keep feeling so overwhelmed by it all and i have no one to vent to. so here reddit. VENTING VENTING VENTING

it is thanksgiving. i am going to spend time with my family. i have them for right now. if you have anyone in your life to talk to, get off reddit. call someone you don't talk to anymore but would like to. i spent too much of my life disconnected from most of society and it made me almost very crazy. it just makes me a mean person, or a person that other people can't understand, or a person that just isn't very considerate of other people. 

i don't know. that's my experience. vent vent vent. 

why do i want to be perfect, i never will be perfect, stop trying to be perfect, me! i probably would be fine with my programming project if my developer partner did not work in india and the only time i get to talk to him is a 2 hour window during my work time. i tried asking my project manager about this, i will very happily switch my sleep schedule around because i work better isolated and in the evenings when everyone is sleeping (noises distract me horribly - adhd i guess, i can't tune them out). but my boss says 'we have a different philosophy here'.

also studying security made me completely paranoid about anything i post on the internet. but i don't care who reads this and knows it is me. this is me. i am neurotic. i have tons of anxiety and stress and i know i should just not give a fuck but how can i not give a fuck when i feel like my entire family is depending on me to do a good job. i have to be a good role model for my brothers. i have to make money so my father can get out of debt. i want to help my sister be able to get through school and not put up with the same craziness from my mother that i have because i had to cosign loans with her and i can't spend the time researching what is the better way to take her off of my loans. which is also probably more expensive for me to do, is it? i don't know. i don't know where to look about these things. 

why is life so fucking hard. because i'm poor. that's why. it's always freaking out about nothing working out correctly even though it always manages to. i'm still alive. that is something to be happy about. but this amount of stress is just, it makes me want to curl up into a little ball and just cry and cry and cry. and it doesn't help. i am tired of trying to be strong for everyone else, i am so tired of all of this. i want a vacation. i want to just go somewhere and not be stressed out. the best i can do is just drink wine at night so i can get to sleep. 

this all just feels like my fault. it is. everything i do i do it to me and it affects only me and i have to believe that. i learn too much about other stuff and it confuses the fuck out of me about how reality works, i worry about whether the universe is deterministic or non deterministic and the kind of implications that has for every choice i make. i get too metaphysical on things.

it is not anyone else's fault, because i made all of these choices myself. did i? i don't know. sometimes i just react to shit. who am i. i don't know. my ex's mother said i have no sense of self. i don't. i just base my personality off of other people. and i just worry about them. i finally am starting to try to worry about myself but i am trying to do too much. but what else can i do. seriously. this is life. i feel like i grew up the wrong way. 

i just want to feel like i am doing something right for once. "

This semester of school I am on an internship and on my off time I've been practicing a lot of programming. (I'm focusing mainly on Python,MATLAB, and C++, moreso on MATLAB since that's what my internship place requires me to use)  

Anyway I've been getting really into making models/simulations (well I supposed that's a grandiose term for what I've been doing :P) of physical problems. I talked to my current Boss/supervisor about my new ""passion"" and he suggested apart from understanding the physics involved and learning programming from a textbook, I should look at other peoples code. He says that gives me more insight and perspective on different approaches. Makes sense.

So r/Physics, any advice on how I can become better at computational physics? Also any good recommended place to look at already done physics modelling/simulations like my boss suggested ? (either in MATLAB,Python, or C++) 
Heck, if any of you have any Physics models/project/simulations from when you were still school(or are currently in school!) I'd love to see that as well if it's not a prob!

Anyway, thanks for reading all that! Hope to hear from you soon! :)

I am a 23 year old music student who graduated with 3 undergrad degrees. This summer, I had to to work a bunch of internships to fulfill the work requirements for my music business degree. Since May, until the end of October, I was working unpaid internships for that degree.

In that time, I've been looking for a job in any industry where I had experience. I've been gigging as a musician in NYC, but that doesn't pay all of my bills. I've looked into everything from dream jobs right down to food/beverage and retail. I told myself that by November, I should have a job with my experience, education, and personality.

Fast forward to this week. Literally on my last dollars, I FINALLY found a job. (After over 800 applications) TODAY. 2 actually, maybe a third. I have to decide which one is the best fit. (one's a barback, the other is working at a bagel shop.) I have to go in Friday for training at BOTH and then I should be working come this weekend.

The problem is, it took so long to find a job that my savings have been burnt through. I have enough food for a few weeks and most of my bills are paid. The main issue is affording my metrocard to get to work. I'll be making my own lunches to save money. After I pay my electric bill (due tomorrow), I will have $14. If all goes well, the soonest I will see a check is the Friday after NEXT (so on December 7th).

I'm asking r/assistance for any help with being able to afford transportation to my newly acquired job(s). I estimate that I would need around $100 for the 2 weeks of transportation, with a little extra just in case I get a music gig.

I will definitely pay everyone back (with interest, if required) as soon as I can. I will continue updating this thread, or through PM with anyone who has offered to help me.

Thank you to anyone who has read this.

TLDR: finally got a job when I actually ran out of money. Need $100 to be able to get work until the first paycheck comes in."

London, 19 November 2012, BP, en av Storbritannias ledende graduate rekrutterere, kunngjorde i dag lanseringen av en ny Stipendprogram for talentfulle vitenskap, teknologi, ingeniørfag og matematikk (STEM) studenter studerer ved ni valgte universiteter over hele Storbritannia.
I sitt første år, Stipendprogram for £ 450 000 BP vil gi 90 stipender, hver verdt £5000, og vil være åpen for ni universiteter for å støtte ti forskere. Som programmet er rullet ut de første fire årene, vil det være utvidet fra år til år, å gi en totalt scholarship fund av opp til £4 .5million. Fondet vil deretter fremgang som en årlig stipendprogram å gi finansiering av opp til £1 selv hvert år.
Universiteter som er valgt til å delta er: Durham University, Imperial College London, University of Bath, University of Birmingham, University of Cambridge, Universitetet i Manchester, University of Nottingham, Universitetet i Oxford, og University of Strathclyde.
Rettet mot å bygge kapasitet i ferdigheter og kunnskap som er sterkt behov i energibransjen, fokuserer stipend programmet på å støtte utdanning og utvikling av neste generasjon av ingeniører og forskere. Lavere grads studenter kan søke om stipend basert på ferdigstillelse av et elektronisk søknadsskjema, evne til test og et ansikt til ansikt intervju med BP.
Emma Judge, leder av graduate ressurser, BP, kommenterte; ""STEM nyutdannede problemløsning og rask tenkning evner hjelpe stasjonen innovasjon og utvikling i virksomheten.

Dommer lagt; ""Vi håper stipend fondet vil lette studentenes bekymringer om finansiering deres videreutdanning i dagens økonomiske klima, og stimulere til mer av den klareste og beste hodene å fortsette å studere stilk fag.""
Professor Colin Bailey, administrerende direktør og dekan ved Fakultet for Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences ved Universitetet i Manchester sa; ""Vi er glade for å er blitt valgt for BP stipendprogram. Det vil gi våre studenter mulighet til å realisere sitt fulle potensial og mer økonomisk støtte vil gjøre dem til å konsentrere sine studier. Engasjement med studenter i sine tidlige år kan virkelig gjøre en forskjell og bidra til å gi dem et klarere bilde av bedriftens landskapet, så det er flott å se et selskap som BP arbeider med akademia på denne måten.""
Som en del av sin pågående forpliktelse til å støtte utdanning i Storbritannia og i utlandet, er dette det femte året BP har vært å tilby stipender til høy ytelse studenter. Hundrevis av studenter har benefitted fra programmet til melodi av £7 .3million siden 2007.

My ex Alex broke up with me, because he got an internship at a church and they found out I wasn't Christian and told him to break up with me. To make matters worse, he was my first time. The break up destroyed me. I was losing not only the guy I lost my virginity to, but also a guy that made me happier then anyone else had. Anyway, we (mainly me) decided we should still be friends. I really wanted to, because I had a small hope we might get back together and I was terrified of losing him completely.

Well, the break up was about 4 months ago, and I've been trying to move on. The only issue is after I go on a date with a guy, I keep thinking about Alex. Or I'll end up seeing Alex and hanging out with him. The worst part is that every time I see Alex, he kisses me, or let's me hold his hand, and it makes me miss him terribly. No matter what I do, I can't seem to get over him... And I'm not sure if it's just because he was my first time or if it's because I miss him.

This is putting a serious strain on me getting over him, or finding someone new. I know there is next to no chance of me and Alex getting back together, but I still can't get him out of my head. I just don't know what to do....

Also, I know most people are probably thinking, just STOP seeing him altogether. And I actually have tried that to no avail.

Please. Help me?

---

We started seeing each other 5 months ago near the end of college. So we only really got to be with each other all the time for about 3-4 weeks before she moved 3 hours away and I finished my one final year. 

Shes a graduate then.  She lives at home now and works a in retail. She hates it. Both work and home. She was sexually abused by her older brother when she was very young and he is a constant reminder to her of that. **She has never spoken to anyone about it.** Also was harassed by an old teacher who she eventually got sacked from his job. Shes had a number of shitty exes and one one-night stand which she now hates herself for. I think her past experiences have shaped her into who she is - she feels very strongly against promiscuity and generally sleeping around and porn and vulgarity and parents letting their kids go wild. And doesnt think much of herself. :(

Shes in the process of applying for intern-ships with companies but its getting her down because she wasted her uni days with this shitty ex and has no experience to show for it so nobody is replying to her applications. She hardly has any days off as a result of the work she is doing to pay off her edu debt and flights to see her ex when they were together (he spent a year in San Fran where he told everyone he was single and fucked another girl). 

I'm focusing hard on my studies and work at the bar. But I have much more time off and am willing to miss classes to see her. When are together it is awesome. But when she leaves, she says she feels dreadful. So she broke up with me. I dont get that. I look ahead to the future to the holidays or when I finally graduate when we can finally be together because I feel like she is the one, even though she has her issues, I love her for who she is. I bake and post her gluten free cakes and breads (shes celiac) and encourage her to paint and write and speak her mind. She said she never felt accepted as she did with me based on this one time where she was staying over but I had already arranged to meet a friend and I said it would be great if she could come along (her ex would tell her to stay at home and would never allow her to mix with his social life)

Problem is, when we got together, she was breaking up with this asshole ex (3 years of cheating and lying; she has trust issues as a result) and i was fresh out from a 3 year relationship too. She did all the initiating because I thought I was waaay out of her league (she is beautiful - I always thought she looked like Olivia Wilde, but this girl is much cuter) So* she* told me she liked me, she *says* she initiated our first kiss that we had in the bar. (she quotes 'the guy should do 90 percent of the work and give you the last 10 percent of space to seal the deal.) When I finally told her I loved her, *she* had to get it out of me (we were watching the sunset in a park, I made sure to make it really obvious that I had something on my mind because I had an inkling she did too, I WANTED her to bug me, which she did and I said it). She says she wished I had done all these things of my own accord. But I always feel very insecure because I've only had one serious relationship and I've only just noticed attention from the opposite sex. I didnt want to fuck things up by rushing it. I had to be 100% certain that she wouldn't freak out. Also I felt like she was keeping me at arms length, like she never let me in. And although I was getting all these obvious signals from her, I'd always see her with asshole ex so I was confused. I didnt want to be her rebound. 
---

This has happened before but In person - she said she didnt want to be putting me down constantly with her mood swings - she has depression, and having to leave all the time.  But I'm willing to deal with it. After I got emotional, I think she realised how much I cared and we both cried and it was fine. 

Obviously in hindsight I wish I had done all these things (the first kiss etc) now but I dont think that warrants her breaking up with me because its 'too hard' when were apart even though its utterly amazing *in* bed **and** out when were together. She has made me feel much more secure about myself and in turn, Im trying to do the same to her. She made me realise that I wont get if I dont ask and am not honest about what I want. (it took a while for us to get in bed because I was afraid of asking her because ive never really done it before (beta as fuck I know). But that's all changed. 

She also seems to be ignoring the above arguments and keeps going back in circles to the same shit. I just want an objective opinion boys and girls &lt;3

I love this girl. Help. 
--- 


**TL:DR:  Girl gave me lots of obvious signals before we finally got together, I thought she was just being 'nice' because she was beautiful and I thought she was waaay out of my league. She initiated first kiss, had to get me to say to her that I loved her (not as bad as you may think, read above.) After 5 moths shes breaking up with me for these reasons and because she 'cant deal with the distance'....But I can....How can I convince her that were jumping the gun?**"

-Scholarships for project completion and tuition reimbursement

-Networking opportunities with other businesses in case said businesses want to hire our volunteers from us.

What we are doing:

-Partnering with other small businesses to answer their tech needs at a lower cost and benefits that come along with working with a non-profit.

-Partnering with larger businesses in workforce development and R&amp;D Programs for grants and funding.

-Giving students a place where they can get real-world job experience because employers are too afraid or undervalue good people.

What does everybody think? We basically got tired of seeing good people get turned down and coming out of college without getting employed with a mountain of debt....Do you think something like this would work or fail?"

You'll show me around Seattle, maybe take me to the touristy things, maybe find a place where I can drink without getting carded. That last bit ain't necessary. I hate not being 21 :(. We'll pay for our own shiet, definitely. People paying for me makes me anxious.

A lil bit about myself:

 I'm a CS major. HOWEVER, I'm not a ~girl gamer~, despite what me being a cs major would have you believe. I've posted here once before and I disappointed a lot of folks when they falsely assumed that. I am pretty ""feminine"" and a ""girly girl"" in how I present myself. I'm smart, ambitious, and very goal-oriented.

Things I like: live music, watchin a buttload of movies, HGTV, puppies n kitties, Dexter, True Blood, Game of Thrones, LOTR (SO 'CITED FOR THE HOBBIT OH GAWD), programmin, makin $$, and spendin $$.

Don't respond on this post! PM me! 

If we like each other and I get the internship, I'll be back in Seattle in the summer so we'll keep in touch."

I've been having a tough last few months. I'm a nineteen year old originally a New Zealander but have been living in the states for the last four years (nearly). I graduated from High School and also did a year of university in Computer Science. I worked for my father's company over summer and then went back to school after that. Two weeks in I decide I'm done with this major, pack up and move to Australia to live with my sister.

My intention was to find a job and make some money to go travelling or something to get me out of this rut. I've never had a job before my father's internship and so I didn't really know exactly how to find work so I didn't. I bummed around at my sister's apartment playing video games practically all day. I felt like shit because I relied on her so much. After two months I finally gave up again and moved back to New Zealand to be with my mother. Here I am. My second week of being in New Zealand and I have talked to ONE friend. Not because I don't have ""friends"", but because I fucking hate everyone.  I'm meant to be here to find work, or to find something to study. I've thought about the air force, becoming a policeman, forestry courses, forestry apprenticeships, going back to school for computer science, working another summer with my father, going to school for something different etc. But everytime I come close to making a decision, I talk myself out of it and realize how dumb I was in the first place for thinking I could do that.

I don't know what to do with my life. I think about how easy it would be just to end my life. There wouldn't be any struggles or confusion but I don't think I could do that to my mother and my sister. How do I figure out what to do with this life?"

In the meantime I thought I'd ask some questions.

1. How are the EE and CS departments at CWRU? I am most likely going to major in Electrical Engineering, but I also want programming experience. How feasible is it to double major with Computer Science?

2. In addition to loving technology, I am also a huge band geek (trumpet player!). Do any of you participate in music ensembles at Case? Also, has anyone here applied for/received the music scholarship?

3. In order to realistically be able to consider Case, I need quite a bit of scholarship money. I am not a minority or likely to receive much need-based aid, but I do have a 34 ACT (with 36 math), 4.5 weighted GPA, and many extracurriculars. How much aid should I expect to get, and what other scholarships due you recommend I apply for?

4. Co-ops and internships are something that really interest me. How is CWRU's co-op program, and where do EE/CS students typically co-op?

5. Lastly, what is your favorite thing about Case that you didn't expect to like?

I realize I just asked a lot, I would appreciate it if you could answer what you can. Thank you, and I may see you guys starting fall 2013!

EDIT: I have officially been accepted to this school and received a $25500 University Scholarship! This still leaves the school out of my price range, but I am applying to a few more CWRU scholarships so hopefully I will get one or two of those. I will certainly make another visit to this school, and keep everyone's comments in mind when making my final decision!"

Just had a date with a legit 27-y/o. She has her own house, car, an MBA and a good job. Me, I'm 21, student on an internship, and according to her I look ""like a high school kid"" lol. I'm not gonna lie, I shaved too close to this date. But I stayed pretty cool regardless, just sorta laughed it off, telling her how she looked younger than me. 

Anyways we had a pretty decent coffee date for an hour or so while she was on lunch break, got to know each other and have a few laughs. But she made it pretty clear several times that I was too young, we should just be friends, and her parents were pressuring her to marry and have child (!). That sorta stuff. Again, I just stayed with the program: ""cool, ok, yeah so [next topic][or poke fun at last statement]"". Overall we got along quite well. 

Walked her back to her car, and she said that we can be friends, if she and her friends are going out sometime I can go out with them. Ok sure. But it's at this point where I'm just kinda like (to myself) ""ok I don't see how I can escalate"". Handshake, goodbye, date over. 

On the positive side, I made an interested new attractive friend that hopefully has more female friends to which she can introduce me. And frankly I think I left a pretty strong impression for someone my ""age"". 

Why I come to seddit, is asking for your take on the matter and knowing if there is anything more/different I could do for these situations. I like older ladies man. And for the next little while I'll likely be seeing more of them since I'm not in a college town, and my transportation options are limited.

I'm finishing my 4th year of university as an Environmental Sci BS (bull shit) major. It's all right. Nothing special. I don't really care about the major that much, and I definitely do not care about it as much as others in my major. I chose it because it looked easier than the other majors. So retarded. I have no idea what I'm going to do after graduation. I'm too late for grad school since I haven't taken the GRE and plus I wouldn't even know what I would study. I don't really have anything else going on, so I guess this will be my career path. I don't think I have the courage to just go and pursue an entirely different path all the way from the beginning again. I want to start making some decent amount of money for myself. How do I just get through this? I wish I didn't choose this major or this university and really just thought hard when I was younger about what I wanted to do in the future, but even if could go back in time, I still really wouldn't know. My internship is just a bunch of grunt work. My gpa is like 3.1 and my parents keep saying that I have to get at least a 3.5. It's too late for that now. I didn't tell my pestering parents about it, because if I did then they would constantly give me shit for that. Instead I stupidly told them I'll tell you at graduation. It's gonna be such a major let down. Ohhh mannnnnnn this sucks. FUCK! I want to make some money (ideally around 60k right now. I dunno is that even realistic probably not.), not have a lame assjob that makes me work beyond work hours like my lameass internship doing some lameass stuff. Man I feel so lame. And now I have to get back to my internship work because I procrastinated all week. Has anyone been in a situation like this? I really need some advice. How do I deal with the future? "
13r4o3,2,2012-11-25,"Fuck I love my life (no sarcasm) aka a late ""what I am thankful for"" post.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/13r4o3/fuck_i_love_my_life_no_sarcasm_aka_a_late_what_i/,"These past few months have been so amazing it's surreal. I feel like I am going to wake up from this dream any second now.

To start, I thought this semester would really suck. Hardest year of my major (architecture), living with my parent for the first time in college and had recently broken up with my girlfriend. 

How wrong I was. 

First, thanks to the toughness of this year it helped me make such a great friend in my studio (a redditor who actually showed me this cool subreddit) We have become such good friends it's crazy. People ask how many years we have been friends because we click so well. Thanks to him I have tried so many cool things (sorority parties, raves, bar hopping etc.) I attribute 50% of the awesomeness of these past few months to him. 

Second, I decided to try to really change who I was after my ex and I broke up. I insecure and needy toward the end of the relationship and quite frankly I'm ashamed. So I have been majorly going out of my comfort zone by going to all these crazy greek parties with my friend. For example I went to a sorority party as a chipendale dancer (black pants, no shirt and a bowtie) and holy shit that night was such an ego boost. I have a nice body but never show it. That night these fine ass girls were slapping my ass and wanting to get pictures with me (more than a dozen girls) even made out with a hot random chick (something I have never done before) I have so much more confidence now as a result of that night alone.

Third, I became the sexual conquest of this cute asian (who I sort of have a thing for) girl. After going to a friend's party she texted him that ""it is her goal to bed me this semester."" Nothing like this has ever happened to me. So we started talking and boom we now have an amazing fwb set up going for a few weeks now (she recently broke up with her bf as well). She thinks I'm a sex god. (I think I'm ok) and it's awesome because she has no reason to lie since we're just casual. 

Fourth, I randomly got offered a scholarship that pays for all of my tuition for the rest of my years in college. I still can't believe this happened. I even get extra each month that's excess for whatever I want (using it to save for studying abroad and help out my mom since she helped pay at first). 

Fifth, my professor has now hired me part time with his firm and I will be getting to help design a house this winter with him. I am so excited about this. I am so lucky to be getting experience like this while still in school. And he is such a great guy to work with. The work environment is so awesome. We drink beer most workdays. It's so laid back. He also has connections with a firm that offers a paid internship in Spain for the summer and is trying to get that for me next summer. God I would die of joy if this really happens.

Finally, I have really changed as a person. I am so much more outgoing and confident now. Not a douche though haha. I'm more mature about relationships as well. For the first time in my life I am happy to be single (romantically anyway). 

And what surprised me a ton was when I found out my ex is dating something new. I knew it would happen and was expecting to be jealous, envious, etc (since when we broke up I was still so crazy about her but it seemed like she had mentally exited the relationship before we officially ended things) But the weirdest thing happened. I was happy for her. A bit sad we're definitely over now though. She has a tough life and I just want the best for her. I feel like my maturity has greatly risen by this reaction alone. 

Fuck I am just so happy with how things are going in my life right now. Because my life has not ever been this good. (Dad committed suicide when I was 14, have had depression for years, had always been so unconfident as a result) and now finally things are looking great.

Still don't know what I did to deserve any of this but I am so thankful.

Sorry if this comes off as bragging but I can't tell my friends this because I'd feel terrible as they don't have nearly as many good things going for them. But I just needed to say this out loud I suppose.

13r3ol,13,2012-11-25,I moved to LA and I'm looking for guidance and/or advice,magkipz,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/13r3ol/i_moved_to_la_and_im_looking_for_guidance_andor/,"I've been here in this beautiful city since September (a little over 2 months now).  I come from Ohio University, a place with a nice video program and a lot of OU kids move out here after graduation.

I have internships at two different production companies that keep me busy during the day and occasionally get me onto set as a production PA but there has been no pay yet.  UGH.  I check craigslist/mandy/entertainmentcareers.net constantly.  Nobody emails back.

I've been making connections and emailing people hoping that a paying gig as a production PA, camera PA or assistant/editor will come up but nobody's called so far and I still have to eat.  I've been cold calling post houses and even wandering into offices at the Culver Studios lot (one of my internships is located there) to talk and drop off my resume and I've gotten good vocal responses but no calls!

2 months is too long to not have anything paying.  Does anyone have insight or advice into breaking into production work in LA?  Ideally I would want to have a part/full time editing job while PAing on the weekends (I love being on set!).  But right now I just want anything that pays.  How do I get this ball rolling... faster?!!

TL;DR, I'm a PA/editor/small-time videographer new to LA in need of work, can you point me in a direction?

**EDIT thank you so much for the advice!  It's reassuring to know that I'm headed in the right direction.  Just keep swimming, just keep swimming swimming swimming...**"
13r21e,37,2012-11-25,Lab Volunteer after Science Hiatus.  Is this Possible?,galactically,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/13r21e/lab_volunteer_after_science_hiatus_is_this/,"Hey guys, I'm in a bit of a rut here and wondering if anyone here has advice for me.  I graduated from University in 2006 with a degree in Biochemistry.  All throughout University I had been working for non-profits and so afterwards it was something that I continued to do because I was super attached and loved what I was doing.  Fast forward a few years, I had reached a plateau in that field and so when I was laid off I saw it as an opportunity to re-enter the science field which I had never really even been a part of.  Resume after resume resulting in rejection after rejection.  I even contacted old profs (who remembered me, btw) asking for advice.  All they promised me was that if they knew of something (job, internship, volunteer opportunity) they would let me know (though I kind of doubt it :( really).  One even suggested I move to another location to get a manufacturing job.

What I really want to do is work in a research lab.  The only experience I have is a list of some pretty dope techniques I got to do as an undergraduate.  I didn't shy away from any difficult courses and took extra seminars and stuff so I could learn as much as possible.  

In the years that I was working for a non-profit I was taking courses that related both to the non-profit field I was in and a couple of grad school courses in genetics and immunology (but with no lab component to these).  I do have experience demonstrating an upper level microbiology course for a year in 2006 while I was still an undergraduate.  That is all the experience I have.

What I can gather is that I don't have much experience and the experience that I have was so long ago that it barely counts now (to get me a job).  What I do have is a lot of passion and enthusiasm, usually for everything that I choose to do but that's not something easily conveyed and I don't think it really counts.  I can't put that on my resume.

What do I do?  I'm thinking of contacting the laboratories that interest me directly so that I could offer to be a volunteer.  (I was actually hoping for a prof that I had contacted to recommend one for me so I could use the ""Dr. So and So recommended I contact you"" line.)  These are full-on research labs. I don't know the Ph.Ds that run them, but I have attended seminars they spoke at.  These labs are also pretty competitive.  

So, after all that mumbo-jumbo (sorry!) my questions are:
-Do I contact the lab director or the head researcher?
-What should I put in my cover letter?
-Does the fact that I spent 5 years in a non-profit organization look bad for me and should I minimize this on my resume? (Currently, my relevant work experience is before my most recent work experience but I have a lot of qualifications plus education type things for my non-profit work.  To me it shows how much I put into things.  Not sure if this makes a difference though and if I should cut back on that or omit it all together.)

You might think I'm overthinking things but I just want to make sure I get a placement (as a volunteer!!!) because I have spent the past year doing nothing with hopes repeatedly dashed.  I want to make sure I get a reply back.  I want to make sure I sound like I could do a great job.  Right now, its not even about getting a job, it's about having something (volunteering) to do and not feeling bad for myself.

Any input or advice you would have for me would be greatly appreciated.  Things I could say in my cover letter for example and who I should address it to.

Moral support would be great as well.  I know I need it.

Thanks guys."

So it’s a quick tale this week.
 
And due to the popularity of the older woman younger guy scenario I thought I’d introduce you to a young Mr Ho.
 
As I was closing into thirty and exploring younger flesh I was also branching out and decided I’d like to fuck (or in the very least kiss) my way around the world.
 
In Australian we refer to the good folk of China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong as Asian. I realise in the UK it extends to India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and so on.
 
Thus my newest conquest is best described of being of oriental descent. Definitely mixed race because (without being a stereotypical Australian racist) he was well over 6ft. He was awfully posh and came from Oxford but was at 6th form college; not the university. He was also a rugby player so for someone not on the petite side was physically a good match. Because of his age and athleticism he was also presumably full of stamina.
 
Once again the teen had to travel to visit me. We’d been communicating online and he seemed confident enough to see me one weekend. Only the Friday night beforehand I started getting my period. Having sex on my period doesn’t bother me, if anything it’s a bit of a turn on and a lot of men feel the same. However someone with minimal experience could find the thought of pumping a bloody vage quite off putting; psychologically traumatizing even.
 
I texted to let him know the situation; suggesting a reschedule saying I completely understood having never had sex with  a bleeding cunt before he may want to take a rain check. He assured me it would be no problem and he’d be there Saturday afternoon. On reflection I think he didn’t want his bus ticket to go to waste- he probably had to work really long hours at McDonald’s to save up for those babies. No menstruating cougar was gonna put his dick off his game…..or so he thought.
 
He actually managed to make his way to my flat (my flatmate having cleared off to his boyfriends for the evening) saving me having to meet him at the station and play nanny for the duration of the trip.
 
I’ve always been into slighter men, but the sheer height of him and the broadness was overwhelming. Coupled with the tones of his skin colour, hairless body and completely defined chest and ripped torso I could barely believe my lust…errr luck. He was like a giant Manga cartoon with brains and an awfully posh accent. There was just one downside with this giant man-boy. He had a very tiny todger. Perhaps had he not been so tall it wouldn’t have been noticeable but it was. It was like a little chipolata. I wanted to wrap it up in bacon and serve it at a dinner party.
 
Perhaps I should’ve removed the tampon first, perhaps I should’ve trusted my guy instinct and talked him out of attempting sex, but as he pulled my knickers down and I (discretely I thought) removed a tampon his face became very pale. When two fingers slipped into something more than watery warmth, he removed them. Clearly that particular cherry pie was not to his taste. When he looked at his his bloodied fingers I didn’t think he was imagining himself on some massive rock stage with an air guitar singing ‘Sweet Cherry Pie!’
 
All his good Oxford manners went out the door – he was anything but an English gent.
 
It was simply a case of his dick going limp and hearing him suddenly overcoming his previous youthful shyness and boldly stating, ‘I’m sorry I can’t do this. I thought I could but I can’t.’
 
it was pretty brutal on the old ears. I must say and talk about a pink (or rather red) elephant in the room. Although unspoken, the word ‘awkward’ reverberated all around. Unashamedly he clearly had no intention of finding alternate accommodation. Worse still he felt given he’d at least shown willing I could recompense him in some way for his monies and menstruation massacre. So I took the the chipolata and let it flop round my mouth and in all honesty within less than 2 minutes he’d come. He was verbally very grateful – by then he’d found Mr Manners and informed me I gave the best blow job ever. Ever? But that poor excuse for a stout infant-fish had barely had my lips round it before it was spewing man milk in my mouth. The best ever? He mustn’t have had a lot cause I hadn’t even got started – still at that point I needed an ego booster so it wasn’t an unwelcome compliment. Turned out Mr Manners was a passing visitor and he fell asleep immediately so I sneaked into my flatmates covers to feel safe and reel from the indignation and humiliation flung at me by some college teen.
 
Ever the hospitable host I woke at 6am and put myself back into his bed, all showered and fresh. When he woke to find me there, I confess there was an absence of regret or sensitivity in how he broached the monthly issues of what is considered normal for mature women. Perhaps that was the problem. You go to bed as a mature woman with an immature man you are likely to experience these inwardly excruciatingly undignified moments.
 
Not Mr Ho though. His first words were, as he put an arm round me and pushed my head to his groin was, ‘That was an amazing blow job last night, the best – do it again for me please before I have to catch my bus.’
 
I really should have mustered a little courage and backbone and told him to fuck off and learn a little bedroom etiquette or man up and remember not every rugby game was played on a dry pitch – sometimes it rains and gets muddy but you still gotta play the game.
 
I didn’t though. I had two minutes spare so finished him off. I’m guessing my ‘oh-so-amazing’ micro blow jobs were enough to counteract the mental scarification of seeing his index and middle fingers covered in dark red cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue.
 
A year or so later he was doing an intern-ship at Price Cooper Waterhouse and got in touch (he really must have liked that blow job). He asked if he could visit and knowing there was not a clot of blood in sight and remembering that huge hunky body my resolve weakened and I told him to come round.
 
And he was a specimen of perfect physical beauty, even his titchy penis was beautiful. His cock hadn’t matured so I could only hope his attitude and technique had.
 
How wrong I was. It got hard and managed to slip into the entrance of my vagina but it slipped out after cumming within all of two minutes.
 
‘I seem to have a problem with this,’ was the best he could offer.
 
I did the thoughtful girly thing and said it was normal and natural and encouraged him that the next time he would last longer and it’s be better and all those platitutdes. Once recovered though he plopped it back inside me and the duration was even shorter than the original encounter.
 
Did he apologise, offer to take me to dinner, offer to perform oral pleasure on me or offer any physical comfort or stimulus? No – I got a ‘I better drive home now before my aunt and uncle miss the car and wonder where I’ve been.’

I packed up my things and moved to Los Angeles where I was able to get a job in the field working in house for a small, crappy ISP. I didn't produce any work I'm proud of or anything really worth showing anyone else.

To be honest, I didn't get any chance to fully flesh out ideas during college either. I'm mostly interested in copywriting, so I did do a lot of writing courses but all my ad classes mainly focused on theory with nothing really ever being created. I didn't do any graphic design either... 

I've kicked around since moving back to my home state of Michigan, but never was able to even come close to getting another job back in the field, which is the ultimate goal. Now I'm finding myself facing another job loss and thinking that it might be the time to try and get back into advertising again... but no idea really how to do it without having a book or any idea really how to even go about presenting myself as open to ANY entry level openings knowing that kids graduating these days probably have more experience and know-how with their internships and all that jazz.

My question essentially is how do I go about presenting myself as a viable candidate? I can write for days but, like I said, have no graphic design experience so would need someone to make all the fully developed stuff a book requires. I'm totally open to starting at the bottom and working my way up to where I want/need to be, but how do I get that across without coming across as sounding desperate to potential employers? Any tips/advice/anything you guys could help me out with would be greatly appreciated.

Also, apologies for the somewhat rambly post. It's been a long day and my two weeks of unemployment are starting to stress me out as well. Thanks again for any advice/help you guys and gals can provide!"

Rioters enjoy playing with the community, not only with but against as well. What if players would get a small bonus gold by getting a kill on a Rioter? Similar to Zyra and Sion gold bonus on kill. Here's an example of the numbers:

* +1 gold for an intern.
* +2 gold for a Junior.
* +3 gold for a Senior
* +4 gold for a Lead / Manager
* +5 gold for Ryze and Tryndamere (presidents)

Only full time positions are available, no internships, part time, summer work programs, or telecommuting. If you are a recent graduate, you must demonstrate real-world Java or web development (JQuery, CSS, etc) knowledge to be considered. Thanks!

**What we do**

We develop 911 emergency and public safety software. Our software revolutionizes the way emergency first responders receive calls, react, and deliver critical emergency services to the public. We believe that by applying innovation to the public safety sector, we can make a difference in people’s lives. Our products include next generation VoIP 911 communication (voice, sms text, and video), computer-aided dispatch, GPS enabled mobile units for fire/police/EMS, maps and live data delivery, police and fire post incident management/investigations, and data mining/reporting.

**How we do it**

We believe in agile software development. Our well defined and efficient processes are backed by the best tooling we can find. Some of the tools we use include JIRA, GreenHopper, FishEye, Confluence, SpiraTest, Balsamiq, Subversion, and Jenkins. We believe in continuous integration, unit testing, and automated testing. We like clean code.

Developer happiness is important to us. Work areas are quiet, spacious, window-facing, and all developers get fast boxes with dual 24” monitors. We have our own development lab to run load tests or bask in the warm hum of the server racks. Our systems engineers ensure that production issue distractions are kept to a minimum. Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, contribute to open source, or enjoy reading about and discussing technology, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important. Our product line covers many diverse development areas such as distributed soa, web, backend, mobile, maps/gis, databases, caching, reporting, data indexing, and high availability. Each of these areas in a mission critical environment contains their own unique and difficult problems to solve. As such, a strong foundation coupled with the desire to learn, grow, and solve hard problems would make for a strong addition to our team.

**Junior Developer**

You have the passion and are ready for a challenge but are still getting started with less than a few years experience. You have exposure to some of the technologies listed, and are very eager to learn more while becoming stronger in the areas you already know. 

**Mid-Level Developer**

You are a seasoned developer with 2 to 5 years experience that can solve tough problems. You’re strong in at least one area of the software stack and are eager to expand into others. You are familiar with best practices and know how to write clean code.

**Senior Developer**

You are a very strong developer with over 5 years of experience. You are adept at breaking down and solving very complex and difficult problems. You’ve been exposed to most areas in the software stack and very strong in a few of them. You’re able to learn and integrate new technologies independently. You enjoy mentoring and guiding the more junior engineers.

**Technologies and Frameworks**

All of our developers have the freedom to pick the best tools to solve the problem at hand. Some specific technologies we like to use include Java 6 (soon to be 7), Spring, JPA/Hibernate, EHCache, PostgreSQL, H2, Web Services (SOAP and REST), Asynchronous messaging, Apache Lucene/Solr/Elastic Search, Java Server Faces 2, Primefaces, HTML 5, CSS 3, WebSockets, JQuery, Android, Swing, TestNG, Selenium, Maven, JasperReports, Jython, Bash, Geoserver, OpenLayers.

They are deeply and personally attached to their business, which I work as a programmer for.  I'm leading the current main project, and I know that progress will probably grind to a halt after I leave.  There is only one other fairly inexperienced coder, who I was working together with.

I plan to give them 2-3 more weeks of my time, as to not blindside them out of nowhere. I have become friends with them over the 1.5 years I've worked there, and they are not going to take the news well.

How should I handle breaking the news, SEddit?  Any tips?"

13t6lx,374,2012-11-26,Palestinian here: I wish one day the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for atrocities committed towards Palestinians.,throwaway874832749,worldpolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13t6lx/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/,"Considering the success of my last [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/13chp2/palestinian_here_hear_me_out_youll_probably_like/), I thought of doing a new post about how Palestinians have been treated throughout the Arab world. I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel. People living glass houses shouldn't throw stones."

I current am, and have been for 12yrs, an IT person (for a broad description of what I've done). I am currently working on my Divemaster internship with the intention of coming to Cairns to do my Instructor training, then hopefully getting a job at a dive shop and moving to Australia permanently. Based on what I've been reading, I'm more likely to get in under a work visa if I apply for an IT job rather than applying as a Scuba Instructor. My other option would be to do the 1yr work vacation visa, then hopefully have an instructor position and convince the dive shop that I'm worth sponsoring (I don't even mind paying the $5kAUD fees).

So does anyone know much about the best way to apply? I'll probably being hiring an immigration assistant as recommended by the Australian Immigration department, but I thought I'd talk to some locals too.

P.S.
I turned 30 this year, so this is my last year to come in on the work/vacation visa.
P.P.S.
I have read the plane on the /r/Australia graphic

Thanks!"
13vx51,12,2012-11-27,UPDATE: anxiety about my first OB appointment tomorrow... (long happy rant!),finndred,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/13vx51/update_anxiety_about_my_first_ob_appointment/,"My appointment was yesterday morning, and it wasn't scary at all! In fact, it was the most laid-back and personal visit to any doctor's office I've probably ever had.

When I arrived at the office I was given some forms to fill out concerning my health history and my significant other's. Then I met with a nurse so that she could take down my weight, blood pressure, etc. and basically repeat the answers given on the paperwork. She gave me a gross glucose drink and then left - telling me to get changed into my gown, finish the drink, and that an intern would be in to see me soon.

The woman who I interacted with the most at the appointment was this intern; she's been a labor and delivery nurse for a while and is currently in school to become a certified nurse midwife. She took down the *same information from the paperwork*, which was a little bit tiresome as I'd had to answer the same questions multiple times and was eager to get on with the exam. She asked if I knew which of the two local hospitals I'd prefer to deliver at (and since one of them doesn't accept my insurance the decision was made for me), and then gave me a **binder** of information. It was broken down into first, second, and third trimester and post-partum sections - with lists of safe medications, free classes at the clinic I was visiting as well as both hospitals in the area, lists of symptoms and ways to ease them broken down by semester, what's normal and what should be concerning, etc. There were also pamphlets about the newly-renovated (and, may I say, fucking *awesome*) birth center at the hospital I chose, as well as emergency numbers and a pamphlet about each of the tests/screenings I'll be having done in each trimester. I was really impressed with how thorough it was and how much stress was relieved just by knowing that I would have this to refer to throughout my pregnancy.

The intern was incredibly friendly and talkative, so I wasn't nervous about the exam - which was really great. After she had taken down info about my health history and gone over the contents of the binder, she felt my stomach and gave me a breast exam. Then the certified nurse midwife (CNM) came in to oversee my Pap smear and pelvic exam, and then! Because I was unsure whether I was 8 or 12 weeks pregnant, they decided that we should first try to find the bean's heartbeat and then that I should have a dating ultrasound done before heading to the lab to have approximately **half of my blood drawn**. (Slight exaggeration, but they took like seven vials of blood!)

I got to hear the tiny heartbeat, which was so exciting! I wasn't expecting them to be able to find it since 8 weeks was the more likely time frame, but it was there - and it was so fast and strong! I nearly cried. Anyway, then I got dressed and went to have a dating ultrasound just in case; I am indeed 8 week pregnant, and the ultrasound photos look like a boomerang with a glob of mayonnaise on it. But, it's actually my uterus and a tiny little blob of future-person! That was really exciting, although I was bummed that my significant other had left for work by the time I knew they wanted me to get the ultrasound right away - and the technician was pretty rude, but oh well.

After all the exciting stuff, I made my next appointment for December 27 and went upstairs for the bloodletting. I was really surprised at how supportive and personable both the intern and CNM were, since most of my experiences with doctors in general are pretty formal and stick-to-the-questions-on-this-sheet-feeling. These two ladies were really talkative, wanted to know about my support network and my life, seemed genuinely excited to hear the heartbeat with me, etc. It was so much more pleasant than I was worried it would be! 

I'm actually looking forward to going back next month - although that's mostly because we're having the NT screening ultrasound and I'm hoping the bean looks a little more baby-y. Now I just have to figure out how we're going to announce this to my significant other's family and the general public in a month or so. Hmmm..."
13vnkr,2,2012-11-27,I [20/M] have a crush on [24/F] but not sure what to do,ohITSANSON,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/13vnkr/i_20m_have_a_crush_on_24f_but_not_sure_what_to_do/,"I'm off in Asia doing an internship right now, it's an office job and 2 weeks ago a charming young lady also took an internship at the same place. We hit it off almost right from the start and lately I've started to take a liking to her... She is smart, cute, hard-working, thoughtful, and just generally very pleasant.


I've been thinking of just manning up and asking her out on a date but there are so many doubts in my mind. I guess that's why I'm here... I'm not really sure if she's interested in me yet, and I feel like maybe I should spend a bit more time just randomly talking to her to see if there's really a spark between us? It's only been 2 weeks after all. All of our 'long' conversations so far have been either during dinner or slow work periods (our office is sales so she's always working hard when there's clients that need assistance or paperwork to complete)... so I haven't had that many chances to talk to her really. Usually a bunch of us go out for dinner together and honestly I don't know when I'll get another chance to talk to her 1 on 1 again. I don't want to ask her on a date in front of a bunch of co-workers because I'd rather not give her that kind of pressure (I want her to feel safe saying no if she's just not interested). At the same time, I'm slightly paranoid that trying to catch her on a bathroom break is too creepy and might come off as cornering.


That said, I've really enjoyed my conversations with her thus far and she seems to have a lot of fun too! She's usually rather quiet and shy but she opens up a lot when she talks to me. I have also noticed that she likes physical contact (sometimes she'll touch my shoulder, or constantly bump against me while walking)... Though sometimes at the office it seems like she just completely ignores me, so I feel like I'm getting mixed signals (though when I tease her about it, she insists that she is just too focused on her work). Maybe I'm overthinking all of this.


I mean really, right now I'm not all that interested in taking this to a relationship. After all, I don't know this girl all that well and I'm returning overseas at the end of 2012 anyways (I'm not one for LDRs and she has not been in a relationship yet so I wouldn't want her first to be as distant as a LDR if we were to get together). As of now, all I want to do is get to know her better as a person because I'm genuinely interested who she is.


Sorry if I've rambling on a bit, I'll just cut to the questions I suppose :P I'll edit on any other facts as needed or if I come across them.


1. How do I know if she's interested?

2. I know I should just ask her out on a date. How can I create an opportunity to get her 1 on 1 without making the situation awkward for her? I want to give a chance to have a safe out if she's not interested.

3. What do I do about my leaving in a month? Or is this just an entirely irrelevant issue that I'm psyching myself out on?

4. Also, my plan for the date is to take her out for an afternoon stroll by the seaside since neither of us are from the area and she keeps saying she wants to check out the scenery... I figure this is a light, relaxed way for us to walk and talk. If possible, we'd follow up with dinner. Is that a good plan, or does it seem too much for a first date?

Any other advice is also greatly appreciated! Thanks guys! :D"
13vn1p,4,2012-11-27,Would you date someone who is receiving disability/SSI?,somewhatcrazy,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/13vn1p/would_you_date_someone_who_is_receiving/,"Some Background info here: I (23m) am currently applying for disability benefits. I am already on food assistance and my very supportive parents are helping with my bills and expenses so I can continue going to school. I do have my own place (with roommates) and a car, and I have a lot of ambitions that are currently on hold until I can afford to pursue them.

The main reason I ask this is because I am not *physically* disabled. I have *mild* aspergers and ADD and OCD tendencies, but these issues almost never affect me socially anymore. The real problem is my **anxiety**, which is what prevents me from working. I have only had four real jobs (I did an internship for a while) and all of those jobs ended with me leaving due to having panic attacks while working. Specifically it would happen when I was dealing with a particularly difficult customer, or when things got extremely busy. I have also had to leave jobs due to being made to feel uncomfortable by my peers. (For example I worked in a deli once, and when it was busy it was incredibly stressful and I would make stupid mistakes. My coworkers all hated me because I would either have to stay and try my best which would slow them all down, or run to the bathroom to try to calm down at which point I would be accused of laziness.)

What it boils down to is that in my day to day life I can easily manage my anxiety by simply removing myself from bad situations, avoiding people who affect me negatively, and dealing appropriately with confrontation. However, as soon as I am on the job I lose access to all of these coping mechanisms, and sooner or later I end up fleeing the situation.

At this point I have no way of affording any sort of therapy, and my parents cannot continue to support me. While there may be jobs out there that would work for me, if I didn't find one on the first try I would just end up in the same situation again, only without any sort of safety net.

Okay so that's the bad stuff out of the way. The **positive** side of things is that in general my issues only crop up when I am in a situation I cant escape from like a job. Anyone who meets me in a normal situation would never guess I had any issues, as I have worked hard to be confident, engaging, funny, and intelligent. I've been told I'm considered attractive as well, and IMO I am a damn good boyfriend. Aside from being a bit shy and awkward (which I usually can use to my advantage) I am not half bad with approaching women.

So to (finally) get to the point, I just got out of a two year relationship and have just started approaching women again. All of this disability stuff is a very recent development, and I usually just tell my friends my parents are just supporting me so I can go back to school. However, I really don't think its advisable or at all **respectful** to a girl to lie to, or withhold information from her if I want to pursue her romantically. However, I also have received a lot of harsh judgement from people I have told, usually because I don't look or act ""disabled"" and I prefer not to share my issues.

So please help me out by telling me whether or not I am ""dateable"", and If so, if you would prefer to know about my situation up front or if you would be ok with me getting to know you before I opened up about it."

Even though I realize things could be much, MUCH worse, I still find it hard to keep myself from crying to sleep at night...  I worked my ass off for four years in school and for what?  To work selling electronics working for the worst job on the planet.  I don't even make minimum wage...  

Nobody wants to hire me, I either screw up the interview or they just don't call me in for one to begin with...  I've tried many different ways...  Through career fairs, linkedin, craigslist, school and even just knocking on doors...  Nope.  Nobody wants to hire a kid with an MET degree and no internship.  It's like they think I didn't work hard enough or something...  Like a lack of an internship, which is usually doing menial busywork anyways, means that I wouldn't be a good long-term employee.  

Besides that, I'm in a real shit position...  I'm 24 and I'm still living with my parents...  All of my friends have moved away...  some of my coworkers are friendly but they'll stab you in the back whenever they get the chance...  I should be enjoying bachelor life and a good job but god just shovels shit in my face whenever he gets the chance.

I hate myself for writing this.  I'm sorry for the rant but right now I just need to feel some love...  That may be selfish I know but I just need to find as many reasons as I can to go on fighting.  As morose as it sounds, I'm really starting to lose hope.  With everything.

Before anyone points it out, I realize how terrible, angsty and emo that was.  I have no shame...  It felt good to write it."

13uyb3,6,2012-11-27,"is there any other way? i don't want to give up, but she's given me impossible deadlines [M21, US/ F28, china]",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13uyb3/is_there_any_other_way_i_dont_want_to_give_up_but/,"I guess I'll start at the beginning. I never thought I would need advice...

End of july 2011, I'm home on summer break, very bored and perhaps a little lonely. I meet a 25 year old girl from hong kong on omegle, we talk every day for a while, she wants to meet me in person, eventually she asks me to be her boyfriend, at first I refuse, but she's so sweet and very kind, and gorgeous, and around christmas I give in.

So we're together at this point. To be honest, I thought it wouldn't last long due to the distance and language barrier (her english wasn't great then, but has improved quite up till now). But I kind of have a soft spot for asians (much softer now), she was really sweet, and I figured even if things didn't work out I would have learned something, because I'd never so much as held hands with a girl before.

Things are going great at this point, it doesn't take long before we exchange ""I love you""s and also get really naughty on skype. We make plans for her to visit sometime around valentine's day, and we're both really excited.

But things start to sour... she trips and breaks her nose terrible, and for some reason she's not able to fly for *several months* because of it. On top of that, due to issues getting a visa and shifting work schedules and finding time, we still to this day have not met up.

She also brings up the fact that she has a very sensitive body (as in, susceptible to illnesses and injury), and she likely will be unable to have children past a certain age (I think she said 33 or 35 at the time), and we talked about it for a bit. After I reassured her that even if we could never have children I would still love her, I mentally tuck that away as ""something that could potentially destroy our relationship"" and then I forgot about it until recently.

Somewhere along the way she brings up the prospect of marriage. I tell her I strongly believe that we can't even consider it until we've lived together for at least a year. Eventually (early/mid spring) I tell her that I'm uncomfortable talking about that since it's so far in the future. That's fine with her at this point.

On top of all of that, we start arguing a bit about her weight-- she had gained around 30 pounds since I met her the previous july, and it wasn't until mid-october of this year that we really resolve that, although we have resolved it (she is losing weight now). Compared to the rest, this is a small issue, but it didn't help things.

Mid-may. I find out she's actually 27, not 25. (Her 28th birthday was late june.) It was either me remembering wrong our omegle conversation, or she lied about it then or maybe it was a typo or something, I don't know. But she never corrected me until this point, and while I was angry, I understood why she did it. She didn't mean to be deceitful, she's a sweet, innocent and (despite her age) slightly naive girl who didn't know how/when to come clean and was thoroughly convinced I would leave her when she told me.

Also starting in may, and happening a total of around 7-8 times up till now, she's tried to leave me because she thinks it won't work out. Every time, I beg and plead for her to stay and she does. We really do love each other despite all of our difficulties.

We made plans to meet during the summer, which gets pushed back to september, which gets pushed back to november (due to a shifting business trip which ended up being cancelled, but she still got a work visa that will expire end of this month).

She brings up marriage and kids again in the fall, often. In september, she convinces me to get engaged against my better judgement.

Unfortunately, also in september, in my excitement to meet her, I ask her to try birth control since we both would prefer it without the rubber. She had told me before that she was allergic to it, but when she agreed I had kind of figured her doctor said it was safe. It wasn't. She almost got cervical cancer (thankfully not), and now can't visit before her visa expires. She also had to take some hormone pills that made her gain weight, which wasn't a huge deal but didn't help things.

Recently, the past two months, I find out more exactly what kind of commitment she is asking for. She might not be able to have kids after the age of 32 (only 4 years from now!!), and furthermore her family/friends/culture is pushing her to get married asap (all of her friends are married already). 

Right now, we have plans for me to fly to her city during spring break. We made plans for me to work there and live with her next summer as an internship, but I don't know if I can actually go through with it (my parents are really pushing for me to find something at home, and I agree that it would be best for my finances and career). There is also a chance she might be able to move to seattle by next september and work there, which would be great for us as that is a city we both agreed that we would love to live in.

I've promised her that I will have kids with her when she still can, and that I will marry her in 2014. Over thanksgiving, it became pretty clear to me that I can't really do that, and that things probably won't work out.

But I'm also thinking about her future without me... it's also very clear that she loves me a whole lot, much more than she has loved anyone else before, and I feel the same way. I worry that either 1) she won't find someone else she really loves in time to have kids or 2) she would rush into a marriage with someone she doesn't love, just to get married and have kids. The 3rd option where she finds a great husband and has a great family seems very unlikely, and I'm worried about her, and wondering of there's not some way she could choose me.

**------tldr------**

Due to cultural differences and health issues, she's given me deadlines that I can't meet for both marriage and having kids. We both love each other very very much, and I can't let her go, and she can't either. It seems such a shame that we love each other so much, yet our relationship will probably end without even having met.

The only solution I can come up with besides just leaving her is very sad and very hurtful-- putting all my cards on the table, telling her I can't meet those deadlines, and asking her to choose whether she wants me, or to rush to find another good man to make a family with. Is there *any* other way?"

Bank vägrar att kommentera om frågan ganska sent onsdag samma år de mailade ett uttalande genom en talesman säger att banken redan “samarbetar med myndigheterna” men nekar till kommentar om pågående rättsliga förfaranden.

I vissa andra frågor som berör UBS, de förnekar mediarapporter talar om rika tyskar att flytta medel till Singapore och andra pengar centers framåt av en schweizisk skatt itu av träda i kraft i januari.

Sedan 2009, UBS har noga undersökt “villkor” för företag med över 60 länder, däribland Tyskland och vidtagit åtgärder för att justera eller förbättra reglerna där så är nödvändigt, talesman sade.

Hello Reddit

I know this is a longshot and most likely a selfish cry for aid of some sort but im honestly just tired and cant handle the pressure anymore

Im just writing off the fly on whats on my mind so i apologize if im all over the place.

I am a 28 year old (28 in december) male currently living in Malmö (Sweden).
For as long as i can remember ive been shunned and an outcast as much in social life as in the job market.
Ive had a few internships that has led to like a christmas job where after i get the usual (we will be in touch if we need you), to never hear back and finding out they employ some other random person

Now im not really sure what or how things go around normally since my childhood was basically non-existent until the age of 14. Prior to that i was physically abused by my stepdad among other things (some i to this day try to just block away)

Ive been on medication for the few past years with a heavy depression. I have anxiety attacks constantly and on top of that insomnia.
What i have done to combat said things aside from medication. Is playing video games alot trying to get online friends. Not much luck there either to be fair with you

As for depression. I got pets. They cheer me up when they happy alot. And make me laugh, something i find myself rarely doing anymore or even smiling

Friends? non-existant. My 2 pet birds (one which i'll get to later) are my friends

Now im just trying to keep it short and this is where my cry of help comes

I earlier this year had a somewhat large sum of money saved up. Not much for maybe your average working man but for me it was alot.
In February month i wanted a friend for my bird so i bought him one. A cute one on top of that that sadly passed away a few months later due to an enlarged liver and her feces had blood. She basically passed away within a few hours after i noticed

And yes i did notice it earlier but with the +400% vet fee's (we're talking about at least 400-500 dollars just to see the vet since it was on a weekend) There was no way i could afford that. I had already spent roughly the same amount on her treatment a few weeks prior

Now i took that blow hard but i kept hoping maybe it was just her time despite her beeing young. I got another one and well. Its all going well until a few weeks back . It was due to her laying too many eggs  she got a weak bone structure and excess liquid and we sorted that out.

Now however she also got a small swelling on her liver and im just hoping that the same fate wont happen her.

Where is this all leading
Im not sure what ill do if i lose her, ive already tried to commit suicide twice before .

Im hoping this medication she will have for roughly a week more  can aid her but im low on money all together

For rent, for food, for her well-beeing and yes i place her above me. I love animals beyond anything

I can manage to survive on bread and water if it so helps her live

This is my main cry of help. Funds to help her. Or at least try to, knowing ive done all i can. Even if i have to sell all my possessions, not that it would revenue anything
I never in the past 10 years christmas or done anything special for my birthday. Cause i dont feel i deserve it. And even if i could id probally use it for my birds


And yes you may ask if wellfare exists , but they have also turned their back to things

Ive probally forgotten a few things that i really wanted to talk about and just talked about one thing, but all i know for me that little bird is worth to me than anything

Please Reddit
Help

**TL;DR**
Need help with vet costs, food, rent
Need a friend or two
Someone to talk to or ask for advice
Need a job

13ufun,78,2012-11-26,"Web devs, do I have a fighting chance?",boatBurner,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/13ufun/web_devs_do_i_have_a_fighting_chance/,"I've got a big decision to make.

I'm 25, married with four little boys and only a couple of months left in the Marine Corps. What I decide to do next will determine the following twenty years of our lives. As such, it has been a great deal of stress for me over the last year.

I've made the decision a while ago that I don't want to stay in the military. And unfortunately, all of my peers and mentors in the military are shocked at any other decision that doesn't involve staying in the military because of the size of my family. I get it. I have quite a full plate, but I also think a lot of people get ""stuck"" - military or otherwise - in a career they aren't happy with out of fear of failing.

I don't want that to be me, but I need to be smart about this next step.

I have been focusing on learning Ruby on Rails only recently and have a solid background in HTML and CSS. To an experienced coder, I'm very much a green horn. You can see my freelance and contract work at http://turbofish.net and http://bluereach.com respectively. A lot of what I do for client work is using CMS or pre-built templates and themes, and just modify them as needed.

As someone with a family depending on me and no more than 3-4 years in web design experience, how likely is a career in web development? I would love to build web applications and start my own business-to-business SaaS or work with an existing company, but I often wonder if I'm delusional and should settle for something outside of the industry. I simply don't know enough people to get a good assessment of my skills vs. the industry standard.

I'm currently taking college courses on the side for a CS degree, and plan to continue pursuit of the degree once completely out of the military (and fortunately, the GI Bill will pay me $1400/mo. during school months for housing expenses in Arizona).

Am I at least capable enough to land a decent internship someone? Should I just keep on dreamin? Are there some harsh realities about my circumstances that I need to embrace? Or is there a good shot at pursuing this dream to become a web developer in a shorter span of time than I'd thought?

Thanks for your feedback. I'm very receptive to sound advice and I'd really appreciate any expert input.

I'm also not a very private person (I believe you are who you are, online or otherwise) so I'll be willing to share any other bits about myself if it helps you in lending some input. Thanks again.

Hello Reddit

I know this is a longshot and most likely a selfish cry for aid of some sort but im honestly just tired and cant handle the pressure anymore

Im just writing off the fly on whats on my mind so i apologize if im all over the place.

I am a 28 year old (28 in december) male currently living in Malmö (Sweden).
For as long as i can remember ive been shunned and an outcast as much in social life as in the job market.
Ive had a few internships that has led to like a christmas job where after i get the usual (we will be in touch if we need you), to never hear back and finding out they employ some other random person

Now im not really sure what or how things go around normally since my childhood was basically non-existent until the age of 14. Prior to that i was physically abused by my stepdad among other things (some i to this day try to just block away)

Ive been on medication for the few past years with a heavy depression. I have anxiety attacks constantly and on top of that insomnia.
What i have done to combat said things aside from medication. Is playing video games alot trying to get online friends. Not much luck there either to be fair with you

As for depression. I got pets. They cheer me up when they happy alot. And make me laugh, something i find myself rarely doing anymore or even smiling

Friends? non-existant. My 2 pet birds (one which i'll get to later) are my friends

Now im just trying to keep it short and this is where my cry of help comes

I earlier this year had a somewhat large sum of money saved up. Not much for maybe your average working man but for me it was alot.
In February month i wanted a friend for my bird so i bought him one. A cute one on top of that that sadly passed away a few months later due to an enlarged liver and her feces had blood. She basically passed away within a few hours after i noticed

And yes i did notice it earlier but with the +400% vet fee's (we're talking about at least 400-500 dollars just to see the vet since it was on a weekend) There was no way i could afford that. I had already spent roughly the same amount on her treatment a few weeks prior

Now i took that blow hard but i kept hoping maybe it was just her time despite her beeing young. I got another one and well. Its all going well until a few weeks back . It was due to her laying too many eggs  she got a weak bone structure and excess liquid and we sorted that out.

Now however she also got a small swelling on her liver and im just hoping that the same fate wont happen her.

Where is this all leading
Im not sure what ill do if i lose her, ive already tried to commit suicide twice before .

Im hoping this medication she will have for roughly a week more  can aid her but im low on money all together

For rent, for food, for her well-beeing and yes i place her above me. I love animals beyond anything

I can manage to survive on bread and water if it so helps her live

This is my main cry of help. Funds to help her. Or at least try to, knowing ive done all i can. Even if i have to sell all my possessions, not that it would revenue anything
I never in the past 10 years christmas or done anything special for my birthday. Cause i dont feel i deserve it. And even if i could id probally use it for my birds


And yes you may ask if wellfare exists , but they have also turned their back to things

Ive probally forgotten a few things that i really wanted to talk about and just talked about one thing, but all i know for me that little bird is worth to me than anything

Please Reddit
Help

**TL;DR**
Need help with vet costs, food, rent
Need a friend or two
Someone to talk to or ask for advice
Need a job

13y5b7,3,2012-11-28,[CRIT] A Cold Night [1000][Realistic Fiction],Lord_Boo,write,https://www.reddit.com/r/write/comments/13y5b7/crit_a_cold_night_1000realistic_fiction/,"I wrote this story a few years ago, back in High School, for a class I'd taken for fun. Even after the class, I had a bit of an attachment to the story - a sort of conflict, in that I thought at times it was really good, and at other times that I was deceiving myself and it was pretty sub par and needed massive work. It's been through a few major drafts, as well as several minor ones. Going through a few formatting things, trying to make it less of just a wall of text.

There are three parts, which I'm sort of looking for different feedback from each part.

Part 1: Original intro
Part 2: Alternate intro
Part 3: Main story (can lead from either intro) (Too long to include in this same post)

    Intro 1
This section is meant largely for setting the world of the main story, and for getting part of the plot into the reader's mind, so those are what were most important to me, with characterization and and dialogue following after that. 

“So have we found anything out?” Officer Jefferson asked, glancing around the apartment as he headed to the crime scene. The place was filthy. Jefferson literally had to avoid stepping on some of the largest bugs he'd seen in his life – some the size of a bullet casing, nearly. The hallway was littered with pizza boxes and take-out wrappers. The victim obviously never left the house, and probably cleaned up just as rarely. As he approached the body, he couldn't help but glance at the discarded pile of what seemed to be food and trash. It was growing several kinds of mold, in colors and growths he'd never seen in his life – and he'd seen a lot of things.

“Yes, sir.” One of the forensic agents walked alongside Jefferson, though he seemed far less fazed by the pig-sty the victim called a home than the officer did. “There was a note on the laptop, presumably a suicide note by the looks of it. You know, it's quite interesting, I-” Jefferson gave the short ginger man a hard stare, and he cut to the point. “Aside from the note, the victim – who we've now identified as David Smith Junior – had in his possession before his expiration a paper cup of water as well as a large dose of potassium cyanide. Gross examination of the corpse leads to the conclusion that a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascu-”

“Look... kid.” Jefferson had to hold his tongue. It wasn't politically correct to call him poindexter anymore, he remembered. “I don't wanna hear all this science mumbo jumbo. Save us both the time and just tell me what we know.”

“Well... we don't know anything in certainty yet.” The agent began, quickly continuing  at Jefferson's increasingly irritated demeanor. “But... it's fairly safe to conclude that Smith took the cyanide with the water before writing his note, but managed to conclude it by the time the cyanide actually took effect. Official cause of death is likely a heart attack. It's a suicide, sir.”

“Well, let's wrap things up here, then.” Jefferson turned his back to the geek and his squad. He could hear him jabbering on about a press release and something about books, but he managed to tune him out, just wanting the day to be through with. A routine suicide, some fat slob got sick of being just some fat slob and decided to end it all. 

Of course, that wasn't the story at all. Jefferson had little time for things that didn't help the case move along, so he wouldn't find out about the victim until that evening on the news. And Jefferson would never – like the rest of the world – know the true story of what happened to Dave Smith Jr. that night.

    Intro 2
The first intro was connected with the first ""version"" of the story. I did some overhauls to make certain things make more sense, and decided I didn't care for the original intro enough to revise it. Replacing it, this version has more emphasis on description, using it as a tool to set the world. Plot and dialogue are also there, but I'd say characterization is the next big thing after Description/Setting.

“Jesus Christ, this is disgusting!” Jennifer cupped a hand over her nose and mouth. “I swear I'm going to puke.” She tried to block out the stench of rancid leftovers and growths of mold. The fact that the room was heated and they wouldn't turn it down didn't help anything either. She'd covered scenes of murder and suicide before, so she was far from squeamish, but this took vile to a new level. The small apartment was practically decorated in filth. Everything was coated in either dust or grime, her shoes were sticking to the what might have once been carpet, the walls were stained with fluids she didn't even want to guess at, and the floor was covered in-

“AHHHH!” The news reporter kicked her leg in a jerk-reflex as a cockroach as big as her high-heels were tall crawled across her foot. Her shriek piercing the apartment, both the news crew and the forensics team turning their attention to her. She stumbled, breaking one of her heels as she stepped backwards and tripped on a discarded pizza box that had staled and crusted over solid, before falling onto a more than overflowing trash can. The waste in it crunched and squished under her weight, releasing a burst of rotten odors, of old take-out and delivery. “Oh god...”

Jennifer pulled herself to her feet, running from the apartment. Upon reaching fresh air, she doubled over, and promptly emptied the contents of her stomach over the concrete and her thoroughly-ruined shoes. Cursing under her breath, she kicked the shoes off and wiped her mouth. “Make-up! Wardrobe!” She barked once she'd had a moment to recover.  

“Jenny, we don't have time. They're expecting us on air in eighty-seconds.”

“God damn it!” She snatched the microphone as someone handed it to her. “Fine. Bring the equipment out here. Just get a close up on me so they can't see my skirt.”

“But...” An intern spoke up. “Mr. Johnson specifically mentioned that he wanted us to get a good shot of the inside of the apartment.”

“Yeah? Well tell Mr. Johnson that if he wants to see this place he can get a Haz-Mat suit and a camera and wade through that shithole himself. And if he doesn't like that then he can f-”

“Five, four, three...” The cameraman began counting her down to live.

“Hi, Don. I'm here just outside of the apartment of one Dave Smith Junior, who, we're now finding out, uses pen-names to publish his books. It seems that late last night, Smith passed away of apparent suicide. He would have turned 30 today. The exact details won't be confirmed until later, but it appears he took potassium cyanide dissolved in water. This cyanide is commonly used to clean or maintain metals such as silver and gold, and is known to cause a heart attack or stroke within sixty minutes of ingestion. We're getting details now that records are present in Smith's apartment to confirm that he is in fact not only poet and author Leon Stride, but also T.G. Renalds, author of the best-selling young adult novel series, *The Notebooks of*…”

    Main Story
For this one, characterization is easily the most important thing. I wanted the central character to feel as much like an actual person as I could, while still keeping him interesting enough for the reader not to get bored. As such I developed a character that had some dominating negative traits, which sets up the challenge of generating negative opinion of the character to start with, and change the reader's point of view by the end of it. The plot is pretty minimalist - nothing really *happens* in the external world that's influenced by the events that take place - but I feel like storytelling is important. Cards on the table, this was written a month or so after having read Tobias Wolff's [Bullet in the Brain](http://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_27/section_1/artc2A.html) which I fell more in love with after each re-reading, and the kind of minimalism of important events and heavy focus on a central character really stuck with me and influenced the writing of this piece. My biggest concern is that, after reading the work, the reader will simply respond, ""So what? Nothing really happened."" Which is certainly true, and there will always be that problem with some audiences. After watching a well performed production of *Proof* at a High School Theatre competition, which I was thoroughly impressed and pleased with, one of my director's opinion of the play remained ""Who cares?"" So I guess what I most want to do with this story is create some sort of attachment or interest in the central character itself so that the reader, upon completing the story, doesn't walk away with a sense of lack of fulfillment. 

The main story is too long to include, so I'll link to it below. It's an additional 3500 words on top of both of the intros which are also there.

I have been working as an IT analyst for the past 3 years doing support/implementation for financial software.  In the process I have picked up skills in SQL querying (in DB2, MySQL and MSSQL).  I have also picked up some light programming skills (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, batch script writing).  I have also used excel to solve basic problems with data sets. I have also worked with web servers and mainframes.  

How much would these technical IT skills help in my career change?  Would they offset a lack of actuarial internship?  (I keep hearing internships emphasized).  Would these skills offset an average gpa (not terrible)?  Would they make up for having an unrelated major (liberal arts, it was more than 5 years ago when I graduated).  I do have an Economics and Mathematics minor, which I've found that college minors aren't always helpful.

I am mostly nervous about investing the time and effort for the exams, and after passing a few exams, still not getting an entry level position.

Any wisdom to this would be helpful.

13xqbr,2607,2012-11-28,IAmA a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon and I wish the Arab world gets as little as 10% of the criticism Israel gets for treating Palestinians. AMA.,throwaway874832749,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13xqbr/iama_a_palestinian_refugee_from_lebanon_and_i/,"I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13t6lx/palestinian_here_i_wish_one_day_the_arab_world/) on r/worldpolitics, and somebody told me I should do an AMA, not sure if you'd be interested. I'm sure most of this information is new to you considering the considerable lack of media reporting on the issue. FYI, I'm a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon. Here's the [proof](http://imgur.com/7DcO8).

Let me start with a couple of countries:

**Lebanon**

Around half of the 400,000 refugees live in camps, deprived of many rights. Refugees don't have any property rights, no access to the Lebanese healthcare system and there are certain restrictions on jobs we are allowed to do. We are issued handwritten [travel documents](www.passport-collector.com/2011/08/10/lebanon-refugee-passport-for-palestine/) of appalling quality (large size, cheap paper). The travel documents don't even have a full date of birth, just the birth year. You probably know about the Sabra and Chatila massacre (from the movie Waltz with Bashir, perhaps my favorite animated movie) were 3000 Palestinian civilians were killed in cold blood. These are at the top of my head, I'm sure there's more. This is what a British MP Gerald Kaufman said in 2011 when he visited the camps:

&gt;When I went to Gaza in 2010 I thought I had seen the worst that could be seen of the appalling predicament of Palestinians living in conditions which no human being should be expected to endure. But what I saw in the camps in Lebanon is far worse and far more hopeless. The conditions are unspeakable, but for over 400,000 of our fellow human beings this is their life: today, tomorrow and for a future that cannot even be foreseen. At least in Gaza, frightful though the situation is, the people are free within the confines of their blockaded prison. In the camps of Lebanon they are not free.

**UPDATE1: Since many here are blaming the PLO and its involvement in the civil war. That's definitely true to a large extent, however you're missing a few points. Most Palestinians refugees were placed in camps in south Lebanon when they arrived. These camps were gradually militarized and became the grounds for operations against Israel and because the PLO had so much power back then, they started making trouble and trying to control part of the country. So had the Lebanon absorbed it's Palestinian population properly, this wouldn't  have happened. Look at the Palestinians of Syria, they didn't make any trouble and didn't start any wars, why? Because they were treated like equal citizens. Also, FYI, Lebanon naturalized more than 100,000 Palestinian Christians and Shiites. Second, who do you think was funding the militarization of the PLO? THE ARAB GOVERNMENTS, whether it's Saudi Arabia or Iraq or some other Arab country.**

**What do I want from Lebanon as a Palestinian refugee? Some of you say that naturalizing 450,000 Palestinians would be a strain on the country. You think that much Palestinian refugees aren't already a  strain? Everyone knows if Lebanon naturalizes Palestinians the whole debt Lebanon has would disappear. I'm not exactly fond of naturalization myself though. However, so many laws can be quickly enacted that will significantly improve the life of a refugee, like property law or proper ID and passports formats that aren't from the 1950's. Also, you say that refugees put a strain on Lebanon. Mind you that a large number of Palestinians work abroad and they all send money to their families in Lebanon so they contribute a lot to the Lebanese economy. Hell, I've been told the Lebanese lira dropped significantly when the PLO left the country in 1982. One more thing, all Lebanese factions and leaders involved in the civil war are now reigning free in the country many of them ministers or MPs, the same people that committed massacres towards their fellow Lebanese. Nobody was punished for the civil war, except for the Palestinians. Why? Because they're not Lebanese, so it's perfectly fine to discriminate against them.**

-------

**Syria**

Surprisingly, refugees there are treated quite well, almost like a citizen. Although this is changing and the Palestinians are being forced to choose sides in the Syrian uprising.

**Jordan**

It's the only country that naturalized Palestinians after the annexation of the West Bank, perhaps because they needed the population back then. From what I know from my family members living there, there's some discrimination between the natives and Palestinians, but it's minimal compared to other Arab countries.

**Kuwait**

Kuwait [expelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_expulsion_from_Kuwait) more than 450,000 Palestinians when Arafat declared his support for Saddam during the Gulf war.

**UPDATE2: It seems like a lot of Kuwaitis here are saying that the Palestinians got what they deserved for their support for Saddam. Can you really believe that 400,000 Palestinians earning good money in Kuwait wanted war and death in Kuwait? There might have been a vocal minority, but that's to reason to expel families that were contributing to the Kuwaiti economy.**

**Iraq**

Palestinians enjoyed full rights under Saddam's reign, however after the 2003 war they were severely targeted with discrimination or killings and the majority fled the country.

**Egypt**

You can read [this](http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR20/FMR2013.pdf) report here. Not only are they discriminated against (no free education) but they receive no UN assistance whatsoever. If they go out of the country for more than 6 months, their residency permit might be revoked. Imagine being born and living in a country your whole life and needing to renew your residency permit every couple of years. Also, a little bit about the occupation of the Gaza strip by Egypt, one observer (a member of UN) noted that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""

-----------

I'm sure there's more but these are off the top of my head. Also, for a Palestinian refugee it's very hard nowadays to get a work visa to Gulf countries. I was accepted for an internship in Dubai for an American bank but I waited for the visa for 1 and a half months and it never came. I had to relocate to another office. This isn't anecdotal evidence, many complain about this.

Moral of the story: Israel naturalized over 1.5 million Palestinians. They enjoy full citizen rights and many of them would remain in Israel even if a Palestinian state is established. Palestinians in the Arab world on the other hand suffer from discernible and vile discrimination. If a non-Palestinian Arab speaks of the maltreatment of Palestinians by Israelis, tell them to STFU and demand rights for Palestinians in their countries before they complain about Israel. People living glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Their reply ""That is still not definitive from the account for me to verify in the thread, but it is enough back up that I will not remove this from the reports."" ~~I'll giving them additional proof.~~ they need an ID with my name, don't feel safe sharing that.**

**EDIT3: Maybe this is not a real AMA, but it did serve its purpose of informing redditors of the plight of Palestinians *outside* Israel. I'm sorry I disappointed you with my lackluster answers, I'll try to answer more questions tomorrow.**

13xm62,3,2012-11-28,I hate myself.,zombiechristmas,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/13xm62/i_hate_myself/,"Hi guys. I am literally writing a wall of text and idgaf right now. I just need to feel like somebody will read this and that somebody will listen.

Before I go into what I am dealing with, let me give you a quick background of who I am. I am a 20 year old university student studying microbiology. I am in my junior year of college. I live by myself and have a puppy. My parents are my financial support and I have a boyfriend who I love very dearly. 

Sounds awesome right? 

Maybe. But for some reason, I have been REALLY feeling down the past few years. I busted my butt through high school: worked three jobs, had an internship at a hospital, and was a full time student. Graduated 5th in my class (would have been second but I got one ""B"" my freshman year). Not getting perfect grades on an exam was a failure to me and I always made sure that I did whatever it takes to do well. I was also on my school's varsity swim team. Then I moved across the US for college and have been unable to accomplish anything.

My very first semester I tried to withdraw from the university because I felt like it was too overwhelming. My parents convinced me to stay. During that time, I met my boyfriend and a small group of friends. Despite having them around, I kept having this nagging feeling of just ... nothing. I just didn't care about anything. Oh look I have an exam tomorrow... Cool~ My roommates are shitty... whatever~~ I would fail exams but constantly just felt numb towards it. I ate food constantly and didn't exercise. By the end of the year, I had gotten mostly B's in all of my classes and gained 15lbs. Summer semester happened I had to withdraw from one of the two classes I was taking because I just kept failing the exams (due to me not studying). Coming from the perfect student a year before, this was shocking to everybody.

My sophomore year came and I moved in with those three people I met the year before. Worst mistake ever. They treated me like shit and two of them made it their life goal to make me miserable. I could write a novel about all of the horrible things they did, but I'll spare you all the details. However, I was able to stay strong emotionally during the semester. My boyfriend told me if I didn't get my shit together he would leave me. Fair enough. I busted my ass again and did awesome. Pulled a 96 on my last organic chemistry exam (compared to the 64 I got on the first one!) Lost 10 of those 15lbs that I gained the year before. Things were looking good. 

Well... about a month later, all of the horrible feelings came back and I quickly feel back into my ""numbness"". I hid in my room and did nothing but eat. My roommate situation got so bad that I had to sublease my apartment and move out. Any trust that I had in people was gone. I had zero friends. I gained a grand total of 25lbs from just hiding in my apartment. I stopped going to my classes and barely scraped through my classes. I cried almost every single day. I ended getting my first B-.

This current semester, I promised myself I would try and do well again. I went through sorority recruitment and rushed a rather popular sorority... thinking I would finally make friends. 116 sisters later and I cannot connect with any of them. My hiding in the apartment has gotten worse. I'm too scared to go to the grocery store or the gas station or to the vet or to the doctor. I'm too scared to go to class. The semester ends in two weeks and I am looking at getting an F, C, C+, B, and an A-. I have now gained a total of 40lbs. None of my clothes fit and I am a disgusting slob. I want to withdraw from the university again. I have constant migraines and when my anxiety gets really bad, I rip all of the skin off of my fingers (literally all of the way around my fingers). I'm always tired and my eyes hurt from crying every day.

I hate myself. 
I hate the life that I'm living. 
I hate everything. 

My parents are zero help. My mother is a hypercondriac when it comes to herself and barely acknowledges that I have a problem. They just tell me to ""study harder!"" ""stop picking ur fingers lolol!"" If I tell them that I'm unhappy they are like, ""why have you never said anything before!"" when I literally have been telling them every couple of weeks for the past two+ years. Last night I got another failing exam grade back and decided that I should schedule an appointment with a psychologist.

My insurance doesn't cover psychology/psychiatry. 
Now what?

Seriously. I feel like life doesn't want me out of this. When I was in middle school, I use to self injure and even though I have no desire to go back to those ways, I miss how it broke these feelings of numbness.

I have no idea what to do anymore. I don't want to fail out of my major. I LOVE my major... I just ... I don't even know.  "

[M17, 5 months]

Hey. This is my first time posting here so just let me know if Im doing anything wrong. So Lets call me G and my girlfriend C. The other guy is P. Yeah. Another guy. We are all seniors in high school. My girlfriend and I go to the same school and P goes to one near by. C and I started talking last April during school, I was kind of new to talking to girls as I had only had one girlfriend before, so I was playing ""the asshole"" type even though that's not who I am at all. Im actually a really nice, romantic guy (I didnt mean that in a conceited way). But I wanted her to be interested so I pretended to be an asshole. And she took the bait. She started to like me around June after we talked for a while. We knew we liked each other but I kept saying that I didnt want a relationship, I was afraid because my ex hard hurt me so badly. C said ""okay fine. But I like this other kid who works with me at my internship, since I dont know if you and me (G and C) is ever going to become anything, is it okay If i see P a little bit?"" Being an idiot and an asshole, I said ""yeah sure, thats fine."" A week or two went by and I realized that I really liked C. A lot. We had taken each others virginities and we felt a very strong bond to each other. So I told her I wanted P gone. She then told me that she didn't know if I was lying to her or not, because of the lack of interest I showed in the beginning of our relationship (this would come up a lot over the next 5 months). She told me that she would think about who she would pick. She picked a date two weeks away and told me she would have a decision then. The date came and went. No decision. Every day I spent with her I fell deeper and deeper in love with her. I told her I would do anything for her and for the first time, I meant it. I told her I finally understood why my dad had always been so generous to me and my sisters, always sacrificing everything he had so that we could be more comfortable. It was because he loved us and I understood because I loved her. It took her three weeks for her to say it back. But when she did say it, I could tell she meant it too. We both started crying. Fast forward about three months. Weve had a lot of fights and almost broken up a few times (Always about P) but we always got back together, never being able to stay mad at each other and never being able to be apart for longer than a few hours; a day at the most. We have planned a future (however improbable) together. Married. Two kids: Sam and Charlie. A dog; a Hovawart named Chester. We really loved each other. Until one day. I decided enough was enough. I just could not take it any longer. I broke up with her. By the end of the day I realized how much I missed her and how much I loved her and she agreed that she wanted me back. But she didnt trust me. She didnt trust that I actually loved her because ""how could I if I was able to break up with her"" and she didnt trust that I wouldn't try to break up with her again. But I do love her. Very much. This was two weeks ago. She isnt that mad at me anymore, but still has some issues. She hasnt seen P in a few weeks but they still text just as much as she and I do. I cant get her to stop, as much as I plead for her to. She likes him a lot. 

I have left a good deal out so if you have any questions on details, please ask. But what do you suppose I do? I really dont want to lose her. She honestly means everything to me. I know im just a kid in high school but I've never felt anything like this before and even though Ive only had one girlfriend before, Ive had other romances. I know what it normally feels like. This is so much more. Everyone Ive talked to tells me to just forget about her. But I cant. I will never be able to forget about her. Thank you for reading. I know that was long.

13wrp6,8,2012-11-27,A Plea for Help,[deleted],OpiatesRecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/13wrp6/a_plea_for_help/,"I posted in here a few months ago about wanting to get clean. I failed. Here is my story.

I'm a successful college senior, my grades are good, and I'm going to graduate in the next year. I recently got an offer for an internship with a great company in my field that should turn into a full-time offer if I don't mess up. Everything in life is going my way recently, except for the fact that I've developed a pretty frequent opiate habit. 

I currently take between 40-80 mg of hydrocodone every day. It started out once or twice a week back in August and has been an every day thing since late September, so about 2.5-3 months. 

I'm really making this post because I need support. I need encouragement. I need people to explain to me what I'm going to face when I stop this, how long it's going to take to get through it, and suggest good ways to remind myself why I'm quitting for those moments of weakness. 

The only break I've taken since I started was 3 weeks ago, during which I stopped for 5 days (mon-fri). I thought I was golden. The physical w/d's were over. On Saturday I woke up and decided to ""reward"" myself for the time off. I did that, and didn't use on Sunday. Then I used on Monday, and have used every day since then. 

I'm getting scared. I'm spending way more money on this than I ever imagined I would. I'm doing it way more than I ever imagined I would. I have WAY too much going for me and this needs to stop, and it needs to stop now. Finals start at the end of next week so I want to be through the physical w/d by then, so tomorrow will be my first day off. 

During the 5 days I took off, I noticed the worst symptom was waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I was having a panic attack and not being able to go back to sleep. Do you guys know any good ways of dealing with this?

I need words of support. Tell me your stories. Tell me how it could be worse, scare the shit out of me. Tell me how you quit. I need anything right now. 

Thank you. "

A little background: I was your typical socially awkward penguin. I would say my anxiety stemmed from the fact that I was grossly overweight (even obese at one point) so I never felt attractive. Long story short, I landed an internship in January, hit the gym, lost 55lbs, became more confident, and read /r/seduction and /r/malefashionadvice to polish up the rest of my game. 

During that time, I became close with one of my female friends and asked her out only to be turned down. I did not let it hinder our friendship but it took me months to get over my one-itis. Fast forward to this semester (September), I see her again after 3 months. We hang out often but it's purely platonic. So here I am, this social butterfly. She sees me mingle with everyone on campus especially with other women. I guess my total 180 shocked her system. 

And here's the kicker! This past week, something happened. As I told her that I (finally) got a date, she reveals that she has feelings for me but does not want a relationship. She wants a friendship with benefits... and what do I do? I decline (but we made out though). Why? Because I am still insecure about my body to be physically intimate with someone. It doesn't show through my clothes but my excess skin is really fucking up my confidence and I don't want her to react negatively when ""it"" does happen. I've been laughed at before, I don't to be laughed at now nor pitied.

What should I do aside from gym harder?"

140lb9,92,2012-11-29,Boss Decides to Bite the Hand that Feeds Him,Drdoomz,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/140lb9/boss_decides_to_bite_the_hand_that_feeds_him/,"So to start off we need a back story. I was the youngest CADD (computer aided drafting &amp; design) guy to ever work for this specific company. I was currently finishing up my associates degree while also working full time for this company. I was told that after I finish my degree I would be given a very generous raise pending I was still with the company...(This should of been the first red flag).

Things went great for the first few months... It was only me, another designer and my boss. I even passed a certification test making me an ADDA Certified Mechanical Designer. I am a fast learner, and I picked up the tasks and jobs that were assigned to me very fast. So I was given even more responsibilities due to the lack of individuals in our group... So after about a year on the job I was brought on to Full time with benefits even though it took them two months after promoting me to give me any sort of paperwork or documentation stating I was promoted. 

Now enter the Interns! We started taking on interns to do help with some of the workload... Basically my boss was looking for another ""Me"". And to his surprise every single person he brought in was a complete idiot. This went on for about a year and 5 interns later we were back to the three musketteers of drafting. We were probably working 60+ Hours a week to keep up with the workload. When low and behold my boss decided to incorporate a whole other devision of the company into our design group ""Document Control"". Now we needed to hire an individual who could do Document control and some small Cad work on the side whenever he had the time. SO I told my boss that I knew a perfect individual who would need a little training (Just like I did) but could be brought up to speed very fast. So I get him an interview and he gets the job.

Now the person I got the job is a Halfrican... Half Black, Half White, and honestly he is one of my best friends. He is also the WHITEST black person you will ever meet. Now  I was unaware of this at the time but my Boss was a complete raicist, and wouldn't give the new guy any time of day. My boss would pull me and the other designer into a conference room and bitch and complain about how retarted my friend was, and how stupid and ignorant and so on and so on about 3-4 times a week. This put me in a horrible position where I had to just ""agree"" with my boss so that he would get over it and move on and let us get back to work. Eventually my boss would only invite the other designer and myself out to lunch just to bitch about the guy every day. Also my boss always made me drive him out to lunch and usually made me pay for his lunch but that is a whole other matter =/.

Eventually my Friend got tired of our boss's antics and decided he wasn't going to put up with it anymore. He put in his two weeks notice and my boss decided to make the next two weeks the worst weeks of his life. My friend told me thanks for getting him the job he didn't blame me for the way the boss was treating him and told our boss to fuck off and left the same day he put in his two week notice.


Now my boss decides to turn on me... To blame me for picking this individual. To tell me that I have to work ""Unlimited Overtime"" to make up my work and his work. I say ok and proceed to call out sick for the next two days. I turned my phone off so that he couldn't call me, and Went into the office after it closed on the second sick day, Dropped off my letter of resignation, my door badge, my keys, and any other item I  thought he wanted. 

Never heard from him since.

However, a mutual friend of mine and the guy who left right before me who worked at the company said the next day was histerical. My boss threw his monitor through a wall after reading my e-mail to look under his keyboard for my resignation. And pretty much lost his mind. After a couple months he is now the most calmed minded individual and doesn't interact or say anything to anyone.

Don't fuck with the people who make your life easy.

Now I did leave out all of the harassment I had to put up with from my boss over the years... I figured it would shorten the story up drastically. But needless to say I became very depressed and dreaded going into work every day. Thanks for making my decision to leave so much easier!"

I have already began studying for P/1, I am a math major and a mid-tier engineering university with a 3.8 cumulative, and 3.9 in my major. I am involved in leadership roles within my fraternity and am part of an exclusive greek honorary society that helps with philanthropy events and holds seminars for the greek community.

I'm hoping to take P/1 a couple weeks after new years, and am curious as to what my first step should be. Should I look for an internship even though I'm graduated from college? Or should I instead look for an entry level position?


I also am trying to get a gauge of how difficult it will be for me to get said position you suggest I go for? I felt as I was a very competitive, but then I read of people on actuarial outpost that had to send out 500 resumes to get even one entrylevel offer. Is it really that bleak?

13z78w,4,2012-11-28,"SO (21F) has broken up with me (22M) because of an email to an ex/friend, please advise me reddit. It was supposed to be forever.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13z78w/so_21f_has_broken_up_with_me_22m_because_of_an/,"So I'm not sure where to begin, but I will try to summarize all important facts that are relevant to my story. I really need your help Reddit. I know that I erred here, and that my SO has every right to be mad at me, but I don't know to what extent I can fight this. I think it is blown out of proportion, but I don't know to persist or if I need to back down. I don't know how to feel, and since she left 8 hours ago, I can't feel anything but sorrow. I assume this is normal. I'm sure many people feel this separation anxiety. But nothing makes sense right now in the context of my life and your input will hopefully give me some help. I cannot heal and find my own way. I really need guidance, for the first time in my life. 

So I am going to start with myself. I am a 22 year old male, I've had 2-3 relationships in the past that did not work out. For many reasons, in some of these relationships I had a history of infidelity. I did these things because of everything from retaliation, to just plain lack of caring and immaturity. Since then, I have recognized that cheating never does anything for anyone, neither does deceit. These are very personal, emotionally heavy things to carry with you once you suffer through it. Needless to say, I too, have been deceived a few times.

Anyways, I have this person in my life, let's call her Haile...she is an ex. She was an ex 2 years ago, and since then we have seen each other once in person. But we have kept in touch via other communications (facebook, text) after a solid year of not talking at all. Our relationship did not work out, but when both of us were in a time of need, we were there for each other. Not romantically, just as friends, as moral support, as someone to talk to when nobody else truly understood. The reason for this is because in some crucial ways we went on to experience the same things with our next SO's, and broke up and started talking again at the same time. I do not have ANY romantic feelings for this person, and have not since our relationship didn't work. It was a clear failure for us to be together romantically, but as friends, we gave each other decent comfort and support. I cannot speak fully to her feelings for me, but as far as he has expressed them, they were always platonic and as a friend since we started talking again. I never saw anything more.

Anyhow, this brings us to my current (now ex) girlfriend. Let's call her Bree. Bree and I started dating in July of this year..right around the 15th. We met through work, and after a couple of days of messaging back and forth nonstop and having great chemistry, we decide to go on a date...more of a play date for our dogs. I brought my dog over to her house to play with her dog. This was great, and on this day we talked for about 9 hours, nonstop. The subject of our attracting for each other came up, and we were both honest in that we were very attracted to one another. 

The hurdle here was that she was just getting out of a 3 year relationship..and things had not yet settled down. She was still talking to her ex. Within a week of us continuing to see each other, she completely broke things off with him and cut communications. Since then, our relationship escalated exponentially. It was the kind of feeling when you find the person you are meant to be with for the rest of your life..we both felt that way, and we both were very honest about it. We both felt exactly the same. We liked the same things. We joked the same way. We absolutely clicked in every aspect of life..sex, interests, career, everything, She was, decidedly, the perfect girl for me, and conversely I was everything she wanted in a guy. Our relationship escalated very fast. We knew we wanted to be with each other and it was very clear...very, very clear. Love was in our vocabulary, and we did everything together, we moved in together, and soon every part of our lives belonged to each other. It was amazing, and we were complete.

Well...the problem starts here. Somewhere in those 4 months that we had been together (July-Now), she started becoming very suspicious of me for EVERYTHING. Always checking my phone, facebook, email, web history, everything. I understand that I had a shitty past..but I loved her. I loved her a lot and would NEVER want anyone else. Somewhere within all this, I had to cut out contact with Haile. She was jealous, did not believe that I had only platonic feelings for her, and basically was very uncomfortable with any communication. She was convinced I still loved this ex, but I didn't, and I don't. Her and I were good friends, but I accepted cutting communications because it is an ex and I understand her not feeling comfortable. Anyways..the way I had to do so was fairly rude. Haile tried to contact me and say hi a few times, and the last time, on the 5th attempt, Bree, my now-ex, then current gf, demanded I tell her I was with someone else and could no longer talk to her.

I obliged. Things went on....she always checked my email, web history, always trying to catch me in a lie. Sometimes borderline too much,but I didn't care. I love her. I had nothing to hide. But today..today I made a stupid mistake. For some reason, I thought of Haile. Not romantically. Just as a person I had lost touch with. Last I heard from her she was in the process of getting an awesome internship in her field, but I never found out how that went. I made the foolish mistake of wanting to ask. But I felt I couldn't tell Bree...So I went behind her back. I decided to create a fake email, with which to contact Haile. I did this truly hidden, I did not want Bree to know, but I wanted to know how Haile was doing..for no reason other than it crossed my mind. I do not love Haile. I do not want her. I just wanted to see how she was..if her internship had worked out. That is it.

I created this hidden email account and sent a simple message:

""How have you been? It's been a while. Hope you're well."" and didnt'sign my name. I did not want to leave my name on it from paranoia of Bree fidning out...wrong, I know, but I knew she would not understand. Long story short she came to find out of this..

Everything exploded. She has claimed I do not love her, and if I did love her I would not do this. I would not betray her like this. I would not have done this. I have ruined everything. I apologized a million times, I have admitted myself to be childish, stupid, that I acted on impulse and that nothing in the world means more to me. It didn't matter. We cried, she got her dog, packed her things, and left to her parents'. 

This happened today (11/28) at around 3pm EST (when she left). Since I have tried to text her. She has told me she hates me, that I have destroyed her, that I will never have her back, that she is done with me, that I never loved her or I never would have done this to her. That this has been a betrayal of her trust. That she can never trust anyone again. That going behind her back has completely changed who I am to her, that she no longer respects me, and that she can no longer trust me.

I understand it was wrong to go behind her back. But it was just an email. THis person is in a different continent altogether. Bree, the girl breaking up with me, previously claimed to want to be with me forever. That she loved me infinitely. That nothing short of cheating would bring us apart. But all my attempts at calling, texting, have led to her telling me to give up and that she will never come back. That I have completely changed everything and it is over.

Is this what I should expect? I understand my error in going behind her back. I never should have hid, or had to hide, anything from her. She thinks this person means more to me than she does, but she doesn't. She believes I still have residual feelings, but I don't.

Is she angry because it just happened today? Is it the anger speaking, or have I truly done so wrong, that this is irreparable in a relationship that was so strong? She claims that, if I loved her, I would not do this. That this proves my love is weak and pathetic.

Reddit..what do I do? I can't stop trying to have her back. Should I let this go? I can't move on. She is truly everything to me. Everything feels empty without her. I can't imagine setting her free, and never seeing her back. What is happening? Is this email truly what destroys a relationship?

Sorry for any mistakes I made in spelling/grammar, I am typing this between tears. Thank you reddit. I need your help.

TL;DR: GF left me because I emailed an ex of 2 years behind her back to ask ""how've you been? been a while."" (that's it), because this ex and I were close only as friends. She claimed to have true love for me, but now claims that this email means I have chosen someone else over her and have ruined everything, that it will never be the same. What do I do? Have I erred that greatly?"
142gcj,207,2012-11-30,Would someone be willing to help walk me through some questions. I'm coming out of an extremely fundamentalist household...,mitsuruugi,TrueAtheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/142gcj/would_someone_be_willing_to_help_walk_me_through/,"I'm 23. I was raised as a southern baptist, I was even an intern Youth Pastor for awhile. I understand most of the ""Christian"" responses to most atheist postulations. But the way I was raised has led me to believe that christianity does not hold the answers. I understand that the problem of evil  (So well summed up by Harris in the God debate part 2) is a large hole in the Christian worldview. I also understand that Evolution is extremely well supported and flys in the face of biblical innerancy. 

I find myself at a difficult point in life, I live in Lynchburg, VA with my wife. Thankfully she shares most of my views that the religion we have been raised in is probably not the correct way. Lynchburg is the home of liberty university for those who don't know; so there are very few people around here to consult with. I've read many books on both sides (I even attended liberty for a few years so I understand the super christian view)

I guess I'd like to state my views and ask a few questions and if anyone can help guide me a little more, I would greatly appreciate it.

I feel I have a good handle on what makes christianity false, but I am confused as to the atheistic response. I understand what it's like to be an atheist in regards to 99% of world religions, but I also have the dichotomy in my head of knowing the christian response to most of atheisms ideas. 

For the record I would call myself an atheist but I have a few hang ups that are causing me to continue to question...

First, one of the biggest PROOFS christianity offers is irreducible complexity. This was pushed so hard while I was in school and I've read several books on the christian side of it that state that this is an insurmountable stumbling block for evolution and is a huge win for creationism. What is the naturalistic response to this?

Second, I know that athesim pokes a lot of holes in biblical contradictions. However there is a branch of christianity called apologetics which says that bible verses, when understood in the concept of the time that they were written ARE infallible and therefore not contradictory.  Mostly they claim that OT verses can be dismissed as cultural if they don't make sense in the modern setting, but the moral verses about how to mak certain life decisions are relevant today. Is there a logical counter argument to this?

THe other rebuttal I here when discussing my beliefs is usually an oversimplification of ""How can you say a primordial soup struck by lightning created life?"" Is there a better way to explain this?

I'm sorry if my writing comes off as disjointed. I really appreciate help on this as I feel I'm in a scary place in my life, departing from the beliefs and ways I  have been conditioned to live my life for 20 odd years. I would say my real departure from christianity started about 3 years ago when I joined the army and only recently after discussing it with my wife have I really started to verbalize and define it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: WOW I can not thank you guys enough. I never expected this kind of response and I can not tell you how grateful I am to all of you. I will absolutely be showing this to my wife when she wakes up tomorrow. 
A special thank you to cypherpunks for his incredibly wonderful analogy and to both Loki's who linked some very useful videos. 

At this point, I would have to say that in my head I would call myself an atheist, it is just a scary proposition to let that slip out because a majority of my friends and family are super baptists. It almosts feels dishonest to let them continue believing what they do about me, but I wouldn't want to cause them strife.

Again, I just have to say how overwhelmed with gratefulness I am at how gracious and informative you guys have been."
141v6d,0,2012-11-30,"23/f and friends no longer seem to want to be friends with me (24/f, 24/f)",Rilmawen,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/141v6d/23f_and_friends_no_longer_seem_to_want_to_be/,"I'm at a loss, my friends who I've been friends with for years have stopped responding to my texts or calls.
If you must be honest (which I'm fine with), please don't be mean. I'm already hurt by this enough as it is.
To give a better idea of what's going on, my (former) best friend's fiancee hates me, because I said something to her that was misinterpreted to her fiancee. So for six months, he hasn't spoken to me. I have learned my lesson from that.
In June, another former best friend had her wedding, during the wedding everything was fine, but I made a mistake by attempting to talk to my other friend's fiancee. That caused him to get really mad at me and officially block me on facebook. It took another few months, but I was able to move on, or get to the point where I'm not filled with rage every time I think about the situation.
Fast forward to this fall. The friend who is engaged and I have seen each other a few times since September, maybe a handful. I've tried to text and/or call, trying to be understanding that she is extremely busy. I am too. Same thing with the other friend who just got married. Now both of them ignore me. On facebook, calls, wherever.
I tried to go out with another friend last weekend to catch up, who is friends with these two people. She is known for not being a very good friend, who is 'fake', in the sense that she pretends she's there for you and then really isn't. She told me that these other two ""friends"" don't really like me any more.
It's really upsetting, I've known two of them since elementary (the one I met last week to catch up I have known her since elementary school, but haven't spoken with her much, we ended up going different paths). But the other two we were very close. Now suddenly...nothing.
I realize that one just got married and is busy, but that doesn't mean she should ignore texts. These two friends (engaged and married ones) text a lot, so that they don't respond doesn't make sense. The engaged friend is also busy with work and an internship, but she still finds time to respond sometimes. She may be mad because I have attempted to reach out to her a bit too much, and now I'm trying to back off, but it hurts.
I don't know what to do anymore, because it seems to me, obviously they don't want to be friends with me. Beyond the engaged friends' fiancee being mad at me, we had hung out after that happened and everything was fine. Yet now...nothing.
I have never felt so betrayed before. I feel like I have no one to turn to, I mean as a friend. I have good parents and a wonderful boyfriend, and a few friends from college who have their own lives, but no one I can confide in as just a friend. I'm seeing a therapist for anxiety/depression, so me feeling this rotten about it may have something to do with that, but it still hurts.
My question is, how can I move on? I'm quite shy, so I have trouble being really open w/ new people for fear somewhat of judgement or that they won't like me.
I know this will be downvoted, but I could really use some advice from an objective person.
Also, my mother thinks these friends are stuck in high school related drama, which I agree. Maybe I need to grow up? I don't know.
I'm not in any self danger, just looking for advice.
Tl;dr Best friends forever no longer applies, looking for advice to move on.

141q2l,13,2012-11-30,I want to move to the next stage of my life but I don't think my family will let me,Risorial,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/141q2l/i_want_to_move_to_the_next_stage_of_my_life_but_i/,"Okay so I’m in a real predicament. I got an internship in LA and I want to move from Utah to there with my boyfriend but, my super TBM family will probably disown me. Moving in with my boyfriend is the next logical step. I’m young and I don’t want to get married yet. If I move there with him there will be more money and we’ll be safer than if it was just me. 

I’m just so afraid to come forward to my family about this. I love them and I don’t want them to forget about me just because my life choices are different than theirs. I’d also really love for them to help me move. They have much more life experience than me and can help me make the right decisions. Some of my family lives about an hour away from LA and I’d like to think I could count on them if I needed something.  If I’m not able to get their help I probably won’t have enough money to get out to LA let alone get set up in an apartment and everything. They can also take away my car since the title is still in their name. 

I'm a good person and I want my family to be proud of me for the things I've accomplished instead of writing me off because we don't believe the same things. I'm fairly certain my family knows that I'm not really into church anymore but I know telling them that I don't want the same lifestyle as them will shock them. They may come around eventually but I just don't know...

I won't be moving until the summer but just knowing that I'm going to have to tell my parents and everyone else I want to go with my boyfriend is stressing me out beyond belief. I don't know if it would be better to tell them now or later. There's advantages and disadvantages to both. 

I could lose everything over this but I know it’s the right thing for my life to get to the next stage. 

Thanks for reading."
