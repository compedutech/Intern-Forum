I am a recent graduate with a bach. in Software dev. At the moment I have an internship going (unpaid :(   ) so I figured a good way to get some money on the side (afternoons/weekend jobs) would be to start up a simple little home pc shop.

I have done small to medium repairs on my own and family computers for free over the years, but I do not know if I want to include any kind of larger repair service (do not have the $ to afford startup gear if its a hardware issue). What I did plan on including though is the following:

* Home network setup
* Virus/maleware removal
* Custom builds
* Data Transfer
* Software installation (eh...we have a large group of elderly people here)
* Recommend with what budget you have what desktop/laptop to buy

After I get some initial funds from doing a few jobs, maybe it would be a good idea to then invest in tools for repair jobs (PS testers etc). I have a usb-sata-ide already that I borrow from a friend, and I already have a generic toolkit of screwdrivers and zipties/cutters. 

I figured a flat rate for most jobs would work good, and with the custom builds I would get a budget, and then collect a percentage     (enough to cover the parts if I have no budget to work with) ahead of time, and then the rest after completion. If I did get into repair, Id probably charge 30-40 an hour to undercut the local (hugely overpriced) store that has 2-3 employees working there. I applied back there when I was 19 looking for a summer job, back then it was....nasty to say the least. 

Flyers will be put in the 2-3 grocery stores within the 2-3 towns around here. Will be ordering business cards and setting up with Google Voice. Anything else you guys can think of that I am missing that I could include/need to do? Hopefully this is in the correct subreddit. Thanks for your time!

p65rg,2,2012-02-01,Just Trying to Shake this Depression,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/p65rg/just_trying_to_shake_this_depression/,"I don't know what started this all but for the past two months I feel like I've been falling deeper and deeper into depression and can't seem to find the ability to get out of it.  Depression runs deep on both sides of my family and I used to go to therapy for it when I was a kid and thought I had been better from it but maybe not.  I try to smile and be happy but I just isn't working like it usually does.  I don't even know where it all began, it wasn't even a month ago I was home and with my family and everything was great.  I come back to college and I feel so upset that I cried myself to sleep most every night for the past week and I just don't know what to do with myself.  I'm in my last semester for a dual major in computer science and cognitive psychology and I can't get the nagging feeling that I'm not going to pass these two courses I""m in and I'll have to retake the classes and it's scaring the shit out of me.  I've been working hard and we get the assignment back and the professor says you'd have to be an idiot to do bad and this and that about how only thing he takes points off for are dumb questions so when everyone else does fine but I get a 50% on it for the rest of the class I had to sit there feeling like a complete dumbass when I already have enough anxiety about that stuff.  I don't know what it is but whenever I try programming now I get horrible anxiety, like my stomach starts to turn and I feel like getting sick after about 30 minutes of it.  I've never considered myself to be dumb just never really smart either just normal but lately I can't help but feel like an idiot about everything.  I'm starting to look for jobs after college and I""m not sure if this is what I want to do but I have debt that I need to pay off so I need a job.  I recently decided I'd try online dating site after my friend recommended it and thought why not. After a broken heart from my highschool sweetheart I decided going into college I'd take a break and be by myself for a while but that's changed and I've tried for the past three months to start dating again.  I've emailed multiple women online and I haven't even got a response from a single one,  I don't know if I'm doing it wrong, maybe I'm not really that attractive or whatever it is but I just can't seem to do anything right and I don't know what to do anymore.  My brother has an internship at a compnay I wanted to work at last year but I didn't get the internship and now that I'm graduating I thought I'd try it again since they are looking for employees but I get anxiety like you wouldn't believe from thinking about it.  I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I wake up an just want to go back to sleep and forget everything.  I haven't felt this hopeless in a while and I don't know what to do."
p5s9r,1,2012-02-01,Jia you chao ren!,driven2rhythm,WritersGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/p5s9r/jia_you_chao_ren/,"I'm an engineering student and I haven't had a writing class in three years. I moved to China eight months ago for an internship and I figured since I wouldn't be using a lot of spoken English I would need another way to keep up my English. My decision was to started a blog about my experiences in China. I'm trying to improve my writing and possibly start writing a longer story or fiction sometime in the near future.

Within weeks of my arrival in Shanghai, I was informed that there would be a half marathon occurring in early December and it would be nice if I attended. Feeling that I could totally run 13.2 miles to complete a half marathon, I began training. I managed to run two to three times a week averaging about two to three miles for each run. 

About two months into training, I went out for my usual nightly run. When I’m running, I do so rather absentmindedly, making each turn without thought. As I rounded corner after corner, I noticed that a man on a bike seemed to be keeping pace with me. To double check, I sped up and so did he, I slowed down and he again followed suit. A plan formed in my head to beat him. Obviously this was not an achievable goal but I decided to push myself to the limit anyway. I finished a mile run in the six to seven minute range which I’d never been close to achieving before. 

The next day I decided to time myself to see just exactly what my limit was. Off I went on my run. It was just a typical night with a little weaving between people and cars due to my increased speed. I kept watch on the time and was very pleased with my rate. As I came up to the last corner I pushed it into overdrive, determined to impress myself. I reached the corner, hit a rough patch of dirt, twisted my ankle, and fell into a pile on the ground. I got back up, limped home, and proceeded to be overly dramatic about my injury and ran once in the next four months. 

With the lack of exercise looming over my head, the registration date for the half marathon decided it was a good time to make itself known. With still a month and a half left for me to train, I decided to register. And so I ran a few times and then got on a plane for a three week vacation to America. Take a guess what I didn’t do a whole lot of in America. 

While at home one night my sister decided a run was in order for her half marathon in a few months. Against my lazier judgment, I decided to join her. What started as an easy two mile run turned into me pushing my limit again and running seven and a half miles. My longest run at that point in time was about three and a half miles. This made me confident that maybe I could in fact complete a half marathon. 

In a matter of moments I was on the plane again to China. I sent a text to my friend announcing my return and he inquired back if I was ready for the marathon this Sunday. This Sunday… ha ha ha. I’d managed to run about four times in the last three months and the marathon was this Sunday. I mustered up the willpower to run two more times to “prepare” for the half marathon. 

At first I decided to exclude this next portion but of course, there’s never a dull moment in China and this is without exception. Friday night was check-in and gear pickup. The rest of the people I came with had registered in person so it was off by myself to find online registration. I got my number and went to pick up my stuff. As I walked and looked at the numbers I came to the realization that I was registered for a full marathon. I clearly remember scoffing at the idea of me running a full marathon when registering so clearly this was a mistake, an easily fixable mistake. Wrong. With the general flexibility of China, I assumed a quick switch was in order. That day, for whatever reason, insurance said “no, this is not possible” and therefore no switch is allowed. After ten minutes of tense discussion in Chinese and walking from booth to booth, it was decided, not officially of course, that I would run as the guy in our group who had paid his fee but could not run. No complaining if I fall and break my leg or something along those lines. Whelp. 

If it wasn’t already shameful enough that I’d probably get about half way through and fall over from exhaustion, it was requested that I wear a costume. I mulled the idea over in my head, not quite excited at the prospect of looking like a complete and utter mess. Against my better judgment, and since my friend was going as Spiderman, I ventured out Saturday afternoon to a costume shop and found myself presented with a pretty limited selection. In the end I decided with Superman, cape and all. As a note, bargain always. I didn’t realize until later on like a stupid laowai(foreigner), that I got suckered into paying about $30 for something that a Chinese person would pay $5 for. 

Saturday night consisted of a rather uneventful pasta dinner along with booking my ticket to Cambodia for vacation (maybe I lied). Thanks to jetlag still hanging around, I was asleep by 9:30. This also made getting up at 5:30 that much easier. I got dressed, walked out into the living room and laughed that I was the first one awake. Then I checked the time, smacked my head, and went back to bed for another hour. 

After an hour nap, I returned to the living room to find the others getting ready. Spiderman would be concealing his identity until the start of the race, then donning a mask and staying anonymous for the duration of the race. This was somewhat frustrating as Superman just has a stupid hair curl that somehow hides his identity. I possessed no such curl and therefore was going to be known no matter what. Deciding that a good confidence boost was in order, I wore the costume with false pride from the apartment door to the end of the race. 

Typically as a foreign white person in China, I tend to stick out and get a few inquisitive stares on the regular. I’ve gotten comfortable with this and tend not to notice unless I’m actively trying to catch people staring, which I sometimes do when I’m bored. Today though, I felt the eyes of everyone on the subway. Upon arrival at our subway stop, we remained at the exit as this was easier to locate our friends instead of trying to walk through the massive crowd of runners. This involved watching group after group pass by as they were released from the train. It was almost like a safari where groups would pass by, stare at the wild creature, take a picture, and continue on. 

Maybe you think of my example as an exaggeration. You’re wrong. People did in fact take pictures. Some were secretive and I would catch them out of the corner of my eye. Others would try and catch me without looking and then run away once eye contact was made. This bothered me somewhat but I tried to be a good sport about it since it’s not everyday Superman stops to run a half marathon. 

We remained stationary for about fifteen or so minutes. During this time I started counting the amount of pictures being taken of me. At this point, the count was already up to ten. About this time, the first person asked to take a picture with me. This picture brought a genuine smile to my face and managed to destroy a large chunk of insecurity present within my head. Finally, our group had assembled and we emerged from the subway. 

I was greeted by 25,000 runners, their fans, security, event organizers, and anyone else who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. One cannot quite comprehend what such a large number of people looks like until you see it. With this large number came an equally large number of cameras and I gave up attempting to count the pictures being taken of me. 

Finally, Peter Parker decided to transform and Spiderman and Superman got to hang out together. We walked along to drop our bags off, stopping about every minute to pose for a photograph. As we made our way through the crowd, I realized I’d been tricked, or maybe I just didn’t know marathons very well. Nobody else was wearing any resemblance of a costume. However, contained within one opening of the crowd stood two Johnny Depp Characters, one from Pirates of the Caribbean and the other from Alice in Wonderland. Of course a picture was in order. 


As we stood counting down the minutes to the start of the race, it dawned on me just how stupid running a half marathon was with no training. However, I had invested about $60 in this race and I was already here, might as well suck it up and go for as long as I can. The race got underway with a walk for the first several minutes followed by a light jog as each runner got a chance to stretch out. I must say that I’m disappointed that I didn’t bring my camera, but that was probably for the better in the end. The first turn of the race saw the road corkscrew up one level and then straightening out into a massive bridge. The corkscrew itself was rather wide and you could see almost all the way around it and the entirety of it was covered in people. What an awesome sight to see. 

The next seven miles was filled with packets of people dressed in decorative outfits, shouting “jia you,” words of encouragement to keep running. Every so often I would hear a shout of “Superman!” and I’d throw up the peace sign, as is typical of China, at least I think that’s the proper response anyway. Some runners would run ahead of me, stop and take a picture, shout a quick thank you and continue on. Others would inquire as to why I was running to the finish line and not simply flying. This kept my spirits up and I chugged along.

 ASKREDDIT.SELF ,I HAVE BEEN TO A MENTAL HEALTH DROP IN CENTER AND I'M BEING REFFERED TO  MY GP AND I'M WAITING TO SEE A THERAPIST.
THIS REASON I POSTED IT HERE IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE PLACE IT SHOULD BE.*

LONG AND RAMBLING POST
ME(30M) HER(21F)
Ok I'll start from lastnight.
I've been doing Standup comedy for a while now(about 10months) and have been seeing this girl (21) around one particular spot that I perform at.
Well we talk for a bit as I know one of her mates as he compares a night there, I gave  her my number over Facebook and  told to give me a call or TxT sometime .
So a day and half after that she sends me a txt,end up txting each other about 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 weeks and had 2 two hour phonecalls that felt like they by in minutes ,til last night .

We met up for a coffee and talked for about an hour then headed to the spot where I perform ( we both know people there). Anyway I get talking to her and honestly I think she is amazing, she works at a expensive pub in central London,she goes to Uni (and is in the top 5 students in her subjects) and also she interns at a prestigious law firm.

she's extremely well read and funny and clever. Her family are liberal caring and funny (she is also very pretty ,I think most of her guy friends have a crush on her) ,so her upbringing is pretty different from mine.

Well as you can see now I'm totally smitten with her but she really busy only gets one night to herself, I asked her when I would get to see her again and she said probably in two weeks. 

Now let me tell you about my self
When I was 5 I witnessed my father kicking the shit out of my mum ,it's pretty much affected my attude to violence, my father was a scary drink an could turn at the drop of a hat (not on his kids but adults)(also taught me how to handle drunk people). 
When my parents got divorced I would stay with my dad and his gf(who also happened to be my mums sister).between the ages of 6-10 I was sexually abuse by my dad(him touching me when he was drunk) and by an older cousin ( who I had to share a bed with,he would touch me too). I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex ( the closest I've come to sex was making out).I have suffered from depression for most of my life but most people never get to see that,they  me see laughing and cracking jokes all the time.


I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.
I'm not sure she even likes me like that, could be just be being nice.

Also could I ever be normal ? 

I mean have a caring loving relationship with someone who I can tell everything too,someone who would love me?

I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.
I often think about suicide but won't do it till my mum dies, and I'm smart 
enough to make it look like an accident.


So reddit this is the question,
Does this girl like me?
Can I find love and happiness?
How do you get over witnessing domestic abuse and child abuse?
Is life worth living?
Here's a little story

When I was 5 I started school,after the first week I was moved to a different class,I was given a letter to give to my parents explaining why I had to move class (I had trouble with my abc).
So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating),that I'm dumb and need to learn my abcs.
So at the weekend my mum drops my dad to work,as he's getting out he tells her ""make sure jestersidiot learns his abc"".
Now in the car my brother and I convince my mum to take us to the park,end up playing football then go home and watch some tv.

My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 
Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.

So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying ,mum says to him that jestersidiot is a kid should have some fun.well the argument escalates to yelling and then he gets up out of his chair and starts beating her .
punches to the face ,grabbing her by the throat and throwing her to the ground ,still punching and kicking her.then he gets down on her and starts punching her in the face like she's a man.while standing there my older brother(7 at the time) walks over to see whats happening with my baby sister(who was 3 at the time)
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,my mother is screaming for her mother till the day I die I'll never forgot that sound.
he stops hitting her and moves me and my siblings to the living room where we watch tv,I make an excuses to go to the kitchen(to check on my mum) but she's not there ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .

ABOUT ME
I am the darkest one in my family,so growing up I got all the dark/black jokes about my skin tone.
I was constantly bullied by people(some times white or black but mainly southeast asians).

It didn't stop when I got home because that's when my brother would bully me.I pretty much wished I was dead everyday when I was a kid.funny thing is if people were to describe me back then they would probably say I was a class clown.
I recently told my mum,brother and sister about the abuse (just about my dad not my cousin). 

I've had to be there for a friend who has been diagnosed with liver damage so I've had to be there for him,telling him to be positive and what he can do(keep getting doctors opinions till he is satisfied,speaking to liver disease groups and ARM himself info about what going on with his liver). Also arranged for a party for him so people could see him.

I'm still fighting depression and so times its hard to get out of bed.
I drink too much and smoke ,eat the wrong shit.
I've been unemployed for a longtime and my CV looks like shit.
But sometimes I have hope.

The thing with this girl I spent so much time alone that, i cant believe that someone could even like me that.
Well I guess it doesn't matter now,I txted her but she never got back to me.
I think I came on too strong Nevermind plenty more fish that don't want my bait. Or maybe she's busy ,or more likely she saw right through me.
Here's the thing It's not even about the girl It's about the fact in the firsttime in years someone like me and got to know me ,and now wants nothing too do with me because I'm a loser. I lose at life. Death would be better then knowing you on your own till your last breath never knowing love from a woman.

*As you can see I was feeling pretty shitty but I sent this to my closest friend and he convinced me to get help*"
p7ebx,9,2012-02-02,Becoming a grant writer?,[deleted],nonprofit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/p7ebx/becoming_a_grant_writer/,"Hey everyone,

Like the title says, I'm interested in advice about how to become a grant writer. I will soon be graduating with a double major from a major university. My minor related to non-profit studies. I consider myself a good writer. 

I  have been involved during my college career in a lot of non-profit work, including being on the inside of a project that involved securing a large grant (I did not write the proposal, but was involved in proofreading/making suggestions, as well as implementing the project once we received funding). 

Other than that, I have zero experience in grant writing. 

I realize that most likely, the first thing to do is to secure a volunteer internship in grant writing. However, I'm wondering, how can I know that a particular ""grant writing internship"" is going to give me the skills I'll need to eventually secure a paid job doing it?

Also, can you recommend any books, online resources, or classes to take?

Thanks in advance for your help."

p7bt8,8,2012-02-02,Common 0L Questions,orangejulius,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/p7bt8/common_0l_questions/,"**COMMON 0L QUESTIONS**

**1) Should I go to law school?**

 No, but that's not going to stop you is it? Didn't think so. Nobody ever listens to the warnings about a Yeti until it's ripping their arms off, either.

2) What are job prospects like after graduation?

**3) I'm an undergrad, what should I study if I want to go to law school?**

Anything. You're going to find everyone from any background can and will go to law school. Here's my tip...study something you enjoy and can make a living doing, just in case you don't end up going to law school.

**4) What do the law school tiers mean?**


The tiers refer to the law school rankings that USNWR publishes yearly. The ranking system is a composite of many factors, including peer and professional ratings, student/teacher ratio, etc. Each year, schools report their data and the rankings come from that data. Thus, schools move around in the rankings year to year. Generally, however, schools don't rise or fall more than a few spots every year (especially in the Top-14). 

There are 4 tiers:

* Tier 1 (1-50)

* Tier 2 (51-100)

* Tier 3 (101 - ~150)

* Tier 4 (~151 on down)

Schools are always ranked in the top 2 Tiers. USNWR generally also ranks Tier 3, but the rankings matter less and less as you get into Tier 3 and 4 territory. The general *trend* is that the further down you go in the rankings, the lower the admission standards are, and the lower your employment prospects are. 

While rankings shouldn't be your only determining factor when choosing a law school, the ranking of a school should play a role. Employers (and to some extent the general public) pay attention to these rankings. 

**[5) What does it mean if I choose a lower tiered school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/p8r4v/what_does_it_mean_if_i_choose_a_lower_tiered/)**



**6) What is the LSAT and how do I study for it?**

**The Test**

The LSAT is the law school admissions test. It is administered 4 times a year under conditions very similar to the SAT or the ACT. Along with GPA, it is really the determining factor for law school admission. A low LSAT can destroy your chances even with a high GPA, and a high LSAT can make up for a lackluster academic record. 

There are 4 graded sections as part of the LSAT and 1 ungraded ""experimental"" section. On test day, you will not know which section is experimental. Each section is strictly timed and you are given 35 minutes to complete each section. You will be given between 24 and 28 questions or each sectionThe 4 sections are:

* Logical Reasoning (2 sections) - Somewhat like SAT questions. These questions will often ask you to find weaknesses in arguments, identify valid premises and conclusions, etc.

* Analytical Reasoning - Logic Games. This is by far the hardest section for unprepared test takers. This section tests your analytical skills by having you solve complex ""games"" involving multiple factors and rules for how those factors interact. These kind of games can be learned, and practice and preparation goes a long way here.

* Reading Comprehension - Again, somewhat similar to the SAT. You will be asked to read typically 3-4 passages consisting of between 2-6 paragraphs and answer questions about those passages.

The experimental section will be made up of questions from one of the aforementioned categories. This section is unscored.

Finally, there is an ungraded writing section where you are asked to argue for one of two equally desirable options. Law school administrators don't seem to ever use this section for anything, so don't worry about it. However, it is advisable that you write something and make sure to sound at least mildly intelligent. No admissions officer wants to see that you just doodled for 35 minutes.


**Studying**

There is no substitute for taking practice tests (old LSATs) under test conditions, and as many as possible. These are available relatively cheaply from a variety of sources, including LSAC.

If you find yourself struggling in one particular area, the PowerScore bibles are an invaluable resource. There are individual bibles for each section of the test, and they contain detailed walk-throughs and guides on how to approach each type of question, along with ample practice problems. 

Finally, there are intense courses (e.g., Kaplan, Princeton Review), but they are not cheap and their effectiveness when compared to self-study has not been shown to make them worth the huge cost.



**7) How important is undergraduate GPA compared to my LSAT score?**

Law School admission staff almost entirely base their decision on your LSAT and GPA (URM status being the big exception). The question here is how important your GPA really is, my quick reply is that your GPA is less important than your LSAT score but still hugely important.

[Lawschoolnumbers.com](http://lawschoolnumbers.com/) (LSN) is a self-reporting admissions site. Basically you create a profile, put your GPA/LSAT in and any other details you find important (while be relatively anonymous).

[Lawschoolpredictor.com](http://www.lawschoolpredictor.com/wp-content/uploads/Law-School-Predictor-Full-Time-Programs.htm) (LSP) is a site with a calculator that determines your chances at any school based on calculations of prior classes. Most of their information comes from lawschoolnumbers.com

Looking at schools bottom 25%, median, and top 75% GPA/LSAT and then comparing it to students who were admitted and denied, it is revealed that your LSAT is more important. Schools have more of a hard cutoff for lower LSAT scores than GPA. A low LSAT causes more denials than a low GPA, and a high LSAT with a low GPA puts you back in the running while not the other way around. LSP calculates GPA being about 20% to 30% of what the LSAT is worth (They do it school by school); this percentage range is consistent with [allegedly leaked school formulas.](http://www.uiowa.edu/~030116/prelaw/lawschools09.htm)

Keep in mind, while the LSAT is more important, your GPA is second- by a lot. Despite what admissions staff may tell you, your LSAT and GPA almost entirely will decide whether you get admitted or not. This is allegedly because of rankings like USNews weighing LSAT and GPA so much.

I would also like to take this moment to point out that your GPA and your LSDAS GPA (the one law schools see) may be very different. If you ever failed a class but then retook it to replace the grade, I’m sorry to say that both grades will count. [Here is a calculator for LSDAS GPA.](http://www.lawschoolpredictor.com/wp-content/uploads/Law-School-Predictor-LSDAS-GPA-Calculator.htm)



**8) What Does It Mean If I Pick A Top 14 School?**

I'm at a Northwestern, so my answer will be tainted with the understanding that 95% of my classmates have pre-law school full-time work experience, so pretty much everyone has the work experience employment ""bump.""

For the top 10%, almost everyone gets jobs at prestigious Vault 10 law firms. Some people will say that Northwestern cannot place into certain firms, but I will tell you that at least one person in my class got an offer at each of Vault 10, including Wachtell and Debevoise. (To clarify, I don't mean one person swept; some combination of people covered all of them though). Almost all the big, prestigious firms come to campus during the summer before 2L to interview people. However, it is true that they would rather take only top students. For people who are below the median (read: that's half of everyone), you will be looking outside of OCI, almost certainly, but for people in the top 1/3, not getting a big firm job is almost difficult.

What happens to people at the bottom of the class? Many people still get jobs. This depends on your ability to pitch yourself to large law firms with less prestige (for example, firms that pay $120k instead of $160) and firms in non-major cities (like Milwaukee, San Diego, New Jersey, Texas, etc). This is a lot easier for, say, Texans, than for a native Chicagoan. Still, T14s have national reach. Despite having bottom 1/3 grades, I will be summering at a firm that pays close to $160k in a non-major city. Some firms would rather have anyone from a T14 than someone at the top of their class from a worse school, as I learned through my recruiting process.

Still, for one reason or another, some people don't get firm jobs. I know two people in my circle of friends who tried and came up empty-handed, both below median. So it's true that it doesn't ""guarantee"" anything, though the odds are definitely in your favor if you're flexible, open-minded and ready to hustle, because at the end of the day, many firms want to hire you on the strength of your school name alone.

There are also lots of other opportunities: the doors fly open for judicial externships, internships with Federal agencies, etc. I get tons of access to attorneys: they want to recruit at school, so all year there are firm-sponsored events where you can go pick an attorney's brain. Just today I called someone I met at an event like that and chatted with them for an hour about what term-time externship made the most sense for my long-term career goals. I only knew this person because their big prestigious firm thought it was worthwhile to have them spend several hours a year meeting with students and talking with them throughout 1L.

**Transferring**

Do not pick a school with the intention of transferring. There is a 90-95% chance you will never get the opportunity to transfer, and even if you do get the opportunity, there is a small chance that transferring is actually worth it (T2-&gt;T14 is generally considered worth it, but if it's just 10-20 spots, it probably is not). I highly recommend checking out TLS for transfer advice."

I've been given relatively free reign to choose books to review, but I need some help - what are some of the classics you think absolutely must be read (though I love sci-fi, I've been too busy with school work for the past two years to really delve into it as much as I would've otherwise liked)?

My GF and I (I'm 27 shes 25) have been dating for the last 6 years. Honestly I was planning moving in with her as soon as she graduated and settled into her job and possibly proposing to her soon after. She just got a job as a middle school Spanish teacher.

We both still live at home for different reasons... I am currently working an internship that is part time and doesn't pay too great. 

Anyways...

She called me up out of the blue last week and told me - in so many words - that shes not sure if she wants to be with me forever. Now that shes done with her job search, her personal life is the next thing she needs to focus on, and it scares her to think about settling down (she is a very fickle girl, it takes her forever just to figure out what to eat for dinner).

She is very conflicted about this whole thing, and is going to talk to a therapist as to why she feels like this. But in the meantime, she wants both of us to see other people and figure out if this is what we both really want. I'm not sure how long she means, my interpretation was a few months, but she could mean years for all I know. 

Reddit, I really love this girl and I want to grow old with her. Should I wait around and hold out hope that she will come around? Or should I move on with my life and worry about myself? 

TL;DR - GF wants a break after 6 years because shes unsure if she wants to spend the rest of her life with me.

I am a third year student studying Computer Engineering.  I am currently doing a software co-op (paid internship) at a manufacturing company.  Since they are a manufacturing company and don't know much about software, they pretty much came up with some projects for me pretty much based on the fact that they have to do with computers.

Cutting to the chase, they want me to write a mobile version of their website (which was created by an outside web developer company).  What we're looking to create is something simple and tabular based.  For example, we like the layout of sites like [The Owl House](http://www.owlhouserochester.com) and [Rock Ventures](http://rockventures.net) (obviously you'll need to be on a mobile device to see the website layouts I am talking about).  

What I'm basically looking for is how to get started.  I have no problem teaching myself by Googling everything, but I've been trying to do that for a while with not much luck, and I feel that it might be because I'm not searching for the right terms.  Anyways, can you guys help me out with a couple quick questions?

* What search terms can I look up to learn how to write a tab-based mobile site like the ones above?
* What languages should I be looking to write this code in?
* When finished, how do I make it so that the mobile site is viewed when accessed from a mobile device (not the regular website)?

Brief intro: I am fluent in Java and C++ and have been teaching myself HTML and CSS lately in hopes that it would help with this project.  Any help is appreciated, and again, if this is the wrong spot for this post kindly redirect me to where I may get some help.  Thanks a lot!"

**Description**

Patrick is rocking solo in the studio today, taking your calls and taking care of business. He talks about his current situation, shirt orders, Overdose, interns, donations and more. But don’t think that means there isn’t any funny. Patrick talks about getting a case of juice sent to him by a listener, and he single-handedly redesigns the NFL and professional football as we know it, including new team names and random team assignment. It’s going to be amazing. There’s also a rant on women and a story about a weirdo teacher in Los Angeles. The last part of the show is pretty much Patrick calling out delusional people, like the guys who does that Independent Podcast Awards shit.

At this point the thread has [spiraled out of control](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/) with Harrelson's comments being downvoted to oblivion. You can see the answers he DID give [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/iamwoodyharrelson) (and hit context to get the question).

There is also a circlejerk-type [request thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9u8t/ama_request_the_intern_who_suggested_woody_should/) looking for the intern who came up with the idea in the first place.

This has obviously not helped the movie at all. Many people are commenting that they will boycott the movie and Harrelson in general. My question is whether or not this will curb the influx of celebrity AMAs, for better or worst.

To be fair, these AMAs were giving a lot of attention to Reddit from other sites who linked to them. I would be very curious to see the traffic stats to these celebrity AMAs from outside links.

I personally think the celebrity AMAs are hit or miss, depending on whether or not the celebrity ""understands"" Reddit and the internet in general. Harrelson obviously did not. It is given that most celebrities that come to Reddit are promoting a movie or show. Does this mean that a celebrity cannot make an AMAAM (ask me anything about movie) without getting into possibly offensive questions? I ask this because the first question that Harrelson answers, and what possibly started the downturn, was a Redditor accusing him of taking a [friend's virginity without calling afterward.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nlalf?context=3). 

Anyways, very interesting stuff.

Edit: More stuff I came across.

Just saw that the virginity story has become a [meme in itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/p9reb/woody_meet_reddit/) being on the front page of /r/funny. 

In that thread there is a counter argument going against the circle-jerk mentality and [defending Woody](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/p9reb/woody_meet_reddit/c3noi5e). It has been upvoted to 630.

pbwus,10,2012-02-05,Go-To guide to breaking into the industry. ,DLDude,Themepark,https://www.reddit.com/r/Themepark/comments/pbwus/goto_guide_to_breaking_into_the_industry/,"Hey all! I realize some of you might be interested in working in the industry as you go to and work through college. The industry is a very small, but very tight knit group of people and it's surprising how quickly you can get to know some very important people. I wanted to share my experience in how I and my friends got in. 

In 2007 a good friend and I started a group called the Theme Park Engineering Group at Ohio State (http://themeparkeng.org.ohio-state.edu/). There had never been a group like this before. That November, 3 of us went down to IAAPA (the amusement park convention in Orlando) and gave out business cards. Not for ourselves, but for the group. I think it really turned heads that we were a group dedicated to theme park engineering. We began to work on our own design projects. We designed and built a working 10ft steel version of an S&amp;S power tower. The more we did, the more people seemed to notice. 

Our first big break was when CoasterDynamix (a toy roller coaster company) came to us to work on a new product they didn't have time to develop themselves. Of course, one of the owners of CoasterDynamix also is a partner in The Gravity Group. It wasn't long before we knew most of the people at the Gravity Group. Those guys also know most of the guys at Great Coasters International. Within 2 years we were on a first-name basis with all of them. 

Throughout all of this, we kept going to IAAPA. We made special Theme Park Engineering Group Polos so that we looked together and professional. We met many people in the industry. Roller Coaster engineers, themed attraction engineers, etc etc. We talked to everyone we could. 

The thing about the amusement industry is that a lot of 'geeks', or 'foamers' try to get jobs at the major companies. Companies don't want to hire someone who idolizes the people they would be working with. They want to hire people that are passionate, yet highly professional. Having the Theme Park Engineering Group name behind us gave us that legitimacy. Due to this, we've had quite a bit of success getting into the industry. 

Here is our track record (so far)

I work full time for CoasterDynamix now as a design engineer

The other founder now works full time at Universal Creative

One had an internship last summer with Universal Creative

We've had 2 people intern at Great Coasters International

One guy works full time at The Gravity Group

One guy just got a job at Disney Engineering

Another worked for a whole year (an internship of sorts, but NOT the college program) with Disney Engineering

A girl worked had a 2-year part-time internship with Roto Studio (they do themed designs)

The point is, if you have a level of professionalism, desire, and talent, the industry really isn't as hard to break into as you may think. Sure, you won't be designing coasters your first year out of school, but you can still land REALLY fun jobs. 

There have been a couple colleges that have created Theme Park Engineering Groups that mirror ours at Ohio State. I know Penn State has a fairly developed group. My suggestion if you are in college or are about to go, find one of these groups or start your own. You can contact the Ohio State group if you have any questions while setting it up. 

Just an FYI: If I had to say what the MOST important things to do if you want to get into the industry are, i would say:
#1. Go to IAAPA and be PROFESSIONAL. Have business cards, get business cards. I don't suggest bringing a resume. Contact them later to talk about job opportunities.

pbqyh,5,2012-02-05,Entering Summer Internship With Big 4. Concerns Arising.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/pbqyh/entering_summer_internship_with_big_4_concerns/,"Hey everyone, 

I'm currently in my junior year in college and have accepted an offer with a big 4 firm to participate in their 8 week summer intern program this coming June. At first, I was ecstatic knowing that it's a pretty safe bet that I'll have a full time offer coming out of college and I get to go to freakin Folrida and get paid for it! As I started asking staff what the job was like, I got pretty standard responses ""It's great, I learn something new every day!"". The responses are totally different than what I have read on some accounting forums which sound more like they're being tortured every day. What really concerned me was when I talked to my friend's cousin, who is currently very successful in industry, and she had said that she was cussed out by her manager on the first day as full time staff and every day was a struggle. She left after 2 years.

So my question is, what is it really like working for the big 4? Am I going to be miserable for the rest of my public accounting career? (I'm going assurance in the bay area if this is relevant)

Also it would be great if I could get someone with a lot of experience with big 4 to PM me for an AMA.

Thanks!"
pbha9,7,2012-02-04,"6th semester finance major considering switching majors to computer science, seeking advice",itsalwayslulzy,IndianaUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/pbha9/6th_semester_finance_major_considering_switching/,"Ok, so I'm a finance major in my junior year at IU, and after a summer internship, exploring some different career options, and coming to terms with what I'm going to do for a living, I'm considering switching my major to computer science (or maybe doubling up). I've always been a good student, I've got lots of AP credit, and scored very well on the math part of the SAT. But honestly, I majored in business because I didn't know what to do, and it seemed like a somewhat easier major. I'm not sure if I'm too enthused about the job options in the field and the cocky, macho culture that permeates these business types (in all honesty). I feel like many Kelley students run into feelings like these halfway through school, but have shunned traditional classes for too long to switch. I'm feeling crazy enough to ditch everything and go down a different path.

Well I've always loved computers, and I'm thinking about switching majors to CS. It would definitely add some time to my college career, but I've had a scholarship so far, and honestly don't mind being in school a little longer (even if I have to take on some debt). Finance is alright, and the job prospects are probably decent, but I'd rather do something I really like the rest of my life than something that's.. well... meh. This would be a big change in my life, that I've arrived at after a long heart to heart with my parents and girlfriend. So I figured I'd come to Reddit to get some practical advice. BA vs BS, job prospects, whether I'm full of shit, difficulty, different career paths, etc. And anything about the IU comp sci program specifically is appreciated. Feel free to drop a bomb on me and hit me with any practical advice about a CS major. Thanks in advance :)"

I am a long time lurker here on r/atheism, and thought you guys might find my story interesting. Its a personal account that supports my views on how the church preys on the young, poor, and less intelligent people in our society in order to increase their numbers, and thus, their wallets. As I re-read this vastly cut down story, I realized how much it relates to the definition of the word ""cult"" instead of the word ""christianity."" Before you read this, know that I still love every member of my family dearly despite their role in what happened to my brother. The Christian faith is what they believe in, and theres nothing I can say that will change their faith. 

I grew up with 2 younger brothers, and 2 very loving parents. We were brought up going to church every day, however, we all did what most kids did during church and drew stick figure battles on the bulletins the whole time. We'll call my 2 brothers Bobby and Danny. Bobby is 2 years younger, and Danny is 7 years younger. We had the greatest childhood any kid could ask for. Our father spoiled us with all the coolest nerf guns, our bedtime was much later than any other kid in the neighborhoods, and when N64 came out, we were the first on the block to have it. My father was a successful business owner, and my mother was the stay-at-home mom who gave all of his money to the church. As I got older, I realized what was happening and approached my dad about it, however, she had the ball and chain so tightly wound there was almost nothing I could say to fix the problem. 

I had been in college for 2 years at this point, and was having the time of my life. My mother (the religious fanatic) was upset with me for choosing a public university, however, I told her again and again I chose the school because it had one of the top 5 business schools in America. I was getting straight A's, got a fantastic internship in NYC, and things couldn't have gone any better. Bobby was looking into going to the same school as me, however, once the time to choose schools rolled around he was extremely nervous about getting in. 

Bobby was never the smartest kid in school, however, had the biggest heart in the world. He was the most free spirit of anyone I ever knew. His grades in high school limited his options for college, and my mother decided to practically force him to go to a Christian school in Florida. She used the state of Florida to lure him into schussing a Christian University, since he loved warm weather, the beach, golfing, and everything that state has to offer. He was there for a year, and called me every month to tell me how much he hated it. He told me the people were too religious, and tried to force him into doing things he didn't want to. I called my parents and told them to get him out of there, and that he wasn't happy. My father agreed with me, however, the influence my mother had on him made him useless in helping my aid my little brother. She thought that it wasn't Christianity that was the problem (obviously) but it was his attitude and that the Satan was trying to influence his life. Anytime any of us had a problem, my mother always said to pray about it and read the Bible to us. I told her repeatedly how ineffective this was, and after a number of years finally quit asking my mother for any help regarding emotional issues. Bobby told me he was going to tough it out the rest of the year, then look into transferring without the help of my mother. I encouraged him to do this, however, one day everything changed out of the blue.

It was now my senior year in college, and I had already been offered a position at a top financial firm in NYC. I was so concerned with my own life that I neglected to check up on Bobby a few times a day, but we still talked weekly, and he told me he liked it now at his school and wanted to stay. I asked him if he was sure about this and he assured me he was happy. I assumed that he found some friends that weren't crazy bible pushers, but couldn't have been more wrong. This is where it all gets weird…

I went home for Christmas break and Bobby was not the same person at all. Instead of playing Halo with me and Danny downstairs, he was upstairs reading the Bible. We tried to get him to hang with us, but all he wanted to do was to pray and read the Bible. He no longer was wild and funny like he used to be, all his friends noticed and thought he was brainwashed, and it seemed all his former goals of playing professional soccer and majoring in physical therapy went out the window. I went to my parents and said there was something wrong with Bobby, and he needed to leave that school immediately. My mother, infuriated with me, told me that I was the problem and Bobby was happy. She told me I was the one who had a problem and that it was because I didn't commit my life to God like Bobby has. 

I tried to talk to Bobby numerous times following Christmas break and convince him he was being brainwashed, and that he needed to leave that university immediately. I tried to show him how different he was, and prove to him that the church took advantage of him during a hard time in his life when he was unhappy. I told him that what he was feeling was a misguided euphoria brought on my mass influence, and that if he hadn't have been around so many religious people at once during that time in his life, he never would have gave in like he did. He didn't listen, and my mother did everything in her power to prove to Bobby how unhappy ""I"" was, and that ""I"" was the one who had all the issues. 

Bobby even tried to tell me how I needed to to give my life to God and that I was the one with the problems. I asked him about the youth group he was in down in Florida and how he originally joined it, and the details made me so angry I wanted to kill someone. The way he was recruited reminded me of hell week when I was pledging my college fraternity. He said he was practically abducted from his room, driven somewhere 15 minutes away, and basically told he needed to give his life to God in order for the fear to go away (Gods grace and mercy or something?). I told him that what he went through was similar to cult activity, and that what they were doing was not the same type of Christianity we grew up with. I made him give me the name of his youth group leader, and called him the next day. I threatened him, and told him to leave my little brother alone. He said he would, but apparently Bobby was still going to the church group, and lied to me and told me he wasn't. 

Fast forward to today (2 years later, since there are so many details and I don't want this thread to be much longer). I am currently working in NYC as an Actuary and love every detail of my life. I am happy, make good money, and have a wonderful girlfriend all against the will of my controlling mother. If you knew how awesome my relationship with Bobby was before he became brainwashed….erghhmm…. a Christian, you might tear up seeing how bad it is now. The only conversations we now have are him trying to convert me to his faith. He is constantly asking me and my parents for money to go on ""mission trips"" to exotic countries to tell people about Jesus. He gave up his dream of playing professional soccer, and now is working towards seminary school. He proposed to a girl he has only known a few months, and for whatever reason she said yes. His personality is dull and completely uncharacteristic of his former self, he refuses to do anything ""ungodly"", and he is the biggest financial leech I have ever seen, constantly giving the money my father sends him for food, books, etc. to his church. I can tell he's not happy, but I feel the grasp these people down in Florida have on him is so strong. It almost seems like a forced happiness, and I feel powerless to help being so many states away and him being so far gone. If I had the means to cut him off financially, I would, but sadly I am not in that position. I begged my father to stop paying for his college and to get him out of there, but my mother won't let it happen. I feel like we have nothing in common anymore, and hanging out with him now is like hanging out with a stranger.

Danny and I still play xbox live every Sunday night to stay in touch, and we have remained best friends throughout the whole ordeal (I refer to both my brothers as being my best friend). I still love every member of my family, but hate how my mother has encouraged Bobby's mind to be so badly manipulated. She knew he wasn't the smartest kid to begin with, and I think inadvertently used that to set one of her sons down the path she would be proud of as a Jesus freak. Everything that made Bobby my brother is gone. I understand that people change as they grow up, but this is different.  

Christianity stole my little brother, and my best friend.

pdsli,5,2012-02-06,hair drug test: shaving my ENTire body,throwawaydt444333444,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/pdsli/hair_drug_test_shaving_my_entire_body/,"hey everyone! I wanted to get r/trees input on my hair test strategy, and maybe clear up some of the facts about hair tests and how to beat these damn things. For some background, I've failed a hair test before. I tried using two bottles of the ""miracle shampoo"" from the local head shop, one the night before and one right before the test. When I complained the guy at the head shop said it was my fault because I used it twice and was only supposed to use it once. Whatever. Anyways, I don't smoke much anymore, but did do quite a bit during vacation the week before new years and again during a week in the middle of January. I was also in a room with a lot of smokers this last weekend and felt a bit of a contact high.

I'm beginning the process of applying for jobs, I will graduate with a masters degree in July and my current internship is set to end in June. I've begun sending out applications and already have one company flying me out of state for an interview next week. Question about the process:

*can I safely assume I won't have to submit to a hair test until I accept an offer? like the company that is flying me out next week, they understand I wouldn't be starting until July at the latest, so they wouldn't take me into a lab and test me right after an interview, would they? could they? And I would have every right to stall and say I'm still evaluating other offers, right?

Here is my strategy right now:

*Today, I shaved all of my body hair. I will do this again about a month from today.

*I shave my head on a weekly basis anyway, and will continue doing this until I have a test date set, when I might let it grow out the required 1.5 inches or whatever.

*I'm pretty skinny but have noticed a fair amount of 'winter weight' on my belly. I was going to try to break a sweat running or biking at least 3 times a week beginning now.....I know this is where the THC is stored, so i figured it would help me pass a test and, you know, get healthy and shit.

What do you guys think? The consensus seems to be that these things go back 3 months, but I've heard longer. I'm over the shampoo...any other ideas that would help me feel more confident?"
pdrbz,3,2012-02-06,hair test plan: shaving my ENTire body,throwawaydt22222,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/pdrbz/hair_test_plan_shaving_my_entire_body/,"hey everyone, I wanted to get some advice from r/trees on my plan for passing hair drug tests. I've actually failed a hair test before and was hoping my situation could help get some of the facts straight and get a solid plan heading into a test. I currently intern at a pretty big/ well known company and graduate with a masters degree in July. I'm not a big smoker anymore, but I smoked a fair amount during the week before new years and again during a week in the middle of January. I was also in a room this last weekend with a lot of people smoking and honestly felt a little bit of a contact high. I'm beginning the process of applying for jobs after I graduate, and already have one interview next week- 

*Granted that my current internship ends in June and my graduation won't occur until July, I'm wondering if I can safely assume I wouldn't be asked to take a test before June? 
*Also, since I'm applying for a few different jobs and will hopefully be able to evaluate several different offers, can I assume that I wouldn't be asked to take a test before I actually accepted an offer?

I had a bad experience with the 'miracle shampoo' stuff when I failed before.....I went crazy and bought two bottles, used one the night before and one the day of the test and still failed. When I complained to the head shop that I still failed the test, they said it was my fault because you're only supposed to use one of the bottles before the test (whatever). So my strategy now is this:

*shaved all of my body hair today and will do the same thing a month from today (not much arm/leg hair to begin with so doesn't look conspicuous)
*since I'm a guy and already shave my head once a week anyway, I will continue this, maybe until I get an actual test date then let it grow out a little. 

I've also noticed myself putting on some ""winter-weight"" (I've always been pretty skinny) around the belly and understand these fatty areas are where your body stores thc. I was also going to try to break a solid sweat at least 3 times a week on the stationary bike just to trim down on the fat (and...you know....be healthy and shit).

So what do you think? Consensus seems to be 3 months and your good but I've heard longer....any other tips going into this summer (besides not smoking) that would make me more confident against the evil testing labs?

pdhro,1,2012-02-06,Help. My little sister (22) is locked up at a Christian camp in Arkansas. How do I get her out? ,jesuscamp22,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/pdhro/help_my_little_sister_22_is_locked_up_at_a/,"My younger sister has been enrolled in a faith-based psychological program for troubled girls and young women for about three years. She is 22 years old, was diagnosed as a teenager with bipolar disorder, and has type-1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes -- her extremely poor management of which initially compelled my parents to send her to this place, because the doctor/entrepeneuer who owns it also has a daughter with type-1 diabetes and promised specialized care and intervention. They were also compelled by the Christian framework that situates what the place calls its “bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model” of psychological intervention, since they believe that only the healing power of Christ can cure my sister of her penchant for making bad decisions. These decisions include her mistreatment of, or plain disregard for, the insulin therapy she needs to survive; her tendency to get involved in romantic relationships with deadbeat dickheads who treat her poorly and take advantage of her, financially, physically, and emotionally; and the numerous occasions on which she has stolen money from my parents, always in rather clumsy ways, that is, in ways that ensure she will be caught. The original plan, as I understand it, was for my sister to spend the estimated 120-180 days in treatment at this camp in rural Arkansas (at an truly outrageous cost), and then to enroll in a certificate program at a design institute. This was the deal: go through the program, get yourself right, and we (parents) will send you to L.A. to pursue your dreams etc. As I said, this was around three years ago. About nine months ago she finally “graduated” from the seven-step program, but moved on to a low-paying internship at the very same place (and under strict supervision and extremely restricted freedoms) which she held until a few weeks ago. At this point, she was discovered to have been once again skipping her insulin injections, and also she bought some CDs instead of paying for her car insurance, or something, and the psychiatrist in charge of the whole place, and a few other places like it, ordered that she be run through the whole program again, for a second time, complete with regular checks from my parents to the tune of about $6,000 per month. The details of the whole situation are really quite vague. This is the biggest problem. Even when she was on the payroll, she was only allowed to speak on the phone once a week, and even then only to my parents. She could receive letters from approved immediate family (like myself) until this new turn of events, so I am completely cut off from all communication with her. She wrote recently, just before her letter-writing privileges were suspended, and asked if she could come live with me for a while; the answer, of course, was yes, but she will not receive my reply. Technically, there is nothing “keeping” her at this place – in the strictly legal sense of unlawful detention – and supposedly she could sign herself out and walk away at any time. “Walking away” here means literally walking about 10 miles to the closest pay phone, but also walking away from my parents and their money, and from three years of religious indoctrination. My impulse is to drive to Arkansas and go pick her up, but there are major practical constraints here: most importantly, health care (which she will need to survive), and the fact that she has been on some serious head medications like Ziprazidone (an anti-psychotic, also used to treat bipolar disorder) that really need to be gradually suspended.

Now, I could enumerate the hundreds of reasons why I think this whole therapeutic model is terrible and violent and offensive, but the main reason is that it attempts to “treat” troubled people by teaching them how to internalize a repressive, odious religious narrative, all while exploiting gullible dogmatists like my parents who they know will raise no objections because to do so would be to compromise their faith in Jesus. Worst of all, I am fairly certain that, like my parents, these people truly believe that they mean well, and that they are doing a necessary good. So what do I do? What can I do?"

pdaht,2,2012-02-06,Help. My little sister (22) is locked up at a Christian camp in Arkansas. How do I get her out?,[deleted],athiesm,https://www.reddit.com/r/athiesm/comments/pdaht/help_my_little_sister_22_is_locked_up_at_a/,"My younger sister has been enrolled in a faith-based psychological program for troubled girls and young women for about three years.  She is 22 years old, was diagnosed as a teenager with bipolar disorder, and has type-1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes -- her extremely poor management of which initially compelled my parents to send her to this place, because the doctor/entrepeneuer who owns it also has a daughter with type-1 diabetes and promised specialized care and intervention.  They were also compelled by the Christian framework that situates what the place calls its “bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model” of psychological intervention, since they believe that only the healing power of Christ can cure my sister of her penchant for making bad decisions.  These decisions include her mistreatment of, or plain disregard for, the insulin therapy she needs to survive; her tendency to get involved in romantic relationships with deadbeat dickheads who treat her poorly and take advantage of her, financially, physically, and emotionally; and the numerous occasions on which she has stolen money from my parents, always in rather clumsy ways, that is, in ways that ensure she will be caught.  The original plan, as I understand it, was for my sister to spend the estimated 120-180 days in treatment at this camp in rural Arkansas (at an truly outrageous cost), and then to enroll in a certificate program at a design institute.  This was the deal: go through the program, get yourself right, and we (parents) will send you to L.A. to pursue your dreams etc. As I said, this was around three years ago. About nine months ago she finally “graduated” from the seven-step program, but moved on to a low-paying internship at the very same place (and under strict supervision and extremely restricted freedoms) which she held until a few weeks ago.  At this point, she was discovered to have been once again skipping her insulin injections, and also she bought some CDs instead of paying for her car insurance, or something, and the psychiatrist in charge of the whole place, and a few other places like it, ordered that she be run through the whole program again, for a second time, complete with regular checks from my parents to the tune of about $6,000 per month.  The details of the whole situation are really quite vague.  This is the biggest problem.  Even when she was on the payroll, she was only allowed to speak on the phone once a week, and even then only to my parents.  She could receive letters from approved immediate family (like myself) until this new turn of events, so I am completely cut off from all communication with her.  She wrote recently, just before her letter-writing privileges were suspended, and asked if she could come live with me for a while; the answer, of course, was yes, but she will not receive my reply.  Technically, there is nothing “keeping” her at this place – in the strictly legal sense of unlawful detention – and supposedly she could sign herself out and walk away at any time.  “Walking away” here means literally walking about 10 miles to the closest pay phone, but also walking away from my parents and their money, and from three years of religious indoctrination.  My impulse is to drive to Arkansas and go pick her up, but there are major practical constraints here: most importantly, health care (which she will need to survive), and the fact that she has been on some serious head medications like Ziprazidone (an anti-psychotic, also used to treat bipolar disorder) that really need to be gradually suspended. 
 
Now, I could enumerate the hundreds of reasons why I think this whole therapeutic model is terrible and violent and offensive, but the main reason is that it attempts to “treat” troubled people by teaching them how to internalize a repressive, odious religious narrative, all while exploiting gullible dogmatists like my parents who they know will raise no objections because to do so would be to compromise their faith in Jesus.  Worst of all, I am fairly certain that, like my parents, these people truly believe that they mean well, and that they are doing a necessary good.  So what do I do?  What can I do?"
pfdd0,0,2012-02-07,So I write a nasty email every two months to this guy.... ,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/pfdd0/so_i_write_a_nasty_email_every_two_months_to_this/,"Once every two months, I send out a vile email to a person who used to teach a sophmore level english class at a major university in the South (US).  Sending that email is the highlight of that day for me, and at times of stress, of that week.

The guy wasn't a real professor, just a Teacher's Assistant.  I was doing great, but he failed me because I forgot to put a quote in my paper in quotations; without the """" signs it came across as blatant plagarism.  I begged him to reconsider my honest mistake but nothing came of it.  I was on academic probation already (i had a rare dyslexic condition which doesn't allow me to learn the same way most people do, but i wasn't diagnosed back then..hence the bad grades), and failing this class was the last straw.  The TA never admitted to any wrong doing, while knowing my situation.  I'll never forget the smirk on his face when the dean made his decision (he took his TA's side) and the university booted me out, stripped me of financial aid for a year.

I was holding down two jobs and an unpaid internship at the time, while taking care of my sick father and younger brother.  He passed away soon after I got kicked out and my world went spiralling down.  I became a recluse, alone and felt like a failure for a whole year before I got my act back together.  I went to a local community college.  Got my jobs back, and also started putting my little brother through college.

I am now a distinguished film maker, and had I been weaker in the mind, would have comitted suicide instead.  So I email this guy with the most vile things imaginable ever two months to remind him that his smallest action, due to his ego, could have had a major negative impact on the lives of my baby brother and other family.

Moral, don't be ego centric.  Don't take life too strictly.  If someone makes a small mistake by accident, don't go too hard on them.  But don't let anyone abuse you.  And if they do, make sure you TELL them that.

peu6x,0,2012-02-07,"Girlfriend broke up with me, I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to now.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/peu6x/girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_i_feel_like_i_dont/,"Hey Reddit,

I’m mostly doing this because at the moment, I feel like I dont have any other people to talk to. My girlfriend broke up with me over the weekend and I’m still having a hard time with it (obviously). Prior to all of this everything was going pretty normal for our relationship. Granted we were doing the long distance thing but we’ve been together in a serious relationship for 3+ years. We basically lived together for a year till I moved back home to pursue audio engineering. We seen each other almost at least once a month since I’ve done that whether it be the weekend or over a week long visit. This girl was the girl that I really thought I would marry and spend the rest of my life with.

The week leading up to the Friday that this happened was very different than usual. I knew she had a busy schedule coming up so every time she would blow me off by saying she was “too busy” I didn’t think a lot of it. But it got to the point where I decided to tell her that we would just talk on Friday since it was the end of the week and we both weren’t busy then. Deep down I could feel we were going to have an argument about something.

Friday came along and we finally got to talking and right away I could hear it in her voice, something that was really going to tear me up was about to happen. When the words came out of her mouth of her telling me she wanted to break up and be single for a while, I don’t even know, it was one of the worst feelings I’ve ever felt. 

To turn the next 7 hours that we talked about it short. She basically is doing this because she feels we are going down separate paths. She has always been in honors classes through high school and is currently going to ASU doing a double major in Psychology and English and is doing a LGBT research study. Me on the other hand, I made mistakes in high school and ended up having to finish it in an independent studies program. I went to the Conservatory of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, an audio engineering specific school in Arizona. Lived out there for a year and moved back to California to pursue and internship at a studio. Being 21, I’ve never had a “real” job which is something I regret, but plan on changing that in the coming weeks. Anyway, because of that, she explained that she had been thinking a lot these past few weeks that she has felt unsatisfied with this relationship in that, we're not on the same page with compatibility on motivation and working and goals in our life. She wants to be single for a while and do things independently and wants me to figure things out and do things for myself. She says she doesn't want to be with anyone else and doesn't plan on anything and that she still loves me and doesnt want to lose me. We've spent way too long building this relationship, to just throw it away over something that I honestly believe can be figured out. She doesn't want it figured out together. I've explained many times that we can do this independently and together at the same time. 

She’s tried to convince me that in addition to doing this for herself, she’s doing this BECAUSE of how much she cares about me. As of right now, I told her to take the rest of the month to let things sink in for the both of us and we’ll talk some time around then. She has non refundable tickets to fly out here in March, I really want her to come out here then to see if we can talk things out in person because all of this happened over the phone.
I have to at least try a little bit to save something I feel very confident would still work. I understand a lot of the concerns she has but I think she’s being overly logical about them and not feeling what overall makes her happy. She has been my closest friend for 5 years. I can’t just let go. "
pe3ru,15,2012-02-06,"The Love of Ownership: Chapter 9, Work",notjustathowaway,BDSMerotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/comments/pe3ru/the_love_of_ownership_chapter_9_work/,"I woke up horny, not surprising as the toy in my pussy gave the feeling of there being something inside me, which I loved, but it wasn't stimulating, which was making me frustrated. The longer I wore it, the more I regretted complaining like that. I knew my punishment was deserved, but I hated it anyway. After getting ready I knelt next to the door, waiting for Master to finish the breakfast I had made for Him. He ate quickly and took my leash off the table, clipping it on me, then walking out the front door. He then turned to the left, forcing me to conceal a sigh of relief. Master usually took the bus to work, which was down the street to the right, but his truck was just to the left. I was happy that he had the decency to not parade me around on the bus. Most people didn't care, and some who rode the bus with master often knew about our relationship, but I didn't want to publicly share the fact that I was being paraded around on a leash while in a low cut blouse and pencil skirt.

Master drove quickly to work and pulled into His reserved spot at the company. He was the founder and CEO of His small software company, which allowed Him certain privileges, such as a reserved spot and twenty four hour access to the building. He used His access privileges to open the building and usher me in. The security guard at the desk smiled at Master and called out across the lobby. ""Hey, Boss, I didn't know it was bring your pet to work day, I would have brought mine!"" I recognized his voice immediately. It was Lee, a nice guy a little older than Master, whom We had met at one of the BDSM events we go to on occasion. His pet, Alex and I had hit it off, and we started hanging out in casual setting. When the electronics store that Lee worked at went under, Master had offered him a security desk job working for Master's company. Master had given him identical hours with better pay and benefits, so Lee was very grateful, and always acted professional when others were around, but when it was just the two of them, with or without me, they were much more relaxed.

""Nah, Lee, pet here got in trouble last night, so she's getting desk duty today."" 

""Alright, Boss, I'll give you the early light if someone comes in for you.""

""Thanks, Lee.""

""My pleasure, Sir."" I winced at Lee calling Master 'Sir,' That was my title for Him. I knew my jealousy was unfounded, as anyone could be called 'Sir' but when it was my Master, I wanted to be the only one to use it.

With Lee also being in the community, it allowed Master a little bit of extra piece of mind, as Lee would alert Master long before His secretary would, allowing Him to conceal me and refocus on business. There were only three people who worked for master that knew His secret, and all of them were salary, and I'm sure could get away with murder as long as Master was in charge.

We were in the elevator when Master spoke again. ""I just got a message from the man I had a Eleven o'clock with, apparently he's picked up a bug, and won't be able to make it today, which means that you will belong to me all day.""

I knew that meant he would be spending the day at his desk. Master normally worked in the trenches with the rest of his team, but on occasion would take a day to work on the more corporate side of his company, so him spending all day hidden in the office wouldn't arouse suspicion.

We walked in and he unlocked his office, leading me inside. His preference for modern style wasn't shown in this room, as he had decided to go with a steam punk theme. He ushered me under the strong oak desk, and attached my collar to a short chain hanging under the desk, he wound up my leash and stashed it in the hidden compartment under the desk. Master had a fondness for concealment, so it didn't surprise me that when he opened the drawer under his desk and fiddled with some unseen controls, I heard the hissing of steam and the hum of motors. I knew the steam was entirely for effect, but the hums came from the three monitors and a computer that were expertly hidden inside this desk. It had taken Master almost a year to complete the desk, but once completed, it was quite the work of art.

He then unzipped his pants and let his shaft flop out before beginning to work on his computer.

I knew what my job was, and out of fear of reprimand, I began to play with his pulsing meat. With my hands bound behind me I could only use my mouth, trying to slowly tease Master's shaft to hardness. The stiffer He got, the easier it was for me to slowly fellate Him. I could hear Him surfing the net above me, going through His daily websites, watching His Tuesday videos, then with a sigh I heard Him click over to actual work. Now He was typing away on some spreadsheet, probably a financial document. Either way, I could tell He was close, so I readied myself, brought my soft pallet up and took His full length into my throat. Swallowing softly I could feel Him grunt as I sucked the orgasm directly from His rod.

He came hard in my throat, His hot sperm coating my insides as it dripped into my stomach. I had to resist the gag reflex that appeared as His cock pulsed in my mouth. I slowly brought my head up, His tip now sitting on my tongue. I lapped at any cum that hadn't poured down my throat, and slowly cleaned my spittle and His cum off of His softening cock.

At this point, I wanted so badly to cum, my legs futilely rubbing together, hoping that somehow I could steal some pleasure from the evil device inside me.

He sighed with His orgasm, not seeming to take His attention off of the computer. I unintentionally whimpered lightly. I didn't like to be ignored, and hated even more when my hard work wasn't recognized. Seeming to hear me, even over the music He had been playing, He finished a line of text and reached under the table, stroking my cheek lightly before going back to work on His computer. I hummed happily, nuzzling into the side of His knee.

The rest of the day continued in such a fashion, Master occasionally pushing His meat against my cheek, me pleasuring him to orgasm, cleaning Him off and then laying back against His knee.

Suddenly I heard a knock on Master's office door. He called the person in. ""Here you go sir, an order of the general, a side order of fried rice, and two sides of pot stickers, plus a large mountain dew and a large sprite.""

It was one of the interns, he didn't seem to be questioning why Master got two drinks. They had been trained well to follow orders and only ask questions if it would make them smarter or more efficient.

He left quickly, probably to deliver food to the other employees. Master set the take out box full of pot stickers in front of me. He knew that the ten pot stickers would be more than enough for me, and he set one of the sodas next to it, leaving the straw in easy reach of my mouth.

This brought me to the assumption that I wasn't going to be eating with my hands so I thanked him quietly and picked up one of the pot stickers, finding it surprising easy to eat without my hands.

The rest of the day was uneventful until we headed home. Master used the back elevator this time, which meant no one saw us slip out, Master leading me out on the leash."
pgl0d,0,2012-02-08,Hi r/food - an interesting app for you and hoping you can help me :),raaaargh_stompy,food,https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/pgl0d/hi_rfood_an_interesting_app_for_you_and_hoping/,"Hi Guys, 

Firstly full disclosure, I work with Foodtree (well I am an intern here) and I am telling you about this because I'd like your help.

That said everything about this is free and should actually be of interest to the the food community!

We made an app that lets you tag pictures you take of food to the places you bought them or ate them (restaurant or store), as WELL as the places the food came from originally (if you know it) - the idea is to build a big map of where all the food we eat is coming from, and to be able to use some social networking to track down places to buy fresh seasonable and local things.

So all that said - I was hoping some of you guys would try it out for us? We are a super small company and literally every user is exciting to us! :D In particular we are trying a data experiment centered around Whole Foods Stores in North America... if you happen to live near by one, and could take the time to install our free app and go take some pictures of food - any food - there it would help us so much.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

We have been dating for 3 years, half of which has been long distance.

Since we both went off to college it has been a little rough on our relationship but we always pulled through.  Right before I went off to college this semester we had a really bad fight, she said it was her breaking point but like always we worked it out and we made up.  She then goes off to an internship that she received at a theme park near Orlando. We continued talking, not as often because she is busier but nonetheless still talking.  After about a month in she tells me we need to talk, I try not to think too much of it, but then she tells me that since she is there she doesn’t want to have any regrets and that we should go on a break/breakup.  I didn’t really take the news that well, I didn’t yell I just became very sad and we sort of talked it out to the point that I “accepted” it. Then we talked the next day, she says she still cares about me and that she loves me but she just wants to be friends. She also continued to say she was confused and that she has never had these feelings(I quote “more than attractive but I could see myself dating feelings”)  for other guys.  I’m trying to be as nice as possible towards the whole things but it is tearing me up inside, I don’t know how long I can keep it up.  I honestly don’t know what to do, I’m very lost. I know this might sound childish and I should just move on but I am not ready to lose her this easily but I also want her to experience whatever she is going through now just in case we do get back together she won’t want to go through this again. I keep reminding myself this is actually happening.  I’ve never felt this sad. I just feel I had something so great and now its gone.

Also before any of this happened I already bought tickets to go down for a week, I’m still planning on going down but what should I do? 

I guess my main question is, how should I go about keeping her in my life with a possibility of getting back together afterwards.  Should I try and go down next weekend?



**TL;DR**

GF went to internship for 8 months, month in she wants to go on break/breakup, sending very confusing signals. I still want to be with her, what should I do?

I'll try to answer questions the best I can, I do have class today, so I'll try my best. Thanks in advance."

Why even take the time to do something like this, and Lehr Thing praised the order of intern knighthood and slayeth the dragons queen and children for the uttering of cute phrases and fire breath or bathing in the blood of Hollywood’s younger brother, curiously named, Uncle Phil who lives beneath a tree in an elf village playing old metal records and smoking dust by himself, always out of weed, always asking for money, somehow always stoned the remembering what the firemen did for us on that day the government took over the news media and doctored those shots of planes hitting buildings on live television, in an attempt to convince our nation that we should go to war with Italy, as pizza was of course the holiest of imports and yet the sluttiest of exploitation. Gal Scal then remarked the Airwave ranger that Gilgamor wanted his future schlockeds by the eternal order of bite my cheese the intern dispelling the toxic gas amongst the people who were all busy trying to remember why no one was catching fire, being of course that they are all water, and water is hydrogen and oxygen, both of which are extremely flammable and lovable and certainly the not the first love of an extraterrestrial homophobe name Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Ron paul who begat Rand Paul who when reversed begat Ron Paul who begat Rand paul who when reversed begat Glenn Becketh.
Slick spoke:  “Of course when the great number collides with the paradox of old we find ourselves contemplating the Great equation.  Which is of course.  9/11:11-42012 multiplied by 666 and divided by Saturn (plus satan) = Everything is Terrible"
pfwv3,8,2012-02-08,5 Weeks in and feelin' fine.,ChronicElectronic,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pfwv3/5_weeks_in_and_feelin_fine/,"Hello Everyone,

I'm currently a little over 5 weeks into what I originally thought would be an extended break. I'm seriously considering quitting for good, but I haven't decided for sure. I took a 3 month break last year in order to be able to pass drug tests while getting an internship. I hope to go for at least 6 months, then decide where to go from there.

The catalyst for this break was failing two classes and going on academic probation. I've generally been able to get by in school (my GPA is just over 3.0). I decided I needed a break to make sure I don't go on AP again and risk some really bad consequences. After a few weeks when my head got clear I did some thinking. I realized that I can't remember the last time I really put my full effort into my studies. I used to blame this completely on weed, but I realize now that I was just using that as an excuse. Although, it sure is easier to motivate myself to focus on classes when I'm not smoking. This quarter I actually turned an assignment in early. Where as last quarter I was failing to turn in assignments altogether.

Besides improvements in my classes, I've restarted my meditation practice, finally got around to brewing my first batch of beer, and I'm even trying out vegetarianism. 

I'm surprised at my will power, seeing as that I live with 6 pot smokers, of which two deal and one grows.  I know I can stay strong through the end of the quarter, but once its over I may struggle to continue with my break. Hopefully the positive changes I'm making in my life are enough to motivate me to quit once and for all.

Peace and Love."

I am going to be moving to Seattle for the summer for an internship at Amazon. I have been looking for somewhere to live online, but have not been able to find anything satisfactory.
Does anyone know of any resources I can use to find somewhere furnished to live for those 3 months? My budget is $1000/month up to $1400 (but I would prefer to stay around $1000)
Also any suggestions are where to live?
Amazon is located in South Lake Union, and I would like to be able to walk/bike there.
Based on what I've read so far, I have been looking for places to live in SLU, Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, and Belltown.
Thanks!"
piasx,12,2012-02-09,"Gentlefolk, I could use some advice.",Esuka,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/piasx/gentlefolk_i_could_use_some_advice/,"[](/takealetter) A little background first. I'm a 3rd year a california uni, studio arts major. I am a game designer, I have a title up on XBLA, another completed project, and a title we are hoping to get on Steam within the next few months. Unfortunately, my school (the school of the arts, not the uni) does not lend much... any support to my field, but I managed with the Video Game Development Club, of which I act as an officer. I spent a quarter studying abroad, and the overall experience was incredible. I came back from a month of traveling, having survived on my own, feeling pretty confident. 

[](/cheerilee) Still with me? Awesome. So here's the problem. In a nutshell, there isn't enough time. I can divide my time into 3 basic categories: Entertainment, schoolwork, and career/resume work. Again, because my classes have very little overlap with my field, I have to build my resume largely on my own. And yes, drawing ponies counts as entertainment. I love it, I love sharing them, and I'm not about to stop, but I can't really use it. 

[](/lunagasp) And in one month, GDC, one of the largest gatherings of game and software developers in the world, is being held at its annual location in San Fransisco. If you want to be a developer, it's urged that you go. If you are one, your company will sometimes cover you going. It's important. But I look at what I have for my resume, and I don't feel like anyone will buy it. Yes, I've completed projects, which is a step above a lot of people in my position, but it's not enough of a step to compensate for the lack of expertise I have in sheer technical skill. Even though going to GDC with the singular intention of getting a job is likely to fail, the contacts you make there will often be considering new interns and employees. 

[](/derpwizard) Sorry folks, almost done. Now, I can go, focus purely on making contacts, and bolster my resume and my portfolio as hard as I can for next year, but there's a final issue. GDC takes place during the end of my school term. Being an art student, most of my finals are in the last week of class rather than the dedicated finals week. And even though the number of classes I'm taking is lighter, all of them have more out of class work. If I go to GDC, I have little doubt that my grades will suffer for it. So here's the question folks:

**tl;dr**: Do I accept a slump in my grades in favor of strengthening my resume and my job prospects, or do I finish out college knowing I'll have a harder time finding a job?
And for the record, obviously my entertainment time will take a hit, but I can't give all of it up or I'll go nuts. Thanks for your time, folks.

*edit 1* So I consulted schedules a bit, and I have to revise my previous statement. My grades wouldn't suffer, they'd be shot. I have an exam worth 30% of my grade in one class, and it's the final week to work on a project for another. I can't get a makeup on the exam.

*edit 2 because it seems edit 2 didn't get saved* Thanks all for writing in. Seeing so many people say ""go to GDC"" makes it hard to admit that, despite my desires, I don't think I will be able to attend. Between the dip in cash and the poor class results I know I would receive, I just don't see a way I can manage it this year. Frankly, looking at this in a bigger perspective, I'm thinking GDC is only the tip of my problem iceberg. I'm going to have to reorganize how I approach my future, mostly on timetables and finances. 

This whole thing has left me in rather poor spirits, so I'll stop here. Thank you again for your time, and I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to more of you in a timely manner. Class permitted me only a quick glance every hour or so. [Have a good night.](http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-hugs-for-everypony.gif)

I'm a 20 year old web developer (PHP/MySQL) with several years of experience.  I'm currently working as the lead web developer at a local web-based accounting firm.

I'm interested in coming to the UK for the summer for an internship, and I see that in order to get a work visa I need to already have a company willing to ""sponsor"" me.

Does anybody have any suggestions for how I might find myself a sponsor?  I've applied to a few companies that I already know about that I'd like to intern with, but I don't really know what else to do.

Thanks in advance!"
pjs84,10,2012-02-10,"S08E14 Review ""All You Need Is Love""",Phlexonance,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/pjs84/s08e14_review_all_you_need_is_love/,"The episode starts off with **Mer and Derek** not finding any space where they can have sex since Zola is reunited with them (and Mer's house has always some extra people, i.e. Lexie).

**Lexie** passive aggressively offers to babysit Zola on Valentine's Day (yet she couldn't babysit her for 20 minutes to let Mer &amp; Derek *have at it*).
Merek don't fall for her passive aggressive trap (and they probably don't have time to discuss Lexi's existential issues during breakfast). Although it's kinda cold to show absolutely no interest in her issues. She's conflicted because of Mark and has surely been giving out signals of distress for weeks.
Passive aggression continues with an uninvited lie towards Mark (who by the way should finally take a hint).

The woman who's boyfriend died and who complained that he didn't propose to her for 8 years was a hint to women to sometimes disregard tradition and initiate themselves. Yelling at your SO to propose to you is **r i d i c u l o u s**.    
Anyway, she was also the plot device to give Lexie courage to finally talk to Mark (the locket was the last drop).

She finally went over to Mark's but Avery is there. :D
Impossible situation for her but I think Mark finally got it and something should happen next episode (the writers have been yanking our chains for too long regarding Lexie+Mark).

Mer insensitively complains about her sexlife to **Christina** who's too proud to fight for her marriage. Kinda gives away how self absorbed she is.
Christina tries to get into a conversation with **Owen** by indirect topics (i.e. work); he doesn't want to deal with her as he's already given up on the relationship. (Rightfully so, as Christina has not shown any empathy towards him for a long time).   
Then Owen tackles Christina away from a car which would have hit her (*inside* the hospital; yeah, pretty contrived plot element). This is supposed to remind her of his selflessness (he was there for her after the hospital shooting and decided to put her not wanting to have kids over his desire for kids, so that they can continue the relationship.

Later on he tells her he's going to move out, at least temporarily, not even looking for her reaction (or maybe trying to hide his own).   
She's visibly shaken. I don't know what she expected from her approach (i.e. pretending not to care).

**Richard** plays the good guy again, watching out for the *little people*'s feelings (i.e. April and Lexie) yet showing disregard for Owen's crumbling marriage.

The ""stupid intern guy"" hilariously asked ""So anybody got any Valentine's plans?"" in an OR with Christina, Owen and **Teddy** xD

Owen asks Teddy to be his friend again since he really needs someone to talk to and she lashes out at him for putting the needs of the hospital above her own. Somewhat strange, considering that they both have been in the military and it's pretty clear that additional people would have died had he told her about her husband.
Stellar performance on Kim's part btw.

Teddy vented to **Christina** and that's when Christina started to feel empathy for Owen again. She realized that he even went to Teddy (of all people) in search for someone to talk to.
Maybe because he was there for her after the shootings and always made compromises and became the ChoR, she started seing him as this perfect godlike man who *has* to be perfect.   
Now he's back in his ventilation room and she remembers his fragility which is what brought them together in the first place.   
Mer's monologue in that scene: ""And sometimes all we need to do to ease the pain, is call a simple truce"".         
Now that Christina is feeling empathy for Owen again, they have a chance.   

You probably noticed this earlier but I have to write it down at least once:    
**Alex** is good with kids because his parents weren't present and he had two younger siblings.

**Miranda** performs another display of insecurity: she expected Ben would break up with her because she wasn't on time (what the hell?) and he was fantastic as always.

In case you're wondering where the review for S08E13 is: it was a filler episode.

pj33b,4,2012-02-10,Help! I don't know what to do anymore.. :(,Honiahaka12,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/pj33b/help_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Le sigh. I've been dealing with my dog for about 9 months now, which isn't a LONG time but it's long enough to get some kind of training down with a dog.

Here's the sitch. Back in 2012 Summer I adopted a coonhound from out vet school. She was one of the dogs that the vet students get to poke/prod/experiment on to get good enough to be a pro. They don't mistreat them or anything, but it is a sad life IMO. So I went to meet all the dogs and picked her out because something just ""clicked"". 

When I adopted her, she came with all shots and even the paperwork of what had been done to her. Apparently before she was their vet dog, she worked at a prison. She was being trained to hunt down prisoners and attack them, but she failed the test because she was gun shy (she curls up in a yelping heap at the sound of one being fired).

So I take her in and in the first few months she's learned tricks such as ""sit"", ""paw"", ""stay"" (kinda), ""high five"".. and other cute dog tricks. Everything was going good until she learned how to get out of our fenced backyard for the first time (about 2 months after I've had her). I was angry at the time and chased her all throughout the neighborhood. I would call her and she would stop, look at me and then run away again. It pissed me off to no end, but I never called her with an angry tone and I never raised my voice in an angry manner because I wanted her to come to me.

When she FINALLY came to me, on her terms and not mine.. I praised her through gritted teeth. Even though I wanted to beat the shit out of her (which I would never do.. but it's still tempting).. she would wag her tail and we would go on our merry way. I'd patch the hole and everything would be fine. Then she would get out again and do the same thing, and again I would be totally ""happy"" that she came back to me.

This is what's happened the last 9 months or so. It's always been a problem.. but what am I supposed to do?

It's a bigger problem now.

I currently have an internship at a horse breeding farm and my dog has to come with me. Otherwise she's left at home in a kennel for 12 hours and I would feel terrible for that. She's great on a leash and listens to me, when on a leash. There have been two times that she's gotten out of the office that we stay in. Once it was my fault for not making sure the door latched, but tonight it was solely her. She pushed the door opened with her nose and took off into the night.

This pisses me off to no end because I went out after her and called her name, she stopped and looked at me. I called her over and said, ""Hey Rollie! Come here!"" with a big smile and a chipper voice. She took one look at me, stepped towards me.. and then turned tail and ran the other way into one of the pastures. It infuriates me when she does this.

This wouldn't a big deal (just a headache), except we have coyotes/hogs/deer/wild dogs/bobcats and other predators that come after smaller prey.. like a domestic dog. Eventually she comes back to me, which is amazing.. but I can't have her running around like that.
She also has a terrible habit of getting into the horse pastures and barking at them, she won't chase them or hurt them.. just barks. Anyone that knows anything about horses would know that this can send some of them into a frenzy and into a fence really quick. The horses that are being bred here are racing horses. These horses, on average, range between 100,000-400,000 dollars. Especially the pregnant mares that they have.

My internship boss has already warned me that if a horse gets hurt at my dogs expense, then I'm the one to blame and I'll be in a lot of trouble. Which is what I expect really. I wouldn't want some animal chasing down my prized horses.

I know I can leave her at home, but it breaks my heart. My roommates also don't like that she howls while she's in her kennel.

So here I am, on Reddit. Does anyone have any tricks or something that I can use to help her learn to come when called and to stay by my side without a leash on her?

The ones that I've tried are being really ""happy"" when they come over, give them a treat and tell them what a good dog they are. Another is the shock collar.. but I don't know how she'll react and they are a bit pricey. I don't want to make a purchase and have her not respond the right way. Another thing about shock collars that worries me is that some people say it causes a distrust between the dog and owner? She already hides and whimpers when I give her a swat on the bottom for doing things like digging in the trash.

The thought crossed my mind tonight, just to give her to a no kill shelter and get a good dog. I don't want to do that.. but what else can I do?

Help please? My dog is broken and I don't know what to do to fix her. :("

pl4jy,3,2012-02-11,Long Distance Dump and I Feel Like a Chump,dumpedandthrownaway,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/pl4jy/long_distance_dump_and_i_feel_like_a_chump/,"Hey there r/breakups. I've been a bit reticent to speak my mind about what's been ailing me, as it pales in comparison to what so many of you are going through, but in some capacity I feel that much worse for feeling so terrible about this situation...So, I guess I'm really just here to vent/seek impartial advice regarding coping strategies.  

Anyway, I'm a 26 y/o male who is studying out of the country for two years.   Prior to leaving for my first semester I met a girl (also 26) who was a co-worker.  She and I got along swimmingly.  Any time we were hanging out, it was always a blast, and it was fairly obvious that we both had crushes on each other. We finally hooked up before I left, but it was obviously a day late and a dollar short.  So, we continued to communicate every now and again via facebook messages, and it always brightened my day a little bit (I think it's important to note at this point that I think she was kind of seeing someone, although I'm not sure. I didn't really ask). Fast forward four months, I come home and we start hanging out much more frequently, and things really start to develop into something more meaningful.  

So, August rolls around and I had to leave for school again; at this point I'm unbearably sad. I was leaving my friends and family for four months again and I really felt that our relationship (not in the 'official' sense, as we weren't technically together) was simply not strong enough to survive four months of such separation.  But, lo and behold, we continued talking every day on the phone and online.  It sounds really lame, but this really impressed me.  Neither one of us necessarily had to do it, but we wanted to, and it seemed that things might actually work out. So, I spent all of this time becoming emotionally devoted/attached to the girl.

Then around mid-October or so she calls out of the blue and says ""I don't know what you expect when you get home...Things may get messy."" I respond ""well, I don't want to be so presumptuous as to say I EXPECT anything (lying like a rug) but I hope for the best for us, and that we'll be fine."" The next day she implored me to forget that whole thing ever happened.  

So, I come home in mid-December. The past two weeks she had been kind of strange. and I felt that she was trying to distance herself from me. She also had backed out of a trip to come pick me up (one of her friends canceled), and so I had been kind of having weird feelings toward her for it. I get home and I see a message ""are you home?!?"" ""Is there a number where I can reach you?""  So I didn't want to totally give up on the situation...Maybe she's just nervous? I don't know. I hadn't liked a girl this consistently for a long time, and I didn't want to give up that easy. Anyway, I talk to her a day or two later and she's just weird. So I did the manly thing and texted her 'I'm really ambivalent about hanging out because I don't know how you're feeling. what's been going on the past few weeks?'  ""I've been ambivalent too. I started dating someone, so I thought it might be awkward.  I should have told u (sic) sooner.""

I told her I was hurt and I felt like a big dumbass and that's about all I have to say.  She sent me a message back and I didn't even read it. Deleted from facebook, hit the gym, and literally lawyered up (as I had gotten in an accident while I was all screwed up about it that day). Two weeks later it's the day after my birthday and she texts ""happy belated birthday."" and I say ""hey, thanks buddy. I am kind of glad you texted because I kind of wanted to eat crow for being so pissy the other day. Hope your internship goes well."" And I felt so good in that moment. Then she seemed to be intentionally cold to me: ""well, I just wanted to say happy birthday."" I didn't respond. She then asked when I was leaving and if I wanted to hang out before then. I declined. I feel like I handled things as I should have, and I guess part of what I need is affirmation of that from someone impartial.

Anyway, this all happened like a month and a half/two months ago, and I just feel that my response has been disproportionate to the scenario.  I've dealt with a breakup from a (much more meaningful) 3.5 year relationship where the breakup literally lasted 4 years (talk about messy) so I thought this would be a walk in the park. However, it hasn't been. I wake up early in the morning/middle of the night, sometimes thinking of her and just thinking 'how could she do me like that?' She was someone I really trusted to not do me wrong. Sometimes I just spend all day feeling alone and miserable even when I'm hanging out with friends. I have many of the typical signs of depression. I have found that it gets better and worse, but I thought I would certainly be over it by now; it seems that it is worse than it was when I first left home.

I haven't actually seen the girl in like 6 months, and I have no idea how anyone can have such an effect on me. I think that a lot of it had to do with the feeling of loss of control over the situation; she made this decision unilaterally without talking to me, and there was nothing I could do but get her out of my life. I still have this awful idea that I want to talk to her or something. I also feel incredibly selfish for not accepting the fact that her relationship now is probably making her happier than being with someone so far away.

tl;dr: Guy leaves country for four months, comes back to find his love interest is not so interested in him anymore, but more interested in another dude.  Guy is still incommensurately upset about the whole ordeal and would like to stop being depressed about it."

It involves writing your best/most memorable date in San Diego after liking the page.

I'll be honest and confess I work as the FB/Twitter intern there. However, we have a very low amount of 'likes' and I'm very fond of this subreddit (and reddit in general) and I want to open up the chance of winning to people who might actually be interested in the prizes. Our current 'fan base' is not extremely active on the page and I want at least a couple of people to legitimately participate to make the contest fun and interesting.

We have a bunch of coupons and vouchers similar to the one we'll be giving out on Valentine's Day so liking and keeping up with the page won't be too detrimental for ya'll because we'll keep giving out stuff on a decently regular basis. If nobody is too upset, I'll also gladly let everyone know here when those things are happening in case the prize is worth the 'like.' 

The Balboa Passports are valued at $125.00 each. Winner gets two passports. Contest rules will be explained on the page and all you need to participate is 'like' the page and then share with us a fun, memorable date in San Diego.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thank you!

It makes me question what was real or if any of it was real if she could do that. Like today I was about to head home from my internship working for this really awesome artist guy and instead he had me and my coworker go to a private gallery opening with him, and we got in cause he's a big deal, and I got to talk to my favorite non-fiction writer Tania Katan who was there as we've become acquaintances. But it made me think of my ex because I had given her my copy of Tania's book to read and she absolutely loved it and she was a huge art person. I just thought about how much she would have enjoyed being there and seeing all of that amazing art and finally getting to meet Tania too.... I guess I'm just really not over it and it is still tender. So anyone up for a cheer up post?"
pkfog,0,2012-02-11,Why are unpaid internships legal?,[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pkfog/why_are_unpaid_internships_legal/,"**Short Version:**
I am very interested in finding out why unpaid internships are so common these days and more importantly why they are legal at all? 

**Long Version**
I'm a college student and my friends who are majoring in fields like communications, theater, etc have had as many as 10-12 unpaid internship! As a computer science major this seems ridiculous to me as in my field it's hard to even find an unpaid internship.

It seems like there are companies out there that are hiring armies of interns, not paying them, and not even giving them college credit, yet making profits off everyone of them essentially replacing real paid employees with a collection of nameless minions.

I read up on my own on this topic and ended up finding this quote:


“If you’re a for-profit employer or you want to pursue an internship with a for-profit employer, there aren’t going to be many circumstances where you can have an internship and not be paid and still be in compliance with the law,” said Nancy J. Leppink, the acting director of the department’s wage and hour division. - NYTimes

pkc5b,9,2012-02-10,"I've made great strides in the last year, but still have no idea what to do or how to have fun.",[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/pkc5b/ive_made_great_strides_in_the_last_year_but_still/,"Pre TL;DR: Fucked up childhood spent entirely by myself, almost no free-time, no friends. What do/how fix?

I've personally made leaps and bounds over the last year or so with my social life and self-image. I've slimmed down and lost over 75 pounds, mostly cleared up my face with the help of r/wicked_edge, and started dressing nicer thanks to r/malefashionadvice. I also realized that being 6'6"" doesn't make me a freak, and that I can actually be attractive. I've started being a lot more outgoing, less shy, and generally don't avoid social settings any more. r/askseddit has been awesome for making me see that I was being a complete AFC/Nice Guy™, and I've pretty much stopped being Mr. Friend Zone Magnet.

What I've had a considerably harder time with is actually getting out and doing things, due to a large combination of factors:

* Going to a small, technical school/community college with almost no common-areas/school events. Each major is essentially the same people moving in one group from class to class, never getting larger. All 5 of my classes take place in 3 rooms, with the same 10 people every day/class. Like Majors are grouped together in Gen-Eds, so instead of being an opportunity for meeting women, it's a giant clusterfuck of CS/Engineers. To make matters worse, the building all my classes are in is off by itself, and houses all the sciencey/technical classes.
* I work ~30 hours a week: 24 at a (paid) internship, and ~8 during the week as a CNA at a Nursing Home. The CNA hours are all evening hours, generally two days a week from 5:30pm-9:30pm. Every other weekend, I work from 2:45pm-10:45pm Saturday and Sunday, so that's pretty much two entire weekends a month wasted.
* I still live at home. Although I live in a smallish rural town, I'm just ~35 mins away from Sioux Falls, SD, the biggest city in South Dakota(not saying much, when compared to Minneapolis/St. Paul). College/Internship is there, and Nursing Home is a 5-minute walk from my house. The town is almost stereotypical in that it's full of all the people that couldn't escape/got pregnant in junior-high/barely scraped by on their GED and never gave a thought to anything beyond that.

All of the above has pretty much ground me into a routine of: classes -&gt; work -&gt; homework -&gt; shower -&gt; reading/Reddit -&gt; bed at midnight/1am -&gt; get back up at 6:45am and repeat. Only having 4 days a month completely work-free and to myself has pretty much ruined any chance I have of having a normal social-life.

I really don't regret the above, because it's enabled me to maintain a 3.8+GPA, and just yesterday I paid my last tuition payment off in it's entirety, and am currently ~$2K in the black. My internship is going extremely well, and in about 11 months they're quite likely to give me a job-offer that I'll probably accept, while taking night-classes for my Bachelors in Programming.

I might add that I was born in Japan, my father being a missionary/pastor, and pretty much spent my whole life up until 18 there. Due to complicated shit involving, but not limited to:

* Never really staying in one place for much more than 3-4 years while in Japan, and being almost completely isolated while there due to never really learning fluent Japanese
* Mild ADD/ADHD that I've managed to get/work beyond.
* A mis-diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome that lead to some pretty serious over-medication that left me a zombie for most of my middle-school and high-school years.
* The ""Tourettes"" resulted in me being sent to a school for the mentally-handicapped for 3 grades around middle-school.
* Being sent to a ""youth-home""/boot-camp in the armpit of Montana for all of my high-school years. Run by a stereotypical christian fundamentalist husband/wife. Imagine the type of people who talk about Obama being a Muslim, and not even having an American birth certificate. Every aspect of their lives and personalities was in some way linked to God/church/the Bible.

All of this led to me being a loner my entire life, never having friends for much more than 2 years at a time, with parents who never really trusted me.

With the above wall-o-text said, I have no friends outside of class, almost no free-time, and no idea what to do with myself when I do have some. I really don't want to spend this weekend reading/puttering around on personal projects. I'm planning on bouncing around town tomorrow, but really have no idea of how to fill a day or what to actually do with myself beyond crashing in Barnes &amp; Noble all day. I have no idea where the college bars are, and no one to tell me. Any suggestions?

pkbmk,7,2012-02-10,Sexxit: Is Sex a legitimate reason to end a relationship?,[deleted],sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/pkbmk/sexxit_is_sex_a_legitimate_reason_to_end_a/,"I'll preface this by saying that sex isn't the only reason behind my doubts as to whether or not I want to continue dating my girlfriend, but it does weigh heavily.  We have a lot of disagreements over school and money and whatever else.  If fact we're currently staring down the barrel of a long distance relationship as I'm leaving for an internship over the summer and she's staying to do... whatever.  However, what I currently find most frustrating is our sex life, or lack thereof.

As a college student I feel surrounded by sex, so much so that I feel upset that I'm no longer having any.  My girlfriend and I used to have a very active sex life; everything seemed fine.  Then we both got very busy last semester and our sex life fell off a metaphorical cliff.  Every once and a while we'd make time for it, but while it seemed great to me apparently she just wasn't that into it.  I always felt a great deal more open to it than she.  It started to seem as if she was avoiding it.

I've brought it up many times that I'm frustrated about this.  I personally feel that it's an important part of an intimate relationship, and that once you've established that kind of relationship, it's unreasonable to renegotiate, so to speak.  Her typical response is to accuse me of being some sort of machismo pig, saying that I'm giving her an ultimatum to have sex or I'll leave her, an act that she says would basically be on par with rape.

I see do see her point.  I obviously don't want to have sex because that's what keeps us together.  And I was partly to blame for often having other things I needed to do rather than spend time with her.  But still, am I being unreasonable here?  What would you do if your partner didn't want a sexual relationship while you did?  

And sorry for the essay, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it."

This is a 2nd account because my fiancee knows my main account info and I don't want him to see this and get hurt. 

To start off with, I have been with my fiancee for 2 years and 4 months now. We love each other very much. We have been through terrible and wonderful things. For the most part we have had a great relationship. 

BUT recently things have changed. He recently developed an anxiety disorder from all the stress in his life. It started in Nov. of 2010. He went to basic training and hurt his back pretty bad. He was medically discharged from the National Guard. The National Guard was his life and he planned everything. But when he was discharged everything changed. He came back home to live with his grandparents. His grandparents moved while he was at training and they could never go live back at the house my fiancee grew up in. He became depressed about that. He had no idea what to do with himself. Then in Jan of 2011 I had a huge fight with my parents and went to go live with my fiancee and his grandparents. 

For about 6 months we did nothing. No school. No job. Nothing. His grandparents were very nice to have us live and eat there rent free. Then his mother came to live with us too. That is where a lot of family drama stated. And his two aunts added to the mixture, constantly screwing other members of the family for their own benefit. 

In the summer I got a job and started to pay off my car again to my dad. Saved quite a bit of money. He still didn't have a job though. Then my job ended (it was only a 90 day internship) in August and he got a job around that time. So things were ok.

Until his grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in the neck. It devastated my fiancee. And I think it really began to depress him. Then in early October my fiancee had to quit his job. He was getting panic attacks everyday at work. The best part was he didn't have any insurance then either. So we were then back to neither one of us having a job, both of us being depressed and not doing anything. The panic attacks kept getting a lot worse. His grandparents had some Xanex to help him through it all but it didnt work that great. 

Finally in December he was able to insurance again and able to see a doctor. Also in December we finally moved and signed up for school. Things were looking better. The doctor prescribed him Lorazepam and we just had to wait and see if it would help his panic attacks. 

Well we started going to school last month and moved in but the meds the doctor gave him didn't work. So the doctor upped the dosage. And ever since then he has changed. He is a very sweet person in nature but lately...he has anger flashes, says the meanest things and can't control what he does or says. His panic attacks are decreasing but He turns into a gigantic asshole. And I can't stand it anymore. I love him so much. And I want the best for him. I just don't know how to deal with it. I do so much for him. And he doesn't give much back because of the side effects of the meds. 

Please 2X, give me any advice you have. I really need it. I don't know what to do besides get mad at him then feel like a jerk because its a side effect of the meds he is taking. Please help. 

**TL;DR:**My fiancee and I have been together 2 yrs and 4 months. The past year got him really depressed and he developed anxiety disorder. He finally saw the doctor and they prescribed him Lorazepam. The medicine is making the horrible panic attacks go away but turning him into a gigantic ass because it's one of the side effects. I don't know how to deal with it. I get angry at him all the time because of the things he says. Please help."

pmd0i,15,2012-02-12,Technical Internship Interview Ideas/Tips,Psyko_Koolaid,Theatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/pmd0i/technical_internship_interview_ideastips/,"I want to begin by saying that I am in no way the ultimate authority on this, and it is very likely that I’m not the first person to come up with these ideas. These are just my observations after sitting in a conference room all day doing 10 minute interviews with students/recent grads that were primarily looking for internships. I’m the ATD of a medium sized, professional summer theatre company.  I’ll be spending all of next Saturday interviewing people at another large audition/interview conference, and I wanted to post my current thoughts.

First things first, breathe. I understand you really want a job, and that there is a lot of stress that goes along with interviewing. The first thing I’m going to do when you come for an interview with me is shake your hand. Give me a nice firm handshake in return and calmly introduce yourself. I’m not going to bite, and I’m not going to brutally interrogate you.  I say this because I had many interactions this weekend where people were so nervous that their hands were shaking throughout the interview. I may not exactly look soft and cuddly, but I’m also not Santa Fe Opera. (Not that they are terrifying in any way either, just using a well known name to make a point.) The worst thing that could happen to you in the next 10 minutes is that you don’t impress me. While that isn’t desirable, it’s not a reason to torture yourself.


My next bit of advice may seem obvious but be aware of the time constraints. If this is an event where interviews are tightly scheduled do your best to stick to it. Be on time, and be aware of how long you’re spending on explanations/questions. If you bring your portfolio don’t expect to be able to cover it all in a 10 minute time slot. Ideally I’m going to want to look at and discuss your resume, and chat in general about your experience level and/or goals. In my mind I want to try and gauge how well you would fit a position in both personality and skill. I do want to see the portfolio, but I don’t want that to be the bulk of a first interview. Pick out a few key pages and explain the relevant parts until about 1 minute before your slot ends. I will always ask questions if I have them.


Do your research, and come with questions. Knowing a little something about the company you are interviewing for goes a long way. If I don’t have to take 1-2 minutes to explain the kind of work we produce that leaves us more time to talk about your skills and examine your work. Take 5 minutes of your own time to check out our season and look at some photos, and if you want more specific information ask me. One or two intelligent questions will make you stick out.
I saw a lot of freshman and sophomore students who had a resume full of any credit they could list. I understand the necessity of doing this in your first few years. I had to do it too. Several times when I asked these students what they specialized in or what they were looking for they would answer, “Everything,” or “Anything.” No. You can’t specialize in everything. I want you to have a well rounded knowledge of technical work, but I want you to have a passion for a more specific area within it. Pick an area that suits your strengths, or that you want to hone your skill in. *In my opinion* there is nothing wrong with saying something like, “I got my start as a carpenter, but I’ve developed an interest in electrics so I’ve also been taking as many electrician positions as I can in the past year.”


My last bit of advice is to be excited and engaged. I’m likely doing interviews all day. You’re likely to be doing the same thing. If you come to me with zero confidence or are so anxious that you can’t hold a conversation it doesn't give me much to go with in terms of approximating your abilities or personality. If you’re really tired, or really nervous, fake it. Sit up straight, look me in the eyes and smile. If I can’t get you engaged in the interview I’m likely to lump you in with the mob of people who I know I interviewed, but can’t remember a thing about. Don’t barrage me with fake pep, but be warm and honest. If my BS meter goes off that is the first thing I’m going to remember. I like to challenge people. If I’m asking a lot of questions it’s because I’m trying to get you to break out of the standard, ‘safe’ responses. I want you to sell yourself as a whole person, not just as your resume.
Again, I’m not the final word on any of this. There are other people who have other priorities. These are the things that matter to me when I talk with people looking for internships. Everyone interviews differently, and some of this becomes less crucial in longer interviews or on a 2nd or 3rd interview. Still, I feel that the some of the general ideas are useful in any interview.


**tl;dr**

* 1. Be calm. It’s an interview not an interrogation.
* 2. If you only have 10 minutes, use them well.
* 3. Know who you’re talking to.
* 4. Be well rounded, but have specific skills/goals.
* 5. Be confident and honest. I want to hire a person, not a resume.

plvua,16,2012-02-12,Stories?,FearlessEyes,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/plvua/stories/,"I've read all the stories underneath the 'birth stories' category on the sidebar. I was just wondering if anyone had some stories that weren't shared there, or, if you have a specific way you'd like your labor to go? I'll start~!

My BEST FRIEND (and sister in law) just had her baby at 4:57pm, July 11th (She was over due. We always joked how she would be overdue and I would be early and we'd have the babies on the same day. Well...) and we had just gotten back home from a day of visiting her in the hospital and spending time with family. My fiance had just went to bed since he had a long day ahead of him for work. Me being 36 weeks pregnant.. I didn't exactly like to sleep when he slept (I wanted the WHOLE bed.) and I cleaned while he was sleeping a lot. well, I had just sat down after some rigorous cleaning and I had coughed and felt some fluid leak out. I thought 'DAMN IT I peed again.' so I got up, emptied my bladded. Opted to leave my pants OFF and continue cleaning. I knelt down to pick something up and suddenly.. more leaking on the floor! Except a lot more than what just a trickle of pee would be. My first instinct was to get down even lower and smell it. Did NOT smell like urine at all. I jump up. Excited as all high hell because I was 99% sure my water broke. At this time it was 12am. I run into the room, tell my fiance my water broke and his response was 'WHAT!? Okay.' and went back to sleep. I shook my head and decided to pack. Realizing I have NO bags to put stuff in (except for my old highschool backpack that I refuse to part with) I call my mom's house. my 15 year old sister answered the phone.
Me: ASHLEY. is mom there?
Ashey: ... -suspicion in voice- ..She's sleeping.. what.. why....?
Me: My water broke.
Proceed to hear phone fly across the house and her scream 'MOM! MOM MOM MOM MOM' as she races down the hallway. 
Go to wake up fiance again. 'STEPHEN. I'M IN LABOR' 
'OKAY. -back to sleep-'
My sister and her friend who happened to be sleeping over come over and help me pack. I tell them to beware of wetspots. all I get is an 'EWH THAT'S WHAT I STEPPED IN!?' 

After 5 more attempts of waking up fiance and one FINALLY being successful (after punching him in the crotch lightly [I play dirty.]) we begin our 30 minute drive to the city. at the outskirts of the city awaits my other good friend who decided to come and help with anything for the first 4 hours of my labor.

I was MISDIAGNOSED with MRSA. it's contagious. SO I WAS ON QUARANTINE. Doctors treated me like shit until I got into the actual delivery room. When I arrived in the delivery room my contractions were steady and I was at 4cm. Here's the kicker. I don't remember 75% of my labor. There are video recordings of me SCREAMING my head off. I only remember crying. LADIES. if you ask for an epidural MAKE SURE YOU REQUEST that it is only the attending/head anesthesiologist doing it. I'm not afraid of needles but the thought of a needle going into my SPINE and not being allowed to move while they were doing it TERRIFIED ME. I got an intern. HE STUCK ME THREE TIMES before he got the actual attending. I was vomiting and crying because I was terrified. My anesthesiologist was great though. He tried to make me feel better with little jokes. like 'Is this your first time? MINE TOO!' I called him an ass a few times. He said I'd be back in 9 months ;) After the epidural I was in HEAVEN. Until.. It stopped working on the right half of my body. the screaming started again apparently. my sister told me she had called my mother (who was in the room with us) and she said that all she heard was screaming. She was convinced I was dying. Next thing I know I'm telling the doctors it feels like I have to crap. Literally. They checked me and I was at 8-9 centimeters! Almost time to push! We quickly rushed visitors (My other BFF and her boyfriend came to visit and wait for baby to be born.) out of the room as the nurses began to talk me through things (BIRTHING CLASSES ARE A WASTE OF TIME. I FORGOT EVERYTHING/DISREGARDED ALL ADVICE) Suddenly I was at 10cm and it was time to push. it was a strange sensation. On one half of my body I was completely numb. The other half I could feel EVERYTHING. The doctors told me she would be out by 5:30pm (July 12th. It was 4:15 at this point) There were my words. ""FXCK THAT I WANT HER OUT BY FIVE."" and I began to push. Nothing on one half. burning on the other. NOW LADIES. when a doctor tells you to stop pushing and pant like a dog.. FOR HEAVENS SAKE. LISTEN. That means that the chord is wrapped around the babies neck and they have to remove it. After that little ordeal it was time to push again. After some more pushing Evelyn came out. at 4:52pm. July 12th. 23 hours and 55 minutes after my BFFS baby was born. All the pain was gone. All I could do was cry tears of happiness. And that is my story."
pljvf,1,2012-02-11,Parents want me to move back home to focus on my studies...,[deleted],teenparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenparents/comments/pljvf/parents_want_me_to_move_back_home_to_focus_on_my/,"I'm in a dilemma. I'm 18, and a freshman in college. I attend a very prestigious university where it's hard enough for most students to make it out with decent GPAs but I'm taking this on as a single mother (I gave birth about six weeks ago).

It's been extremely difficult since the new semester started because I don't have anyone to watch my daughter, so just making it to class is a blessing. My family lives about 5-6 hours away so they can't help me out. I do have friends, but they're so busy with their own schoolwork and kids that asking them for help would be unrealistic. Along with this, I'm extremely behind on my academic progress because I haven't been able to take a full course load (I am taking less classes than the normal student because I need time to tend to my newborn daughter). I'm already pretty much guaranteed to graduate a semester or even a year late.

My parents are trying to convince me to transfer to a school close to home so I can live with them and get help with the baby. I'm trying to get into med school so I need time to focus on my studies, internships, extracurricular activities, etc., time that my parents feel will be available to me if they help me with my daughter.

I'm hesitant about moving back in with them though. After having lived by myself, I realized how uncomfortable it is to have to live with others. I also definitely do not want to push my responsibilities as a parent to my own parents. I am my daughter's mother, and I want to play that role fully. I don't know how comfortable I would be with having my own mother ""mother"" her in a sense. I also have this feeling of crippling failure when I think of moving back in with them, as if I had to because I could not handle this on my own. I most certainly can handle this on my own, but moving in with my parents would, I admit, make things ten times easier and allow me to graduate sooner.

So what should I do? Should I just stick it out and try to do this on my own? Or should I let my parents help?"

Also, I have been with my boyfriend for over a year and we plan on going further with our relationship (sexually) in the near future. I want to be prepared for this so I want to go on the pill for the obvious reason.

I have a very basic student health insurance policy that I had to take out for an internship coming up this summer, so I would like to take advantage of that if I can. I just don't know how it works - do I go to Planned Parenthood or do I find a doctor? Is there some sort of physical exam?

pledd,14,2012-02-11,I'm losing the motivation to keep going. I'm not sure how far that goes. I have had thoughts of suicide in the past but lately I just find my day to day life upsettingly alone.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pledd/im_losing_the_motivation_to_keep_going_im_not/,"I'm losing the motivation to keep going. I'm not sure how far that goes. I have had thoughts of suicide in the past but lately I just find my day to day life upsettingly alone.

I have always found it hard to fit in with other people. When I was 11 I was moved to the US because of my fathers job, my two older sisters already at uni. I was completely alone, 3500 miles from my family, and I was in a small American town where I was outcast by my peers and viciously bullied because of my location of birth. I would show up twice maybe three times a week in the principals office, covered in bruises, only to be suspended while my attackers parents were apologised to; my school administrators were bigots. But I am not here to cry about that. I just want you to know that at 11 I had to 'grow up' , alone, and since I have never fit in with other people.

I left my parents to move back to the UK 2 years ago to start uni. I have a good group of friends, mostly male but there are a couple of girls who we were living with last year. I hear a lot on Reddit about the friend-zone, I wouldn't say I have this problem because I don't feel that way about any of my friends. That's what they are, friends. But now that everyone is starting to settle down from our fresher-year antics they are all pairing up and finding people to go out with. 

And I am alone. On a computer science course with 4 girls and 80 odd guys. Everyone I know knows all the girls from their home towns, and from their courses, a couple of them are quite the 'players' for lack of a better term. I often wonder if that's why I gravitated to them as friends. Out of respect.. jealousy perhaps. Whereas I have no home town, and the three 'friends' I could claim from the US are guys, and too far away. Everyone here goes home for the weekends, to go to the pubs with their friends. And I sit here in my house. Alone.

I don't know anyone to ask out, let alone anyone I even want to get to know. I am English but I have been away from the UK for so long that outside this little group of people I don't know anyone. 

And lately I find myself pushing people away. I refuse to go out on group nights out because I drink too much, the stress of group events. I have (stupidly) confessed my depression to some people in the past, but it was pawned off as being the alcohol, and in the morning I have always been too embarrassed to bring it up. My friends just think I am an angry person because I expect a lot of the world. They don't know that I spend most of my time crying because I can't handle the responsibility of life, given the emptiness of my own.

The one 'relationship' I have had in my two years of uni, if you can even call it that, was with one of the girls on my course. A sweet girl, we started talking, it was clear there was something there. We kept trying to hook up but friends and house mates dramas always kept us on our feet. I had an intern-ship over the summer and we texted and talked constantly. She got me through the work day, she said good night. I lived alone over the summer by the way. All summer, with no friends in the city, they were all home with their friends from their home towns. I am not proud to admit it but I was dependent on those texts. And by the end of summer I thought we had such a shot together, and that love was twinkling in our eyes. Well... That didn't pan out. We tried, and I realised she wasn't the person I thought. Or at least it became clear we were 'too' different. And as sad as I was I wanted to be friends, but she took it as an insult; bridge well and truly burned.

I feel very self-conscious writing this. I don't want to give a 'life story' or to sound like I am whining. I just want someone to have heard this. Even just partially reading it. Because I don't know many people. And it would be nice to know that someone knows that this is how I feel. And that it's not alcohol talking, and it's not me being melodramatic.

Right now I have a goal for myself. And I hope it's not an unrealistic one. In the past it was to 'find a girlfriend', as if that would magically solve all my problems. No. My goal for the next month or so is to start consistently waking up without fresh tears on my face. I hope that if I can manage that that I can start to feel better about myself, and my life. Because I don't want to kill myself. From what I have seen there is so much to life. There is so much I haven't experienced, the joy, namely. And I want to. But I can't shake the feeling that for me it won't happen."
pnbro,11,2012-02-13,"Bad mental health hospital experience. Not as abusive as others, I'm sure, but for me it became the symbol of my entire existence's dysfunction. (Pure venting, rambling, don't read it unless you really want to)",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pnbro/bad_mental_health_hospital_experience_not_as/,"I have very bad memories from when I walked to a hospital (medical) and asked for help about being suicidal. I was left half naked, fishbowled in the ER for over 24 hours, no one to talk to, just forms to fill out vicariously. A social worker treated me like I was a criminal for wanting to kill myself. Strange disdain from doctors as well. I took up room that could have been used for injured people. I did not know they would put me in the ER.

I was transported by police to a mental hospital. I was treated with active contempt by a medical doctor there, who got me out of my room late at night for tests.

I finally fell asleep, exhausted from crying. So loudly I knew I was keeping someone up in the other rooms. No one complained.

I woke up to three people walking into the room. A man introduced himself and the other two, who were women. Doctor, doctor, medical student. I was sitting in bed, without pants. I was dazed from the past two days.

I did horribly, filling out this vicarious form. The doctor looked at his wrist as I spoke, as if there was a watch on it, then rolled his eyes to look up at the valid existence beyond me that I was keeping him from with my presence in his perception. The medical student audibly called me an asshole on the way out of the room, speaking to the woman doctor who I believe was an intern. One of the questions was, ""do you hear people saying negative things when you walk away from them?"". I couldn't remember any specific time that had happened. But it happened then. I really have no idea what caused them to behave like this. It seems very unusual.

They wanted me out that day. I wasn't really suicidal apparently. The female doctor came back in to speak to me after I tried to express this new dimension of hopelessness I did not know existed until after trying to get help with my already overwhelming hopelessness to the nurses through their forms. She reluctantly decided that I could stay an extra night. She acted like I was a whining child getting a treat. ""I couldn't talk to anyone. I felt I was either going to buy a tank of helium and kill myself that night, or try to get help. I thought that I would have plenty of time to change my mind in the long walk to the hospital on the other side of town. I didn't change my mind. I need help."" I said this to a chant of condescending ""fair enough""s. Oh, and also, a ""that's a *very* long walk, [fat boy]"" thrown in. (To be fair, my weight may not have played into it. Still very condescending.)

I was a big boy and ate my dinner. Thanks for checking nurse. (not horrible in itself. But I had waited so long for *someone* to *talk* to.)

Just fill in the gaps with violent weeping into a rag, waiting for the next thing to happen. The rag became too wet to be of any use, used a towel.

A young male nurse came in and gave me a note with a number on it. ""Your dad called, you have to call him and give him this code in order for us to let him talk to you."" This code was to protect my privacy. . . Somehow my father found out I was at the mental hospital. Not supposed to be legal, but apparently the social worker at the first hospital thought it was okay to call him and let him know that I *might* be at a specific mental hospital. He's a psychiatrist, so surely he would know how to make the situation better. Just like he did the 22 years I lived with him. (i'm a fucking cliche) Female nurse came in to ~~make sure I wasn't planning on suing the hospital for breach of privacy~~ console me.

The next morning I was up early, sitting crosslegged, humbly in the ""authority chair"" of the room. The one the lead doctor sat in the morning before. They walk in with two quick knocks. ""You're up. [can't believe it, you lazy sack of shit]"". I'm asked questions. I answer them more directly than before, having given up on being respected as a human being capable of having meaningful feelings. After being told I changed my mind about killing myself at the hospital, I denied it. And so I was reluctantly told that he thought I could receive treatment at that hospital.

I didn't want to stay. I wanted to talk to my therapist. I regretted so much not just talking to her. The female doctor had spoken with her over the phone, and apparently was caused to have new empathy for me, (once given an alternative to the authoritative ""lets hate this guy"" of the lead doctor), and even had a sympathetic tone when she said ""yes"", after I said that I wanted to speak with my therapist.

I didn't trust my therapist because I felt she didn't respect me enough and was a little condescending. I told her this the day I left the hospital. She stopped being condescending, and listened to me with less assumptions. Or at least she acts like she does very well, which is enough I guess. I know the alternative now.

I cut my arm for the first time, (22 years old). I did it during one of my regular fits of remembering the experience. It gave me a fucking complex or something. I think about it every day. It makes me feel more suicidal than any other thoughts do now. It's come to represent so much! I was mistreated as a young child, this affected my behavior, which caused me to be mistreated as an older child, which affected my behavior, which caused me to be mistreated as an adolescent, and so on until we reach the now, where I'm treated with disdain and contempt by the last people who would ever help a person.

I will fight lethally before I am ever dragged into a mental hospital again. I will never allow people to cause me to feel that extreme of societal rejection again--that which does not have a word that I know of, a kind of seperateness that occurs in the mind, not lonely, very different, complete existential invalidation. I will kill and kill myself before I allow it to happen again. My story is just what I have now. The dead surface skin I can shed off into the internet. It's not what happened. I am not a story. No one is a story. They held me to their story. Their simple story. Less than human.

Although my therapist said condescending things much less than before, she never showed real sympathy for the hospital experience, which had come to represent all of the unhealth of my life. You see, she is an expert, and has much experience working in a hospital like the one I was in. She knows very well that they are bad. My experience, she had a story for. Because she has so much experience about the subject, there is no event concerning it that she can't predict and understand completely, without needing to hear about it. She is fairly old, and has this mentality of experts are authority, mistakes are so rare. Mistakes are not rare. There is no such thing as authority, except in the very practical. The authority of the lead doctor's disdain for me is what allowed the medical student to say a disparaging thing about me in earshot while I was in the most vulnerable state of my adult life. Authority of his expertise is what allowed him to not question his decision that I wasn't really suicidal. I have unusual ways of expressing things. Apparently I'm a fucking anomaly. One so obscure it's not worth exploring.

Just needed to type this into somewhere."

Me and my girlfriend had an awesome relationship we had been talking about marriage for the past year and she had already picked out where we were going to get married, how the wedding was going to be and so on. The day before the breakup everything was great, we were looking at wedding rings for the upteenth time, talking about whether we should get diamonds or gemstones and having a really great time. literally the next day she texted me saying ""im not feeling the same""

 she had been acting funny but i just shook it off and said I'll come over after you get off class so we can talk about it. she got out of class 2 hours early and texts me to come over i said okay, before I'm able to leave my house she sees me on facebook chat and messages me. she then begins to say that she doesn't love me anymore, that she didn't want to try to work it out and she just wouldn't be happy. I asked her to explain and she couldn't she just kept saying i dont know i dont know. and she ended it right then over facebook chat. I didn't flip out I contained my anger and merely said that i hoped she had a nice life. and I have been very respectful towards her parents and such. but it killed me emotionally. i was lost, the entirely of these three years were devoted to her and she just ripped it apart seemingly overnight and over facebook chat. her parents actually were extremely shocked as well and had no idea why it happened. this happened about a week and a half ago and I have not spoken to her. she has texted me saying she needed a shirt she left in my room, so i went to her apt and left it in her car along with her spare keys and she texted me thank you the next day and I said nothing.

I don't really know what to do anymore. She was the entire reason I was on this side of the country, i moved out here for an internship and met her and ended up staying, we spent almost all of our free time together, I go to school out here and have a job but i dont have any family out here. i have 5-6 friends who are cool but they aren't really close friends.

she texted my father two days ago saying she feels bad and wishes she could talk to me and tell me her reasons but she doesn't think I would want to see her.

so my question is should i let her have that conversation with me? is getting closure worth the pain its probably going to put me through to see her again. after what she did to me I'm just not sure. I feel so much anger and resentment towards her, but id be lieing if i said i wasn't still crazy in love with her. I don't want her back, at least that's what I keep telling myself, I'm not sure I could forgive her.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I (24) broke up with my gf (25) of 3.5 years in December of 2010. We kept living together for 7 more months until our lease was up and we continued to act like we were together (did everything together, kissed, had sex). I broke up with her foolishly because she was my first gf and I was naive. She was always super in love with me the whole relationship, so I naively thought that breaking up with her wasn't risky, because I could have her back whenever I wanted.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I broke up with her because we were having some issues (she was very jealous and insecure, I'd never been with another girl, and we were both getting on each other's nerves and running out of patience). What I really should have done was to initiate a ""break"" with the intention of definitely getting back together some day.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   So anyway, around October I realized how much I really loved her and tried to get her back. To my surprise and horror, she didn't want me back. She's told me so many different reasons that I don't know which ones are true: she still loves me, but needs time to herself; she could see us getting married if we get back together and she's afraid of commitment, etc. So I decide to let her have her space.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   Then around November, she starts dating an 18 year old guy. That's a 7 year age gap with the girl being the older partner. She's still dating him now and is apparently very enamored of him. Everyone is telling her (besides me, I haven't talked to her since new year's) that the age gap does not bode well for a long term relationship, but she disagrees with them all. She's possibly planning on moving far away for 6 months for an internship in the fall and her new BF wants to transfer universities and go with her.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   My theory is that they are just in the ""honeymoon"" phase or ""puppy love"" phase and that they are both just flooded with hormones and can't think straight. Especially the BF, because she is probably his first love and is therefor crazy enough to consider moving across the country to be with someone he's known for 3 months.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   Also, it seems that her new BF has some qualities that my GF thought were missing from our relationship. I was never big on watching football or playing soccer, two things her new BF loves to do. But I feel like these are trivial qualities and that me and my ex shared more meaningful qualities and made a better long term match. Her whole relationship with this new BF seems very un-thought out and hormone-driven.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   So basically my question is what's my best strategy for getting her back? Should I just not contact her at all until she contacts me? Or should I avoid contact until sometime in the summer (before she possibly moves away) and then try to let her know how I feel one more time?  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I'm worried about so many things right now. I want her to miss me, but I feel like her current relationship is blocking that from happening. I'm worried that if I wait too long to contact her, her memories of how great our relationship was will start to fade and become less powerful and influential. But on the other hand, I feel like if I talk to her too soon, it could push her away. Also, I feel like even if she realizes that her new relationship isn't that great, that doesn't mean she's not going to stick around in it for years to come. Her BF before me was terrible and she stayed with him for 5 years. How can I know if she's in a mediocre relationship, so that I can move in and tell her that I still love her and that she should break up and come back to me? I guess at some point I could possibly call her sister or one of her friends and ask if they've noticed any conflict in the relationship.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   What do I do? (It's hard to convey in a short amount of words on reddit, but I do feel like her and I are really compatible and have a real shot at true love and a happy marriage. I really want to get her back!)  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
**TL;DR  
Broke up with GF of 3.5 years, wanted her back, she said no, not now. Is now dating a new BF that is 7 years younger than her (25, 18). They've been dating for 3 months and are already talking about moving away and living together. How do I get her back if her new relationship is really just a hormone-driven bad decision?**"

pot0z,6,2012-02-14,"Girlfriend broke up on LDR, need advice on dealing with it.",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/pot0z/girlfriend_broke_up_on_ldr_need_advice_on_dealing/,"Hey Everyone,

**Background:** Well about 2 months ago my girlfriend of 3 years went away to Europe for an internship during the southern hemisphere summer (shes still there as of posting). We are both 23, her being in the last year of uni while I graduated recently. Before she left I felt we had a fairly good relationship which in retrospect was kind of falling apart due to both of us taking each other for granted, yet I still thought I was a good boyfriend who tried to make her happy whenever I could e.g baking her cakes/surprise visits at work.

About a month into her trip she became really emotionally distant, never initiating contact or saying that she misses me. I became worried and asked her about it but she claimed that's how she was when she traveled abroad (this not being her first time). This continued for a week and finally due to the lack of answers I did something I shouldn't have done which was reading a conversation on facebook between her and a friend. In the conversation I discovered that she was planning to break up when she got back because she claimed she didn't miss me at all and I annoyed her when I called. After revealing this to her a shitstorm ensued where she got angry about me invading her privacy but showed deep regret for saying the things that she did and we both admitted we did things that were wrong and said we would try to work it out.

**Now:** Eventually after a few days she broke up with me as she felt it would be better if we be friends instead. Its been a month since all of this happened and in the original break up on the phone she used vague terms like ""its not you, its me"" and other things along those lines. It took a week of prompting through email to get her real reasons for breaking up which were that she had changed and gained more confidence/independence/fashion sense as a result of being away and didn't think she could return to her regular life back home which included not being able to stay emotionally committed to me. She still has a year of uni left though but she plans to move into the central city away from the suburb where we both live until she can move away next year to a different country.

Essentially from her given reasons, I feel like it was her polite way of saying ""I've become to good for you and feel I can do better"" and its really eating up my self-esteem. After discovering this I told her that we can't be friends as I felt those were fairly selfish reasons for breaking up. Shes kind of an insecure person and I feel the changes she is feeling is just based on a travel buzz rather than actual change though I could be wrong.

In retrospect I am kind of glad that the relationship is over as there were a lot of bad things amongst the good that I didn't see happening at the time such as her taking me for granted, yet despite this I'm feeling really ""left behind"" as she has a new and exciting lease on life while I'm stuck looking for work having just finished uni.

Besides the large hit my self-esteem has taken, I've been having a lot of distressing thoughts about her being with other guys/girls and her past romantic encounters that she told me about which are really eating me up on the inside. I know that the breakup was good for both of us, but I seem to be more sad and depressed about her being with other people both past and present rather than us not being together anymore.

So reddit can you please help me with some suggestions about how to stop thinking about her being with other people and maybe taking initiative to improve my own life so that I don't feel so left behind. I know this sounds like a big ask but any help would be seriously appreciated.

Thank you.

As barely paid part-time intern I worried I wouldn't be able to pay for my phone,internet,food (in the order lol). So I started an emergency fund by dumping my change each night in a bucket. 

I wasn't originally going to get a Mac but a series of events and research made me wish i had more money to buy one... when I realized DID have more money. I wasn't used to thinking about bucket-o-change as actual funds.

In the end i had $735.60 worth of change. WOW!! 

I'm more impressed with saving that much change then owning a Mac. But having something with good resale value and a mere 2.9lb is nice too ;)

I finally got a decent paying job so I started buying some of my own equipment for some home network experimentation. 

I actually just bought a 2950 switch and a 2621XM router. I'm not really looking to make a certification home lab (I plan to do that during my next full time internship with Packet Tracer) just a place to experiment.

So i have a couple questions, I recently saw a Cisco Pix 525 firewall for sale and I was considering buying it. After a quick search I didn't find to much info about it, Cisco had a end of life statement. Would it be worth getting to know how to configure such devices? 

My next question has to do with other vendor's equipment, such as Juniper ( I really don't know too many other vendors). Should I invest in learning to configure a Cisco firewall? Or buy a Juniper router/switch and become familiar with that? 

Sorry if I spam questions on this subbreddit, I just realized how much knowledge is in this reddit and the classroom (so far at least) doesn't teach much beyond the technical skills."

My good friend is being called on to go on mission to Uganda and Kenya this summer, to do disciple work as well as service projects. Here is her letter she wrote to facebook: 

"" Dear Family and Friends,

The Lord has been doing much in my life and heart since the last time I went to Africa. I have been praying and seeking His face since and I am pleased to inform you that I will be going to Uganda for 6 weeks to work with beautiful orphans and study under missionaries as an intern. I will also be going to Kenya for 2 more weeks to learn under the Hovinghs, the missionaries I first learned under my first trip to Africa. This is a total of 8 weeks I will be in Africa! My Father has been teaching me so much since I stepped off that plane in Africa, and I cannot wait to return. He has called me on a mission there, and I want to help raise awareness of the good that is being done, and also raise awareness for the needs.

The total approximate cost of the internship is 5,100 and it is July 14th – September 9th in Kenya first, then Uganda.
I will be able to help disciple, have hands on service projects and activity planning, leading the children at the home, and they will be plugging some of us into our expertise! So yes, this means that you’ll be seeing many pictures of what’s going on! The ministry I’m going with is absolutely fantastic. It has heightened my love for missions, and sets forth an extremely loving and godly attitude in their work. I’d strongly encourage you to check them out for yourself just so you know what else you’re supporting www.heartofthebride.org. 

If you feel you are in a position to support me financially, know that the bulk of this amount ($2,800) is for my airfare and is due as soon as possible. The remainder of the support is due May 9, 2012. I would like your prayer support above all else as I prepare for the trip and while I am abroad. I will need it, even though I’m not easily homesick, 2 months is a very long time. Also make sure you check out the picture that I is on the event thing. You can buy this on my website http://aegoinsphotography.smugmug.com/ and help further support me and my mission by buying the picture! You can get this one and other Africa pictures all under the album Africa.

Here are some specific ways you can pray for the team and me:
•	That our hearts will be in the right place with God as we lead an example of His love
•	That the glory will never be led back to us, but our Father
•	That our families will be safe while we aren’t there, but equally leading people to the faith while we are gone
•	That others see the Hope of Christ through whatever He has us do
•	That satan won’t be allowed to get a foothold, discourage, or weaken our health
•	That greater than anything we will be lights unto this dark world here and when we return





If you would like to financially support this trip, you can mail a check to:

Heart of the Bride Ministries
P.O.Box 786
Niceville, Florida 32588


Checks should be made out to Heart of the Bride Ministries accompanied by a note designating the check to Anna Goins for Uganda Internship All financial donations are tax deductible and you will receive a donation statement at the end of the year.

Thank you for your love and support in Christ""

Just found this board and I thought maybe I could get some advice from some of you. I am currently an intern at Noyes Hospital in Dansville (Alfred State requires our last semester to be a internship) and I am currently going to start looking into sending out resumes/looking at apartments. I will graduate with a bach in software application development (focused more on systems A&amp;D)

1) What would be a good place to look at for apartments? I did browse for one while internship hunting but did not look to deep into it. I would be moving up from Wayland with my fiancee, and probably would enough for a decent lease payment to start off with.

2) Does anyone know of/have open positions in their IS staff they are looking to fill? I will be done in May and should have my degree (if ASC does not screw yet another graduate over, has happened to about 3-4 of my friends in the last year). 

For some REALLY quick and summarized info, I have led dev teams in large class projects, worked help desk related jobs (at Noyes and also at ASC). I have taken classes with c++, Java, VB, I am trying to currently learn python since it was suggested to me. I was apart of the networking team over the summers to install the dorms networks (mostly just construction work, not entirely related). 

No biggie if no one has any large leads regarding a job, just thought I would try my luck here as well as normal job hunting. Thank you very much in advance!

Edit: I have been searching via http://www.rochesterworks.org/ as was suggested in other posts. I have found only about 2-3 entry level IT related jobs that I would qualify for. One being [Associate IT Software Engineer - Entry Level](https://searchjobs.external.xerox.com/careersection/us/jobdetail.ftl?job=172843). Any thoughts/ideas?

I just had to make an account and share my day just to get it out there and not have it eat away at me on the inside. So to start off I had long preparations for the 2 main events of today: a job interview for an internship I really wanted and a 30% midterm.  

Over the past week I put in nearly 4+ hours every evening learning and understanding everything  I needed to do well on the midterm. As for the interview I was making sure that I was able to answer all types of behavioral questions that were common in most interviews. So to cut the story short I woke up today morning knowing that I had done my preparations to my fullest. But the day started off on the wrong note, I went into the interview and suddenly froze up and couldn't focus on the questions being asked nor was I able to reply back without choking on my words. I was going through some major anxiety to the point where I had looks of concerns from my interviewers. I managed to get through the interview and walking out I knew that I had just lost out on the job cause of that horrible interview. Saddened I still had my hopes up since I hoped they would overlook my breakdown for my qualifications and carried on with the day cause I knew I had to be focused for my midterm. But the midterm only further pushed me into my current state of depression, since that was probably one of the worst tests I have ever written in my life. So I come home and find that I had received an email from the employer from the interview earlier and they informed what I had expected in that I was not going to be a good fit for the role. 

So to summarize today was as clear of an indication that no matter how hard I try and how hard I try to make things work I still end up screwing it all up. I have no one to talk to about the pain and suffering I go through just trying to be happy. For once I wish that things would go my way. These past 6 years of my life have been hell and everything I have touched has turned to shit.  I try harder than most of my colleges at school and yet I'm always the one with the shitter grades. As of right now I feel like i should just drift away with my useless life and just not care while I await my death with open arms. 

Sorry if this was a rant that went no where, but i wanted to put my anger out in words. For those who read this thank you.

Hello Reddit,


I'm a CS graduate working a full time job.  Recently I've started to flirt with the idea of starting my own business, if not for the money, then for the freedom that comes with it.  


To get the ball rolling a family friend who has his own IT related business has offered to send potential clients my way.  He called me today and told me that there is a guy who has his own small business and is currently using an Access application to run his business.  This person needs some work modifying and improving the application.


Now I'm here to ask you fine people for advice.  Any information really, as this would be my first time truly trying to start something, and I really want to do it right.


I have some questions that I'll list down at the end, but if I'm missing something as I'm sure I am, please feel free to comment and let me know.


Thanks a lot,


- What should be my primary focus when I meet this guy, or rather, what are the must-pay-attention-to's?

- Any initial encounter advice?  (I have common sense and can carry myself well, but are there any extras?)

- I've done some Access work when I was an intern, but are there things about Access that I should keep in mind?  (I'm definitely not and Access expert)

- How should I go about estimating the cost?  I've read a lot about per hour vs per project, but I'm not sure this project is at that level.  (This is very important for me because I'm not a good negotiator)

- Are there extra services I could provide? (Possibly could help with creating a small but constant montly revenue...)

psiwi,1,2012-02-16,Louis CK solves the piracy debate.  (No Really.),wyverndarkblood,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/psiwi/louis_ck_solves_the_piracy_debate_no_really/,"My wife and I are fans of Louis CK and she recently bought and downloaded [his latest release](https://buy.louisck.net/) from Beacon Theater.  But his release is also an anti-piracy experiment.  Price it well ($5), and make it easy to get from him directly, and people won't pirate it.  The polls are in, and the experiment worked!  He even offers full financial transparency for how much the production cost, and how much it earned.  For the piracy part skip to the bottom half of the post.

TLDR ~ Louis CK is amazing.  And solved the Internetz.

A couple weeks after downloading the show (we've watched it at least 10 times), Louis sent us this email from the back of a cab:



**Hi.  This is LOuie.  It seriously is me. Im even going to leave
the O stuipdly capatalized because who would pay an intern to do
that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.**

**Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.**

**Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.**

**Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past.
What?**

**Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.**

**Regards. Sincerely, Actually,**

**Louis**


===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
show you wanted.

I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
again for all this crazy shit.

Sincerely, Louis C.K.

psidv,0,2012-02-16,The value of teachers' unions...,I_hate_fountainhead,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/psidv/the_value_of_teachers_unions/,"I came here just to air one of my primary grievances over the current education debate in our country and provide an anecdote for why I think teachers unions are still very valuable to us. 

I'll begin this by saying, I don't think teachers unions don't need reformed, or are educational system in general. Teachers should be like any employee, accountable to to the quality of their product. I believe in a higher accountability, higher benefit system for teachers. However, the problem with the way our educational debate runs in this day and age is exactly what's wrong, there's an overdone focus on the accountability of the teacher. This is only one facet of what's wrong with our education system and it wrongly overshadows other aspects of the system

Now, the anecdote:
I grew up in a poor rural community in Ohio, where like many places in the rust belt, the few manufacturing industries were in a steady decline. Besides being just poor there was still an outdated cultural attitude towards education. ""You don't need college,"" was the mantra among most peoples' parents. On top of that there was a serious youth flight problem, so the demographics swung older.

As could be expected the schools were equally miserable. Our elementary and middle school were built during the Civil War. Passing educational bond items was damn near impossible. Every election our already slim arts and music programs were on the edge of being cut. Big class sizes, low teacher pay, etc... etc...

Anyways, it was our local teacher union which kept things together. Like many small towns we had an overemphasis on the sports program. Our baseball and football programs were regular state contenders and going to a game was the only thing to do on a Friday night. Every election cycle there was a movement to kill the arts and music funding, every election cycle the teachers union gathered and the teachers who ran the sports programs threatened to close up shop, arguing that their programs were no more valuable to the kids than music. Bond item passed. The sum up for vote was always paltry, averaged $9 a person, was still a struggle.

The teachers took it on themselves to actively recruit hometown kids in education in college, so that they could make sure good teachers would come in to the school system and hopefully stay there. If you were in education in college you had members of the teachers union not only checked in to say hello, but would offer to help you with your studies, hook you up with internships, etc... As a result our teacher retention was high and our test scores were the best in the county despite lower teacher incomes.

Our bus drivers and cafeteria workers pay had been static since the 70s and their income was &lt;$5 an hour, which resulted in a strike and informational picket, which because of the unwillingness to pass a bond item meant that we went without cafeteria workers or bus services for more than a year. The teachers were forbidden to strike as well because they had a different union and because of their contracts. Our school superintendents reaction to the striking of the people who used to feed and drive the community's children wasn't exactly.....rational. He hired a security service to protect us from the middle aged ladies waving signs at us and bought 15 vending machines to 'compensate' for the lost lunch services.  As it turned out the low rate security service had a few ex-felons on staff, including one with a rape rap. The controversy gave the teachers union the leverage to force the community to once again pass the controversial bond item...a dread $4 a person.

My point here is teacher's union doesn't just exist to protect teachers jobs. At the local level they typically have a very real concern for the value of the education they provide and for the experience of the kids. On an individual level there are good and bad teachers but they are as a group, out of their own self interest and a care for the kids in their class, the only people acting in the defense of the quality of education.

tl;dr the national education debate attempts to cast teachers unions only as selfish organizations only protecting bad teachers jobs but thy have real potential for measurable good in their communities."

I have lived in Montreal for about a year, and I go back every now and then because my Fiancee Lives there. I took two semesters of school at Concordia, and my French is at an intermediate level. I am a US citizen living in California, and at the end of this year I will graduate with a Bachelors of Science degree in computer information systems.

I am planning to be in Montreal this summer for a couple months (June-August perhaps) and I want to know what I should be trying to do then while I am there, and what I can do to improve my chances of getting a job by the time I graduate. I have been looking into internships over the summer, but mostly all of them do it through the schools there. I hope to get a job under the NAFTA agreement (computer systems analyst) as I understand it will be quite easier to get a work visa (plus that is the kind of job I wanted anyway). Does anyone have any experience with this or any advice for me?

Thanks!"
pryii,30,2012-02-16,"So, these people came to my college class to get me into an internship and then things got weird, more info inside",MistressFey,WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/pryii/so_these_people_came_to_my_college_class_to_get/,"Representatives of a company came to my **college class** to recruit for a summer internship. They had us fill at a survey/contact info, but never gave the company name. My teacher seemed a bit weird-ed out by it, but let them do their thing and I sort of forgot all about it until I actually got an internship offer. After meeting with them tonight and actually learning about the place, southwestern advantage, I came home and decided to do a bit of research before my second interview tomorrow. This is what I found:

[http://southwesterncompanytruth.com](http://southwesterncompanytruth.com)

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Company)

[http://somedayallthis.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-southwestern-company-door-to-door-deception/](http://somedayallthis.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-southwestern-company-door-to-door-deception/)


WTF? How are these people allowed on college campuses to recruit students? If I hadn't looked into it I would have probably considered the program as I'm only a sophomore and it's hard to get an engineering internship at that level of education and I thought they were legit since they were allowed to present **in my class** at a **major university**.
This is their website, 
[http://southwesternadvantageprogram.com/](http://southwesternadvantageprogram.com/)
I'm not asking you to go there and attack them, I just want to make sure no one falls into this trap by thinking this company is associated with any academic insinuation. I'd also be interested in hearing stories from people who have worked with them.

[Edit1: I've provided a step by step look at what you do with this company over the summer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/pryii/so_these_people_came_to_my_college_class_to_get/c3rvgam)

TL;DR A major scam company was allowed to come to **my college class with the teacher present,** take student contact information, and try to recruit me for an ""internship"" selling their products door to door for the summer with no wages other than commission, with no provided food or housing, in a random part of the US away from my home and anyone I know. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

UPDATE!
So I heard back from my professor and she said she had no idea who this group was. When I told her about them it turns out that she has dealt with this group before. They came to her house one summer and, when she didn't buy anything, kept coming back once a week and trying to sell to her. It drove her crazy! She won't be letting them in her class again. I also spoke to one of the head of my college and she said she'd look into making sure all of the teachers know about this.

As for the group, I had one final meeting with them to tell them no and was very alarmed by what the girl I spoke to told me. She was super excited about how she'd work from 8am to 10pm, 6 days a week, every summer, and acted like it was the best thing in the world. She also told me that the stories at the southwestern truth site listed above are all true, but that's just because those people didn't follow the companies ""plan"" for how to sell. I was also informed of the companies safety policy for females. If you go to a house and a man answers the door, ask for a female. If there is no adult female present, speak to the man outside or move on. If a woman is present, it is safe to enter the house... NO IT'S NOT! O.o Females can be rapists and murderers too, but this company tell college age girls that, as long as there is a girl there, you're safe.... &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 

Anyway, my ordeal is done and I hope this helps others avoid this program as it sounds really terrible! "

He was in a LDR before with a previous girlfriend which ended badly (girl was crazy though; told him she was pregnant to get him to stay). He knows I am completely different from her but I think this is the reason he seems hesitant about me leaving. He just gets really sad and doesn't want to talk about me leaving even though it is in a few months. I had told him it is going to be ok and even showed him some things we could do together even though we are going to be apart.

pvh8g,1,2012-02-18,Too many interests: I don't know what I want in life anymore or who I want to be,ThoreauIsCool,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pvh8g/too_many_interests_i_dont_know_what_i_want_in/,"As a child, I have always enjoyed fiction, fantasy and history - whether within the quiet and reserved context of History Channel documentaries or Disney movies (Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily my favorite stylistically and thematically). I've always loved the worlds portrayed and used to wish I could live in those times. Indeed, my strongest academic subjects are the humanities: history and English I have consistently enjoyed all my life, both as hobbies and as classes. I love the hands-on, speculative nature of these subjects, how they give you so much creative and analytical freedom.

I've been told time and time again that I'd make a good archaeologist, anthropologist, curator, something of the sort. I could definitely fancy a nice job in a museum, helping to date and sort pieces. Everything about the past fascinates me, to the point it's almost a childishly nostalgic, Holden Caulfield-esque obsession. Some of the more trivial examples? I love the handpainted backgrounds of old cartoons, old boxy-framed cars, EGA 16-color computer games, what have you. Even the old Windows 9x icons, I felt, had more character and descriptiveness about them than the increasingly glossy, gradient-filled icons that have been plaguing the Windows OS since XP and now well into 7.
What's wrong with history, then? I don't know - I'm not a big academics person and I don't think I could ever commit myself to a job in history. One typically requires a master's or Ph.D in order to attain safe employment, but I don't want to teach either. I like to be my own boss and keep my options open, something I really don't think I'd be able to maintain if I had to fall back to becoming a professor.

I also have an interest in graphic design and website design, the former of which I've done a lot for my school over the years. I was assistant and later chief editor of our high school newspaper's layout in the last two years, and I really enjoy designing things like posters, logos, what have you. I really enjoyed working on the school's paper, just hanging out, throwing ideas around with one another and improvising with everything. A productive and creative atmosphere to work in, one I truly reveled in. I don't consider myself very good though, and whilst I do want to do some intern stuff whilst in college in this field, I don't know if it's right for me as a longtime career. I can only work on things that truly compel me, and I feel as though expanding this into a full-blown profession would sap me of my motivation and creativity.
 
My dad is a photo retoucher and graphic designer, and as much as I share his passion, I have the problem of questioning myself and my abilities all the time.

This is where things get particularly confusing. I've also had a huge passion for game design since I was a child. I've done a lot of game modding, particularly level design and texture artwork. Unfortunately, I seldom get anything done - admittedly suffering from a bit of an inferiority complex, it won't be long before I decide to completely scrap a map for whatever reason. I'll often imagine a modification fully complete, or imagine one totally cool room in a custom map, but then anywhere from an hour to weeks into development I'll realize I just have nothing else to work with to create the rest of the project. And then I scrap it.

Here's an analogy that only some gaming veterans who've really been in tune with the developers over the years will get. I think of myself a lot like Ken Rolston or John Romero - a visionary, who likes to do a bit of anything and everything and thinks about the final product, but often gets in over his head. I've had so many ambitious ideas for games, but I never get far with them. And I don't know what part of game design I'm best at - I can do everything but program, which kind of sucks because it means I can't really entertain any of my ideas.

As stated, I definitely am more of a theory sort of person when it comes to design, not a technical ""this is how it has to be"" sort. I think I'd be really good at writing or world design - focusing on the big picture, how the story or factions play out, how a city is designed and the history behind its architecture. There's one story in particular I've been gradually fomenting in the back of my head, that I definitely want to make into an adventure game someday. You know who I'd like to be like, sometimes? Yahtzee Croshaw. Someone who just kind of gets to do a bit of everything in designing games. Adventure and role-playing games are certainly my favorite genres, I'll tell you that.

I've kind of bounced around between level design, art, what have you. Texture design is the only area in which I feel moderately up to par with the skills of, say, a student of my age specializing in such a field. Jack of all trades, master of none. It's also the only website I've ever technically ""finished"", even though it's lacking some images and full of placeholders at that. I know the ins and outs of HTML/CSS/PHP, but I have virtually no incentive to use them unfortunately. I'm redesigning a non profit organization's website for a friend this month, but I don't know how well that'll go. I need to work on aesthetics for sure.

But I don't know where to go from here - I've considered simply keeping all the design stuff as a hobby, of course - most game developers start out that way. However, I don't know what to do for college. I was thinking of becoming an English major possibly, since I'd have a lot of freedom in what to work in. Too bad they get such a bad rep. I was thinking it'd be cool, somewhere down the line, to start my own printing/publishing business or something of the sort. Something on a local level, that's both involved and fulfilling to my want to play around with different aspects of design. I definitely want to play it safe though, to a degree. The fact my parents are baby boomers doesn't help much as my dad is pushing into his mid 60's. I want to be well-established, for my parents to be proud of me. Not go the way of some Bohemian hipster designer who's living in between social security checks. It's far too late for that.

I've had innumerable hobbies, interests and projects over the years, and yet I can never bring myself to stick to one of them. I can't commit myself to being a particular person - I simply feel it would be contrary to my (our) nature to live one's entire life as, say, ""that guy who makes the &lt;video games/artwork/short stories&gt;."" I have no real goals to aspire to in life, other than having the time and money necessary for me to sustain myself and my hobbies.

But familiarity is extremely important to me - if not in interactions with others than in personal rituals and routines. I'm a pretty conservative person (both politically and socially) and there's very much a sense that I can only do something if I understand it. I'd sooner fail a project than do some impersonal, ingenuine half-baked job that doesn't speak my true colors. I've abandoned lots of projects over the years (video game mods, stories) because I feel as though I'm not doing them proper justice. People will tell me that they thought my work was brilliant, and I'm simply too much of a perfectionist, but I simply lack the fortitude with which to tell myself that's the truth. I feel as though the notion of work, the thrill of starting a new project, is far more gratifying to me than actually completing it - perhaps it's because I'm more interested in distracting myself than attempting to evoke some particular response or criticism from others.

As a child, I was always lauded as brilliant in school - and looking back retrospectively, so many friends and family members wonder where I went wrong. People tell me of how much they would strive to achieve were they in my position, and why is it that I don't put my creative and intellectual energies to some great endeavor? I simply feel no reason to - it's pitiful, because I feel a strong sense of obligation and duty to my family and society at large.

I had a leg up on other kids in school, and yet my constant indecisiveness and self-doubt have led me astray. In in my hobbies and schoolwork, I'm constantly working frenetically, stretching myself thin if you will, to strive to be a jack of all trades because I don't know what I truly want to do - writing, artwork, video game design, etc. I had the potential and the opportunities with which to do virtually anything I wanted, to change the world, and yet I didn't act on them. Because I didn't specialize, and simply continued to try and remain on top of everything - for instance, I had wanted to do graphic design when I was a kid, and whilst in the beginning I would say I had a greater inherent talent for it than others, I would get stuck in a depressive rut, whislt other kids who had less ability but were more passionate about the field would take classes and do work.

And now everybody else has grown up and found their place in the world, and in spite of everything I had when I was younger, it's all been utterly wasted. The only thing I still feel even remotely confident about is my ability in writing, but nothing else. And there are some days, in my darker moments, where even that I completely shirk in favor of being an unproductive slob. I feel cursed for how my mind can wander so freely, and have such hunger to explore so many different fields whilst I have left my own social person and interaction with others blank and unrevealing."

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?

&gt;&gt;I needed an AOL screen name and had just visited Ireland. I thought it flowed off the tongue well.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?

&gt;&gt;Just the one. I haven't caused any problems that warranted abandoning this account.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?

&gt;&gt;The incredibly broad range of topics and stories that you can read and discuss. I don't know anywhere else that offers such a broad supply of content and commentary.

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?

&gt;&gt;Study, read, take a walk, listen to music, travel

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?

&gt;&gt;I think a significant amount of the growth has come from memes and macros, like the kind found in F7U12 and AdviceAnimals. More people are coming to reddit for specific niches of content, like memes and MMOs like SC2, TF2 and LoL, not joining the site as a whole and discovering subreddits they find interesting.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?

&gt;&gt;Reddit has always been what you make of it. The default front page was never a pinnacle of rationality as some old-timers (and more recent redditors) contend. Sensational and misleading headlines have been earning the top spots from the beginning.
At this point, I'm not subscribed to any default reddits, and haven't been for some time. The largest communities I'm subscribed to are /r/sex and /r/Android with just over 100k members. I don't envy the job of the moderators running the larger ones, since they have a nearly impossible task to enforce their rules (if they want to).

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?

&gt;&gt;I'm a moderator of a few communities in the RepublicOfReddit network. If you're looking for replacements for many of the default reddits that maintain a higher signal:noise ratio and have transparent moderation, come visit us in /r/RepublicOfPolitics, /r/RepublicOfAtheism, and /r/RepublicOfReddit. If you've ever complained about reddit or think you can do better, come see how much of a difference you can make."
pxsxk,0,2012-02-20,A perspective on yellow fever and interracial dating,whitedudesproblems,asiantwoX,https://www.reddit.com/r/asiantwoX/comments/pxsxk/a_perspective_on_yellow_fever_and_interracial/,"This is sort of a response to the Lena Chen article that is on the top of this subreddit right now.

About *my* supposed ""yellow fever"": I was in China for an internship and have to do a complimentary language course in university . I was accused of yellow fever the second I started studying in University.

I'm a white dude and have been together with my pinay girlfriend for 3 years now. I am quite used to the looks we get on the street. (There are not many asian-white couples where I live) One thing I will never get used to though is the jokes I get on a regular basis from friends, family, or just random people at parties etc. I was accused of ""yellow fever"" so many times its not even funny. Its hard enough for SEA-white couples to get over all this ""does she love you long time?"" thing that still far too many people have in the back of their mind. Wearing a suit to work hasn't been much helpful with the ""your girlfriend is a mail order bride"" for me either. Being accused of yellow fever is additionally hurtful. What most people dont realize is that its extremely devaluing for a relationship to get called names like that.. As if the relationship is based on some kind of sexual fetish.

As asian girls are the most recent culprits of accusing me the most of my ""yellow fever"" I'd like to get a perspective on how you think about this. I have felt that some asian girls tend to abuse the word to poison existing and new relationships from the getgo. I also feel like the word is hurtful to any cross cultural relationships while being nationalistic and or sometimes flat out racist on its own. I have never heard the word mentioned in a positive way. So why keep asian girls using it so frequently? 

WARNING CONTROVERSIAL 

I feel that some girls feel entitled that they are the center of a ""fetish"" and abuse it to be condescending and get a sense of superiority.

And how is yellow fever different from the the ""gay-gene"" ? As in: you are born to like certain traits. And how is it treated so differently. Its as if gays were accusing gays of homosexuality. Why is it deemed to be pathological anyways? Most guys like blonde hair. Now liking black hair is sick?

END CONTROVERSIAL

I'd also like to know what you think ""yellow fever"" exactly is and why its so ""creepy"" to some girls. For me -- I am not into anime, I dont watch hentai. I dont watch korean dramas. I am mostly interested in asia business-wise. My girlfriend and I met by pure luck. My ex and I aswell. She was - interestingly - half asian. Which got me comments like ""you slowly get hooked on asian"". So asian girls are drugs aswell. 

So for me there might be a pattern here even though I might not be typical. But is my interest in asia now off putting? I've always felt like similar interest rarely hurt a relationship.

I also dislike the idea that one can get ""identified"" with yellow fever. As if my love for her is some kind of unnatural disease. 

I hope my rant is somewhat comprehendable. I am typing this on the train right now. I'd love to get a view on things so please leave comments aplenty.

I met her three years ago and she is the kind of person you only meet once in a lifetime. And, of course, I screwed it all up.

We were good friends for 8 months (I waited too long to clear my true intentions, I guess), dated for almost a year and a half and it's been 10 months since we broke up. Our relationship had many problems, but I think the main reason of its ending was my inability to handle them the right way. I was too jealous, controlling and impulsive. I blamed the society and her friends for influencing her to do things I disapproved, when it wasn't really up to me to decide all that. I judge people a lot (maybe I'll be a judge someday, maybe not).

After we broke up, I lost it. She was too important in my life, and that's never good. I lacked of other things to keep me interested and occupied when I wasn't with her, and once I figured I wouldn't be with her again, everything went down. Things got out of control and she filed a restraining order against me (and it gets better: I'm a law student). Her family was scared and who can blame them? I would've done the same thing or worse If I had a daughter and some guy wouldn't stop annoying her and going after her against her will. Long story short, I spent my 21st birthday afternoon in a police station explaining myself. I talked to a professor of mine and lawyered up. He solved the hole thing without getting me involved.

The fact is, after all that, I still miss her and don't know what do with myself. I've tried lots of things, good and bad. I searched for psychological and psychiatric help and started taking anti depressives; I used cocaine, which I regret; I spent a month in Europe (I could easily be living in London, but I can't just drop off college now); I started to practice Boxing and returned to play football, but injured my knee; I got in touch with old friends; I dedicated myself into a 4 months internship at the Federal Courts of Justice in Brazil (in case I didn't mention, that's where I'm from).

I'm much more mature now and I'm certain that I could do things differently, but I'm also certain that she will never be with me again. The thing is, at the end of the day, I can't help thinking about her and feel sad for everything. And I'm sure she doesn't waist any second of her life thinking about me anymore and is probably having fun with her friends - it's Carnival weekend over here. So I wanted to ask (finally) for some real advice, something huge. It could be anything, like growing a beard (even tho I'm incapable of doing that), rent a Jeep and live in northern Norway. I don't care, I just want some ideas and advices to help me get thru this. 

And I know this is probably a cliche question, but believe me, this wasn't just a normal relationship break up for me. It's much harder, much deeper. The ""you'll find someone else"" is useless. I have issues regarding social relationships (you can probably tell by now) and I connected with her like I only do with one other person in the world, my little brother who has Down Syndrome and is a very special person.

Don't know If anyone is going to read this, but writing and talking always helps me put my thoughts in order. And If you did read, thank you for your time.

pxala,1,2012-02-19,IAmA young band manager AMA about your band making it!,[deleted],musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/pxala/iama_young_band_manager_ama_about_your_band/,"I have been infatuated with music for quite some time, and have always been very social and outgoing. I play guitar and sing relatively well, but decided that the music business was a good path to go on. In 2007 I enrolled as an Entertainment and Arts Management major at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. Classes included ""Arts Writing for Non-Profits"" to ""Touring and Promotions""... that being said, you really learn the real shit through the real world.
After interning with Umphrey's McGee, a midsize rock group based in Chicago, I was able to take in a variety of skills and tips to make it as a grassroots band/organization. Through UM I was also able to work two major festivals, including Lollapalooza which I will be doing again this August for my fourth year.
For my second internship, I took my skill set and decided to go big and apply it to a group that I figured had MGMT and a label, but really only had good buzz. Cheers Elephant ( www.cheerselephant.com ), a psych-rock group out of PHL, decided to take me on as their manager in March 2010. I was 20-years-old, managing four 24-28 year-olds who had already established a local buzz. My mission was to continue to build them in a variety of ways: structure Cheers as a business, polish their online presence, stay engaged with connections, tour, acquire new fans, etc. allowing them to focus on the creative side of things.
So, it's been about two years, and I'd like to think I've made a great impression in Philadelphia and beyond. We're about to release our third record that is truly going to put us on another level... which is all you can ask for. Constantly going for the next level. However, I've stacked the deck to have it all lean in our favor. Great album production, multiple music videos, new website, full blown PR campaign, and a tour to support the new record.
I've promoted a sold out show, I've taken a meeting in an NYC high-rise with fancy A&amp;R dudes, I've been a roadie, I made a tour poster, I've been a stage manager, I've sold merch, I've restrung a guitar, I drove the van... That's the key: you must be able to wear all the hats. Not too bad for a 22 year-old.
There's another key thing to mention, which I feel can apply to all aspects of life. Love what you're doing, love what you sell. People can see the bullshit in your teeth. I will never represent a band that I wouldn't listen to on my way to work, or recommend to a friend. First and foremost I am music fan, and you can't lose sight of that. Being a legitimate fan of your product, you have the ability to intellegently talk about it for hours on end because you are honestly into it. Common sense? You'd be surprised.
Some parting comments: 1. You hear it all the time, but networking is truly key. To make it in a scene, you must be immersed in it inside and out.
You should be spending most of your personal money on attending other bands shows. Introduce yourself, mention your band, and they'll likely return the favor.
Engage with fans, often.
Release new content, often. The whole world has ADHD now.
Things don't happen to you, you make things happen. Get used to it.
If you're a starting band, play as many shows that makes sense. If you're an established band, don't over saturate and keep your audience wanting more.
RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL. Even if some lame band looking to open for you. Kindly point them in the right direction- you'll never know if you'll be opening for them one day.
Embrace change. It is absolutely possible to make money in the music industry, you just need to be smart.
Reach high. Fake it 'till you make it.
There is no fucking formula! Talent and skill evolves into a variety of lucky encounters which in turn breaks your band. It's a numbers game.
Any who, if you are a starting band/manager/arts presenter that is interested in my insight, please feel free to ask!
BTW, here's Cheers Elephant's brand new video. Let me know what you think! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgMChsTx7GQ"

My name is Andrew Frink, I am an intern at the Louisville Nature Center. A truly unique community resource, the Louisville Nature Center offers wonderful opportunities for nature study and recreation--right in the heart of the city! Part of the Nature Center’s goal is the give a well rounded nature education to the community and to local schools. The Nature Center is often the destination of school trips and family outings.

Currently, the Nature Center has many displays and live animals that are kept on exhibit to help educate and inform visitors about the level of biodiversity in the state of Kentucky. While the Nature Center has snakes, snails, frogs and even a salamander, the Nature Center does not have a display highlighting the vast series of streams and rivers in Kentucky. The commonwealth contains over 90,000 miles of streams containing over 250 different Native Species of fish. We have the largest amount of navigable 
water in any state (except for Alaska).
  
The Green River System is ranked in the top 5 river systems for diversity in the United States, this precious resource deserves to be protected and appreciated. Everyday, the rivers of Kentucky are continually polluted by everything from mining to urbanization. The first step to protecting this resource is to understand and appreciate its natural beauty.

As a intern at the Nature Center, I would like to set-up an educational display highlighting the natural beauty of the Kentucky Rivers. The display will include a river aquarium containing native plants and several species of wild caught native fish as well as an educational poster. In order for the display to be possible, I will need donations from wherever I can get them. I would LOVE to recognize Reddit and/or Redditors for helping with my project!

I think it would be awesome to put the Reddit logo on the display to let people know that my project was made a success in part by this community. Obviously, I’d follow up with pictures and videos of the completed display.

In the rare event of excess donation, all extra donations will go directly to the Louisville Nature Center. In fact, all money will go to them first and then they will allow me a budget for the project.

I guess PM me if you have anything to offer or comment/upvote for support.

Thank You,

Andrew

pz0v5,5,2012-02-21,"""We raised you better than this.""",anxietyistheworst,familysupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/familysupport/comments/pz0v5/we_raised_you_better_than_this/,"tl;dr version- I'm 26, I started working in NYC about six months ago and have been saving up money to move out of my house in NJ since.  I found an awesome place to live with two guys that I know and trust.  I told my family (my grandma and aunt whom I live with and my mom) and they told me I was not allowed to move in with guys / to Elmhurst, NYC / with roommates at all.  What the fuck do I do.

long version aka backstory &gt;

I've always butted heads with my family.  They are very strict and set in their ways whereas I have always felt the need to explore the world and get out there and see things for myself.  They like to watch a lot of television and never leave the house, but I never wanted that kind of life.  I found school to be my niche early on, when my family members were fighting, I was always safe with books and my own world.  I was given a computer at 13 and made a lot of internet friends and found punk rock.  I loved going to shows and had to fight with my mom and grandma to let me go for years.  The first time I wanted to go to a club show with my friends (to see Dashboard Confessional play acoustic!), I made a powerpoint to show my mom I wasn't going to get hurt.  She let me go.

When I wanted to go to college, I had to fight to go away to school. I got a BA in English in 2008 and came home and couldn't find a job.  I had planned on going to grad school right away but I broke my leg that fall. I had to cancel my honors thesis and live at home while I spent the semester in a wheelchair.  My mom worked from home at the time and I kept going to two classes so I could graduate on time.  That summer, my mom told me that I wasted all of her money because I got a useless degree, despite it being something I was really passionate in.  She said if I didn't go to grad school by fall of 2009, she would kick me out of the house.  I got in, worked full or part time for most of the semesters, spent summer 2010 taking an online class, interning in NYC twice a week, and working retail in NJ to afford my unpaid internship so I could graduate in October.  A job landed in my lap near the end of the summer.  The pay wasn't great but it was my dream job and an opportunity I couldn't pass up.  My family didn't want me to take it because of the money.  I did anyway.  I have never been happier in this respect, I am totally in love with my job and it is exactly what I want to be doing with my life. 

Last month, a friend on a music message board I've been posting on for two years told me they were looking for a new roommate.  This, again, was an opportunity that fell into my lap and wouldn't happen again.  It was in my budget, in a really nice neighborhood, would cut my commute in half, and I could take my pet with me.  I checked out the place and loved it.

The next day, I told my grandma and aunt I found a place and was really excited to move out. They immediately said no.  I explained that it was in my budget, I had researched the area and it was safe, I loved the place, and I was ready to move.  I didn't want to discuss moving with them at all previous because I felt like if I did, they would have shut it down.  If I had everything all set to go, how could they say no?  They started asking questions about the people I'd be living with.  When I said they were both 30 year old dudes, I was asked ""what kind of 30 year old men would lure a 26 year old girl to live with them"" and ""what kind of man would want to date you when they find out you have two male roommates. you will never find a boyfriend.""  My grandma was livid and told me that she raised me better than this.  I asked her what it meant, what is better than completing two higher ed degrees, starting a career in a recession, and finding a safe affordable place to live on my own?  She scoffed and never gave me an answer.  They argued that I was not street smart enough to live in the city, despite the fact that I've been working there for half a year now.  That these men, no matter how often I run into them at concerts, will just steal my things and rape me in my sleep.  I offered to invite them over but they refused. I asked why they didn't trust me or my judgement in this and they said that it wasn't me they didn't trust, just everyone else in the world.  They said they didn't want me moving until I could afford a place on my own and when I said that I did not want to live alone, I wanted roommates, they said that there's three people they know that they would let me live with.  None of them want to live in NYC. 

I went to my mom's after this and she had a little bit of a cooler head but was offended I didn't discuss anything, she said that wasn't adult of me.  I told her my reasoning (if its in place, how could anyone say no) and she still said it was childish and proof I shouldn't survive on my own. I explained to her that I am not afraid of the world, and I don't want to be.  I see how fear cripples her, my grandma, and my aunt and I don't want that to be my life.  I want to experience things for myself and live my own life now.  I need to fuck up and learn things for myself, I can't just go by hearsay anymore.  She again said that roommates cannot be trusted (if you left your world there and went to work, would they take everything you own?) and gave me a list of things she hated that I did that prove I am not an adult (stay up too late, don't eat breakfast before I go to work, go to shows) and would rather I waited until I had my job for a year before I started looking for a place.  I understand that, but with the hours I work, it's really hard to make the NJ trains home.  If I lived somewhere subway accessible, I wouldn't have to stress out so much, trains would run more than once an hour.

However, my mom did say that she would think about it if she looked at the apartment with me.  Which is hopeful I guess?  But still incredibly, incredibly frustrating.  All my friends and coworkers think this whole situation is completely absurd.  I don't know what to do now.  I hate airing this shit on the internet but I really am at a loss for how to proceed.  My move in date is April first, so I have some time to figure this shit out, but not much.  What should I do, Reddit?

Sorry for the tl;dr. I just felt like the backstory was necessary."

pyp3a,1,2012-02-20,"Interviewing with VMware, looking for any advice.",vmwarethrowaway,vmware,https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/pyp3a/interviewing_with_vmware_looking_for_any_advice/,"I have an interview with VMware for an inside sales intern position. I am an MIS major and know a good bit about cloud computing conceptually, but have never really had any hands on experience with their products. I don't know that I want to do sales forever, but I figure while I am young it will be good and help my interpersonal skills grow. 

I have done some research and started looking at their white papers as well as history and some financial articles, but I can't really find much on the culture at VMware. I know that until recently it has been under a female CEO which probably means they're big on gender equality, but that doesn't really help me for the interview.

I've been lurking around this subreddit and have learned more from it than anything else I can find. I figure that technical knowledge doesn't get me too far with a recruiter, but a broader knowledge of the company would. I hope this doesn't come across as laziness on my part. I am just really excited about this interview and don't want to waste my one opportunity with VMware.

Any advice for the interview, links to good articles, general knowledge of VMware, you could share would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone knows anywhere to point me for salesforce.com information that would be great. They use it and it wouldn't hurt to know a little about it as well.

Thanks!"
pyma5,1,2012-02-20,I don't want to lie to her about me dating other girls. Is it even necessary to tell her that I am?,LA_ultimate_crush,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pyma5/i_dont_want_to_lie_to_her_about_me_dating_other/,"The girl and I have be dating each other for almost 2 months now and we decided that we were ""seeing each other""... but not in a relationship. The reason why is because she might be leaving to Japan to teach english or for some internship.. I forget.. and she still needs to find her individuality. 

Anyways.. I'm guessing we're not exclusive? I'm so confused with terminologies in ""dating"" ""seeing each other"" ""exclusive"" etc.

So I was wondering, if I'm going to go out with other girls.. should I give her a heads up or talk to her about them? She told me she's not trying to see anyone else, just me. But at the same time, I don't know if that makes us in a relationship or am I able to date other girls? 

I mentioned to her I recently got a girls number at the bar, she got upset for a hot second but cool down because she knew we weren't together. And I asked her so where do we stand with dating other people? She said something along the lines of ""If we do start seeing someone and start getting serious with them, then we should tell each other"" I told her she was the only one I'm seeing right now. But we're still not in a relationship I think.. I still want to play the game.. she said I can go get girls numbers.. Should I tell her, when it does happen, the day when I go out with someone else.. I don't want to lie to her.. I want her to tell me if she was going out with someone.. I just want to keep my options open because we might not even be a sure thing.

Any advice?"
q17c0,8,2012-02-22,I felt a bit down today; GF shot down my feelings,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q17c0/i_felt_a_bit_down_today_gf_shot_down_my_feelings/,"Me - 22/m
Her - 20/f

Been dating for little over a year.

Today I had a little of a breakdown about my weight. I was getting dressed and looking at myself in the mirror, I just did not like the way I looked in a dress shirt. I went to the internship fair yesterday in the same getup and I had no problem with how I looked; I felt confident. Today was different. I'm usually not sensitive about my weight (I've been doing something about it, I'm pretty active, lost 60lbs already) but it just hit me for no reason. 

I texted my girlfriend how disgusting I felt and looked and I just wanna crawl back into bed. She responds with ""I didn't know I was dating a 12 year old girl."" This really hurt me, because the person I trust a lot just shot down my feelings. I felt crushed. I told her I was sensitive about it today and that I felt hurt. She says while she knows the feeling, it's still childish of me, and that it's all her fault that I'm feeling this way. When I asked for a little support, she said all I'm doing is whining, and she'll talk to me later.

This isn't the first time. When I feel down and go to her for support or someone to talk to, I get told I'm a child or immature for having these feelings, and she won't talk to me for hours. After ignoring me for hours, she'll come around and actually talk, but will not be apologetic. It's starting to take a toll on me because I feel I'm losing a support pillar, and I can't trust anyone with how I feel. When I tell her that it's not right she does this, she gets very defensive and says it's all her fault. 

Am I overreacting about this, or is she just being insensitive? Any and all input will be appreciated. 

**Edit:** I should add that I rarely get upset about my weight. In fact this is the first time I felt weird about it in at least 4 years. I am a very confident guy who knows what he is. I get the fat jokes from my roommates everyday, and I deal with it because I know I'm chubby and they're teasing. Also to add on the support thing: I'm usually the one who emotionally supports my SO when she's down. The past month or so she's gotten really upset over silly things, but I did not tell her they were silly or stupid, but rather I comforted her and told her silly jokes and played with her hair, or sent her cute pictures. It kinda sucks when I have a bad day (which is very rarely), she's nowhere to be found emotionally, and shuts me out. "

q13qu,0,2012-02-22,My SO's father treats him like shit and it's pissing me off. Afraid it's gonna affect our relationship now. Help!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q13qu/my_sos_father_treats_him_like_shit_and_its/,"27/F here, he's 24/M. Together 3 years.

Little back story, I have worked my hands to the bone since I was 15 years old. I have no college education, I have supported myself all these years and lived on my own a lot longer than him. I come from an extremely poor family and I am the only child who has moved out of the over crowded house. My other siblings live at home and help pay bills. I've been on my own since 17, lived a rather traumatic young adulthood.

My boyfriend comes from a wealthy family, has some college education and during the 3 years we've been together he was going to school. He's lived a really good life, except his dad has always put him on the back burner and has generally ignored him. He's never held a job while we have been together cause his mom just gave him money, basically. He's done 2 unpaid internships for like...2 months. In fact, I lived with him and his parents for a year and finally had enough of it and moved out 2 months ago, took him with me.

His dad is the money maker. Man has millions of dollars. I have no relationship with him, we don't really speak. I think he treats his son like shit, loves his son in law more than him and his daughter gets whatever she wants. His parents have just a fucked up, bizarre marriage (one sleeps on the couch, the other in the bed). Recently my SO got his associates in science...and then told his dad he didn't want to be a doctor. His dad wanted him to be a doctor and thats not what he wanted to do. He wants to be a chef. His dad says ok, cool. Tells him to find a culinary school, he'll pay for it.

His dad owns several businesses and my SO has a sister who is my age with 2 kids and she's married. The sister's husband works for his dad and his dad loves this dude way more than his own kid. He buys his daughter and son in law everything. He helped purchase their first home, paid for both of them to go to school (they both dropped out after a year), pays for the grand kids ""school"" (it's fucking daycare...school for kids under 2 my ass), bought them a huge TV, grill, furniture...whatever they want. My SO is luckier than most people, though...thanks to his mom. His mom slips him cash when he visits and runs errands for her. She makes sure that he's got a car, his cell phone is paid for and his insurance. 

A few weeks ago I got on my SO's ass about school (I'm paying our rent, bills, etc the money his mom gives him is used for gas in his truck and whatever he wants to spend it on like helping out with groceries). Eventually in my eyes, his dad is gonna find out mom is slipping him money and cut it off real quick. So he asks his dad if he can start school. His dad tells him ""Sure, but you're paying for your own school."" My SO said ""but...dad...you said you would pay for it so I'm not drowning in debt from loans."" His father said: ""I never agreed to pay for culinary school. No."" I hit the fucking roof. He told my SO, his mom, his uncle...and said in front of me that he would pay for it and he totally welched on his offer. My SO tried to tell him he did and his father is one of those guys where his word is law, it doesnt matter how many people heard him say it...he's right and everyone else is wrong. You can't argue with him or change his mind because he does not cave in.

It's gotten to the point where I hate the guy. I can't stand him, I don't want to be around him and I resent him. I don't understand why he treats his son like shit. He has made fun of him in front of the whole family during the holidays, he has no interest in meeting my family (my parents invited him to a birthday dinner for me they scraped and saved for and he turned them down), he purposely will pick a fight with you about anything if you disagree with him (I watched my SO's cousin fly at my SO's father in a rage over a debate about science and the guy is working on his masters, my SO's father has no college education), he has a just complete asshole personality to anyone who doesnt agree with him. I absolutely love my SO's mom and I want to continue seeing her when I can...but not with his dad around.

I just don't know what to do. I want my guy to go to school NOW but he refuses to get loans. He wants to save up for school...but he's been supposedly job hunting and nothing has come of it. I'm paying all our bills plus my car note, full coverage insurance and my cell phone on barely $10 an hour. His dad has the money and won't help his kid. I feel like he resents his son and I don't know why. We moved out because I was sick of living there, the drive was much longer for me to and from work and being around the bizarre marriage was putting stress on us. His mom hides things and tells us about it and his dad is never home. His mom got real sick around the holidays and we wanted to take care of her but his dad kept pushing our help aside like we're bumbling idiots so I said fuck this, I gotta get out of this crazy house.

TL;DR: My SO's father is a rich asshole who refuses to help his kid, but favors the other one. He agreed to pay for his school and then backed out of the deal. I'm broke and want my guy to start his future ASAP. Don't want to be in another relationship again where I'm the financial support. What do I do? "

Mechanical Engineering/Robotics graduate,darksabrelord,SFBayJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayJobs/comments/q0ea2/seeking_recent_bs_mechanical_engineeringrobotics/,"I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Robotics and would be interested in jobs relating to aerospace, robotics, and mechanical design.

Through several internships and academic projects, I have developed a strong set of engineering skills. During my internship at NASA Ames Research Center, I developed a set of MATLAB and Simulink models to facilitate real-time analysis of disturbance forces and torques during orbit. I was also tasked with integrating these models into the main Simulink model for the orbiter, providing more accurate data for exact position and attitude during simulation. My supervisor commended me for my ability to take charge of the project and my problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to work with many different people within our team to accomplish my goals on time.

I developed leadership and teamwork skills through my involvement in academic projects such as this previous semester, where I participated on Carnegie Mellon’s Google Lunar X-Prize team.  My team of four undergraduate students was tasked with developing a trajectory controller for the descent sequence of the lander. Throughout the semester this project required a large amount of personnel organization and interfacing between our group, the course teaching assistants, and the professor. In order to maintain high levels of productivity I constantly identified future objectives and subdividing tasks in order to ensure the project was completed.

I am looking for any full-time positions available around the Bay Area. If you have any questions or wish to see a resume, please PM me. Thank you for your consideration.

q2mm3,1,2012-02-23,"My GF (of 2ish months), her ex(of 3 years) and me. Advice/Perspective Request.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q2mm3/my_gf_of_2ish_months_her_exof_3_years_and_me/,"So I did some searching concerning my  problem/feelings and how I feel to see if there have been any relevant posts. Compared to what some other people have posted with their SO's ex in their relationship, perhaps my feelings are unnecessary and petty. I am really new to relationships and figured I would give posting a shot. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to impart me with their logic and reasoning.... here it goes. 


I am 23, my gf (I'll call A) is 22. I met her about a year and a half ago when she was dating J, an acquaintance of mine. Sometimes I would hang out or go to the bars with J and his roommates, but we were never super close. I talked to A online and at school when I saw her and generally thought she was a great person. We would ride bikes together as we are both into road biking but I never thought anything more of it than just riding with a friend.


A and J had been dating for almost three years before they broke up last september. As we are all finishing our undergrads this year, A essentially broke up with J because (as she told me) she thought they didn't have a future together. [I have never heard of another reason but assume that there were other causes.] Anyways, A and I continued to talk a lot and I started to think something more could be there. I was very reluctant to push anything so I took my time trying to remain simply friends. She would always ask me to go out to the bars with her, go to parties with her, etc. I rarely obliged as I thought I would certainly lose control of myself if I was drunk around her and make a move. As time continued, we were hanging out more, but never in situations that could lead to hooking up. She seemed to be doing fine from her breakup with J and I had developed stronger feelings for her so one night I decided to go out with her and her roommates. We hooked up that night (as it was obvious we both wanted to) in mid November and have essentially slept together every night since then. We decided to make things official on new years. She is my first girlfriend I have loved, who has said she loves me, and who I genuinely want to spend all my time with. 


A told J that she had been hooking up with me in December (because she felt compelled to do so out of respect for him... I was in favor of the 'why does he need to know' option) which brought up a lot of hard feelings from J. J and I don't talk anymore as I know he resents me for being together with A. That doesn't concern me. Nonetheless, A and J remain friends in pretty close contact. When we go out at night, there is a good chance we run into J and his roommates. This happened once and was extremely uncomfortable for A and I. She can have a great time with him alone, but when I am involved, I hate the fact she feels we still have to hide being together in fear of running into J and his group of friends. 


I don't wish to insist that she stops talking to J, that seems irrational. I know she wants to remain friends as she isn't the burn bridges type but they text almost everyday and see each other outside of school perhaps once a week whether at a party or at a coffeeshop together. I guess it is weird for me that they remain in SUCH close contact, is this normal? I recently saw on her phone saying to him ""I keep on going back and forth about breaking up with you but think it is for the best."" It was very causally said in conversation but it really took me by surprise as she had told me she *was* over him and didn't love him anymore. I would never bring it up to her and say that I saw it on her phone, but feel very distraught and backseat because of it. (I brought up something I saw on her phone once along the lines of them hanging out. She wasn't pissed off I had read it, but asked that I respect the privacy of her conversations between her and friends, including J. I know I shouldn't have been looking at those messages, but whenever I see something like that, I can't help but think that my looking is ~~justified~~ probably causing more grief than if I just left it alone)


My own insecurities have taken a toll on me in the past when J and A would talk. I would tell her I feel left out of the picture and she would help talk me through it. I used to get really anxious if he texted her, but have since been able to more rationally cope with my feelings that doesn't imply increased heart rate. Though because she still talks to him so much and says things that she misses him (said to him back in Dec.) or is back and forth between breaking up but hinks its for the best (said last week) I still feel concerned about...something. ( I don't know what I'm concerned about myself, She tells me she loves me and I believe her, but don't know what my concern is ABOUT).  

Situational context: We have tickets to travel to europe for 3 weeks together after graduation and then she is moving away for a summer internship. After that she is going to grad school. I am also going to grad school(hopefully), but the closest locations to potential universities are 200 miles apart. I would love more than anything to stay together, but the most we have talked about is, ""if it is meant to happen, then it will"". I'm not sure how much I subscribe to that thought, I mean maybe, but it is hard to think about have an expiration date on the relationship with the first girl I have loved. It really is a discussion for after we hear back from grad schools. For now, we have tickets to europe together and I just hope she isn't texting J the entire time we are training through Switzerland. 

Sorry, I guess I don't have a solid question. More so I have used this as a platform to vent my concerns in hopes that someone can provide some sound advice (female and male) for a relationship newbie. 


TLDR: GF and her ex's history greatly overshadow our time together. Her talking to him gets me down because I feel left out and wish she would just forget about him, move on, and enjoy our time together.

q2g7r,3,2012-02-23,"Stuck between what I want, what I need, what I deserve and what I can't have.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/q2g7r/stuck_between_what_i_want_what_i_need_what_i/,"First of all, my apologies, though I was raised bilingual, I am not a native speaker. I am 21 and she is almost 22!

To start with this, I had a relationship of 4 years with a girl who I thought I'm going to marry and to this day, I still want that. But, in those 4 years together she has lived abroad for atleast a year, maybe even longer. During that time we would only see eachother during summers, during the time that she needed to be here and for family related things.

But in those 4 years, she cheated on me, when she was in China. I believe cheating is a horrible thing to do, but, being me I forgave here. That being said, she lied to me saying that she didn't cheat for 9 months! In all that time I knew and asked her many times if she cheated on me, she profoundly kept saying no. After she did tell me she was surprised by my reaction, I didn't get mad, I didn't get anything, only thing I felt was utter disgust. She cheated on me because she missed my embrace, my touch and just male attention.

But fast forward to now, and why I am making this post is this: I want to be with her, I want to live with her and I want to have kids with her. She wants this as well but our situation is dire. She still lives abroad and works there for an important company. But her contract will run out in a month, meaning that she has to find a new job. And, she insist on getting a job in the country she is in now even though she wants to spent her entire life with me. I could go to her country and study there after this semester, but that being said I have to give up my fantastic social life, my wonderful friends, my job, my internship and my honors college. Just for her. The fact she doesn't want to go back to my country is that she really fucking hates it. She hates it here and I don't want her to feel that, just for me. 

But, now I have met this wonderful girl, who is also quite a lot older than I am (almost 25) and overall is a great assest to my life. But, as soon as she starts talking about a relationship I get scared, I get really, really fucking scared. This happend twice with others girls before I met her. It's just this endless loop of wanting to be with my ex, then being with a different girl and then crawl back to my ex about how much I miss her. It's just, my mind is full of fuck, I can't just comprehend what to do and it's destroying me. This might be because I'm HSP as well, so most emotions do tend to look bigger then they are. It's just that I want to be with my ex, but I can't right now, but I can't have a girl being with me knowning that I want to be with my ex, I don't want to put her through any misery or false hope. I feel so caged in and I have spoken to my ex about this and we see no clear  answer. Help?

tl;dr: i want my ex, ex wants me, another girl in my life who I really like, no future with ex for now and no future possible from my side with new girl (mind full of fuck)"

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?

&gt;&gt;The best part of last year actually blossomed from my worst part of last year. I had to go to the hospital a few weeks before graduation which sucked. It made me stay in college for the summer to catch up on the work I missed over my 2 week hospital stay. But that summer one of the best summers I had filled with old friends, new friends, and a lot of alcohol

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be?

&gt;&gt;Better decisions as an undergrad

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?

&gt;&gt;I was once at my aunts house. She has 3 kids. One of the kids was bothering me so, offhandedly, I told him to go see what his sister was doing. Turns out his sister was playing Mario Kart on Wii under his account. They ended up fighting which caused my aunt to go see what was wrong. She started yelling which caused my grandma to yell at her which caused my uncle to step in. It caused a big family fight. I quietly left the house.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?

&gt;&gt;Happiness. It's often overlooked.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?

&gt;&gt;It's random. But I have learned recently that it's Latin for 'my plunder'. So there's that.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?

&gt;&gt;3 or 4

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?

&gt;&gt;All the small gems I find while writing for /r/subredditoftheday. It also gives me a smug sense of superiority when my non reddit friends show me something hours after I've seen it

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?

&gt;&gt;I watch a lot of TV and try to discover new music every day. And of course, 9gag

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?

&gt;&gt;Can't really say. I've only been redditing for a year.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?

&gt;&gt;Sure

* Her: That was fun, your sense of humor is not so dry when your tipsy
* Me: You're more fun to hang out with outside the office :)
* Her: I'm fun in and out of the office, you just don't see it... It's ok, I understand you don't find me adorable lol
* Me: Yea well you're still pretty cute
* Her: Ok!  Did my drunk friend make it home?  or are you guys spending the night together
* Her: Wait, don't answer the last part lol just answer the first one
* Me: Lol he got home, and no I'm not spending the night with your 'friend' lol
* Me: You don't have to pretend, I know you and ***** are madly in love ;)
* Her: I told you not to answer the last part lol... But at least I know ***** didn't get further than me lol
* Her: Is it that obvious?  Can't help it, I am a lover, I declared my platonic love to ********* today!
* Me: Haha

q4d4x,2,2012-02-24,Big4 - Industry Preference Question,redhotassets,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/q4d4x/big4_industry_preference_question/,"I'm about to finish an audit internship at a Big4 firm, and we were told that if we get hired FT, we'll be able to rank the top 3 industries we'd prefer to work in to determine our industry placement. The catch is, 2 of our choices have to be industries that we worked in during our internship. I've worked on 3 year-end audits, 2 were consumer &amp; industrial markets and the other was financial services. I was okay with the 2 manufacturing companies, and although I liked my engagement team for the third, I did not like the work I did, so that's definitely at the bottom of my list.

The industry I'd truly prefer working in is public sector (governmental, universities, NFP). My previous internship was 2 summers at a smaller CPA firm, where I worked on audits at school districts, townships, etc. and compilations for small NFP companies. I loved the work, especially compared to the experience I've gained working in other industries, and I know that's what I want to do.

I don't know if this is true for the other Big4 firms, but the public sector group at my firm is pretty small compared to the other industries we work in. I'm guessing it's a small group either because nobody really wants to go into it or it doesn't require as many people and is therefore more difficult to go into. Given my background, I wondered why I didn't get placed into that group for my internship, and I think it's because it's such a small group because there are no interns assigned to any public sector clients. It seems that the more popular industries that everyone tries to get into are financial services and real estate, because a lot of those companies are right in the city, so I'm hopeful that the fact that I even want to be placed in the public sector will help me get there.

**My question is, would it be likely for me to be placed in the public sector industry if I rank that as my top preference and let them know I have experience in that area?**"
q3xhc,0,2012-02-24,Spongebob horror storry! LONG READ (Part 1),[deleted],WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/q3xhc/spongebob_horror_storry_long_read_part_1/,"
I’m NOT saying this is real. I just find it interesting. One reminder: NONE of the stuff said below are in my own words, but instead in the words of an intern at Nickelodeon.


“I want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn’t one.”


“I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn’t paid of course, most internships aren’t, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would shit themselves over it. Since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired.”


“I’ll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the Spongebob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premier that set everyone and everything back for several months.”


“Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be “Fear of a Krabby Patty” and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn’t final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as “How sex doesn’t work” instead of “Rock-a-by-Bivalve” when spongebob and patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card “Squidward’s Suicide” we didn’t think it more than a morbid joke. One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal.” 


“The story began with Squidard practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear Spongebob laughing outside and Squidard stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. Spongebob says okay and goes to see Sandy with with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward’s concert. This is when things began to seem off. While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn’t (at this point sound is synced up with animation so yes that’s not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight mummuring in the crowed before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malace in it. Squidward’s in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with Spongebob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn’t the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people’s eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at eachother, obviously confused, but since we weren’t the writers we didn’t question its appeal to children, yet.”


“The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn’t very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It’s as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.”


“The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it’s only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward’s sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn’t coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don’t purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.”


“Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I’ve had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn’t have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road. The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child’s death.”


“We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke. The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you’d get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo. The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer’s shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out.”

q3kbh,1,2012-02-23,"Prospective Office Manager, Need Help",[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/q3kbh/prospective_office_manager_need_help/,"I have recently left the US Navy after nearly seven years. I initially enlisted as a Dental Technician, however in late 2005 all Dental Technicians became Hospital Corpsmen. Wanting to stay in the dental field (which was difficult for Dental Technicians at the time, as there was quite a bit of cross-training to the medical field), I took on additional training as a Dental Laboratory Technician to 'stay dental.' Knowing that I did want to become a civilian eventually, I started course work and eventually earned my BS in Health Sciences with a concentration in Health Care Management, and I am continuing to work towards my Master's in the same. I have operated as the senior NCO in several dental clinic/laboratories, directly managing the work schedules of 12 people.

That said, for the past two months I have been applying to positions as a Dental Office Manager with little luck. I have received, perhaps, a 15% callback rate for applications submitted. However, when my potential employer learns that I have no real world experience with insurance claims, I'm often quickly dismissed (albeit, quite politely). To rectify this, I have attempted to contact several practices in my local area for an unpaid internship position where I can learn this portion of the trade but have had absolutely no responses.

At this point, I'm quite concerned. I'm contemplating going back to school for a year to earn my ICD-9-CM certification. However, I'm not sure if this certification is particularly valued in the civilian dental sector. Is there, perhaps, an alternate certification that is more valuable to the dental community?

Also, I have included a [1] link to the resume I have been using to secure job interviews. Any comments regarding how to improve it would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT - Wanted to add that I have applied to Dental Front Desk positions in the hope that I could gain insurance experience there. However, I have found I have absolutely no callbacks when I apply to that position.

TL;DR - Recently separated vet needs advice in securing an Office Manager position"
q60o0,1,2012-02-25,Advice: He says he loves me but he won't take me back. Should I just give him space?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/q60o0/advice_he_says_he_loves_me_but_he_wont_take_me/,"We've been together for 2 years. I fucked up last summer and made out with another man, who tried to have sex with me. I stopped. I didn't want that. But I still cheated. I was upfront. It took until I returned to the state I hail from (I had an out-of-state internship for 4 months when it happened), about a month but I told him what happened. To this day I am sorry.
He also hates that every so often I smoke. He hates it.
Since getting back together after the summer, I've been busy. I'm in college, have 3 jobs, and he lives an hour away. I know I could've tried harder to see him, but it was simpler for him to stop by up here since he worked 20 minutes from my university. 
Ever since this summer he's been hesitant to let me go out with friends. And ever since this summer, I've been feeling really independent. 
We started fighting a bunch. He wanted me to put forth more of an effort and I wanted space. One day I finally asked for it. We ended. But he wanted to make it more of a break. So I did. I didn't hook up with anyone, do anything stupid or break any of his 'rules'. 2 weeks later we agreed to talk. We didn't. He was too scared I'd break up with him.
All I wanted was him back in my arms. I knew it was stupid, but he wanted the break, so I thought he wanted me back. 
Now he doesn't know if he wants me back. It's been 2 weeks since we were supposed to talk. Whenever he calls me we fight and cry. I feel he doesn't care. He doesn't want to see me. He says he wants to get back together, but he says no whenever I ask if we are going to. 

I feel played. Manipulated. I wanted out, but I worked on my feelings and myself to be able to get back with him at his bequest. Now all I want is him. I still love him deeply.

But he won't have me. He says he still loves me, still cares, but he won't take me back. He claims I don't deserve another chance, and that I shouldn't talk to him, give him space. But I feel like if I do that he'll leave and never come back. 

Why do I want him? What should I do?"

(excuse me if my site seems far more cocky about my design skills than I really am, I don't think I'd have much chance with finding clients/an internship if I mention that I am a total newbie)

Anyway, heres where I need help!

Though I got most of the site to resize through mediaqueries I can't figure out how to get the text input areas on the contact form to resize and thus I sloppily applied an overflow:hidden at the smallest window size (480px). 
Related: the contact box as a whole isn't resizing as small as I would like it too (im 90 percent sure Im just forgetting to declare something in the mediaqueries). Any idea?

When viewed on a browser that doesn't support @font-face the design breaks horribly. Im not one hundred percent sure why, but it appears guilder is much smaller and more condensed than the fallback font (arial narrow), this may be a super newbie question, but is there a solution to this that doesn't involve me using alternative type (or setting each instance of that typeface as an image)? also, I've got my website to show these typefaces as far back as IE6, is there any significant browser share that would use the fallback font anyway?

I know the blog link is a little awkward as it renders that other nav links useless, I plan on cleaning that up soon. I think thats one of the bigger problems in my site currently, are there other major things you would suggest I do to my site?'

q5b93,23,2012-02-25,"I've been straight-ish my whole life, but suddenly find myself desperately wanting a girlfriend. Confusion! Help?",PixelatedMouse,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/q5b93/ive_been_straightish_my_whole_life_but_suddenly/,"This is my first real Reddit post, and I have no experience with any of this, so please be gentle with me. 

  I'm 20 and I live in Los Angeles. I've been pretty much straight my whole life. I've always found girls attractive, and I find myself checking them out sometimes, but not the way I check out guys (not necessarily in a sexual way, although I do often notice their bodies). I've only ever had boyfriends, and the most I've ever done with a girl is kissed one. I've had two serious, long term relationships with boys. One I dated for two and a half years, one for one and a half. Both times I've been potentially open to a threesome with another girl, or at least liked the thought of it, and both times after the breakup I've found myself considering the possibility of a girlfriend. After the first breakup, I was going to Mills college in Oakland, which is an all girls school, and so I was considering a girlfriend for that reason. Now however, I'm back in Los Angeles and am leaving for Berlin in a few weeks for a paid internship. I went through a breakup about two months ago (I think), and although I've slept with a few guys, I haven't really wanted to or been seriously interested in anyone since the breakup. I've just been trying to force myself into liking someone, because I feel like that's the norm for me I think.

  A week or two before Valentine's day, I started thinking about a great date to take a girl on. I joked about it for a second in my head, kind of planning it out, and then I thought ""I'd love to take a girl out on a date like that. I'd be the best boyfriend ever!"". I know that is incredibly dumb, and that a lesbian relationship doesn't have a boyfriend and girlfriend dynamic, but somehow I fixated on that idea. I'm not sure why, but I feel like I should say this. I'm very girly. I wear heels everywhere, I giggle, and I typically like my boyfriends to be the dominant ones. I love being a girl and don't want to be anything else. Somehow, though, I seem to be thinking more and more that I would make a fantastic boyfriend, for lack of a better term. I've been thinking that I'd love to be the dominant one sexually, and that I'd love to dote on a girl and take her out and do sweet and lovely things with her. 

  I initially thought it was just that, and that I wasn't really sexually attracted to girls. That maybe it was just that I don't think I could ever be attracted to a submissive boy, so I was just switching teams for that idea. I've always thought of myself as only liking girls in my head, and even then only above the waist. As I've started thinking this over, however, I've started having these fantasies. I think of having a girlfriend, and all the things I could do with her and to her. I imagine being dominant in bed, and with a girl specifically, and it actually interests me. A lot. Instead of fantasizing about boys, I now fantasize about kissing a girl, pressing her up against a wall, feeling her chest against mine (maybe doing some other things, but I'll stop there for your sakes).

  I just have no idea what to make of this. I'd love to try a girlfriend, but I have no idea if I'm actually interested in girls or not because I just have this fantasy, this idea, and no real experience. I don't want to experiment on someone and then find out I'm straight. In fact, I don't want to use anyone as an experiment at all. That seems so horrible, especially because I feel like everyone else pretty much knows what their sexuality is by now, and it feels to me like I'm mocking people who are actually bi or lesbian by just trying it out to see if it fits. There's the huge chance that I'm just fixated on this idea in my head and that in reality I'm actually totally straight. Then again, I was never able to find guys sexually attractive until I had had a positive sexual experience with one. 

  I'm not sure I'll be able to figure this out  unless I try, and I desperately want to try. Which brings me to my next problem. I'm sure no girl wants to fool around with and/or date a straight girl, especially one that has no sexual experience with other girls. I wouldn't even know where to start, really. I mean obviously I know how my own body works, but I can't help feeling there's a bit more to lesbian sex than that (you know, just a bit). On top of all that, I don't know how to pick up girls, and I have no idea if I'm attractive to other women. I get in to bars all the time, and someone suggested that I try a lesbian bar, but I don't know if that's how this works. I just feel so clueless and inexperienced, and I'm completely confused. I especially don't want to hurt anyone, or demean anyone by being some dumb little straight girl who thinks she likes girls for half a second and then finds out she doesn't really. Help? Please?

(Also, sorry for the giant wall of text and the shitty writing. It is late at night, and i had a lot to say, but I'm being horribly inarticulate. I'm so much better with words when I'm speaking them.)"
q6yex,6,2012-02-26,"Ladies of Reddit, I could use some help. I just found out my fiance (4 years together) cheated on me - bad - 2 years ago while on a trip overseas. What are the chances we can stay together given the circumstances?",Sorry_Dude,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/q6yex/ladies_of_reddit_i_could_use_some_help_i_just/,"I'm crushed. We were in a good place. I'd like it to work out, but recidivism on these sort of thing is damn near 100%, right? 

Back story: Two years ago, she graduated college and got a 2-week internship in Southeast Asia. She stayed for 6 weeks (against my wishes) and while there convinced me to fly out and meet her. Before I got the chance near the end of her trip, she was robbed and came home before my flight left. By chance, my trip was cancelled. 

I suspected strongly she was cheating on me with one or more guys, but certainly one, while over there. I also figured it was more than a one-night stand because his salacious messages on her on her FB wall quickly disappeared. 

The inquiry: During her trip, I suspected something was going on. All the signs were there. I begged her to tell me and she insisted I was being jealous etc. After her trip I basically found out, but without hard evidence, all I could do is ask her to tell me the truth and let the chips fall. She insisted nothing happened. I had asked her while she was abroad, specifically, if I was flying out and going to find her with a new boyfriend? She lied. I tried to believe her. I'm reasonable and forgiving, but not totally stupid. Later, getting insecure from time to time about this, I begged her for the truth so we could move on. 
She lied to my face without hesitation, total denial, maybe 10 times between 2010-2012. 

Despite my concerns our relationship did well. We got counseling. I was told my fears were normal but unfair. I needed to trust her and so I did. I began to trust her again. We got engaged. Our families are very close and she and I live together and run a business together. 

Fast forward to January 2012. She left on vacation again, this time to Central America for 20 days without my blessing. With her dad. I wanted to go with, but work wouldn't allow me the time off until April. Her dad had to go on vacation in Jan/Feb, so I was left at home.

The Discovery: I was cleaning the house in preparation of her arrival home. In the living room on the floor - plain sight - I found a black berry with Thai writing on the keys. Never seen it before. I honestly tried not to look - for 1.5 seconds. Then loneliness and curiosity got the best of me. 

The Details: She was carrying on a relationship the whole time she was gone. Fully - banging this guy, maybe more, but one over and over, maybe 20 times in 40 days. She was texting him salacious stuff. 100% guilty. Between messages about how excited she was to have sex with him later, she texted me that she was thrilled I was coming to meet her. My messages to and from her were dispersed through a sickening lattice of adulterous text messages that are hard to forget. 

So now she's coming home in 2 days. It's her birthday the day she gets home. I confronted her on the phone and she says she's sorry. She's devastated. It was the only time. She's been keeping some contact with the guy, Jonathan, through Facebook since then, she admitted, but not regularly. She's so sorry. She says she was in a bad place then and now were good and she want's to have my babies. ETC. 

So...

What should I do. I love/loved her. Dearly. I was all in with her. But this hurts.

  
tl;dr: Fiance cheated on me and lied about it repeatedly for two years after until she was straight busted. Any chance of salvage or is this sort of thing game over?  
   



**UPDATE: she's going to read this thread again in a few hours. If anyone has anything to add to her that might help, it would be most appreciated**

I would prefer to be near a 542/545 bus stop so I can get by without a car, and would love to be in Capitol Hill.  Does anyone have any tips on how to find a place that will rent to me for May through August or so?

I look on Craigslist, but it's really hard to find anything temporary that's not like ""$150/day"" vacation rentals."
q8q0h,3,2012-02-27,Where do I go from here?,friendzoned_gtfo,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/q8q0h/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I'm feeling stuck. I'm in this space of ""I screwed everything up"" and ""this isn't how things were supposed to be"" without knowing how to move past it. It's paralyzing. Potential long story ahead.


I was the definition of over achieving growing up. I started university in a program that only took 50 students and required a very high GPA to enter the program and to stay there. I got through alright, but by the end of my first year, things were not going well. I was depressed, not sleeping, and having panic attacks. I went home for the summer, got some Zoloft, and seemed to be back on track. In retrospect I spent most of that summer in hypomania, although I'd give anything to be back at that level.


I start my second year and before I've even finished my first week of classes, I'm off the rails manic/psychotic. It was humiliating. My residence put me on behavioral probation. I fell behind in my classes and fell into a deep, near suicidal depression, sleeping, skipping class, crying, and drinking myself sick. Though I had seen a few different doctors and a therapist, no one suggested that I be treated for bipolar or even that I stop the anti-depressants. I finished second year with a C average and repeated 2 courses over the summer. I was out of my enriched program, obviously, and I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to bring up my GPA in 3rd year. 


Every year after that I told myself that I would do better this time around, and make up for everything that I had done wrong. I got better but I've never fully ""recovered"". In my last semester of 4th year, knowing I wouldn't graduate without coming back full time for a 5th year, I burned out and nearly quit school altogether. I got a good doctor over the summer and entered my 5th year because I didn't know what else to do. 


That year went better, all things considered. I got Bs in most of my courses with the help of my Dr., academic counselors and the disabilities office. I was on and off medications constantly through that year to try and get the right dosing, so I was often drowsy or physically ill, or in a fog, which made if difficult to attend all of my classes and keep up. Luckily I was able to get extensions and accommodations when needed.


I got a BSc. and started my first job as a writer in the most awful workplace I've ever experienced. I was deeply depressed for the few months that I worked there and had frequent panic attacks and attendance issues. After 3 months of working there I moved to another city with my boyfriend and began trying to rebuild. I have been unemployed ever since - I've now been unemployed for over a year.


I had always wanted to go to graduate school, get my PhD and become a researcher. I loved my field of study (still do). I don't have the grades or references from my undergrad degree to get into any grad program. I applied to the near by university to take courses as a non-degree student in hopes of upgrading for grad school, but was told I didn't have a high enough GPA to even upgrade at their school. 


It's hard to find a job in my field with no advanced degree and mediocre references. Every day that I'm not working is another strike against me when competing for jobs. I am considering trying to find a volunteer position but am so anxious and lacking in self esteem that I am afraid to even talk to anyone about it. I can't sell myself to potential employers because I do not believe in my abilities. I've had too much failure and humiliation over the past 6 years to have much confidence.


I'm angry at myself because when I should have been getting good grades, building relationships with professors, finding volunteer positions and applying for internships, I was fighting just to get by day to day. Now all of those opportunities are behind me and I feel like I'm in limbo.

And I'm angry at the money that I have cost my family in medication, therapy, repeating courses, extra time in school, time spent unemployed, etc... when they have been supporting me. I don't know how to let go of this either.


tl;dr: About to turn 25, going nowhere. Angry and unsure what to do next.

I'm really sorry about the length. I've wanted to get this stuff out for a while and haven't known how."

So, I'm a student that is about to apply to an internship that focuses on UI for web and phone application. I have had experience in web design with a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and (decent) PHP.

With this as background, I would like to ask: What would be a good starting point for designing mobile UI? I have thought about designing some UI elements (buttons, hover-states, sliders, checkboxes, message boxes etc.) in Photoshop and then implementing the design for a mobile ""app"" or site.

What do y'all think? Thanks for reading!"
q7wew,0,2012-02-27,Learning Multivariable Calc?,canas15,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/q7wew/learning_multivariable_calc/,"So, third year undergrad. Long story, but the honors sequence in my college doesn't really cover multivariable calc and diffyq- We're supposed to cover multivariable analysis and then do differential geometry. My year, the material got changed around (measure theory instead of multivariable calc...), but we still did differential geometry anyway, learning the ""kinda-basics"" as we needed to.

This hasn't been a problem until now. I'm doing an internship this summer in which people seem to like math a lot. This may include calculating things like gradients which I have little idea about: what are some good resources for a somewhat advanced undergrad who just happens to have a small gap around where multivariable calculus should be? I've got a couple of weeks to study before my internship begins, so I've got time to study. Also, books would be preferable to sites since I might be out of country and in a location with pretty cruddy internet.

Thanks guys!

P.S.: Yeah, I know, it's embarrassing not to know basic multi-var. But we literally didn't cover it since pure math people really don't like these kinds of messy things, apparently. 

Also, as a quick note, stuff which would help me build some computational comfort would be nice (aka not ALL theory please, although some proofs will not be completely unwelcome). I was thinking of Spivak's manifolds initially because it's such an oh so nice small book, but I'm not sure it does that :/. Also I'm kinda traumatized by his introduction to differential geometry book. Because that thing is scary. "
q7umv,0,2012-02-27,Good exercise program for a full-time worker?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/q7umv/good_exercise_program_for_a_fulltime_worker/,"So I was in the best shape of my life over the summer. 160LB, muscular, benching high above my weight etc. Then I COMPLETELY let myself go during fall semester at school... I go to school in the East Coast and just couldn't motivate myself to exercise with schoolwork etc....

Anyways, I'm taking this semester ""off"" and getting internship experience back in CA. I'm working 5 days a week, 9-6. My commute is about 1.5 hours both ways so I wake up at 7 already, have a half an hour then drive. Get home around 7:30, eat dinner and am usually ""free"" for the evening around 8:00. 

I was wondering, what is a good exercise program for somebody like me? I want to get back into shape, but I also sleep terribly at night (exercising doesn't help me usually, was sleeping just as bad when I was working out regularly) and I'm not so sure I can convince myself to get up any earlier than 6:30 to get in about 30 mins in the morning. 

Maybe working out after getting home at 7:30 before eating? I guess I'm just asking if any of you guys are in a similar working situation? Do you always have to compromise rest hours to exercise? Are there any programs that can help you get into shape with short bursts of 30 mins? 

Thanks for reading! "
q7syg,14,2012-02-27,This weekend I put on my big boy pants and figured out if I wanted to be a trainer or just simply a man who liked playing with dogs.,Devlik,Dogtraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q7syg/this_weekend_i_put_on_my_big_boy_pants_and/,"I had a put up or shut up weekend with the dogs at the local shelter I donate time to. Just some back ground I am an intern with the canine behavior team at the second largest shelter in my state. I have had a good amount of experience with guardian breeds especially those that have severe behavior issues ranging from fear aggression to kennel stress to simple house breaking issues.

So one of my favorite dogs at the shelter turned into a bite case as he drew blood on an intern (not out of aggression as he would have likely been put down).

 He is now out of bite quarantine and thankfully above ground. He is however, exhibiting symptoms of major kennel stress. For those that are note familiar with this, it is the dogs slowly and quite literally going insane from the stresses of a large kennel environment (constant barking, lots of people, the cleaning process, etc are all very hard on the dogs). Pit bulls especially and most bully breeds fall victim to this as they spend more and more time in the shelter. This pit bull has already bitten one person and is going nuts. This is a major killer of these dogs in shelter environments.

So what do I do? Not just work with him in the training rooms and outside but lock myself in his kennel to give him massage and work on stress reduction with him. Helping show that his kennel is not just a place of confinement but also where happy fun times and relaxation happen. This is critical in helping reduce the stress and keeping him adoptable.

So lets recap on my brilliant choice of hobby 

* 1) Work with guardian breeds almost exclusively 
* 2) Make sure they are the breeds that can really mess you up 
* 3) Find the craziest one of the lot 
* 4) wait for them to come out of bite quarantine 
* 5) lock your self in a space smaller than your closet with them in hopes you can help make him less crazy.

Either I trust my skills and these dogs or I don't and so far I am not finding my faith lacking. However I am starting to understand rock climbers, sky drivers, and other lifestyles that are bat shit crazy on paper but rewarding and worth it in the long run."
qa3jj,3,2012-02-28,A past acquaintance [true],another-attempt,SlutStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlutStories/comments/qa3jj/a_past_acquaintance_true/,"edit- story continued in comments

I posted a similar account of this the other day with a different throwaway account but my comment got buried with downvotes. It was in one of those ""What's your most unbelieveable sex encounter?"" threads. After 20 downvotes, I deleted it. Maybe it'll do better here, especially if I go into more detail.

When I was in college there was a girl named Tammy (not real name) who had a reputation for sleeping with anyone and everyone. She was a party girl for sure, the kind of girl who would flash for 'Girls gone Wild' (she actually did; I used to have the DVD) or make out with a female friend in front of a room full of strangers just for attention. She was totally hot. I jerked off thinking about her all the time but never had the balls to really approach her.

I was a shy loser I admit. I rarely went to parties and I barely knew her but whenever I saw her all I could about was fucking. 

During second year I met my first serious girlfriend. While I still enjoyed hearing the stories of Tammy's sexual exploits, and occasionally catching a glimpse of her on campus, I was more than happy with the love of my life, Rachel. She wasn't in Tammy's league but she was attractive. The sex was nothing crazy but it was good. I was content.

About a year ago I got my first job at a marketing firm in the downtown of a major city. Being the new guy, barely more than an intern, I did all the shit jobs (still do, mostly). Like changing the water cooler or writing the rejection letters to other applicants or attending the meetings that don't matter in any way. Those sorts of things. One of those shit jobs was to go and get coffee for the office each morning.

About three months ago I started my day as usual: texting everyone in my department to ask what kind of drinks they wanted from the Starbucks. The rule was simple: if you didn't reply, you didn't get a drink. So in other words, I always got replies.

When I got to the Starbucks I had a list of nine drinks via text and as I waited in line I tried my best to memorize each one (I hate people who take forever when placing their orders). When it was my turn at the register I looked up from my phone and was stunned to see none other than the infamous Tammy standing behind the counter.

She looked even better than I remembered her, even in that awful looking barista outfit. Long brown hair, large chest, slender body, smooth skin. She graduated a year before me and that year had been kind to her, I though, but there was sweat on her brow and a grimace on her face. Her demeanor had definitely changed, too. Back in college she'd been a queen almost. Here she was just a common worker and she was obviously stressed out and frustrated with the morning rush of customers.

She didn't recognize me at all at first. She just asked what I wanted.

I began listing the drinks. She kept telling me to slow down as she messed with the computer. Realizing she must be new and still learning the ropes I offered her my cell phone and credit card. ""Take your time. I'm in no hurry.""

She smiled for the first time once she realized I'd just made her job a whole lot easier. She gratefully took both and said, ""Thanks! I'll only be a minute.""

About fifteen minutes later she came to my table carrying a paper tray that contained all the steaming cups of coffee. After I signed the credit card receipt and handing it back to her she said, ""Do I know you from somewhere?""

My heart sort of fluttered. All thoughts of Rachel, who was still my girlfriend and actually living with, went out of my head. With shameless excitement I explained to her that we had gone to the same university. I mentioned mutual acquaintences and parties we had been to. One class we had both taken during her last year. When none of that jogged her memory I said my name was Josh Smith (not my real name) and finally she acted like we were long lost best friends.

""Oh my god, Josh! I knew it was you!"" Her lie sounded cheap but I loved it anyway. ""How have you been!?""

We chatted for a few moments and I explained where I worked, which is just down the street from where the Starbucks. She bobbed her pretty head and then told me that she was only working there as a second job. Her REAL job, supposedly, was at an art gallery. I didn't quite buy it but I smiled and nodded as I tried not to stare too much at her chest.

""Here,"" she said after a few minutes. She took my copy of the credit card receipt and wrote a phone number on the back of it. ""We should totally catch up. Give me a call, okay?""

What do we have to catch up on? I wondered. Thankfully all I said was, ""Sure!""

During work that day I realized I couldn't contact her. Doing so would be a betrayal to Rachel. I couldn't get rid of the number though. I entered it into my phone under the name of my Dentist's office instead. Just in case.

Less than a month later I decided that was the wisest thing I ever did.

q9a9v,3,2012-02-28,I want to stop making excuses and realize my dreams,UMadBreaux,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/q9a9v/i_want_to_stop_making_excuses_and_realize_my/,"I've been dealing with depression all throughout college. It has definitely been a rough time, I got involved with some bad people and ended up relying on substance abuse to take away the pains, or at least try to.

Fast forward to today. I am currently in my last semester of an internship, after which I have a full year of classes before graduation. I want to really make the most of this time and actually enjoy myself, as I have spent the past few years slaving away in class and work(I have been working 20-30 hours a week while taking classes).

Above all, I want to start reconnecting with people again. I used to be a fairly extroverted person, depression definitely made me hide in my shell most of the time. I may not ever be able to return completely to my old sociable self, but I would definitely like to start reaching out to others and connecting to other people. My goal is to eventually start dating again, I have dreamed of a meaningful relationship for years and it's time to finally go out there and follow my dreams. I deserve it, I need to quit holding myself back and being my harshest critic.

That being said, I am not afraid to admit I am really scared. My self-esteem is still pretty low, causing me to fear intimate connections out of fear of rejection. My only experience dating in college was a rather traumatic relationship freshmen year: I was in the beginning stages of depression when I met this girl at a party, as I began falling deeper and deeper into despair she wasted no time using me to her advantage, ultimately cheating on me to get back with her ex-boyfriend. I caught them cheating on me with my own eyes, and she never even apologized. Or thought about warning me that she had herpes.

Since then, I have been damaged goods when it comes to relationships. The few times that someone has shown interest in me, I found it easier to believe that they had mistaken me for someone else, that there was no way anyone could be attracted to me in any way. I wish I could go back in time and smack some sense into myself, but those opportunities are long gone and that is that.

I really want to try and start dating again, but I'm really scared to put myself out there. I don't want my self-esteem to completely shatter again, but I know I have to take risks and put myself out there. Can anyone offer some advice for starting to date after dealing with depression for so long? I'm just not exactly sure who I am or where to go from here.

If you have read down this far, thank you for taking a minute of your time to try and help me, it means a lot. I hope that you all can leave depression in the past and chase your dreams and ambitions, we're all in this together."

qbnj5,1,2012-02-29,"Hi, people of r/Math! I would like your advice.",asksmathsquestions,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/qbnj5/hi_people_of_rmath_i_would_like_your_advice/,"I'm a third year undergraduate, and I have the opportunity of doing a ten-week paid internship in my university maths department this summer. I've asked around a bit, and it seems that I can choose pretty much anything I like (obviously maths related!), as long as it works as a cohesive ten week project and one of my lecturers will set it up. 

For example, last year a friend of mine did a report on Gödel's theorem. 
Other suggestion's I've been given by various lecturer's have been the Banach-Tarski Paradox, Gaudi's use of geometric surfaces, or even creating some mathematical artwork or poster's for the department. 

This seems to me like an amazing opportunity, and I'd like to use it to do something which will further my mathematical understanding, while being fun and perhaps even being useful in some way. 

I'd love to hear of any suggestions you might have.

(By the way, the course I am taking is Maths and Computer Science, so I have done all the maths courses you would expect, including group theory, topology, numerical analysis and so on, and I'm reasonably proficient at c++ and Matlab.)

I'm having difficulty breaking into the industry with the rough market so I thought I would try here.

I am a hardware and networking professional that has been building computers and other equipment from the ground up since I was in middle school. I have completed an internship in the field as well (more info on that available on request).

If anyone here handles hiring for a company or knows one who is hiring for IT, please message me for more details, resume, experience, etc. Please link to the business website if possible as I do not want to give out too much personal information to anyone on Reddit (can't be too careful).

I appreciate any help anyone can offer.

qaxml,29,2012-02-29,Outdoors Adventure,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/qaxml/outdoors_adventure/,"Back in 2008 I was working on my Environmental Science internship in a brand new place.  Where I come from had an extremely low crime rate, lower than the average for the US, so maybe I was a little naive or just not expecting much to go wrong.  

So, for my internship, I worked outdoors banding birds.  My fellow worker and myself had set up a new spot to band birds at this little secluded fishing access area.  You could drive in from the main, somewhat rural route, and head down to the lake.  It also had a picnic area that no one ever seemed to use, so we set up shop there.  We had our banding area up this forested rise that had zero trails and no one had a need to go anywhere near there for anything else other than what we were doing.  

My coworker would park at the bottom of the rise, so the car was pretty visible, which I later realized was rather dumb.  We learned that gay guys used the spot to meet up, so we felt somewhat safe as we saw them regularly and we'd wave to each other.  

One morning, things went as usual, and I was up near the top of the rise by myself.  I have a habit of looking behind me, and on this morning I noticed a car parked at the edge of the woods, right at the base of where we were working, right near our car.  I crouched down and moved around to see if I could see anybody down there, and saw a man leave the car.  I got ready to call out to him to tell him to please leave the area when he began taking off his clothes.  He took off all of them, and left them on the hood of his car.  He then proceeded to take out a gallon jug of water and two of those large rectangular buckets that hold cement mix from his car.  

I had a chuckle at how strange this was while finding a dip near the top of the rise to hide in.  I started panicking though as the man entered our work area and started walking up the rise.  I didn't know exactly where my coworker was and he seemed to be headed right to where she had gone earlier.  I called her on her cell and told her there was a naked man in the woods.  She started screaming to get out of the woods and hung up on me to call the police.  

Problem was, there was no way out of the dip I was in without him seeing me when I got up, so I knew I'd have to book it.  I got up, and he turned right to me, total frontal view and set his buckets and water down and started heading right for me.  I booked it down the rise to the parking lot till I found my coworker.  

The cops came, found the guy, took him in and looked him up.  He had traveled over an hour to this particular spot and never gave his motive as to what he was going to do there, but those cement buckets were both full of porn magazines.  The cops showed us what came up when they searched him in their system: Repeat Violent Sexual Offender.  "

I am currently a junior studying ECE, and I think it might be really awesome to go get my PhD after graduation. I am currently debating whether to take a summer position with an REU program doing HPC research or working with one of the National Labs working with their supercomputing. Is there one that looks better for a graduate school application?

Also, here's my resume if that might help you provide an opinion: http://db.tt/xELv77iq

qarz8,13,2012-02-28,"I went to a t-14 school for one year, and then quit after my first summer internship. I have now transitioned into a different career. AmA.",[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/qarz8/i_went_to_a_t14_school_for_one_year_and_then_quit/,"I just figured I'd throw this out there - not to discourage everyone from law school - but to hopefully help out a few people who may have been in my position either before starting or part of the way into law school. Basically, I loathed the experience, lost a lot of weight and was constantly sick, and almost destroyed one of the most important relationships in my life. I initially took a leave of absence, which eventually turned into an official withdrawal. Grades were decent but not spectacular.

TL;DR - LSAT 170, went to a T-14, finished 1L and a paid summer internship (mostly to recoup some costs!), and then quit. Took me about 1 year to get fully situated into another career track, and now I'm happily employed in a highly enjoyable and rewarding job in the tech/new media field. (Had I stayed, I would now be a 3L.)"
qakvs,2,2012-02-28,[Hiring] Video Post-Production Engineering Internship,uncletex,colum,https://www.reddit.com/r/colum/comments/qakvs/hiring_video_postproduction_engineering_internship/,"Hi there...

These seems like a perfect subreddit to repost this at the moment.

We're a post-production house in Chicago focused mainly on commercial spot work. And we're looking for the perfect intern to work with our engineering/IT department.

We fix things when they break. We install and make everything work together perfectly. Our projects include planning and installing new equipment, computer hardware and software support, maintenance of video and audio gear, IT networking, and general troubleshooting alongside our editors and artists.

If you're interested, you should already have some background in video production and post-production. Knowledge about editing and graphics, and the software and hardware behind it would be nice. Knowledge about video and audio cables...how to make them, crimp, solder, troubleshoot, etc. Ethernet? Yes. Troubleshooting Mac, Windows? Yes. Linux? Oh, that'd be real nice.

If you're dreams are to become an editor, graphics artist, audio engineer, or some other awesome person who sits in the chair and runs the gear...that's great. But don't apply to this internship.
If instead...you think you've got a great mix of potential talent, interests, and desire to rebuild computers, wire networks, climb around ceilings digging in cable trays, and help support a video post-house...well...we should talk. 

We're located in downtown Chicago. Send me a PM with a non-form-letter introduction, and I'll be in touch.
