j5o5x,3,2011-08-01,Kiddie Tax Questions,alexf3ng,tax,https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/j5o5x/kiddie_tax_questions/,"I am a 21 year old college student (dependent).

My parents invested my college savings in stocks.
They have about 30,000 dollars left in shares of Apple (I am a senior at a public university)

They are in the 33% tax bracket.

Edit: I am in California
Edit: I do not have a job (doing unpaid internship overseas)

Questions:
What happens if they transfer the 28,000 dollars worth of stock into a brokerage account under my own name.

Effectively gifting the shares to me.  They have a joint account so I should be safe under 28,000 dollars from gift tax.

The stock gained 7000 dollars so was bought with 21,000 dollars.

If I get the stock, will I have to pay kiddie tax on the 7000 if I do not sell the stock?

Will it benefit me if I keep the stock until I graduate, and get a job to be taxed at my own lower rate?

Thanks in advance!"
j6d7k,5,2011-08-02,I need help,Lokilost,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/j6d7k/i_need_help/,"I am 19, and a high functioning autistic, and a year and a half ago I escaped my abusive parents. Due to not receiving any early intervention because of my parents, I'm still learning the basics of how to take care of myself and function well. I currently live with my caretaker, and his roommate. 

I was working for a woman in my caretaker's church, watching her non-verbal autistic son while she was working, which I very much enjoyed, and I'd become pretty good friends with him. My boss was recently laid off from work, and has decided not to pursue another job so that she can stay home with her son. 

My caretakers' roommate charges us $75 a week in rent. I require a lot of help and care, and cannot get by without my caretaker's help. My caretaker is currently in an unpaid internship to paid employment program, and won't begin getting paid for about 5 months. 

There is a farmers' market I plan to sell homemade goods at (fudge, maybe some bread) to try and make rent, but it only remains open until October, and there is no guarantee that I will sell enough or be able to handle the sensory stimulation of the market, or the social stresses of selling at a farmers' market.

We live in Lapeer MI, USA

I don't know how someone would help, but I'm pretty certain that if anyone could come up with a decent solution, they'd be on reddit.  

Edit: UPDATE. I went to a farmers market today. I made fudge, and it sold well, and I made enough for my rent. It wasn't easy with the loud noises and people, but it worked well and I handled it fairly well, only one sensory overload, and I was only nonverbal for about 5 minutes. I'm going to try to continue doing this and see if I can make enough on a regular basis to make rent. Thank you to everyone for your kind words and suggestions."
j6cxr,4,2011-08-01,I'm lonely... ,SodiumHydroxide,relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/j6cxr/im_lonely/,"Hey Reddit,

I'm coming to what I think is the close of a 9ish month long relationship (I know, its relatively short, but we've been living together for the past 3 months and sleeping together for at least 7 of them so it feels like a lot longer). There have been several times where she's given me more than enough reason to end things, but I never went through with it. I've known for quite some time she's not the girl I'm going to end up with, and, as expected, we've reached the end of the road. While nothing's 'official' yet, she's moved out (which was planned), and her behavior makes it clear she doesn't intend to pursue this anymore.

This should be perfect timing, as I'm headed back to school soon where there will be plenty of other distractions. At the same time, even though I know this isn't the right girl for me, I feel extremely lonely now that she's not here. To be honest, the majority of our summer consisted of us coming home tired from our respective internships, and just sitting around, watching tv, etc. There was very little communication, and we usually went to bed at different times (as opposed to during the school year, when we had sex pretty much every night). Even so, I feel very down now that she's not around.

Basically, I don't understand why I have an empty pit in my stomach now. The only reason I can think of is that I'm lonely... I'm so used to being around her all the time, and my body is noticing her absence in ways I thought I would be able to handle better. I'm sure the feeling is going to pass, and at any rate in a few weeks I'll be back living at a fraternity which will most definitely take my mind off of things. But for the interim, does anyone have any tips for managing loneliness? I'm talking things to be doing on my own - I'll be able to see friends on weekends, but they live too far away to be traveling every day of the week."

j84vi,1,2011-08-03,"Reddit, I want to marry my fiancee, and the US government try to make it terrible. We need help.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j84vi/reddit_i_want_to_marry_my_fiancee_and_the_us/,"Me : Male, 22, French citizen
My fiancee : Female, 23, US citizen

____

I am a graduate student in physics and nuclear engineering.
I met my fiancee when I was an exchange student at the University of Texas at Austin under a J1 visa. I had to go back to France, our relationship held very strong, and I came back for an internship at this same university (internship that i'm doing right now), under a J1 visa. I proposed in June, she said yes.

At the beginning of september, I have to go back to France for 7 months in order to finish my master degree. Then, I plan on doing the mandatory internship to finally complete this master at UT (I found one already), and marrying my fiancee.
My plan after that is to do a phD, possibly at UT also.


Our wedding in Austin is planned next June. Then we are going to France to celebrate with my family (a lot of them won't be able to come to the USA) at the end of July, 2012, and we'll have our honeymoon there.





But the problem is that the visa issue makes it almost impossible for us to get married an live together...

Basically :


* **Plan A :**


Around June 23 : We get legally married in Austin (me under J1 visa)

Around July 28 : We go to France (me under J1 visa)

Around August 7 : We come back to the USA (me under J1 visa)


The problem with that would be on the way back to the USA. J1 is a non-immigrant visa. If the US customs see that I am married to a US citizen, then they would very much doubt that I don't want to stay in the USA permanently and possibly won't allow me to re-enter in the USA.


* **Plan B :**


Around August 2011 : We get legally married in Austin (under current J1 visa)

Around September 1 (back to France) : We apply for a visa CR1 -&gt; 8 to 12 months

Around March 2012 : We hope very much that I get the visa...


If I get it on time, I can do my internship and am almost a permanent resident, able to travel in and out of the USA. If not, I'm stuck, cannot complete my master degree (internship), and very possibly can't start my phD.


* **Plan C :**


Around September 2 : We apply for a visa K1 (fiancé)

Around March 2012 : We hope very much that I get the visa... -&gt; 5 to 9 months

Around March 2012 : If I get the visa, I land in the USA.

Around March 2012 : We get married legally

Around March 2012 : We file for an Advance Parole (allows me to leave the USA and come back) -&gt; 2 to 4 months

Around July 25 : We hope very, very much that I get the Advance Parole

If not, we can still go to France, but I cannot come back.


* **Plan D :**


Around June 23 2012 : We do not get married legally, thus no Church.

Around July 25 2012 : We do not get married legally, thus no Church.

Around August 7 2012 : We can come back to the USA and get legally married

Around August 7 2012 : I am a permanent resident, if i fill a change of status form, etc








I'm not subject to the 2 years home residency after J1 visa. I will have a functionning J1 visa when I go back to France with my then wife to celebrate with my family.
Being married at a church is important for us, at least traditionnaly.



I know it looks like a boring post, and it probably is, can't compete with kittens with visa stuff. But if one of you has experienced that, or has any helpful advice, we will be glad ! I just want to live with my wife.

Please excuse my poor english, I'm not really in the mood for being careful with my writing."
j7rx2,0,2011-08-03,Help...don't want to lose girl from last year,boomgoesthethrowaway,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/j7rx2/helpdont_want_to_lose_girl_from_last_year/,"Hey guys,

At the end of last school year I met a girl and went on 4-5 dates up until the very end of school.  Everything went really well and we did everything outside of sex.  I had to go to the west coast for a summer internship and she was also going out of the country mid summer for a few weeks so we pretty much just said bye and agreed to keep in touch.  I was never really big on texting her so I didn't keep any convo going over the summer. She texted me one or two times.

Now in the back of my mind I had always been planning on trying to continue when I got back.

However, after looking at her facebook I have some worries that she started going out with another friend from school that I recognize as someone who used to be pretty good friends with her.  Nothing is at all confirmed but a few comments on her wall mention her and the guy in the same sentence, and her profile picture is her and him at a party, not a relationship style picture but more just goofing around in costumes.

My question is, when should I start talking to her or asking her to do something and should the fact that I noticed this affect it?  I'll be back in NY the 28th and she wont be back at school until mid september. Since she lives only about 20 minutes from the city I could ask her to do something right when I get back, or wait until school starts."

Help!",Jedi_Joe,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j7hhq/i_cant_afford_a_ring_i_think_i_really_want_to/,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 years now. Yes, I know a long time... Here's my situation. 

She is in school for mechanical engineering, and I am a drop out. To clarify, I am physically disabled? I hurt my back severely 7 years ago at a high school temp job at a local retailer. My back progressively got worse resulting in my absence from school to get medical benefits through a full time job. I have worked retail since high school for the most part. Gradually I worked my way from the tech depart at an Office Depot, to a Geek, and now I'm a tech at store with a huge fruit on it's front. 

I bring home $800-750 bi weekly, but I am in a huge amount of medical debt (worker's comp takes years to settle), school debt ( I lost my academic scholarships due to me leaving for not being able to physically continue), and all in all I get to keep about $100 a pay check to live off... I was supporting her at first, so that she could excel in her engineering studies, but now her internship brings in more money than I do. I asked her to quit her job as a waitress at Serranno's during the school year, because the hours were late and she only brought home $15 - 60 a night after busting her lil butt all day, so my financial difficulties are temporary, hopefully... ( I'm hoping my engineer- sugar momma can support us both at some point ), BUT I am ready to marry this woman and I have NOTHING to give. I have been told to get a cheap fake ring and upgrading latter, but she works with engineer$, her friends are engineer$, and her $i$ter (her biggest rival) is one highlight short of Jersey Shore mentality- I dont want to embarrass her or myself with something that does not reflect how beautiful and meaningful she is. This girl has literally carried me on her back to the bathroom when I couldn't stand on my own to pee with back spasms. I love her as desperately as I am broke!

My skills: musician (percussionist with no drum), computer tech with 7 years of experience (marine electronics included), gardening (hobby), and hustler. ( I've always been creative in trying to find resources)

TLDR: I am broke and desperately want to marry my girlfriend of 8yrs but can not afford a proper ring.

PS. I owe her $400 as of today for the rent she had to cover due to unexpected collection agency call from previous academic related bills/fee"

Advice?,jessiema,entwives,https://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/j8y3t/suffering_with_fatigue_and_apathy_advice/,"This week I've been feeling extremely tired. I've wondered if it was smoking too much, but I have smoked the same amount last week as this week. I feel burnt out. I work 9-5 this summer, and I'm a college student. I also took summer classes. I feel like this constant go-go kind of stuff is tiring me out. So on top of being tired, I also have no motivation. I hardly want to go to work, or my internship. I don't want to clean the dishes or the house (which is starting to get really really bad). I feel like I'm stuck in a fog.

I should probably start being more active. I'm underweight, mostly because I spend my money on tree and not on lots of food. I lack enthusiasm for wanting to do physical activity after work. I know it would benefit me, but I need some pep talk so I can actually do it.

Also I should mention I take anti-depressants, this apathy and fatigue is reoccuring, and isn't as bad as it used to be (Birth control is the DEVIL) but if it vamps up, it usually leads to anxiety attacks or depression bouts. I get so bad I feel like I'm losing my mind!!!

Have any of you felt this way? Apathetic and fatigued to the point where you just want to smoke, and sleep, and do absolutely nothing. I've been thinking about taking a week off to be able to get over this lack of motivation before school starts. August 15th is the first day, I'm taking a very heavy schedule, it's my senior year, and I have a job.

j8k69,1,2011-08-04,Future American college students of Reddit! Learn from my mistakes!,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j8k69/future_american_college_students_of_reddit_learn/,"Any others that want to chime in, please do so.  I'm merely giving advice based on my experiences.  I've made *many* mistakes in my college career path and wish all of you to learn from them.  But they are uniquely my own, so I'm sure others would be helpful with their perspectives.  That said...



First: High School---  In High School, unless you're a superb athlete or looking to join ROTC (more on that later), do not worry about athletics.  You're better off joining extracurricular activities that demonstrate more of your social and academic skills.  Only consider athletics for recreation and if you have all your other bases covered academically/socially (unless those other preconditions are true).  They may be BS in the real world, but for colleges, things like NHS, science fairs, student government, knowledge bowl, National Honor Roll, etc. are great on an application.  Colleges only care about athletics if you're a sure bet on getting an athletic scholarship.


Next, still in High School:  Don't worry *too much* about your GPA to the point that you give up Running Start like I did.  I was so concerned about getting into a top-tier college such as MIT or CalTech that I was scared away by people saying that Running Start tends to bring down your HS GPA.  Don't believe that shit, seriously.  Running Start will save you a lot of money, *plus*, freshman level college courses tend to be easier than AP courses in high school.  Much easier in fact.  Don't worry about that GPA so much and do Running Start if you can, if you work diligently you'll be far better off in the long run.


Third, still High School:  When you're in your senior year and sending out those scholarship and admissions applications, don't do ROTC unless you're really passionate about being in the military.  For science and engineering fields, there is a good chance you'll end up in a 5 year major that is impossible to complete on time unless you pay extra to do overtime credits.  ROTC is very demanding, as is the course-load for science/engineering.  Most people aren't cut out for this.  Even if you make it through field training after your sophomore year, things get even tougher as you're in a leadership position in addition to having crazy amounts of scholastic work going on.  Not to mention, some science and engineering majors are 5 year majors anyway.  ROTC eats ups a bunch of credit and you have to somehow still graduate on time even with all of those additional credits.  Finally, military scientists and engineers as officers tend to get paid less than their civilian counterparts.  There's job security, but you get paid less and have to work three times as hard to graduate on time.  Don't do it unless you really want to be an officer.


Fourth, HS: Don't be lazy and do apply for lots of scholarships.  It can't hurt.  'Nuff said.


Fifth, college:  If you don't have plenty of scholarships to give you a ""full ride"" and if you're not going to get a lot grants, your absolute most cost effective path is this:  Running Start -&gt; Community College -&gt; In-state University.  Even if you miss out on Running Start, try to do your general education requirements and any other course you can find for your degree at a community college.  Employers only care about where you graduated from, to varying extents.  My personal experience with a private university was terrible.  When I spent my freshman year at RPI in 2003-04, the total cost was about 39K, my ROTC scholarship covered half, my parents spent their entire college fund of 10K and I had to take loans for the rest.  For one year.  Let me say that we were using cast iron analog voltmeters and ammeters with giant terminals in our labs.  Stuff you'd expect to see about 100 years ago.  Meanwhile, the president was making millions per year in salary along with a house and fancy vehicle fully paid for by the university.


Sixth, college:  Don't get tied up in a relationship while you're in college no matter what.  I got married and had a kid, then got divorced. I'm 26 and still have a year left until I get my BS.  I've taken several years off to just work and get by.  'Nuff said.


Seventh, college:  Don't worry about clubs and whatnot unless they're respected in the field (such as IEEE for me) and you'll do actual job-related stuff by being in those clubs.  Don't worry about athletics or even social/academic clubs unless they would give you relevant experience for your future job in college.  Employers don't really care about shit like student government in college (unless you're going into politics).  They don't care about athletics either. If you do any extracurriculars, keep them relevant to what you want to do when you graduate.  Internships are extremely valuable, as the number one difficulty in new graduates finding jobs is lack of experience.


Finally, college:  Don't discount state universities.  They are often far cheaper and a lot of time better than their private counterparts.  RPI might look great on a piece of paper vs. WSU or EWU (the two state uni's I've gone since), but I can say that both WSU and EWU have had both far better equipment and professors than those I found at RPI.  Instead of stuff from the industrial revolution at RPI, we were using our laptops to sample data at WSU, and expensive/modern Fluke equipment at EWU.  Do your own research, but this was a value judgement for me...I'd much rather prefer a better education with better equipment at a cheaper price than a fancy name on my degree. =)


Cheers and good luck!"

my dad passed away 2 years ago tragically and soon im getting a PHAT life insurance check in the upcoming weeks. And since im only 20 years old, im gonna embelish it into a film career. i took 2 years studying media at Nassau Community College and am getting my Associates in the fall.

what im looking for
I plan on using final cut, LIKE A BOSS, I'm planning on buying a PC too since at the moment i can only afford to use a ?gigabyte acer, so some tips on what I should prepare to purchase in that department would be useful as well.


i plan on going digital, obviously, hd, obviously.
as for what i plan on filming, I'm going to write and direct feature films. My first one is gonna be in the spirit of Clerks directed by Kevin Smith. Its gonna be fucking golden and so long as i dont die young. I'll thank whoever helps me out the most at the end credits of my first feature film. I'll put it in writing so you can sue me for a lot of money if i dont do it. 

oh also where to get lights and equipment would be good. I live near Manhattan so if theres any shops people can suggest who live near the area thatd be cool.


-edit-
ok so i was high when i wrote this but lemme set some sorta cap, i plan on spending 10g on a decent digital camera for independent filmaking. i am gonna also throw the computer and lenses, on that budget. This is really to build up a portfolio as i further my studies after graduation. either i could go to Hofstra for more school which i really dont want to fucking do, or i could look into internship opportunities at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City. I'm probably gonna go with the latter, if not there then somewhere else, as i said i live near manhattan and am looking to get an apartment with that money as well."

I'm currently here on an internship in Brisbane that will end on the 26th. After, I have 10 days to travel around your beautiful country, short, but I have to get home for school. My current plan is to head from Brisbane to Cairns/the reef for 4 days, then 2 days in Sydney, and finally 3 days in Melbourne before I fly back to Brisbane to gather my things to head home. So here are my questions.

1.) I would like to stay at a resort on an island near the Great Barrier Reef for 2-3 nights. However, I will be by myself so I'm looking for a place that has younger people and activities I can do/pay for(e.g. kayaking, hiking etc.) Any suggestions on this one? 

2.) I have a cousin who just moved to Melbourne so I will be meeting with her and go explore the city/surrounding areas together. Anything in particular that we definitely should go see?

Cheers!"

Now we are going into our senior year of college. Everything is going great. She got an internship in Wisconsin this summer so I found an internship of my own here and followed her (we both live in PA). After 10 weeks of being together here, on our own, I requested one night off to be alone. I don't know why, but I just want to be alone sometimes. I guess I am just introverted. She got really upset/offended that I wanted to do this. I thought after spending every day together for 10 weeks it would be okay. My friend and I both have this issue and neither of us can resolve it. Do you think I am wrong wanting this time alone, why should I tell her I want to be alone (I can't find a good reason other than 'just cause'), and/or do you have any other tips to resolve this with her?

Thanks :) I tried to get to the point but if you have any questions about us or our relationship I will answer them."
j8dka,2,2011-08-03,My family is falling apart... advice?!?,tattoodethan,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j8dka/my_family_is_falling_apart_advice/,"this is long so bear with me.....

so summer of 2007 I met my wife, who had a daughter that was a year and a half old. we fell in love and got married and ended up having another beautiful daughter a year and a half later.. I am in the process of adopting the oldest from the biodad (hasnt seen her at all, and is signing over custody) 
A little background on my wife, she is a recovering addict kicked the habbit 6 months before we met and has been clean and strong ever since. While she was in her crazy phase though, her daughter, my soon to be ""officially"" daughter was in the care of my mother-in-law. While in her care my daughter had picked up so many horrible habbits and even knew all the characters from Bones, Dexter, and CSI at the age of 2. Many many more stories about how messed up this lady and her kids are, but for the sake of keeping this short ill just answer questions...

anyway, my in-laws are pretty crazy, i found out that mom, sisters and mom's ex all had money riding on our marriage failing. like, they bet on their own daughter staying married. Anyway, There was a night about 2 years ago when we were at the mom-in-laws Ex husband's house (mom-in-law mooches off anyone she can) and I witnessed the Ex smack my brother in law in the back of the head so hard that my brother in laws forehead went into the drywall. brother in law was 13 at the time. So I took my mother in law aside and told her that her son needs to be out of that situation and either the two of them or just him should move in so that he isnt being beat everyday. 

So mom-in-law and brother-in-law move in about a week later. blah blah blah... long story short we end up kicking them out 8 months later because she had never payed rent and used all our utilities. Keep in mind my wife was a stay at home mom and i was working full time and going to school full time for juvinile corrections and developmental psycology while i supported 2 extra people on top of my family. When she moved back out she took dishes and groceries and money from us, but we were at the point where we just wanted her gone so we didnt fight her over it all... The mom-in-law ended up moving back in with the Ex that beat her son.  Both of my sister-in-laws have lived with us too and stolen from us, but the one in particular we kicked out after we caught her snorting cocain off of our oldest daughter's bathroom counter.

With all of this mess, as you can imagine, we had some very unhappy family. The MIL and the SIL that we caught doing the drugs conspired against my wife because she didnt stick up for them when we decided to kick them all out. They came up with the bright idea that they would turn my wife, their daughter and sister, into child protective services and make up a bogus claim that my wife was beating our oldest daughter. So i was called by CPS in the middle of school and was told that CPS would be out at my house in an hour and i better be there if I didnt want my wife taken away along with my daughter. So needless to say i sped home.

The meeting with CPS was about 3 hours long and after i fought and pleaded the agency ""decided"" that my wife is not a violent person at all.  So out of nowhere, the lady from CPS asks how we punish our children and I said ""the usual, time out and chores"" and she said ""well dont you think a 3 year old is too young for chores?""  I kindly said ""no maam, i dont, when we used to spank she would say ""that doesnt hurt"" and I didnt see the point in BEATING MY CHILD, so we decided chores were a good compromise"". without flinching the lady said ""ok, well where we are at now is Ethan you will be filed in the system as a level 3 child abuser""   

BAM!!!! out of nowhere I was in the system, without a trial, without anything, WITHOUT PROOF EVEN!!!!   So i dropped out of school because i was a liability to all the clients and kids that i had to intern with. My wife and I jumped through every hoop we possibly had to to get this off my record and then when it came time for all of my ""good parent"" classes to be over CPS told me that it really didnt matter and that i was basically screwed for the next 5 years. So that was when we started fighting dirty and found out from a ""rouge agent"" that we had been profiled by CPS. We then set up a meeting with the head of the division where I am from and got it taken care of. Long story short i was finally off the hook and out of the system again. 4 days later the MIL found out that i had gotten off and filed another bogus claim. We told Health and welfare right away and tried to get them red flagged, but we were told that that was going to be impossible.

Durring this whole mess the MIL was in contact with the bio dad and convinced him that he needs to get custody of our daughterso we couldnt keep the in laws blocked out. The biodad filed and failed thank God. so once that blew up in her face she tried to get custody of her for herself by filing with the state of idaho under the grandparent rights law, but once again failed. The past year the in-laws had tried to take my children or have them taken from us 4 seperate times, they also pushed for jail time and such for me. It has now been about 5 months of peace and quiet, for the most part ha ha ah... still an annoying text or email from time to time to my wife from her sisters or mom, but not too bad. Up untill about a month ago she decided she would humor her mom and let her come see her at work and this is where the shit hit the fan. 

now my wife is wanting to hang out with her again and at first it just started out as Just my wife and her mom not the children (I refuse to let my girls be around them at all, only time i wil ever tell my wife what is going to happen in our relationship). My in-laws are the best at mind fucking its rediculou. they have my wife to the point now where she is convinced that i am controlling because i wouldnt let the kids go to the MIL's bday party over this last weekend. 

My wife and i wake up and can go almost all day without even talking to eachother and I hate it.. She is my best friend and I always looked up to her for her strength in overcoming her addictions, but now I am at a loss... i keep telling her to cut ties, but they have her so screwed in the head again... 

HELP!!!!!

p.s. sorry its written so shitty, but im at work and I am trying to type all this between customers. I am desperate..


tl;dr  My wife's family is ruining her relationship with me and our daughters...  "

She was away on an internship this summer.
We got to visit a few times.
She was going to come visit today, said she wanted to talk about something.
Gut warned me, so I pressed her.
She was breaking up with me, said she thought of me as a friend, and had convinced herself otherwise, since she was so excited to be in a relationship. Doesn't want to keep convincing herself or misleading me.

And now I don't know. Because I thought something I had worked towards for over a year was finally working out. And it's not.

So I don't know what I'm going to do now. Find someone else, I imagine, but right about now I don't -want- to. Five girlfriends in seven years is more than I wanted.

She's 21, I'm 23."

j9upm,7,2011-08-05,Persistent headaches and lightheadedness. Doesn't feel 'real'. What's going on?,rfederici,Health,https://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/j9upm/persistent_headaches_and_lightheadedness_doesnt/,"Hello, this is my first post on /r/Health, but I've seen helpfulness and courtesy from the people here; I've had this problem for approximately 7 months now, and it's progressively getting worse. I'm extremely nervous and confused about what's happening.

I've been a healthy male my whole life. I'm currently 19 years old and not on any medication. I take daily vitamins and fish oil. I exercise fairly regularly; I have been playing soccer for 15 years, and sportfighting for two. I've had my share of cuts, bruises, broken bones, and sicknesses (both small and severe), but I've never experienced what I'm experiencing now. Early of last year (2010), my friend introduced me to marijuana. I tried it, everything seemed fine, so I continued. At first, it was once a month. Then, it was once every two weeks. Then, it was once a week. It didn't get much more than that, but I could still stop for a few days and everything would be normal. There were even multiple times I would stop for weeks at a time, and life still went on completely as usual.

This spanned until mid-January. I was having surgery to have my wisdom teeth removed. After the surgery was successful, they sent me home with a percoset prescription. My mom only allowed me half of a tablet whenever I complained, which was about every other day for a little over a week, so I didn't really have much. I did a little research on mixing marijuana and percoset, to be sure there wouldn't be any negative effects, but decided I would refrain from smoking just to be on the safe side.

A few days after taking my last percoset, I tried smoking. It was late at night in late January; under my heated blanket, on my tempurpedic bed, watching television. A very comfortable environment. Suddenly, the sharpest pain I had ever felt strikes my heart; I clutch it. It's constant. Two hours pass; I'm still in intense pain, my 'high' is long gone. I was calm, breathing slowly and deeply, but my heart was still racing.

I haven't been the same since that night. At first, It was heart-related issues. My heart would have these sharp, constant pains at random times. Sometimes within minutes of each other, sometimes not for a month. It was strange; and the two doctors I went to did three or four tests and said it was panic attacks.

I tried smoking once since that night (5 months ago); and the same thing happened. The heart 'episodes' haven't happened for about two months. Now, I have a much more strange and scary issue. Over the past few months, I've noticed myself getting more and more light-headed. It doesn't feel like life is real anymore; it feels like I'm dreaming, and it doesn't go away. I wake up with it, and I lie down at night with it. I've also been having headaches like this. They've been getting worse as well. They may or may not be related, but I wake up with them, fall asleep with them. I've noticed a lack of ability to focus recently. My eyes don't seem to adjust to depth or textures as well as they used to. It takes squinting and head repositioning to adjust to a new visual range. Just yesterday, I was in a restaurant where the seats were a floral pattern. Every time I looked, it was like a 90's 3D movie. It hurt to look at. Made my head (just behind my eyes) ache.

I'm not sure if it's a problem with my eyes, head, or something else, but does anyone know what's going on or how to stop it? I haven't felt truly great in so long. The few medically-inclined people I've told suggested that stress was to blame. Yet, if it wasn't for this, my life would be everything I want it to be. I landed a great internship with an awesome group of co-workers, I'm in a happy relationship of nearly a year, finally paying my parents the debt I owe them for repairing my car last summer. Things are going great, but I can't appreciate it because it doesn't feel real. Nothing does. To make the situation more scary and frustrating, the two doctors I've been to about this have told me it's all in my head. It's honestly getting a little aggravating that they give up so easily. I have posted this passage on WebMD as well, but have yet to get a response after a little over a week.

Feel free to ask any questions, and I want to thank you all for taking the time to read this, whether you can help you or not. I'm truly scared of what's happening. Thanks /r/health"

jau1v,0,2011-08-06,IT Jobs in Toronto?,DZ302,toronto,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/jau1v/it_jobs_in_toronto/,"Hello, Nova Scotian here, graduated IT Networking/Systems in 2010, but have barely gotten a job interview (and I actually have pretty good experience for someone out of school, I did my internship with my school, and they hired me full time for a summer, and part time through the next school year). From my graduating class of 12, one is working in IT, and it's out of province...One of my class mates went out west to Alberta to look for IT work, he couldn't find any there and just started working at Fort Mac, I have another friend who does work IT in Edmonton, but he hates it.

Just wondering if it would be easy to find an entry level IT job in Toronto, I just need any kind of job with relevant experience to get my foot in the door, and I can't stay in Halifax working for $10/hour paycheck to paycheck much longer, so I'm considering moving to Ontario or Montreal possibly at the end of the year if there's work available."
japyt,11,2011-08-06,It's funny...,sniperdogruffo,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/japyt/its_funny/,"I had been trying to get back with an ex. Try as I might I could not have a conversation with her. She was so cutting and to the point in answering questions and what have you, she simply was dead to my attempts, not sparking anything worthwhile. I should have gotten the hint and accepted it and moved on, but I didn't want it to end like this, so coldly. I still felt something for her but it should have been more obvious to me with time that she was trying to move on and I was just a remnant of an uncomfortable past.

Yesterday was the last day at an internship, and it was a rather emotional day in the beginning what with all the goodbyes going around. I tried to find solace in her, my ex, but again I only got a cold shoulder. I lost it there, and I asked her why it was that I could not strike up a conversation with her anymore and she said it bluntly that she wasn't interested. And despite the fact that she had already made this obvious to me before, clingy old me still tried, but this time it was just too much. And I decided to say goodbye to her forever.

I logged off gmail, deleted her off facebook, deleted all her emails today and blocked the hell out of her and then I cried in a strange manner. All these years of bottling things up inside made me cry in such a pitiful way that I was laughing as I was crying, and the self-awareness of it all made me even laugh some more. Nonetheless I was extremely fucked up emotionally, this time this break up really hurt because I meant it and so did she, it was the culmination of trying to fix a relationship that was long dead.

I was burping a lot, and I wasn't hungry at all after my 1 minute of crying, or whatever the hell that was, all in all I wasn't feeling well at all. And then I knew what I had to do, and this is the part that I find funny. Days ago I had been posting on r/running how much of a great idea it seemed to me to go for a run after a break up because it clears the mind. It was supposed to be my day off running, but I knew I needed the endorphins.

Sure enough, 15 minutes into my run the everything that made me feel ill didn't feel that bad anymore, things were falling into perspective and even though I was always thinking about her, it was severely less painful. I finished my run, got home took a shower and had a text message from a girl I like to go to a free Shakespeare play out in the Boston Commons. I took her offer and immediately I start joking with her and flirting and having a blast, and at this point everything was absolutely perfect as I'm still riding my runner's high, feeling satisfyingly sore and elated to be in the great company of my friend, enjoying the evening breeze at a park watching a play. 

Soon after we went our separate ways. I returned home in the T with a friend I encountered at the play as well. We talked all the way home, then spent a good two hours sharing memories of our homes far far away from Boston. 

And it's all fine now. I don't want to see her, I don't want to invite the pain again and let it take hold, all that jealousy and possessiveness, I want it all away from me. And now, as I'm waiting at the airport to go home, all I can think of is my dog and my family, and finally being able to rest. Life is good. "
jamwv,1,2011-08-06,"Just wrote the first chapter of my first novel.  I would appreciate any criticism and feedback, thanks.",[deleted],writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/jamwv/just_wrote_the_first_chapter_of_my_first_novel_i/,"CHAPTER ONE

	Today had to be the day.  The sun was shining, and it had been a fun day at the beach with his best friend, but Theodore Roberts could not wait to get back home and check the mail.  After three rounds of interviews and two months of waiting, today was supposed to be the day Teddy was to find out whether he had been accepted to the prestigious internship at the New York County District Attorney’s Office.  Three days left in his summer, but he couldn’t wait for school, and hopefully the internship, to begin.  Entering his second year of law school, Teddy could already envision himself as ADA Roberts, putting the bad guys in jail to the delight of his family, the victims, and all of New York City; it was all his family had ever wanted from him.  Or was it for him?  Either way, Teddy had to make his parents proud; they sacrificed everything so that he wouldn’t have to be in $150,000 of debt after he graduated, like so many of his classmates.  Ever since Teddy got into a good college, his parents pushed him in the direction of the LSATs, and then law school.  They had assured him he could do whatever he wanted, but guilt prevented him from disappointing them.  Ted could already picture his mother telling her friends about her son, the lawyer.  
	Ted had not been able to eat a quality meal since the previous Friday when the DA’s Office e-mailed him telling him that they would notify him within the week.  So here he was, stupefied with what felt like a rock in the pit of his stomach for the last two months, transforming into a boulder since Friday.  The sun was beating down through the windshield, but he couldn’t concentrate on the heat, or anything else for that matter.  Teddy had obsessed over the internship since last summer when his best friend, Stoner, held the same position.  
	Eric Stone was one year ahead of Teddy in law school.  The two had been best friends since Mr. McAdams’ third grade class.  They remained best friends through their years at St. Sebastian’s high school, playing on the same football team.  Stoner was the quarterback and Teddy played safety; both captains on their respective sides of the ball.  The friends acted off the field similarly to the way they acted on the field.  Stoner was Mr. Popular, always the center of attention.  Teddy went about his business meticulously, but liked to accomplish what was asked of him, and then exit the spotlight.   Their senior year Teddy committed to playing safety at the University of Delaware, while Stoner decided to focus on his scholastics at the University of Pennsylvania.  Teddy loved football and started three out of four years for the Fighting Blue Hens, while Stoner graduated a year early to get a jump start on law school.
	“Well, Ted?” Stoner began, “which one is it?  Would you rather go one round with Mike Tyson in his prime, or have somebody smash a bee hive over your head?”
	Teddy was usually eager to play the “Would-You-Rather” Game, but today all he could think about was the mail waiting for him at home.  In all honesty, Ted would have rather had no summer vacation at all if it meant he could work at the District Attorney’s Office.  
	“I don’t know, probably Tyson,” muttered Teddy.
	Stoner acted as if he had just stubbed his toe upon hearing that answer.  If he had been drinking something, it surely would have looked like a cheesy sitcom in the car with Stoner spraying whatever it was all over the place.  Had Teddy been able to even grasp his friends incredulous reaction, he would have laughed and made a witty comment, but he was preoccupied and just wanted to get home.
	“Are you kidding, Tee?  Do you know how good Mike Tyson used to be?  He was The. Baddest. Man. On. The. Planet.  What do you really think would hurt worse, one hundred bee stings or one hundred shots from Tyson?” Stoner asked, not really expecting a response.  “Dude, Mike Tyson would put you into a coma, then take a bee hive and throw it at you.  I can’t believe you picked Tyson.”
	Teddy was not paying attention to his friend’s pugilist-inspired rant. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”  Who could care about an over-the-hill boxer when his law school career was on the line?  Stoner’s excitement just made Ted drive faster.  The speed limit on the Long Island Expressway was fifty-five miles per hour, but Teddy was pushing his father’s 2002 Ford Focus for everything it was worth, albeit only seventy-two point nine miles per hour.  There could have been a naked woman in a convertible next to the car and Teddy would not have noticed.  The only thing separating him from his future was twenty miles.  
	“Okay, I’ll think of another one.”  Stoner then paused to think, leaving only the whining  engine as a soundtrack.  “I got it.  Would you rather kill somebody you didn’t know, who had no family, or be killed?”  
	Stoner’s question caught Teddy by surprise.  The game was usually fun-loving, if not vulgar, but every now and again a serious question such as this would arise.  He loved his life and family, and looked forward to his future.  On the other hand, he had never killed anything larger than an ant his entire life and did not think he could do it.  Teddy loved his golden retriever, Prince William, growing up and could not imagine killing an animal, much less a human.
	The Universe decided that it was time for Teddy to find out.  With most of his thoughts concentrated on the District Attorney’s Office, and the remainder on Stoner’s question, there was nothing left to concentrate on his surroundings.  Stoner had his head back and eyes closed, waiting for his best friend’s response.  Even had he been vigilant in looking out, there would have been no time.  Testing the car at just under seventy-three miles per hour, the world was flying by too quickly to react.  Reality now seemed to be played through a high-speed lens; one shot for every passing nanosecond.  The first thing Teddy saw was two terrified, brown spheres.  Next came the impact.  The deer’s head smashed off of the windshield on the driver’s side, immediately twisting and snapping the doe’s cervical.  Teddy slammed on the brakes hard, angry at himself that he had not been paying attention.  What would his father say?
	Ted pulled the Focus onto the shoulder, thankful that nobody had been tailgating.  He could not see, but he was sure there was damage to the front and side of the car.  His father would be thankful that nobody was hurt, but understandably upset at the repair costs and insurance hike.  And then, of course, there was the deer.
	“Ted, you okay?  I’m okay and the car seems drivable.  I guess that could’ve been a whole lot worse.”  After a deep breath, Stoner continued, “you definitely killed that deer.  Better him than us.”
	“Absolutely.  I’m glad you’re alright.”  The funny thing was, Teddy didn’t care at all about the deer; it had not even crossed his mind.    With that, Teddy exited the car to inspect the car’s damage.  There was a speck of blood on the windshield where the initial collision took place, and a large dent in the area of the driver’s door’s hinges.  The deer’s inertia carried it to the shoulder, where it lay dead, twitching.  Teddy stood over the nearly lifeless body, recognizing that it was an adult female, probably a mother.  He did not feel sad, or troubled by the deer.  The only feeling he had was one of overwhelming apathy, and that terrified him.

jam7q,3,2011-08-06,Broke up with my boyfriend of 1 year.,arrbreakups,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/jam7q/broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_of_1_year/,"19/F and 21/M 

About a month or two ago, I tried to take some breaks from him because of the issues addressed below and because I was afraid of losing my job. Things were stressful and he was hurt, he is even more so now ..

We broke up about two weeks ago. Things continued in a somewhat purgatory zone. We gave each other little presents (little Starcraft plushies) and talked daily. We knew we cared and loved each other. Last night I cut the last cords up – he thought we were still a thing and had a chance, but I told him we were over. 

Things for the past months have been not great. We were happy with each other, but there were some issues ..

* We stopped having sex regularly as I stopped enjoying it. After multiple UTIs, a pregnancy and STD scare (mostly because I am paranoid about my health), and short fights about birth control, I didn't want to try and have sex with him anymore. I also felt sex was a bit disgusting because I was sexually battered by a former friend of mine, and started thinking about it when my ex would touch me. I didn't want to even makeout with him, as I was afraid it would lead to sex. It was a big deal to him, because he said intimacy was important to him. It was the underlying issue for a lot of the bad feelings he had, and the one of the things that made me tell him it wasn't going to work because I couldn't fix it.
* I wanted to work a lot to keep my job and get an internship with the engineering team at work. I got the internship and will be switching over to the team in about a week.
* ""I feel like we're just friends sometimes."" was something he said a lot. 
* He said he loved me a long time before I did. I told him I loved him the day we broke up. It's a very strong term for me, and I was very cautious in using it. He was surprised when I didn't say it back to him and it hurt him.
* We were dependent on each other for social interaction. We both barely have any friends.
* There were jealousy and insecurity issues. I was always afraid to hang out with my male friends, and he was uncomfortable with it. He thought all my guy friends had ulterior motives. ""I trust you, but not them.""

I see myself being with him in the future when my career is set, but not right now. His great-grandmother wants to give us her furniture when she keels over! His family adores me, and my parents like him as well. He's sweet to me (breakfast in bed, takes off my shoes) but sometimes very immature in the way he acts when he's upset (throws things, says hurtful things, is very passive aggressive) .. But he's a good guy, and has treated me better than anyone has in a long time. I care a lot about him and love him very much.

But, I want to focus on my career right now, 'cause I need to take this opportunity and make the best of it. And, I also want to see other people and experience different things before I settle down, so I know that he's truly the ""one"" for me. I don't ever want to keep wondering or feel like he held me back.

The problem is I don't want to completely shut the door. I tell him that he doesn't have to wait for me and I don't expect him to, and that if we're meant to be together, we'll find each other again.

He thinks that if I truly loved him, I would try and make it work now. I don't have the resources to make this happen right now. I can't possibly try and give my internship the best I can and make the relationship work without having two of myself.

Do I stop talking to him completely for a few weeks? He wants me to keep him in the loop about what is going to happen, but it feels horrible. I don't want this psuedo-relationship with him that's only going to keep hurting. Should I draft up a final letter saying that we shouldn't communicate for a while?"
jag9x,4,2011-08-05,Zombie Novel,nfuentes,roundrobin,https://www.reddit.com/r/roundrobin/comments/jag9x/zombie_novel/,"*Some guides for writing the story:* 

* *It's told in first person*

* *Noah, the protagonist, is a girl, but I would like to keep her gender secret from readers until mid-story or until some giant climax.*

* *Story is first-person.*

* *Noah meets Sharise and Ginny when she breaks into a house to rest for the night.*

* *Sharise is a tired, but caring mother. Capable of keeping her daughter safe so far.*

* *Ginny is a young naive teenager that Noah feels should grow up*

* *Other characters should be introduced along the way, maybe some discussion about who and when later?*




Story:

I spent a large part of my life fantasizing about the zombie apocalypse. I loved zombies. I loved to read books and watch movies about them. I analyzed what characters did that I thought would be successful in a real zombie apocalypse. Changed what I thought wouldn't and made it more effective. Spent hours looking at how to zombie proof one's home and many more playing zombie themed video games. It was all good and fun while it lasted. It gave me something to do in my spare time.  I had a zombie survival plan in place. What I would do, who I would take with, and where I would go. I assumed it was the perfect plan for the big end. That no one else’s plan would be as successful as mine. It was not enough.

The games, books, and movies only prepare you for so much. What they do not do is teach you how to cope when a loved one is infected with the zombie virus. How you have to watch the horror they feel once they realize they have been bitten. Experience hope for them, that maybe they are immune to the virus. And eventually, having to leave them behind...or kill them to prevent the virus from further annihilating the human species. Those nights and days spent alone, running for your life, sustaining yourself in an environment in which you used to be the dominant creature, but no longer. 


God, we were so cocky. Thinking we could mess with DNA, create super antibiotics designed to heal and prevent previously incurable ailments. I'm not sure if it was this that did us in, in the end. The news at the time was overflowing with a whirlwind of tales of recalled meat, bad medicines and stories of the new super antibiotics. No one I've met knows what really caused it. All we have is theories. Maybe it was a combination of bad products or a super virus. Maybe, for those of you that still believe, it is god’s punishment for how humans have behaved. But these theories won't get us anywhere for now. Now, all we have is survival. You really can't hope for much more than that during a Zombie Apocalypse.

**The Beginning**

At first everyone was getting sick. People rushed to the hospital to get diagnosed. Reports of symptoms similar to the flu: high fever, cough. The body rejecting normal food. But it didn't stop there. Eventually people's bodies gave up fighting the virus. Finally, the first person died. Only to rise again. No one knew what to do. It went against the medical staff's training to kill something that should have been a miracle. But when the patient came after them, they were forced to defend themselves. Not everyone was able to escape unscathed. The patient had bitten many before settling down to devour an intern. It was pandemonium from there and all hell broke loose. Or at least that's what the news claimed while it was still running. 

Soon the medical centers became places to be avoided. The government issued quarantines and cautioned the public not to leave their homes. But even with those cautions the virus spread. Families had no choice but to kill parents, children, siblings. The only other choices were suicide or being eaten. 

The world as we knew it changed. No place was really safe anymore. This is my story. 



Chapter one

The sun glared through the window, a bright and early wake up is the best way to go. It gives you more time to travel, and to find shelter and provisions. It's also easier to see the zombies in the day time. You can hear their moans and pinpoint their locations. You never want to travel in the dark if you can help it. Too many things that create paranoia can be mistaken for the walking dead. You can avoid accidentally stumbling over a crippled zombie and being bitten by traveling during the day. 
   I started this morning off like I started most other mornings: turn my radio on and listen for any broadcasts. I kept the radio noise level low, because, even though I was camped out in an attic, one can never guarantee something didn’t sneak into the house while you were sleeping.
   I set the radio to shuffle through channels while I got dressed and packed up my things. I pulled some new clothes from out of my hiking pack, and put on a layer of long johns and extra layers of shirts under outside clothing. It wasn't that cold this fall morning, but the layers would help to prevent a bite breaking skin if I ran into any trouble. Next were the socks, boots, and jacket. Now that I was dressed it was time to roll up my sleeping bag and put it, and my old clothes, into my pack.  The entire time the radio had been shuffling through static noise. No one was broadcasting this morning. I felt a moment of panic. Was I the last human left? Had the zombie horde finally become so destructive that only a sole human has been able to stay alive? I quickly squashed these fears. I could not be the only one. Not me, a college student, who spent most of my time indoors or hanging out with friends. There had to be many more people who had more survival skills than just me. It would be presumptuous of me to assume such a thing. 
With that, I shut the radio off and stored it in a pocket. I grabbed my pack and put it on. Patted my jacket’s specially sewn pockets to assure myself that the gun and ammo were still there, and, finally, grabbed my trusty axe. 
   I moved forward and started to move the old furniture I had blocking the attic door. Once everything was cleared, I put my ear to it and listened for noises. I held my breath. One too many times I have had to beat back an intruding zombie to leave a house. I hoped today would not be one of those days. I waited a few more seconds. Was that shuffling, Please god, not today, I thought. I heard a small muffled noise. I couldn't take waiting anymore. I flung open the door and braced myself to slice anything that came rushing at me. Nothing. Nothing was on the stairs. What had I heard then? I looked around and slowly crept down the stairway. Something moved in one of the bedrooms on the second floor. I debated trying to leave without discovering what was in the bedroom. I decided I would rather confront whatever it was face to face, rather than have something try to chew on my back as I was leaving. I took a breath and crept forward. I did not see anything at eye level in the bedroom. What was in there?

jbokl,11,2011-08-07,Got two potential job offers but I don't know which to take.,MrAlexSan,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jbokl/got_two_potential_job_offers_but_i_dont_know/,"Over the summer I did an internship program at a very poorly managed company. Every paycheck usually bounced or had some convenient ""accident"" happen which made the checks bad for every employee there. Keep in mind, half of the people working there are unpaid interns.

When my internship was up they wanted to offer me a part time job, but they could not afford to do so at the time so I was let go and told that they'd get back to me when they worked out a few things.

During the two weeks I spent not working I was offered another job. It would be a three week job (I work in the film industry), with some fat payoff. My friend, who is working on the job already, had forwarded them my info since they were scrounging for people to hire. I, however, have not heard anything from them. 

Yesterday my old internship job finally worked out a way to get me on full time instead of part time. While the job would be through October at the soonest, it would barely be secure since they've always had so many financial problems and ""inconveniences."" While I won't have such a big payoff I'll be stuck at a job place I have no passion to work at which could go belly up at any moment, but if it survives to October I'll have a decent amount of cash.

The bad job wants to talk with me tomorrow, but I've no clue how to delay committing to it, but keeping it open, until I know for sure what's going with the job I really want. Both start on the same day.

**TL;DR** Two job options. One with high payoff that I really want but they'll ""Get in touch, soon"" or a for sure job I'll get but don't want since the company is very financially insecure. Wat do?!

EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions, everyone. You've all pretty much reinforced my feelings about the job I don't want. The big thing with my situation is finances, while I would get a quick buck with the Dream Job I want it will not last if I keep going job to job, which is the hardest part about being a filmmaker trying to ""make it"" in the industry. Also, I'm not a Director, Producer, or Actor, so the term ""make it"" means ""have work."" 
Crap Job will, if they pay me, give me some longevity and stability. Something I'd really like, but I know I'm fooling myself with that because every two weeks it'll be ""Boss, my check is _____________. What gives?"""

I find myself cheating way too much.,rm548,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/jbkj2/how_to_stay_motivated_after_reaching_goal_i_find/,"Hi folks, I owe a lot to you all for my successes over the last 8 months. I've been able to drop from 240 to 175 and I'm now sitting at around 185. I've noticed that ever since I've hit my goal of 175, I've lost some of my inner drive and have gotten into some of my old habits that got me to 240 in the first place.

For those who have been successful in keeping the weight off, what do you do to keep motivated and sticking to your diet and exercise regimen? I think one of the big issues for me is my ever changing schedule. I lost most of the weight during the 6 months I was on internship working full time. Now that I'm back in classes living a normal college life, I am not in any particular routine. During work, I would come home and go straight to the gym every day which was very easy to get in the habit of doing. Now that I have classes scheduled at different times every day, I have no routine.

Edit: I'd also like to ask if anyone else has a MUCH easier time sticking to healthy eating on days they go to the gym vs days they do not go to the gym? For me it's like the workout is fresh in my mind and I know I'd be throwing away that sweat and effort.

I'd just like to add that you guys are awesome!!"

I am one of those people who has always been relatively fit, without ever really having to work at it. However, since high school I have put on a little ""padding"", and have never had a six-pack or been especially muscular. I have often wished I could change that, and have gotten as close as working out (probably improperly) for a couple of days, only not to return once DOMS sets in (thanks FAQ!). However, I want to change that. I have been browsing this subreddit for a couple of days, read all the great FAQ's and really want to get down to business. I finish my summer internship at the end of this week, and have about about a month and a half of complete free-time before school resumes, and I want to use this time to start building some good habits, get into a groove, and perhaps bulk up and start getting some definition by the time girls are back in town ;).

The Basics:
- I am a 5'11"", ~165lb. 20 year old male College Student.
- I want to lose fat, gain muscle, and increase definition. My main concerns are my stomach, chest, and arms, but I understand that a full body workout is probably preferable to an upper body one.
- No injuries or other health concerns.
- I played football and swam in high school, and tried to do these programs fitness regimens, but never stuck to it. I have alot of friends who work out pretty regularly in college who can give me some guidance about technique, and I do have experience doing most basic weight lifts (bench, squat, etc.), and free access to a Division 1 sports facility.
- Diet is not really an issue for me. I don't eat a whole lot, but have some experience with watching my intakes, and am just as happy eating a tasty salad as I am eating a burger. I am happy to make any adjustments based upon your suggestions, and am open to experimenting with (affordable) supplements.

Main Concerns:
- I would like some suggestions as to what I should be doing on a day to day, or week to week basis. I don't have enough experience with workouts to really know where to start, or how to manage my expectations. I have done some research online for routines and liked 
&lt;http://www.workout-routine.com/dumbbells/full-body/index.html&gt;, but I would like to incorporate some benching and squatting into the mix.
- I want a workout/diet/supplement schedule that will most effectively help me reach my goals. I figure your experiences will be the best way to narrow that down.
- I WANT to keep at it, and value personal accountability more than anything. But I know talk is cheap. Any suggestions as to how I can get into a groove, and stay there, are more than welcome. 

I appreciate any and all comments, thank you all for your time!

jdbku,1,2011-08-09,Need some advice...,theyjuststared,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/jdbku/need_some_advice/,"Sorry this got a bit long I just wanted to give enough background...

So I was on BC from Jan - early June this year.  In June I came to Japan for a summer internship and when I first got here I was ok for about a week but then started having really intense emotional breakdowns...now this coincided with the end of the cycle of BC I was on which I had decided not to take for the summer since I wasn't going to be around my bf.  

After getting off of the birthcontrol I have been much happier in general then I was not only when I first got here, but more so even then I was at the end of last school year -- I hadn't even realized how depressed and irritable I had become; my bf and bff both have mentioned to me how my moods seem to have improved over the course of the summer...(though I have started having some pretty bad PMS : \ )

So I've pretty much decided that this isn't the BC for me and have an apt at the end of sept to see my doc for a new recommendation; however, I return to school in about two weeks and will be having le sexy times with the bf again so, should I go back on the pill just for the time being? I know I could never go through with an abortion if I got pregnant and its my senior year of college so I don't really want to risk it...but at the same time I don't want to be a crazy bitch all over the place to the people I care about...

what do?

could I possibly take it with something like 5-HTP to balance things out?  I mean I'm now aware of the mood changes so I'll probably be able to control them a little better but it's hard to fight your hormones...

any advice would be appreciated : \ "
jd4ro,1,2011-08-09,"I am so in like with this girl, but it's super complicated (originally posted in r/AL)",Illogical_Fallacy,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/jd4ro/i_am_so_in_like_with_this_girl_but_its_super/,"**I'm guessing that this isn't a topic that the queer population of reddit is interested in due to the downvotes in two subreddits. *shrug***

Note, the following content involves gender identity, polyamory, and some cuteness.

To start things off, I'll give the background info.

I originally typed up the original on my phone. I added some clarifying information and spell/grammar-checked things. :)

Me: male-bodied, trans-feminine, super-affectionate, genderqueer, poly dyke currently dating R and used to date C.

C: pansexual cis-female whom I dated from May until last week. Besty fwb now.

R: pansexual female-bodied genderqueer person I'm involved in a ldr with since June, but known for 2 years. No direct relation to current issue, but I am in a relationship with her.

B: femme cis-female bi+poly-curious lesbian I'm madly heads over heels in like with.

The story:

I met B about a month ago from okc. She recently moved here about a week or two before we met. She's incredibly beautiful, shy enough that anything beyond holding hands in public makes her nervous, and has a wonderful personality. She's also a literary geek :D. We went on a few dates and during that time, we connected really well and and such an incredible spark between us that whenever we kiss, even for a brief moment, I blush and lose my breath for a short while. I highly value the natural chemistry between me and potential partners as I do kiss some of my friends and nothing is really meant of it. When there's a spark (a incredibly intense one in this case), there's obviously something worth pursuing romantically.

B is a small town girl who has spent the past few years moving from place to place with gfs. This is her first chance to be single and discover herself outside of being in a committed relationship. She is somewhat involved with a hetero couple in a potential fwb relationship, but things are difficult because the girl in that relationship has some control issues. In addition, she has been on some dates with other girls and longs for a previously unobtainable girl back in NC, where she was last at. Needless to say, she is open-minded about dating.

Since she is a decent enough person in many other regards, I try to help B get acclimated to the city and offer help when I can, including offering her a place to stay if needed and providing connections for job applications and local internships for her class's requirements for human services. She has had a tough few years, so I figured that I may as well offer a hand since I grew up pretty disadvantaged and know what it's like for her now (i.e. being broke as hell and struggling to pay for rent, food, anything). In her case, it was because her new store (corporate bookstore) delayed her transfer for almost a month, which is stretching her budget more than she had anticipated.

Our 3rd date started off wonderfully with a walk, some coffee, and cuddling while watching the river. At the end, as we sat in my car before I drove her home, we made out and it felt amazing physically and emotionally. Immediately afterward though, she confessed that she can't continue past that. She truly likes spending time with me and would want to do something more, but she just can't get over the incompatibility with her sexuality. Serious ""D: what just happened?"" moment. I was honest and told her that I was disappointed, would cry when I get home, and get over it eventually since she is an awesome person to befriend. I called C and she helped me through the situation, which was wonderful of her.

A few weeks pass, and lots of things happen. C has always been supportive of my relationships, and she's generally awesome except for the fact that she is a legitimate misanthrope (we were quite the odd couple). We broke up for unrelated issues that are not pertinent to the situation at hand. When I tell her updates about B, she gets huffy and doesn't understand how B could really like me and not want to pursue anything. C really things that is very shallow of B to focus on genitalia on some level. Then again, she does admit that she's biased from a pansexual standpoint.

B and I hang out every now and then, with the last time being this past weekend. We went to museums and the central library. We vary between holding hands and nothing more to standing awkwardly apart when she realizes again that we couldn't work out. I never knew how much I liked her until I saw her drenched in the rain beside me with a huge smile on her face. It's not just a physical attraction; I truly like her, which is another reason why I help her out so much. I honestly don't expect to win her affections or anything, even if I secretly hope so. First and foremost is her wellbeing. I just wish that I could be a bigger part of her romantic life. I know that sounds like just talk, but I grew up with strong morals and great respect for others. Hell, there was even a time when I had to forcefully persuade a girl to not break up with her girlfriend just for a guaranteed threesome with me and C. That was such a difficult decision, but it had to be done. C was upset at me, of course, haha.

One of the nails that drive this situation deeper into my emotions is that I know she likes me romantically, even now. So the issue is just sexual incompatibility. I know that it's not dick phobia because she's really into that guy from the fwb situation and wants to have sex with him. At the same time, I know that just because you're bi (or bicurious in this case) doesn't mean that you're pan either. Still, it just bugs me so much because I don't know what to do anymore when things are just a few steps away from being great.

I have been comfortable with my body, my gender identity,and my sexuality after going through a great deal of introspection and experiences during my journey of self-identity. This is the honestly the first time I truly feel upset for being genderqueer. :( I can't believe that B can affect me so much.

I guess that I just needed to vent and hear what others think about this uncommon situation.

Tl;dr, genderqueer person likes a girl with great mutual attraction to each other, but pansexual the girl is not.

jd0p0,5,2011-08-08,"IAmA 20 year old girl with scoliosis, who had a spinal fusion at 13...AMA",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/jd0p0/iama_20_year_old_girl_with_scoliosis_who_had_a/,"First off, hello everyone! http://i.imgur.com/cwBdL.jpg

Around the age of 10, my parents noticed my back and shoulder blades looked uneven. They took me to our local Shriner's Hospital to get screened for scoliosis, and that's where it all began. Oh, and by the way, if you’ve never heard of Shriner’s, they provide free orthopedic and burn care to children whose families can’t afford it on their own. There’s absolutely no way my parents could have afforded my back braces and surgery, and without Shriners’ compassion and generosity, today I would probably be in a wheelchair and unable to have a normal life. I’m immensely grateful for everything they did for me.


Anyways, it was determined that I had adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, which basically means that instead of being straight, like a normal spine, mine was shaped like the letter S. Unfortunately I don’t have any pre-surgery pictures of my own back at hand, so here are some examples of other people with severe scoliosis that resemble the way I looked prior to surgery. [1](http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/figures/A00353F01.jpg) [2](http://costamesa-chiropractors.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/signs-of-a-scoliosis1.jpg) [3](http://www.eurospine.org/cm_data/Scoliosis_Fig03_en.jpg)


I participated in a scoliosis research study while the doctors at Shriners observed the progress of my spine through puberty. I would go to the hospital every six months, get a fuck ton of measurements taken, and fill out some surveys regarding my body image and non-physical issues I had with scoliosis. I had three braces (that didn't do jack shit, probably because I didn't wear them as much as I should have) before I ultimately ended up needing surgery.


In sixth grade, I got my first brace. It was a [Spinecor brace](http://scoliosisgta.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/SW-ap_br-eye_black.83192217.jpg), with cloth straps meant to pull my body into a corrected posture. That one didn't do much for me, so I was fitted for a [Boston brace](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_gVpOkFpmgmg/SiwaOOm3kmI/AAAAAAAAALU/j29MDd9jKZ4/s400/boston-brace.jpg) in seventh grade. The Boston brace was a mold of my body that was taken after the doctors forced my torso into an awkward, contorted position that straightened my spine. The idea was to apply pressure at the right points to prevent my curvature from progressing. I didn't wear that as much as I should have because I was getting ridiculed at school, especially in gym class. The third last-ditch effort was the [Charleston brace](http://www.orthotic.com/cb.jpg). That one was supposed to bend my body to the side, against the curve. I had to wear all of my braces 23 hours a day, except for the Charleston brace, which I only wore while sleeping.


None of the braces seemed to be helping my curve. I had frequent *terrible* backaches that would sometimes keep me home from school, I couldn't stand upright for more than ten minutes without back spasms and cramps, and my clothes never fit right. Not trying to make this a sob story, but in general, between having a noticeably deformed spine and having to wear braces to school under my clothes (which was an ordeal in itself - jeans were nearly impossible to wear, and most shirts showed my braces. Not the end of the world by any means, but it certainly felt that way to a pre-teen girl, haha), I got picked on a lot. It's hard enough being a 12 year old girl as it is! All in all, it fucking sucked, and my next move was to get a [spinal fusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_fusion).


A spinal fusion, in my case, involved two stainless-steel rods being screwed into the upper half of my spine. I couldn't correct my entire spine because of a fracture in one of my lower vertebrae from a bad fall, apparently it would have put too much strain on the fracture. My vertebrae were fused together in a corrected position using bone that was shaved off of my right hip. The way I understand it, that entire portion of my spine is ""welded"" into a straight and solid mass using rods and bone graft. I have one scar that goes from just below my neck to the middle of my back, and another smaller one on my hip from where they took the bone graft.


Surgery was terrifying. I was 13, and had never been under the knife before for any reason. I think the worst part before the actual procedure was giving blood for use during/after my surgery. I was an underweight beanpole of a girl and didn't weigh enough to give blood - I passed out the first time, and got sick the second. I wish I could donate blood, but after that, just getting a tiny amount of blood drawn at the doctor's gives me the heebie-jeebies. I don't remember much from before I went under, besides being very quiet and scared. The nurses gave me some kind of medicine that calmed me down and caused me to forget anything that happened after I took it, but my parents said I loosened up immediately and started singing at the top of my lungs and insulting the interns for ""standing around and doing NOTHING!"" I was in the hospital for a week and don't remember being in any pain thanks to a morphine drip. I wish my family had videotaped me on morphine, apparently I was a hoot, but I only remember sleeping and feeling nauseous most of the time.


My surgery was just after I got out of school for the summer, so I spent that whole summer recovering and slowly regaining my mobility and strength. Now, seven years later, I'm happy to say that I've had no troubles with my spine except for the occasional back ache after doing things like cleaning or yard work that involve bending/leaning over. I’m still quite flexible, I can do more or less anything I want to, and my back looks so much straighter and even. I still struggle with body image sometimes, it's hard to shake feeling ""deformed"" after you've felt that way about yourself throughout childhood/adolescence, but all in all I wouldn’t erase my scars even if I could. I’m proud of them, and I’m grateful that I had the experience, because it made me a hell of a lot stronger and taught me the importance of being kind and nonjudgmental. Not only that, but it serves as a constant reminder that things could be much worse. Not everyone with scoliosis can afford proper care and have a smooth recovery. My surgery was a success and made a dramatic difference in how I look and feel, although sometimes I dwell too much on the fact that my back doesn't look 100% normal. I have a lot to be thankful for, and I owe my ability to appreciate what's good in life partly to this experience.



Here are some more pictures of my back. Sorry for the poor quality – I just quickly snapped them on my webcam this afternoon.

So, there's my story. I could talk about it for days, but I tried not to go off on too many tangents. If you have any questions about scoliosis, braces, spinal fusions, or anything else, I'm here to answer! (:

jexwh,6,2011-08-10,Just had to have the master and slave clutch cylinders in my car replaced unexpectedly...,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/jexwh/just_had_to_have_the_master_and_slave_clutch/,"which pretty much completely wiped out the last bit of money to my name.  I'm in school, and on financial aid, but it will not be disbursed for another month or so (not until the second week of fall semester classes).  

I'm also involved in a professional/career development organization at my school, and was wondering two things:

1) if anyone is in a position to lend me a small amount of money to help me get through this month, I would be incredibly grateful and would be more than willing to return the favor as soon as I possibly could, or

2) if anyone would like to have their resume critiqued for a small fee (just whatever you feel would be fair).

I'm currently taking classes, and also completing an unpaid internship about 20 miles away from my campus, so I really had no choice but to have my car repaired.  I would greatly appreciate any assistance any fellow redditors may be able to provide, and if you're not in a position to help financially, even just some encouraging words would be appreciated! :)

EDIT:  I just looked into the possibility of doing a payday loan/advance, which I was reluctant to do, and learned that I would not qualify with my school financial aid anyway.  Anyone happen to have any suggestions for how to get maybe $150 or so to get me through the next month?  Besides my car and computer (which I need for both school and my internship), I also have a small TV and DVD player, has anyone had any luck pawning items like this?"
jertr,11,2011-08-10,Just wanted to tell my story,femident,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/jertr/just_wanted_to_tell_my_story/,"I've only posted here once and I've been really wanting to just introduce myself and give some background info.  27/F

Since I was younger I've always felt like there was something wrong with me.  I even asked my mom if I could talk to a therapist or doctor or someone when I was about 10 but she shewed those thoughts away saying I just wanted attention and there's nothing wrong with me.  I also was sexually abused when I was 6 multiple times by my male 16 year old baby sitter, and I didn't tell anyone until I was 19 or so.  Also also, my dad is an alcoholic.

When I was sophomore in college I had a really bad semester.  My parents announced they were getting divorced after 22 years of marriage because my dad was seeing another woman and he was moving in with her.  Also, our golden retriever who I had grown up with died very suddenly of a heart attack or stroke or something like that, he was 10.  Also, I was dating a guy who was an asshole and had a criminal record and he was about to go back to jail for assaulting some guy, idk.  I was also doing my first semester in engineering school and my classes were overwhelmingly hard.  To top it all off I did not get along well with my room mate and she would tell all our friends that I was crazy and things like that.  

I ended up having my first serious mental breakdown.  I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, but then would take long naps during the day.  I would spend days on end just crying and crying and not being able to function.  There were days where all I could get myself to do was write in my journal, or scribble drawings.  I don't really know why no one (like my parents) tried to help me during this time.  

I ended up going down to our schools health services building and I was crying and in really rough shape.  They had me fill out some forms and i talked to some lady for about 45 minutes and I left with prescriptions for Lexapro,  Wellbutrin, and Lorazapam.  I was told to start taking them right away so that they'd be in my system by finals time, which was about 2 weeks away.  I got through finals and then had a month off for winter break where I had constant bouts of severe depression followed by bouts of mania for the entire month.  When I went back to school it didn't really change and I'm not really sure how I got through the second semester, it was not pretty.  I don't remember most of it.  I stopped taking all the drugs when I was home for the summer and said I'd never take them again because they made me feel crazy.

About 3 years later I was back in the schools heath services, in my last semester.  I was working full time at an engineering type internship, while doing my last semester at school.  I was having to drive back and forth multiple times every day, I was having a hard time keeping up with it all.  My boyfriend at the time convinced me to go seek help.  I went in again and was given Paxil.  The woman convinced me that it was a drug that would calm me down and help me cope with all the stress.  I started taking it and again, I started getting really manic and really depressed.  It was so hard to make it through the day in front of other people, professionals, and not freak out.  Sometimes I'd get out of work, get in my car, shut the doors and make sure no one was nearby.  Then I would scream at the top of my lungs until I just couldn't anymore.  Then sometimes I'd put on my radio and scream and yell and sing and try to get all the energy out on my way home.  Other times I wouldn't be able to stop crying and someone would have to come pick me up.

I told this lady about what had been happening after a month or so, when I saw her next.  She agreed that I should stop taking the medicine but since the semester was ending, my insurance with them was over so I went to my general practitioner and they put me on Effexor.  I later found out that Paxil makes you gain weight, and Effexor is extremely hard to come off of.  I had gained about 30lbs during that year, and then right after I graduated, bought a car, and finished my internship my boyfriend of 3 years dumped me.  He was very cold about it too and it left me devastated. 

I went to a new therapist and he took me off Effexor and then eventually convinced me to try Prozac.  I took Prozac for almost a year but he had to keep upping my dose because it would stop working after a while.  I still had the ups and downs but not quite as much as when I was on the other meds.  Eventually I stopped going to him and stopped the meds.

So, it had been about 3 years and I was convinced to give it another try.  I found a therapist that I really like and she diagnosed me bipolar.  For the past 10 years or so I've been told I was depressed and that I have an anxiety problem and that's it but I always felt that wasn't just it.  There was something else going on here.  Thinking that I'm bipolar, suddenly all these things that i've done over the years and things that have happened to me make so much sense.  I'm not saying it absolves me of anything, but it does help me understand myself more.  It's been about 3 months now and I read this subreddit a lot and it's given me great advice and comfort.

I started Lamictal about a month ago and I was taking just 25mg a day, before bed.  Now I'm taking one before bed and one in the morning and in about 3 weeks I think he's gonna double it.  I think I'm feeling better, it's hard to tell.  This is something very new to me.  I guess we'll see how it goes.

Sorry for the wall of text, just felt like I wanted to contribute something."

1) East Capitol &amp; 16th St. SE

2) Wisconsin Ave. and Calvert St. (Glover Park)

All other circumstances aside, if it were based on location alone, which of these two would be the better option? Obviously #1 is way closer, but I've heard Glover Park area is very nice. Also, I'm not sure if the distance would matter if I am just taking the metro.

Thank you fellow DC Interns! I appreciate your help!

I posted here last week about transitioning from web application development to the networking world and got some great feedback/advice.

I am now 1/3 of the way through CBT-Nuggets CCENT videos and I now that I know that I am genuinely interested in this field and definitely want to pursue it I was wondering if you guys could help me get my salary expectations in check.

One of the important (although not most important) factors in my career change is earning potential as I have student loans as far as the eye can see, I am planning on getting engaged, and would like to save for a down payment on a home meanwhile.  As a contracting web app. engineer I am currently making about 80k/year after taxes which is know is well over entry level for CCENT.

I am hoping I can leverage my web app. development and BS in Computer Science along with my CCENT and shortly after CCNA certs to land something in the 60k-70k range.  Is this a feasible expectation for my area?  I would not like to start off in help desk.  I know that it would lead to experience earlier  but I feel like my development skills would be stagnant if I took that route and the earning potential there isn't great.  

If you can answer, what is the salary jump from CCENT/CCNA?  Would it be worth not looking for a position until I have CCNA or can I look for a position and let the potential employer know that I am in the process of getting my CCNA?  I have no experience in the network field but i have about 2.5 years ( + 2 summer internships) as a professional developer.

Also, as an aside, can you recommend any languages I should learn for the networking world.  I am currently versed in LAMP enivornments and especially PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery.  Intermediate with VB.NET.  I was thinking Perl and Python are used in the networking world more often?

Thanks for taking the time to read and perhaps respond,

jfdjm,0,2011-08-11,"Let's Take the Flaming of Destructoid Down a Notch, Mmmkay?",Slust,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/jfdjm/lets_take_the_flaming_of_destructoid_down_a_notch/,"(Yes, there is a TL;DR at the bottom)

So I've been a fairly regular reader of Destructoid for nigh on 4 years now?  Maybe more, either way, it's been a while.  That said, I'm a little disappointed at how quick on the draw it seems like many people have been due to djWHEAT's recent ""saber-rattling"", if you wanted to call it that.

If you've been a regular-ish reader of /r/starcraft for like 2 months, you probably remember the ire that was drawn when an employee of Kotaku (an intern, I believe) wrote an article and portrayed eSports in a negative light that more or less was on an ego and personal distaste stint.  I think the criticism was fairly valid, if you're going to blog an opinion and you're an employee, you're representing the company who signs your checks.  And when your audience are people whom this subject matter might be relevant to their interests, when you print something controversial, you always run the risk of upsetting them.

As recently as 3 days ago, there was another situation that cropped up when Lord General Wheat expressed his lament over a particular article published over on Destructoid.  This was also another an article published that portrayed eSports in a negative light that was also more or less based upon a personal taste.

Destructoid has received some flak, albeit not as much as Kotaku, over this article.  I understand the feelings people have when it comes to this topic and I can understand why people are as passionate as they are.  I'm actually glad to see people care about this so much!  But I don't feel the vitriol towards Destructoid is valid.

Some have called out Destructoid for being wrong through ignorance, but what really irks me is that some of these people are ignorant of the situation itself.  It's like Obsidian making fun of Pot for calling Kettle black.

I'd even say that Destructoid has been helping rally for eSports.  One Mr. Jordan Devore [published an article to the site's feed on July 31st](http://www.destructoid.com/watch-mlg-anaheim-streamed-live-all-weekend-long-207461.phtml) that announced MLG Anaheim's stream for all readers to become aware of.  Not only did he plug Anaheim, he also plugged the GSL and EVO at the same time.  And for the cherry on top, he bumped the post on Sunday for the finals to draw even more attention to MLG Anaheim while also expressing how intense the StarCraft 2, specifically, has been.  And even had codes to give away to three viewers for the HQ stream.

Jordan Devore is an employee for Destructoid.  He's covering gaming, promoting eSports and is a pretty kick ass guy to boot.

Riding the awesomeness that was MLG Anaheim, the GSL finals and EVO, Destructoid made another attempt to draw attention *to eSports* by asking its community to share their thoughts.  Naturally, as we all know, opinions are like assholes and everyone's got one.  [A thematic event called ""Bloggers Wanted"" was posted on August 1st](http://www.destructoid.com/bloggers-wanted-esports-207607.phtml) that was asking for the community to make posts on what they thought about eSports.

The [article that ignited the torches as we marched towards Destructoid with pitchforks](http://www.destructoid.com/esports-really--208179.phtml) was written by one ""Elsa.""  The important distinction to make here is that Elsa is not a writer for or employee of Destructoid.  She is actually a community member who answered the ""Bloggers Wanted: eSports"" call and wrote the infamous article.

She in no way represents Destructoid in any capacity other than a community member who wrote an article in the provided Community ""C"" Blogs that was published to the front page for being an article about eSports.  Destructoid publishing this does not represent Destructoid's opinion or ""side"" on the topic of eSports, all they did was ask for the community to write about what they thought, then begin publishing articles from both sides of the ""argument"", if you wanted to view it as such.

They've also front-page'd articles about [how EVO is awesome](http://www.destructoid.com/esports-someone-you-know-is-hype-207815.phtml), [talked about how EVO is growing and promoting eSports as a spectator sport](http://www.destructoid.com/esports-an-evolution-in-entertainment-207817.phtml) and even if not published to the front page, the community is still writing about their thoughts.  [Someone even made a, more or less, direct response to Elsa's article](http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/WrexShepard/esports-yes-really--208394.phtml#comments) and she even commented on it.  (If you don't care to read it, I'll summarize it for you - she actually is quite nice and rational about it.)

As was just posted here on /r/starcraft, Michael ""Zechs"" Radford [made a post](http://esfiworld.com/feature/zechs-files-ignore-it-and-it-will-go-away) that highlighted the ""Elsa Incident"" then asked everyone to ignore shit like that.

The problem I see is that continually, Destructoid itself is catching flak for this incident, despite actually having been promoting and working towards the *good* for eSports.  Wrong target, people, stand down!

---------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR - Destructoid has actually been helping eSports, promoted MLG Anaheim, GSL and EVO, called for the community to write articles on what they thought about eSports after the big tournament weekend in a regular event called ""Bloggers Wanted"", published Elsa's anti-eSports article and has been wrongfully taking the ire of other communities such as this one.  Some people have friendlies in their sights and should take the finger off the trigger.**

jf8jx,3,2011-08-10,"Want to encourage boyfriend to workout with me, do I let him know, or should i back off? ",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jf8jx/want_to_encourage_boyfriend_to_workout_with_me_do/,"Hey 2X 
Let me break it down for you, before my boyfriend and I met we were both very overweight, and unhappy. we moved away from home and started living on our own (for school) and we both lost a substantial amount of weight. He used to weigh nearly 350lbs and now weighs 275 He did it all on his own, and he is just a big guy, german roots and is around 6ft. I used to be about 230 and I'm now at 200, its not a lot, but I am so proud of both of us for doing it on our own. When we met we were both in the process of losing weight and we would always talk about our workout routines and our new healthy ways of eating. 
After we started officially dating he started taking me out to eat, we are both foodies at heart and just started going out and trying new places. He had finally gotten a car so we stopped walking/biking places like we had before and our lifestyle is steadily becoming more sedatary. I've noticed that we both spend like all of our checks on going out to eat and treating eachother to mostly unhealthy snacks and you know, all that stuff. We're just so happy together that we've kind of forgotten about our weightloss goals.

 I know my own problem is that, i cant bear to spend an hour everyday away from him, we both work full time so I am dying to see him by the time I get out of work. His job is alot more work intensive than mine though, he is a gardener and spends all day doing work intensive labor, he also has weekly band practice, and also is starting a two day a week internship. He is a very busy guy, so when he sees me i doubt he wants to spend it working out with me. 

Redditors, Is it wrong to ask him to continue his weightloss journey with me and start working out with me. Or should I back off and just start doing it myself? Does it also seem like I am blaming him? I feel like i might be, i guess i just need some advice for motivating us both into healthier lifestyle that we can share together?

jgn14,3,2011-08-12,How to help gf who left abusive bf for me relax?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jgn14/how_to_help_gf_who_left_abusive_bf_for_me_relax/,"We're both 23, I'm a guy, she's the she.  I'm in the military overseas and she's here for 6 months for a college internship.

The first 3 months have passed and through it we did so much traveling and exploring of Europe we kind of fell for each other.  We cuddle and sleep together every night, make out, etc.

The thing is we both have some issues.  Her last relationship ended horribly with a controlling, abusive guy.  Ive had my run of bad girls as well, but tend to not let that bother me.  The problem is I'm a huge doubter, and I overthink everything.

I feel like I ruin moments because I want confirmation that this is going to work out, but you can't just ask for that.  It's also hard because I'll go to caress her cheek or something and she'll flinch involuntarily, or things will be getting hot and heavy and she'll abruptly stop due to bad memories.  

It's frustrating and breaks my heart because, even though she reassures me it's nothing I'm doing, it's hard knowing I've made her feel that way. 

So my question is how do you just relax and have fun, knowing the girl you are interested in is going back to the states in 3 months? Any guys date a girl that had a prior abusive relationship, how did you help her overcome those dark days? The time limit has me feeling rushed, when I like to take things slow, and I know that's the best route with her.

Thanks for reading my ramble!"

we have been constantky talking ever since. 

I will try to make this as short as I can and fill in details when you guys ask. 

He's from Texas, lived with him mom because he was in need of assistance because he was overdosing a lot on pain meds, alcohol. 

In any event. He went a little nuts, and ended up in a psych ward. 

I tried to keep in touch with him. He said he couldn't go back home because of what had happened, his mother had kicked him out, needed a place to stay, he was going to move to vegas. 

I said why not come live with me? You can stay, rent free, maybe get an internship here and get back on your two feet. 

We planned this for two weeks until finally he said he got a bus ticket to here. 

The problems didn't began until he came off the bus. The first thing he wanted was alcohol. 

Now I know many people like him, who want alcohol after a long trip, especially after a long trip... so maybe I'm over thinking. 

Came home, dropped stuff off today, then went to liquor store. The first problem wasn't that he picked up 4 liters of vodka, but that he wanted to buy so much, his card got declined. 

Okay ... maybe I'm just over thinking things. The guy just came from Texas... he just wants to take a load off. 

I did confront him about it, he said he wanted to buy it in large quantities because he was going to finish it slowly. 

Fair enough. 

Through the day, he drank, and I began to see something I have never seen in friends; he became immobile, his moter functions were far ... far ... gone... I got scared. I didn't see how much he had poured, but he encouraged me to yell ""chug"" and I told him I wasn't going to encourage him to drink. 

He drank anyways. 

I had a talk with him, told him he was drinking way too much, smoking, booze, smoke, booze ... what was his actual purpose to come here? He said it had been his first day and he just needed to unwind... 

Fair enough. I was being too harsh. 

Now it was 8, he was completely gone, he tried to help me preform tasks like taking out the trash, but he couldn't even get his shoes on. I told him he should know his limit ... he should know when he is so out of it, that he can't help me or himself.  

Eventually he said he wanted to watch slayer, I put it on, and he laid down. He had been trying to calm himself down with alcohol all this time and I thought he had drank enough until he laid down. 

Then not 3 minutes later he said to call 911 because he thought he may kill himself, because he wont be able to go to sleep. 

He said the hospital had better drugs and to just call the police to they handcuff him and take him to a psych ward. I agreed and called 911. 

They came and took him away. He drank more than 1 liter of vodka. 

Now I'm here going ... should I let him back into the house ... it's ONLY BEEN ONE DAY ... Or should I tell him to take his stuff, and hit the road. 

I was thinking, I had some money saved up, I could spend it to buy him a plane ticket back... 

help me out you guys... what do I do? 

p.s. I didn't drink any. I have been on depression medication for a year and I ...am scared of drinking. It makes me feel really ... bad. 

**Update:** He showed up at my door this morning. He made a pledge that he would just stop drinking. Ha, yea right, after consuming so much? 

I told him he needs professional help. I can't help him, gave him $200 for a bus ticket. 

Told him to take a bus to Greyhound.

An hour later, I get a txt from him saying he called 911 at the greyhound bus station on himself to go to a hospital. 

No idea what's happening ... I just sent him one last message telling him to stay safe and not to return. I don't have a credit card, or else I would have paid using that but I just took money out of the ATM ... now I'm out $200 and have no idea if it was used properly. 

I'm sorta mad, sorta sad. I learned my lesson and it cost me $200. "

----

The strangest encounter I've had with a 'celebrity' was on a trip with my high school's ""Political Science Club"" (which I formed) to Washington, D.C. We had talked about a trip to DC throughout the year, but it was always us saying ""Who wants to go to DC?"" half-jokingly. So, we started fundraising to go and we soon realized we'd have enough money to go, so we booked a party bus for April 30, 2010. Now, earlier that year we had met graduate of our school who was working relatively high up in the White House, so we decided what the heck, let's see if we can contact them and get a tour of the White House. We called three weeks before the trip and didn't hear back until the night before the trip. They needed all our Social Security numbers, but we couldn't get in contact with all the members of the club so we just told them ""looks like we can't do it.""

So, we left our school at 4:30AM and began our trip to Washington, D.C. About two hours into the trip, we got a call from a secretary of the person we knew asking if we had the SS numbers, which we did. We gave them to her and she said she'd see if we'd be able to get in. A half-hour out of D.C. we get a call saying we're getting a tour of the White House. We were all happy. I remember someone in our group saying ""What if we see Obama,"" to which another member replied ""We have a better chance of seeing John Kennedy.""

Before the White House tour, we went to the Newseum (had already bought the tickets). It's a pretty cool place, but we were only there for about 15 minutes. It turns out Oprah was doing a live taping and had a correspondent (Someone King?) in the Newseum for her No Phone Zone thing. There was a huge crowd, and for a brief period we all thought Oprah was there. She wasn't, and the crowd that had gathered really started getting in the way, especially since we were trying to get in and out. 

We got dropped off in front of the entrance to the White House where we met a White House intern that had been sent for us. She took us to the front of the line, which was pretty awesome. She also served as our tour guide, because strangely enough the White House tour is normally self guided. Before we went into the White House, the secretary told me and my friend ""I don't think I'm supposed to tell you this, but you're in for a surprise. Marine One is taking off at noon and we're going to put you on the South Lawn to watch it."" 

Wow. We didn't even know what to think. In fact, we were so out of it we actually asked the nice lady ""will the President be getting on it,"" to which she replied ""Yeah, it's his helicopter."" So we didn't listen to a word of the tour because we were anticipating watching the President take off in the helicopter. We met with the person who made this all possible, and they took us back to where we had began - in front of a door that leads to the South Lawn. We were briefed by Secret Service and the director of the White House tours as to what to expect and what to do in the event of an emergency. I remember the Secret Service telling us ""If there's gunfire, do not run. Duck and walk back here. This is your safe zone. Do. Not. Run."" That was probably one of the most terrifying things I've ever heard.

We were let [out onto the South Lawn](http://i.imgur.com/QgpIQ.jpg) 5 minutes before any other tourists because of our connection, and gathered in front of a rope line. I was surprised by the lack of security; all that separated us from where the president was walking was a thin rope. I'm aware if any of us crossed that rope at any time, we'd either be shot or tackled immediately, but it was surprising nonetheless. It felt so strange being so close to the [back of the White House](http://i.imgur.com/odGDC.jpg). 

Across from us was [the press pool](http://i.imgur.com/2nrDv.jpg). It seemed like an endless line of cameras. I was surprised by the amount of press there to film him walking from the White House to the helicopter, but I realized if anything had happened, they'd all want the footage of it. 

After what had seemed like an eternity, the [helicopter appeared](http://imgur.com/vOshE.jpg) out of no where. Then we waited for another lifetime, when suddenly the President [emerged from the back door](http://imgur.com/6EEnJ). As he was walking, I shouted ""President Obama"" as if he would hear me shouting and walk over. Then, as he was walking out, he [saw the staffer](http://i.imgur.com/4Oprb.jpg) who got us there, recognized them, pointed at them, and walked over to ask why they were out here. The staffer explained the situation, so President Obama walked the rope shaking our hands. **RIGHT BEFORE HE GOT TO ME, HE WAVED AND WALKED AWAY.** I said ""No, Mr. President,"" as if he would turn around and come back. 

Well, he did. And he shook my hand (proven by [this glorious photo](http://i.imgur.com/a3ziF.jpg) of him turning back)

That was the strangest encounter, only because of the odds it would happen. Here's a [video I took of it all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE), and here's [a photo of me taking the video](http://i.imgur.com/cMrCm.jpg) and him shaking my friends hand. 

TL;DR I met the President on the South Lawn of the White House. [Here's the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE). "

I've been doing some research on my own and already feel I've been learning leaps and bounds above what I was taught in college. Although I really liked my college and professors, it seems like they just did a pisspoor job of really preparing me for professional work. I was actually the first and only student to graduate from their Graphic Design program, so obviously I didn't make the greatest choices in schools.

I know I can't blame this all on them, and I should have been more involved and motivated to learn on my own while in college, I should have been more active in pursuing internships in the past, but that's too bad now and I'm looking to change.

All of this has left me very insecure and unsure of myself though. I can't help but question why anyone would actually WANT to hire me. My work is uninspiring, unoriginal, and very bland. I don't have a lot of pride in my portfolio. I'm questioning why I even spent the last couple years pursuing an art degree, because I think I lack creativity. The only thing I AM confident in is my ability to learn and execute ideas. If I know what the end product needs to look like I can make it happen - but starting with a blank canvas and delving into the unknown really overwhelms me.

This has left me scared to pursue freelance opportunities. And, I haven't had much luck with applying for internships/jobs. I'm terrified I won't be able to live up to other's expectations. I want to create things that will be above and beyond what my employers are looking for, I want to exceed expectations!

I guess I'm just looking for some advice to become more confidant, or maybe some stories from people that have gone through similar feelings. I know I need to practicepracticepractice more, and continue learning!"

I am still in college, and I would like to pay down the interest on my student loans so it stops accruing.  I have neglected to pay for the first  years of college because I didn't have a job so money was tighter than tight.  Now, I have a very well paid internship during the school year which will allow me to pay down my interest and possibly some of the principal amount.

One problem: I don't know my loan account numbers, or where to find them.  I have 2 checking accounts, one with a local bank as well as an account at Wells Fargo.  My parents get the statements sent to their house and do not keep them.  I'm not sure when the next statement will arrive and I would like to begin payments immediately.  I've done some searching for my account numbers but all I can find is balances with no account numbers available.

ji7wi,4,2011-08-14,21M: My GF of 5 years has stomped my life I don't know what to do.,ConfusedNALoan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ji7wi/21m_my_gf_of_5_years_has_stomped_my_life_i_dont/,"I am 21 and she is 21 currently. This girl and I have dated since we were 16. We had some issues when it came to getting ready to go off to college, but we worked through them. Like all relationships we have had our rough spots, and I have been able to deal with them for the most part by myself. This time I have no idea what to do and have no clue where to start.

I am in an engineering major at a smaller engineering tech school. This being said I have had the opportunity to have an internship all three summers I have been in college. Now this has led to me being away from my girlfriend for the past three summers, but i have tried really hard to communicate with her through the time apart. That being said for the last 6 mo or so she and I had been seriously talking about marriage and about a month ago she had said that she had gone looking at wedding dresses. I took this as she would be ready for a proposal. To coincide with this I was offered a full time position with the company I was interning for given I finish my degree in may. I told her this and I thought that she would be excited for me as well as us. After this given the prospect of ample future income I went out and bought an engagement ring and was planning to propose. I was offered the job with 1.5 weeks left in my internship. After telling her about the offer she started acting funny and got sick. She wasn't as happy on the phone among other things. I just took it as she was having a bad go and that her being sick was affecting her energy level. 

When I got back from my internship I finally got to go see her and she was acting distant and strange. I just assumed it would take some time to get used to me again after 3 months of being apart. But by the end of the day I couldn't take it anymore and asked her what was the matter. After many ""I'm Fine""s and ""Nothing""s she said that she didnt want to go with me to the job. I said I could find another job somewhere else  but she said ""No, I don't want to go with YOU"". She also stated that, "" She wasn't Unhappy but she wasn't happy either."" Well this kind of set me off and I stormed off and drove back home. Given the situation I pushed up my plans to fly home to see my parents and am now there with them. I call her on the phone. Sometimes she answers sometimes she doesn't, but whenever she does she seems distant and aloof. It never got clarified whether we broke up or what-have-you but she took her relationship status off of facebook and hid all of her pictures. I need some advice. Do I wait around to see if she figures out what she wants, or do I just let her go and face the pain that I know will come. 

In talking to her since the large fight we talked about what about me bothered her. This boiled down to her not thinking that I was very important to her. I can see how she feels this way, but it is not true. Everything I do in my life I do for her or to make a better future for she and I. Also, I have stressed to her that I am willing to do or change whatever is needed to uplift her and help her to be happy.

TL;DR I love this girl with all my being and I want to be with her, but if that means that she is unhappy then I would rather die."

We have a very, very good relationship but we are in a very long distance situation. I have spent the summer with him, and we are much closer than we were ever before. My problem is that I am returning home for my last two semesters of university while he is still far away doing an internship, and he is upset that there is a frat house across the street from my house. Apparently this means that drunk guys are going to be in my house and offering sex 24/7, which is bullshit. I think it is really unfair for him to be so upset and jealous about this situation that I have no control over, and I am very frustrated that he doesn't see that I have zero interest in these stupid boys. It is damaging our relationship that he is self-inflicting jealousy and frustration on himself.

2x, is there *anything* I can do to help alleviate the jealousy issues? Either while I am with him for two more weeks or once we are separated again? It hurts me that he is frustrating himself and that I feel attacked over something I can not control. A little advice would go a lonnnng ways!! Thanks!"

I was friendly with this girl, let's call her Jill.  Jill and I were friends in that I would be the one to do the texting just to see what's up or if I was bored.  When we'd talk whether it was meeting for lunch or texting because I started a conversation, she'd tell me about her Bio tests and labs, etc...  I ask her how they went because that's what friends do.  When I told her I had a big internship interview or big project, never received texts to ask how it went.

She went to my fraternity's formal with me and we had a great time. At least I did and it seemed like she did.  When we would get lunch it'd be like every other week, every third week and only because I texted her about it.  But when we did talk, texting or in person, she'd show interest and ask me questions.  But she never texted me to see whats up or ask about me.  She did, however, find out I liked her as more than a friend, probably based on how I acted, although I didn't feel like I acted differently.  She went to one of her friends (who I introduced her to) and drunkenly started talking about it, but he stopped her and told her to talk to me about it.

Turns out she talked about be again, but this time because she ""felt weird"" taking off her shirt in front of me during a game of Kings (not the five people that were there she DIDN'T know, she just mentioned me).  I was fed up with her shit so i tried calling her.  No answer.  Texted her that I wanted to talk to her.  No answer.  Next morning I get a 5-text text message.  This is what it said:

""Ok a couple of things 1. I hate confrontation. I will avoid it. 2. I hate talking on the phone. 3. ""i want to talk to you"" is one of the scariest phrases ever to a lot of people. I'm sorry I didn't get back to you Sunday, I thought you'd get the hint. I really REALLY don't mean to be a bitch and I just wanna be friends. Like at the party, I wanted to socialize with everybody and everytime I turned around you were there. I wish you would'ven't call, I hate phones haha. I'm sorry about this, I'm just trying to straighten it out but also be firm I guess? Fucking hate confrontation. Sorry. :(""

My response: ""First, I'm sorry for the confrontation, I had no idea.  Yes, staying friends is fine, thats what I thought was going on.  It's just that I feel under-appreciated.  I try to show interest in what you're doing.  Asking you about your tests, labs, etc...  I don't feel that I receive any of that back.  I'm not saying we need to talk all the time.  But maybe every so often it'd be nice to be asked how its going.  Or if I tell you I have an interview or a huge project, it'd be nice to be asked how it went.  Whenever we hang out in groups, yes, I acknowledge I might try to talk to you a little much.  So I'm sorry for that.  That party was a bust, for one.  Whenever we hang out in groups though, I feel invisible to you, which might make me try a little harder.  Please don't take this as me wanting attention from you.  I enjoy hanging out with you and talking to you.  I'm just not getting the feeling you feel the same way.  Please don't hate me for knowing this is, I felt humiliated and embarrassed when I found out that I was talked about behind my back.  A few weeks before formal and last Saturday.  I'm sorry if that rule in kings made you feel uncomfortable, you did not have to do anything.  That rule is always made in our games, it had nothing to do with you.  If you recall, I defended you towards the end by saying I never heard you curse.  Bill and Ted kept calling you out while I said nothing the whole time.   The other thing is, the baseball tix.  I didn't offer to help pay for yours b/c of charity or w/e.  And I didn't offer to pay the whole thing. That's what friends do.  $5 here or there for a friend is no big deal.""

In conclusion: I sent that text so she knew how I felt.  Never heard back and we haven't spoken since this exchange last monday and haven't seen each other since the saturday before that.  The advice I've been given is to forget about her and move on.  The only problem is: I miss being able to talk to her.  Just because the option is always there.  I've never lost a friend this way.  Sure I've faded out with a few.  But this friend loss was so abrupt and, for lack of better word, controversial, it hits me hard.  I don't know what to make of the situation or what to do about her or how I'm feeling.  I guess this is a HUGE way of asking if all college girls are this immature.  Thank you VERY much for reading all of this, I really appreciate you taking time to read and respond to this.


EDIT:
tl;dr I told my friend how I felt about her, and was ignored.  I didn't think we were actually friends because she never texted me, only I texted her and I asked about her, never got asked about me.  Read above to see the texting transcript consisting of two texts."
jj3td,2,2011-08-15,"""A hit of common sense"" -- I wrote this on 4/20/2011 and totally forgot about it until tonight, enjoy reddit.",DomoKunMD,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/jj3td/a_hit_of_common_sense_i_wrote_this_on_4202011_and/,"Among all the economic, political, and social issues that plaster the front pages of news sites these days, the legalization of marijuana stands amongst the most divisive. Hordes of people have been rallying for and against the legalization of this plant, and on the eve of 420, I make my stand.
 
One of the strongest (and most pragmatic) arguments for legalization asserts that Americans spend way too much tax money on fighting marijuana “abuse”. This is absolutely true—most drug arrests in the United States involve marijuana users. These are everyday people that are shackled by local police and forced to spend an x number of months at a state prison. These individuals are stamped as “criminals” in the eyes of society—I will however concede that many states are moving forward towards decriminalization but the present fact remains: those convicted for the use/possession of marijuana are labeled as criminals.
 
‘Criminals’…that word carries more weight than most people realize. Consider this: if marijuana users are truly criminals, I urge you to step onto a college campus and look around for a bit; you’ll be surrounded by these so-called criminals…there’s the English major working on her novel…the political science major that interns for the local governor…the chemistry major applying to graduate school…are these people really criminals? The obvious answer is no, but on paper, this is exactly what these people would be labeled as if caught.  
 
As far as spending tax money goes…I don’t think most people would be happy with their tax money being spent so that law enforcement can chase potheads down--granted they’ll probably be so stoned that there wouldn’t really be much running involved. In any case, I dare to assume that most tax payers would want their law enforcement’s time to be allocated towards more pressing issues, I know I would.
 
Another major argument against the legalization of marijuana involves its impact on health. I can’t believe I even have to waste time on this one, but fuck it. Even as a proponent of legalization, I must admit: if you inhale anything besides oxygen and nitrogen…it’s not going to be good for you. That being said…we (college students) consume a whole bunch of shit that human beings should not do so under any circumstances: Beer, other alcohol, McDonald’s, Yella’s Grill… and Rowan [University] Dining in general. However, each of those has its own level of toxicity, and as responsible adults (lol ya right) we need to gauge what amount is “right” for us. Don’t get me wrong—I’ve spent many Thursday nights myself curled over a toilet seat hurling my mistakes away…I’ve also had my own share of triglycerides, but as the old saying goes: moderation is key. This goes for most things, alcohol is one, and marijuana is the other.  Most responsible marijuana users do not have respiratory pathologies in their futures…most cigarette users DO however. You startin’ to see my point? Below, I’ve linked the relative toxicities of some common drugs including marijuana, alcohol and tobacco (yes…alcohol and the shit in tobacco are actually drugs).
 
http://www.macdoctor.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/380px-Rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_mean_physical_harm_and_mean_dependence.svg_.png
 
For those of you dumbasses that can’t interpret graphs: Marijuana has significantly lower dependency AND toxicity on human beings than alcohol and tobacco.
 
My final argument for the legalization of marijuana is more of a social / personal one. In its essence…marijuana illegalization is a crime itself against personal freedom. Let me simplify this for you, if I am engaging in an activity that is not harming myself, or those around me…then what the fuck is your problem bro? Don’t get me wrong, those individuals with schizophrenic / psychotic tendencies will have adverse effects while on marijuana…but that would be true for any psychoactive substance. To illegalize a substance because it harms a small, nominal population is laudable—those individuals should not be on ANY psychoactive substance, including alcohol.
 
That being said…my own experience with marijuana has nothing but positive. Many argue that marijuana use impairs judgment so much so, that users may become violent and dangerous.
 
-___-
 
Bitch please.
 
If you’ve ever spent time with a pothead, you’ll notice that they’re some of the most docile and passive people around. For fucks sake, Bambi would do more harm to you than a stoner would. I have yet to see people rage and fight on marijuana, most of us just giggle, roll around on the floor and microwave about a pound of hotpockets. In all seriousness though, I have no violent tendencies while high; rather to the contrary, I find myself speculating more spiritual thoughts. Colors seem to sing, music is palpable, and human life seems more magical than science fiction can ever depict it to be. And THAT is why so many of us continue to consume these dimebags of personal freedom.
 
Happy 420 Everyone.

That was the beginning. The president's address, letting us all know about some bullshit switch-throwing party where the who's-who of world government could mingle and joke about how they were changing the world. In reality, the network had been active for months. It just wasn't open to the public. And the real people responsible for bringing the network online were thousands of miles away in the central control hub in Nevada. At that point, I was just an intern. Fresh out of college. Idealistic. Optimistic. 

The WWN basically worked like this: almost all computers manufactured after about 2015 had a government-mandated chip in them. The chip was able to access a network of satellites. These satellites made wireless internet available on about 98% of the earth's surface. The chips let the computers access the internet, and let the government access the location, and some other data, off of each and every chip. But I’ll get to that later. 

Launching the satellites had been a covert joint initiative beginning in the early 2000's. The framework of the network was built on the same technology that enabled cell phones and other wireless internet devices. At first, the telecoms wanted to make it proprietary and charge consumers through the nose for it. However, after the Grand Unification in 2013 when the United Federation of Countries was founded, almost all the telecom monopolies were broken up and nationalized. It was a truly great time to be a citizen of the earth. Or so they’d have us believe. 

I was just a kid during the unification, so I didn’t really have any idea what was going on. I was more concerned with the typical worries of a middle school boy: video games, being cool, and girls. Each day, my civics teacher, Mr. Danowitz, would try to teach us exactly what was going on. Of course, everyone was only half listening. After all, the Unification wasn’t going to affect us in the slightest. Or so we thought. So we didn’t notice, or maybe we didn’t care when we suddenly had a new president, when where we lived suddenly had a new name, and when all the schoolteachers suddenly had to get recertified to teach.

Looking back now, I’m almost frustrated at how little I cared. Here was this huge event that would alter the course of history occurring right in front of my eyes, and all I cared about was who I was hanging out with after school and what girl I currently had a crush on. My indifference to the world political climate didn’t change much once I started high school, except that my youthful ignorance was replaced with a powerful drive to devote myself to my studies almost to the exclusion of all else.

Only when I started college did I start becoming aware of the world around me. Since the unification, society itself had begun shifting paradigms away from a culture of willful ignorance and more towards a society of awareness. Awareness of world events, of politics, and of science. It was a great time to be in college. Especially because the first places to gain access to the experimental system that would become the Worldwide Wireless Network were colleges like the one I was attending. As soon as my school was online, I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated.

I suppose I was in the right place at the right time. Maybe I just kissed enough of the right asses. Anyhow, I managed to land an internship at the government run WWN central hub in Nevada. It didn’t pay. It was degrading. But I was a part of history. Some of the heavy equipment I lifted ended up doing some very important things. And some of the coffee that I fetched ended up in some very important mouths. And 3 months after I started my internship, the Worldwide Wireless Network was live.

**Just to let everyone know:** i'm aware there are sentence fragments, and not everything is grammatically correct. I don't always write perfect. I'm just wondering if it grabs the reader's attention and if it's worth continuing. I'll accept any constructive criticism graciously!

jiveb,3,2011-08-14,Dating and sex issues... need help.,fashionista12,ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/jiveb/dating_and_sex_issues_need_help/,"21F here.

I've been single for about 5 months now. At the time the ex and I broke up (together 7 months-- not my longest relationship), I was ready to take my walls down and let him in and love him. It took me a month or so to get over him. After him, I started been having sex with this guy I met in my class, ""Greg."" Then it was time to leave for my 3 month internship in another state 10 hours away.

I seemed to be going through this phase where I wanted to have sex as much as possible... don't ask me why. Well that didn't really happen. I got on OKCupid (again) and started going out on dates; nothing felt right. There was this guy at work I was attracted to, we'll call him ""John."" Long story short, we finally went on a date and ended up having sex towards the end of my internship.

That didn't ruin anything like I thought it might, it made him want me more... not just sexually but he told me if I lived there, I would be his girlfriend. This is where this is going to get a little confusing....

Greg wants to continue our ""friend w/ benefits"" thing, but John wants us to work out eventually once I'm done with school, so we'll visit each other throughout the year. But here's something else... I continue to look for other guys and I feel the need to have sex with them like on the first or second date.

I know nothing will ever become anything between Greg and I, but I hope something does between John and I. 

So why do I keep looking? Do I have some kind of sex issue? Please feel free to ask me anything. 

TL;DR: You should probably just read it, but basically I keep looking for guys and have sex with them too quickly. I need help figuring out what my problem is.

I would really, really appreciate it if any of you know good sites, agents or whomever that might be able to help me out. 

I understand accommodation in HK is more expensive so I'm on a budget/student cost of living.

I'm working in Central so I don't want to be too far.

Thank you!"

##Stats:

&gt;A/S/L and do you love where you live? 

&gt;&gt;21/F/DC (DC is great, but the summers are absolutely disgusting)

&gt;Relationship Status? 

&gt;&gt;In a relationship

##Favorites: 

&gt;Cats or Dogs? 

&gt;&gt;I’m really allergic to them, but I absolutely love cats. There’s something about the way they’re indifferent to your suffering that makes them lovable.

&gt;Favorite beverage? 

&gt;&gt;Shirley Temple

&gt;Food? Ugh. 

&gt;&gt;Too many favorites to choose one. Bacon. Cheese. Massaman curry. Cheesecake.

&gt;Favorite movies/tv shows? 

&gt;&gt;Movie: Lost in Translation and Groundhog Day TV: Curb Your Enthusiasm

&gt;Music? 

&gt;&gt;The Knife, Death Cab for Cutie, Thomas Newman

&gt;Books? 

&gt;&gt;Anything by Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, or Philip K Dick (also Harry Potter)

&gt;Games? 

&gt;&gt;Gameboy: Pokémon N64: Paper Mario Playstation: Tekken Xbox360: Gears of War (I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE RELEASE OF GoW3!!!!!)

&gt;What is your favorite word or expression? 

&gt;&gt;I really like the word “bananagrams.” The game is awesome, and I get to sing that obnoxious song whenever I ask to play Bananagrams! Bananagrams (do dooo do do do)!

##Miscellanea:

&gt;What makes you laugh? 

&gt;&gt;Videos of cute animals doing stupid things

&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve? 

&gt;&gt;Slow walkers. I mean, come on people. It’s really not that difficult to maintain a reasonable pace. It’s even worse when it’s a group of people who take up the entire sidewalk and walk at a glacial pace. I just want to push them. Or scream. Just thinking about this is making me angry.

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year? 

&gt;&gt;I transferred from Carnegie Mellon to Wesleyan and am having an absolutely fabulous time. I enjoyed studying ECE at CMU, but it consumed almost every waking moment of my life… Now I’m studying astrophysics and Japanese and I’m having an actual college experience that includes daily social interaction alongside the schoolwork.

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead? 

&gt;&gt;Finishing college and getting a job. I love working, and there’s just something about how universities are set up that I really dislike. I find that I learn more on my own than I do in a classroom setting, so I’m really looking forward to getting into a productive work environment.

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be? 

&gt;&gt;I probably would have picked a different initial university to attend. Transferring schools was a huge pain in the ass, and I ended up going to a school that I had gotten into when I first applied to colleges as a senior in high school.

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger? 

&gt;&gt;Last year I emailed the reddit admins asking if they needed a summer intern. I expected them to either not reply or to tell me the position had been filled months ago. As luck would have it, they told me the position hadn’t been filled and asked for my resume. I interned for them last summer (and part of the school year), and I now work for them as a freelancer and am having a fantastic time.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you? 

&gt;&gt;Keeping an open mind. I used to have big issues with letting things go, but a few years ago I said “fuck it” and decided to go into every situation with an open mind. It has made meeting people and maintaining friendships much easier, and I find that I’m much happier now that I don’t have these preconceived notions weighing me down.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name? 

&gt;&gt;In sixth or seventh grade, the friend group I was a part of decided we would all assume different Hostess nicknames (presumably for passing notes back and forth or gossiping or some other inane thing). I was cupcake, another friend was Twinkie, another was Ho Ho, and another was Fruit Pie. 17 is my favorite number, and 13 was the number that I had on all of my sports jerseys since the age of four.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had? 

&gt;&gt;Three. I had one way back in the day (maybe 3 years ago?) that I used for lurking, one for Secret Santa, and then my current one.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit? 

&gt;&gt;I know it’s probably the most used answer, but the users are my favorite part about reddit and are what make the site great. Sure, you’ve got a bunch of assholes who are only out to troll people (or are just genuine assholes), but there are so many incredible people out there who offer wonderful insight into many aspects of life. One of my favorite subreddits is /r/askscience because there are people with different scientific backgrounds who actually are capable of answering questions with authority.

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit? 

&gt;&gt;From September to May I’m a student and part-time reddit employee, and from June through August I work for reddit and bum around at the pool. I also read a lot of books; I’ve gone through 25+ since the start of June.

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so? 

&gt;&gt;Ooohhh boy, yes.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better? 

&gt;&gt;Mostly yes. I know that I’m biased, but I think the admins have done a superb job keeping the site up and running and making improvements to the user experience. Another aspect that has changed is the content that is submitted to the site. There weren’t nearly as many pictures of cats/pets that hit the frontpage and there was more discussion about news articles (though this could be attributed to my selection of subreddits on the frontpage). There wasn’t nearly as strong a sense of site-wide community as there is now. The start of it all was a little bit before the Colbert/Stewart rally (with DonorsChoose), and ever since then a bunch of subreddits have popped up revolving around helping others.

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate? 

&gt;&gt;Well… I’ve been doing this project for almost a year now, but would be great if you would stop by /r/pimpmyreddit and submit a link to a subreddit that you want us to promote! We don’t get paid by advertisers or anything for this, it’s simply to get the word out that there are other subreddits that people don’t really know about."

jjyzn,2,2011-08-15,American Grand Economic Bargain (AGEB) - progressive corp. tax rate &amp; tariffs:,ypoimano,PoliticalDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/jjyzn/american_grand_economic_bargain_ageb_progressive/,"Not a throwaway, just my first post!  :)

So I've had this idea floating around for awhile, and thought I'd throw it out there for the Reddit community to provide some feedback. Hopefully everyone from the Tea Partiers to the Socialists could support it.

Problem #1: Jobs going overseas
Problem #2: Corporate tax rate too high (plus all the loopholes)
Problem #3: Import/Export Deficit

Solution #1: Create a progressive corporate tax rate (something like 5%-75%), with the rate inversely proportional to the % of job positions held by U.S. citizens. 

This would apply to any company doing business (products, services, materials) in the U.S. For example, if Company A had 100% of all employees from CEO/Board to intern as American citizens, then its corporate tax rate would be 5%. Wouldn't matter if they actually lived in the country or not.

Conversely, if Company B had 80% of all employees as foreign nationals (whether working in the U.S. or overseas), then its tax rate would be something like 70%). 

This would apply to companies with U.S. headquarters and to companies based outside the country.

The actual exact rates could be set by economists (I'm not one by any means), but the purpose would remain.

Solution #2: Excepting raw crude, refined oil, etc, impose something like a 10-15% tariff on all materials, services, labor, parts, goods imported to the U.S.

I excepted oil since imposing a tariff on that would probably cripple us overnight. I didn't want the tariff to be so high that the nation would crash immediately; the goal is to spur jobs to return here (manufacturing, service/support, material refinement, etc). 

If you can think of anything else that ought to be excepted post it; or if you disagree about the oil, please state how come. 

Grand changes like these require people of all ilk to force their reps/sen to do so; all the bought Congressmen/women aren't going to do it with the corporate money funding their campaigns - UNLESS we push them as a unified front. 

Thoughts?

Oh, and I'm pretty ""left,"" but but righties I've spoken with seem to like it too..."

Got hired as a student intern to help out with their multi-user db (MS Access) which is hosted on a file server (managed by a 3rd party...YAY...).  Every time I try to apply any sort of updates I need ""exclusive access"".  I've come up with a solution similar to

^This.  This is all good and dandy if the main form is opened, otherwise, no dice.  

TLDR The Main Question:
If you were in the same environment--fileserver managed by third party but still 'hosting' the db which route would you take for suggesting something *new*???

This whole maintenance thing has got me tearing my hair out and I'd imagine that it would probably be much easier to transition to something like Oracle+PHP, *SQL+PHP but these would be a totally new environment for me.

I just got to DC, going to stay until the end of October to do an internship. I already took a little walk around downtown and I figured it would be a good idea to get a bike so I can get everywhere in no time. Where would I be able to find a bike that I can hold on to for two months and then either dump or sell again? I just don't want to loose too much money, so I would definitely go with a used bike, it doesn't have to be particularly good either, just something to get around on.

Unfortunately, I have to say goodbye to the best computer I've ever had this coming Thursday. So now I'm in the market...
Primarily, I used my MacBook Pro for development at work (PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, etc). Nothing terribly resource intensive like crunching numbers or anything. This is why I'm somewhat leaning towards a MacBook Air.
So I need your input! Smooth scrolling, fast programs, and smooth animations are a must - are these achievable on something like an 11"" MacBook Air? Would the small size and keyboard limit my development abilities?
Again, I'm entering my sophomore so I will be taking this to class a lot - taking notes, surfing the web, writing code (for class, assignments, fun, etc.) So finally, should I go with the same 13"" MacBook Pro i7, or do I simply not need that kind of power?"

I'm entering my 2L year and have almost 20 interviews for OCI coming up (how to deal with that many interviews is another issue) and I was wondering how much the fact that I won't be able to work for any of these firms for 4 years after I graduate will hurt my chances of getting an internship.

I'm pretty sure I'm not going to make the Army a career and will want to join the private sector after my time is up so obviously having some private firm internship and connection would be good.

Should I avoid the topic as much as possible? Should I bring it up?  Can I turn this into a positive? Would they like the idea of possibly hiring me back after 4 years in JAG if the internship went well?

I honestly have no idea what I'm walking into with these interviews in general, so any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.

I don't know what to do. I suffer from anxiety which I have been slowly getting over but suddenly things seem horrible. My work life is what most often makes me anxious as my boss is very controlling and bullies me, I am not qualified to work in another profession but can't see how I will cope in my current situation.

I work in a workshop, sort of as a craftsmen, my job is my life and I really want to learn as much about the field as I can and do the best job I can.

I had some free time so I thought it would be a good idea to visit all of the other people who practice this craft in the country and interview them about what methods they use, how their methods differ from the ones I use and why they chose those methods.

One guy I spoke to used very different methods from the ones we use at my workplace and we spoke for ages about the pros and cons of the different approaches, I really enjoy debates of this kind as it helps to clarify what your position on things is, not that I would neccesarily change any of my methods. he suggested I go to this workshop that was being held and I said I might if I saved up the money.

Later I found out the workshop was more of a beginners thing so I forgot about it. But then today my boss called me in and said there was a big problem because apparently this guy had gone to talk to the workshop runner (a friend of my boss) and had told him all about our conversations and also that he wanted to pay for me to go to the workshop. (I was not aware of this)

My boss and his friend said I needed to be careful about who I befriend in the industry, they think I shouldn't be talking to amateurs in the profession. They were angry and basically accused me of 
being critical of the workshops methodologies to outsiders. They also said that people would slander my name and wonder what I was giving the guy in return for payment of the workshop ( I am a girl).

I am devastated, I don't think I did anything wrong but I also feel fearful about the effect this could have on my job (they hinted that I should be especially careful because it was a small field where they had alot of sway), my internship is just finishing and I will be relying on them for employment. It feels at the moment like they control my whole life. I don't know what to do.

I have always had a problem with imagining terrible consequences from just talking to people, being proactive and now it seems like I was justified.


tldr: boss controls my life."

jmpa2,0,2011-08-18,Defensive carry for the misses.,deathsythe,guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/jmpa2/defensive_carry_for_the_misses/,"Hey guys.

My SO recently took an internship in CT with the Jerry Springer show doing production assistant stuff (she's going into broadcast engineering, cameras, soundboards, production type stuff). We are both NY residents living/working upstate basically on the NY/CT border.


I'm not really comfortable with her being around the types that go on that, and the Steve Wilkos show (same studio, also doing part of her internship there); rapists, baby momma/daddy types, child molestors, criminals, etc...


Originally thought of calling in a few favors, expiditing her NY paperwork, and having her get a CT CCW license, but that doesn't seem to be viable for a variety of reasons (she doesn't want to carry a gun, its too much paperwork, she can't keep the weapon at school with her anyway- logistically it would be a nightmare).


I'm looking into alternative methods of protection for her...


A knife would be legal, but useless. (She's a small girl, it would wind up getting taken from her and used against her, also CT law limits to lik 1.5"" in length... useless)
An ASP/baton would be illegal, and also useless for the same reasoning)
A stun gun would be illegal, but prolly the most useful.
Pepper Spray/Mace would be legal, and useful.

So basically I am stuck with the latter.

Now here in our beloved state, you need to basically register when purchasing pepper spray. I know I cannot buy some off the internet and give it to her, and I also can't buy it at a gunshow out in PA or something and give it to her. But can I buy it from my local apothecary/pharmacy and then give it to her? Or do I have another reason to hate this liberal stinkhole even more? 


 
Also if anyone has any other legal suggestions, I would love to hear them.


Thanks guys!"

so as a prerequisite I asked to solve any 5 problems in projecteuler.net using java and bring them to discuss on how they find the  solution.

after a couple of weeks , a girl came today and say she had solved the problems and the interview starts . 

I specify  that please tell the truth if the programs were made by herself or , got help or find out the solutions in internet. 

she says she did them, but  was sick the last weeks and some of them where made under the influence of a little bit of medication, so she is not sure whats on them (I think WTF ).

she handed me paper copies and I went to review  the first ones , and made a comment or two,  basically highlighting how well made  are the variables and good inline comments, she explains she learnt in her C classes to be organized.

I am delighted, finally someone with clean code, but think, too good to be perfect . 

So I ask to modify something to show a different value, and as I saw her dubious, I left the meeting room to give her time, and comeback to  find out she hadn't touch anything of the code . 

so I pick the next problem and found a variable named 
String omg_zombies =""something"";
System.out.println(omg_zombies); 



so I think... cool the zombie reference make my day  and say  ... I found zombies in your code, expecting a reference to a movie, or the inspiration for that variable name. she just put rolling eyes and ... say zombies ? what zombies ... 

so I finished the interview ... and kept looking for the perfect intern... one aware of zombies in his own code .

I'd like to meet up, with anyone really, I'm pretty laid back, cool with most types of people :)

Also I'm pretty into music, I guess when it comes to listening to music people might call me a hipster or whatever. Point is, I like music, and I'm sure many of you do to. I used to play bass in a punk band, kinda 90's, early 2000 sound, but I'm into everything, seriously, as long as it's got some substance to it. 

So, I think it might be cool to go see some shows together!  I'm planning on going to the Pitchfork Festival on October 28, and 29, but besides that, I have no idea where the good venues and cubs are, or where one might find some cool open-mic bars with talent.

Fast Foward to a few weeks ago, wehere she told me that some guy tried to kiss her at same party. I was pretty upset, because she waited so long, but I told her you did the right thing for telling me. I foudn the guy on facebook, and sent him a ""Your an asshole"" message, and he sent one saying ""Dude she kissed me back""

So, I go kinda stir crazy. I know her facebook pw, and i know its wrong but I log in to see if there was anything said. I find her conversation with a friend, saying how she kissed him when she was drunk. I confront her with this, and she said she only told her that to make the story more dramatic, because the almost kiss kinda shook her off...


I think thats bullshit, and that something happened, shes mad at me for not trusting her, and im mad at her for being deceptive.

Edit-7:45 Got this on facebook, then we talked on the phone

 ...This summer, while we were on the outs with each other, Josh did show interest in me, but I refused him. While we eventually did hang out with each other, it didn’t turn into anything. What I told Jill was true. However, this is very different from what your other girlfriends did. I still love you, and don’t want to be with Josh, but I can’t be with you right now. Hanging out with him showed me that I don’t think it’s a good idea for us to be together. I just want to be independent. Your emotional ups and downs are, I believe, causing you to mistreat me. I don’t want to be with anyone else, but we can’t be together right now. I’m sorry...

jqiez,5,2011-08-22,Fall in love in a small town - move to big city - things falling apart.  ,smalltown-bigcity,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jqiez/fall_in_love_in_a_small_town_move_to_big_city/,"Help reddit, I don’t know where to turn.  I’m M29, wife is F24.

I met my wife 4 or 5 years ago.  We were both living in a small town, and had come from the same big city so had plenty in common.  Things were great, we spent tons of time together and were very happy.  We decided to get married and move back home to a major city.  About a year has passed since then.  I got a new job and my wife is currently in law school.  

Since moving to the major city we’ve spent less and less time together.  She made new friends, and by my own fault was too tired/anti-social and didn’t go out.  I never went out much, and she stayed at home, but that was in the small town when there really wasn’t all that much to do.  She just got back from a 2.5 month trip overseas where she had an internship.  Our deal when we got married was that she was young and that I would still “allow” her to travel.  That was/is no problem.  She just got back a little over a week ago.  Things have been rocky to say the least.  This past Friday she was out all night till 4 AM.  We talked when I got home from work and said we’d spend all day Saturday together and do a few fun things.  She was too hungover to get up off the couch all night.  

Move on to Sunday.  Had some family obligations that I had to take care of and she went off to study for school.  Supposed to grab dinner with my fam but they were tired and we just decided to part ways.  Wife asks if I mind if she has dinner with her friends.  No problem.  Text her a few hours after she had went out to eat to see when she’d be home.  She says she’s hanging out with her friends.  Whatever.   Go to bed, wake up at 4:30 AM for work, and she’s still not home.  Finally walks in the door at 5 am as im getting ready to head to work.  This is after we had said we’d go to bed early Sunday night.  She’s got shit to do today and is now going to be hungover and screw it up I’m sure.  

As im getting ready we get into a huge screaming match.  Me basically yelling that the only time I get to spend with her is when I get to take care of her hangover.  The conversation ends with her telling me she’s leaving me, it’s over.  

I don’t know what to do.  She might be right, maybe we are incompatible.  She’s so young, and is still figuring herself out, and her changing since the move from small town to big city should have been expected.  I do love her though, and I love the time we spend together.  I just want her to support me once in a while.  Or let me know that dinner means come home drunk at 5 AM.  I don’t know what do…  I don’t know if she’s serious she’s leaving.  We’ve gotten in fights before, even going as far to say that we’re leaving at the heat of the fight, but always ended up making up.  This feels different….  

What do I do?  I feel lost…  How can I save my marriage?  And if it’s gone, how do I protect myself?  I work full time, she goes to school, and has quite a bit of very large loans taken out.  Our joint account doesn’t have much money in at all, and she’s been using it for personal finances which we agreed on, she can have it..  

I’m lost reddit…  Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym?  Any advice is appreciated…  

TLDR – Met wife in small town with big hometown in common.  Get married, move back to bigtown, young wife changes.  Spends no time with me and I feel hurt.  Huge fight over it – she says she’s leaving, too young to be accountable to anyone else.

jqeu5,0,2011-08-22,An NWO insider tells the real truth you have never heard behind the creation and implementation of the NWO.,anNWOInsider,conspiracy,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jqeu5/an_nwo_insider_tells_the_real_truth_you_have/,"I'd like to introduce myself by saying I joined the NWO involuntarily a little over a year ago. I'll say more about  why I am involved latter but first lets go over what you know about the NWO (New World Order). 

I'll summarize briefly what everyone already knows about the NWO. It is a plan created by ""elites"" to take control over the world through possibly project blue beam combined with a fake alien invasion and reduce the population to 500,000,000 as indicated by agenda 21 and the Georgia Guidestones and implement a fascist one world government through an all controlling corporation. This plan has been in the works for over 100 years that I know of. Now the question that everyone seems to skip over is why would anyone want to do this. Considering the majority of the people involved already are the leaders of the world. People like Barack Obama, George Bush, the Rockerfellers, pretty much any high ranking free mason in a position of military, corporate, or public importance. The funny thing is, all of these people are supposedly in a plan to take over the world and yet not much has been leaked. If you are questioning whether it is real it is real, very, I can assure you that; however, you should be questioning its motivations. The one thing left out in all of the conspiracies I have found so far though is the mind control machine. See after the 500,000,000 survive all the calamities they will not be free at all. There is no need for RFID tags, that is old school. The way they will be controlled is through a supercomputer free will simulator. I do not know all the details, it has something to do with HAARP, EISCAT, SuperDARN and the others like them around the world. Check out the spirals in the sky for their location. Ones in New Zealand, one is in Russia etc. They have a world reach and as crazy as this sounds, it is 100% true, are being used in conjunction with supercomputers to read everyone on the planets, well the survivors at least, minds and build up a virtual representation of their daily habits so once activated everyone can become mind controlled zombies and no one will know the difference. Yes, the mind reading works both ways and what I just wrote is true as far as I know from my involvement.

Back to the question why? First we need to look at the twentieth century and humanities current progress.  Throughout the twentieth century there were constantly major wars, huge loses of life, and many examples of corruption and dictatorship. The NWO itself is based on NAZI Germany. These show the terrible consequences of what happens when nations fight each other. During this time the NWO was born. As far as I can tell around 1917. Around this time many intellects started to think what would happen if humanity were to unite, work together instead of against each other, eliminate the things that separate us such as countries and instead just have the country of man, the earth. Imagine what we could accomplish to list a few: space exploration, the curing of all major diseases, increased life span and prosperity for everyone, the elimination of wars, etc. In short what if the world were to unite and work towards a utopia for everyone instead of a fractioned dystopia. It was thoughts like this that gave birth to the NWO.
Everyone sees the NWO as an evil plan to take over the world. But that is not the intention. The intention is to have a group of revolutionaries overthrow the NWO just before it gets completely activated and reveal what happens in a drastic and scary way when we allow corruption and corporations to go unchecked. Don't believe me? I use to think the same way. The thing is the only reason the NWO has remained a secret for so long is because everyone in it thinks they are building a world revolution for good, and they are. Just their methods are a bit questionable. See their thinking is if you shock everyone with the facts I told you previously just before it happens then there will be a world revolution, everyone on the face of the planet having just faced almost emanate death. I went along with this at first; however, it eventually dawned on me that what would be shown is how evil humanity is when the people working on the NWO only wanted to change the world for the better all along. If you are to change the world, make sure you do not become evil in the process. This plan as it stands currently is very misguided.

Is there another way perhaps, less evil, will still achieving a united world? A world without wars and stricken with poverty? There sure is. Instead of showing the evil side of humanity by stopping the NWO we need to show the good side of humanity by exposing all the technology and plans for a brighter future that have been developed over the past 100 years for this revolution. We need to show that when thousands of people work together they can change the world. When billions of people work together there is no limits to what we can accomplish. I'll briefly list some of the things I have my suspicions we have already developed in preparation for the NWO to be overthrown. A cure for cancer, almost free energy fusion, solar, etc, new means of space travel, a well worked out system of government combining the best of many different types such as capitalism, socialism, libertarianism, etc, also almost finished is a cure for aging. That is the type of technologies black projects have been working on for quite some time. Along with the tools to make the NWO seem real. In our current system there is too much corruption for many of these technologies to be released. The cure for cancer would just go to a corrupt organization instead of belonging to everyone. See the NWO has alot of influence but it is far from controlling everything or else there would be no need for a world revolution. To my knowledge they cannot stop wars completely, or corruption in office or corporations. In short, with our current world wide politics they can not change the world for the better in any meaningful way. We need a revolution, that is true, but it can be a revolution for good showing the awesome things humanity can accomplish instead of the terrifying.

As for myself, I believe I was chosen to be in politics after the world revolution. I would love to take part in an intern world government just to get things going after a good revolution but I think humanities ultimate destiny is a internet democracy. Noone in charge and the complete elimination of corruption. A united humanity governing itself.

I'm off to work on a good revolution, I hope you guys can join me.

jq4a4,7,2011-08-21,Being unemployed is getting to me - Life falling apart and I'm struggling with staying afloat and trying not to hurt myself,woefullyunemployed,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jq4a4/being_unemployed_is_getting_to_me_life_falling/,"I can basically sum up my depression right now with:

**tl;dr**

1. About to start month 4 of being unemployed

2. Went through a really rough break up that neither of us want/wanted, but not sure of how to stay together

3. Unable to find an exit out of my current life, every day is becoming harder and my options of helping myself out of my dark mood and regaining my motivation seem limited

***

1)  I have applied to over 100 jobs (90 recorded on my job tracking spreadsheet, but I haven't written down a lot of the retail and temp jobs I've applied for).

I felt like I tried really hard to set myself up before graduation.  I went to graduate school straight out of college and just earned my Master's degree.  While in school, I volunteered an insane amount and completed an internship.  I probably put in an extra 30-40 hours between those two on top of my 10 hour assistantship (which was often more like 15, because I put in extra hours to help students) a week.  In my last year I started looking for jobs as well, putting in a few applications here and there every month while putting together a list of occupations and companies to look into once I had my degree in my hands.  I was not lazy about it.

Well, the internship went nowhere.  It was with a non-profit that went through large scale restructuring and massive budget cuts.  I was warned throughout the last half of the semester that there wouldn't be a place for me.  I tried to get some sort of recommendation out of my superiors (well owed, imho, considering the hours and effort I put in there), but many were either let go or brushed me off.  It was very frustrating, because I felt like my time would have been spent much better elsewhere and I did it for credit, which was a huge waste of money.

I have good academic connections, but most of the people I know are struggling just as much as I am.  I've contacted a few professors, but the one that responds has now moved to another state and isn't really in a position to help.

I tried to get into teaching, but my state went through huge budget cuts and teaching lay-offs.  Otherwise, there isn't much of an economy for my degree because of lay-offs, cuts, and lack of funds into the private sector as well.

I've tried looking out of state, but I can't seem to get my foot in the door with being so far away.  I've started to use my (ex)boyfriend's address for some things, so I'll see if that changes anything.

Count me as part of the ""lost generation,"" a spoiled, over-educated brat with no job prospects.  I have conducted original research using heavy quantitative statistical analysis.  I have crazy science skills.  I'm good at biology, forensics, and social research.  I have a good employment history and references.  I still have no job.

I'm living with my parents, which adds to my depression because of my strained relationship with them.  I feel so guilty and horrible for mooching off their kindness, but at the same time resentful for past grievances involving them.  It's not a healthy situation, and even my counselor agrees that I should find a way out of the house.  I tried to find cheap housing via craigslist in my area, but it's just not within my budget and most of the responses were sketchy or a bust.  I'm pretty much stuck here.

2)  A lot was hinging on me finding a job, as my SO lives in another state.  We've both been dirt poor and haven't been able to see each other in about a year.  He's tied down in his area because he at least has a job out there, and can't find anything that's equivalent or better in my area (he's tried).  But he doesn't make enough to support me moving out there.  When I didn't get any call backs in his area, I broke up with him in frustration.  We just don't know when there's ever going to be an end date, and we can't figure out how to date each other with this distance.  Going a year without seeing each other has been too long, but we're both miserable and miss each other.   It really hurts.  Neither of us want it to end, especially because of money.  If I could only find a job there, any job, I'd take it in an instant.

3)  Luckily, I still have insurance through my dad and worked out a payment plan with a local therapist.  She's been helping, but she also really wants me to go back on medication while I go through this.  But I can barely afford the visits to see her, as my only income is through donating plasma and odd jobs.  I can't afford the 40-60$ copay on some of these medications, and the lower income options don't seem nearly as good as the counseling ones were.  I'm a bit stuck when it comes to that.

It's getting harder to take care of myself.  My sleep schedule has always been screwed up, and now it's really hard to sleep at all.  I barely want to eat.  I cry all of the time.  I'm extremely lonely.  Most of my friends around here were through graduate school and moved on after graduation.  Plus, my parents live in a rural area about 20-40 minutes away from the nearest towns.  Most of my days, I am sitting inside on the computer without talking to anyone.  I can't stand it anymore, but I don't know what to do.  Volunteering has been suggested to me, but I barely have the money for gas to see my counselor once a week and to look for jobs.

There are days where I hate myself so much for being in this position that I have to actively fight the urge to hurt myself by punching pillows or working out to the point of collapsing.  I'm not to the point of posting on /r/suicidewatch because I'm still finding ways to curb the frustration, but I don't know how much longer I'll be ok while I'm in this rut.  I'm starting to give up and settle into the idea of long-term unemployment and losing everything else.

I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, which funnily enough just adds to my frustration because then I start to wonder *why* I can't seem to help crying all the time (in private) and can't seem to stop feeling so helpless.

***

If you've read through all of this, thanks.  I really needed to get it off my chest, because I need to put on a brave, optimistic, productive front with people I still get to see."

jrhpu,2,2011-08-23,"IAmA very unhappy person who needed to write this down, AMA",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jrhpu/iama_very_unhappy_person_who_needed_to_write_this/,"I got out of a relationship about a month ago, it lasted 2 years i was heavily depressed for the last few months of it because i felt i was being cheated on. Every attempt i made to figure things out, i knew i would get stone walled by her simply saying 'that i didn't trust her'. It was unfair and i felt trapped, i noticed a drastic change in her persona over the weeks and one day after binge drinking and getting high something got shaken up in me and i called her in a panic, i began telling her that im going to try to change for the better etc. I became extremely paranoid that I did this too late. 

I get a call later after she says she's gotten home. I notice several things that put me off and make this worse. She calls me, while she's going to the bathroom and flushes the toilet, laughs to herself- does this whole sticht where she indirectly insults me, the usual. Probably sucking dick in-between sentences. 

The relationship goes on for another two weeks, and she has me over for her sisters birthday party, which was just a gathering of her family. The entire family participates in excluding me the entire night, trying to convey the message that i wasn't apart of it. I've never been very close to my own family, and i always had a hard time communicating with theirs because there was a language barrier and i couldn't find anything to talk to them about. It becomes this orchestrated event where everyone fucks with me. People i once considered family not too long ago physiologically and systematically destroyed me. 

She grabs me, and asks me to start the barbecue up so we can eat, i do it with no problem. Turns out i start it for no reason and left it on for a half a minute expecting someone to start laying down the chicken soon after. I go out to talk to the father and her sisters fiancee, who i used to consider a brother. I get completely ignored and fingered pretty much. I leave and idle in the kitchen momentarily trying to think things through, i overhear my girlfriend talking about people i dont know. I go up to her room and text her, i get ignored and i choose to leave. Before i go she actually comes down- and is yelling everything she says (as if she wants her family to hear, they're right upstairs) then for some fucking reason she brings her sister down to talk, and she had this smug fucking look on her face that i will always remember.

I start leaving and i get trailed by the sister's fiancee. More indirect insults that i cant really deflect, because they got drunk and high before all this. I could barely speak. We walk towards the park and there is this fucking purple bicycle in the middle of a clearing. There, for me to see it. 

I think prior to all this as well, the mother had me over and brought a friend of hers who i believe is the mother of the person my girlfriend cheated on me with. 

We broke up the next day, i starred at her completely emotionally vacant while we were doing the procedure. I talked with such clarity, while wearing a blank face. Something in me had snapped, and iv'e been sinking in to a gradual self destructive depression ever since.

I got an internship at this company full of some of the best in the industry. I have to learn an entirely new program, and i just cant get the time in to practice on my own accord because i always choose to get fucked up and try to forget about everything. I just try to surround myself with friends these days, and they have no idea how fucked up i have been physiologically.

Three weeks later, i have this wonderful night at a screening for a film that i worked on. My oldest friend brings this young actress he knows and we immediately hit it off. I didn't leave with her that night, and i didn't expect to. We danced at a gay club alone for an hour after the group dispersed, it was the happiest iv'e been in a long time. I get her number and we agree to see each other in the following week. 

That was yesterday, everything goes as i planned- everything was working i could have been happy. We see a movie, have dinner- buy some wine and go to the beach to sit and talk. Not an awkward moment happens miraculously, i was being charming and witty. We buy some more wine and head back to her apartment, watch a movie- i dont realize i've drank too much.

I pass out, for 2 hours on her. I remember having dreams including her, very vivid and strange while i was out. I wake back up eventually and we talk for another 2 hours till 4am. I smoothly apologize and ask her if were still on the for the second date and she agrees. We go back to sleep and then i wake up, and it seems she's changed her mind. Awkwardness ensues, we walk out into the rain eventually, I give her a goodbye kiss and we depart. Couldn't get home for a few hours because i didn't have any fucking money because i spent it on the date, so i just idled in places realizing how much i fucked up.

That was my chance at changing things, everything around me is going to shit despite all my good qualities.

If you've read all of this, i love you

tldr; im fucked up physiologically, heavily depressed, and failing at the last second in everything i do lately.

jrgwb,3,2011-08-23,Moving back to the city; time for a change?,El_Rantatron,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/jrgwb/moving_back_to_the_city_time_for_a_change/,"Hey /r/fitness.

Longtime lurker, first time poster, partly due to the fear of ""**CHECK THE FAQ!**"" and subsequent burial. However, after reading it multiple times, searching the forums and coming up with little in the ways of answering my questions, I've decided to create a thread.

First, some stats:

I'm 6'3, 215 pounds. I'm 22 years old, and going into my final year of University. I look [like this](http://i.imgur.com/cywqG.jpg). I am currently at my heaviest, and have never had this much of a belly before.


I live a largely sedentary lifestyle, as I'm a freelance journalist. However, I'd like this to change, as spending so much time at the computer is burning me out. Normally, I would look to start a hobby to distract myself from work, but I usually end up *writing about it*. 

I've been working at doing Stronglifts 5X5 for awhile, and have had mixed success; usually, I can stick to it for 3ish weeks straight before a large story/project/summer vacation comes up, which leads to me ""starting over;"" as you can imagine, this does not do good things for my maxes. Recently, I said ""screw it"" and decided to just keep adding weight to challenge myself, without injuring my body. My current 5RM maxes are:

* Squat: 145lbs 
* Bent-Over Rows: 100lbs
* Deadlifts: 135lbs
* Bench: 105lbs
* Chin ups: I'm kind of useless without 100lbs of assistance on the machine. Negatives are 2-3 before failure, which is kind of embarrassing.


I'm looking to start physical training to gain strength for the prime of my life, and to be generally fit for when I'd like to start a family. My father was never really active with me in my childhood, and I'd like to be able to have fun with my child. I'd also like to enjoy what I see in the mirror every day.

**However:**

What's really been worrying me is my diet. While living at home on a freelancer's salary, I find it hard to turn down my parents' cooking; this is obviously a problem, as most of the stuff my grandma and mom cook employ a lot of butter.

While working out, I drink a protein shake afterwards, and sometimes blend a banana in with it. I also take a multivitamin and one fish oil caplet daily. 

I realize this isn't the best way to approach things, so I'm looking to have a plan in place before I move back to Toronto in September. As I'm going to be working long hours at the school paper and internships as part of my program, I'd like to be as organized as possible, so I don't get confused and give up.

This is where the confusion sets in: I have no idea which plan would be good for me, nor do I have any idea where to start building one. The FAQ says ""try a bunch until you find one that works,"" but I have no idea **which ones to try**. I mean, I've been seeing a lot of LeanGains results posts, which look appealing; however, looking around their site I haven't been able to find any sample of where to start.

Ideally, I'd like to know what numbers I should be shooting for before I start trying to fill them. Finding a workout plan before Stronglifts and SS was difficult, as I **need** that kind of structure laid out for me before I start. 

I'm not looking for a magic program that works around my schedule, and is convenient for me; I realize that results take work, and that they don't often come easy. What I'd like your help with is finding a diet program that would work ideally with SS or SL, and that is friendly with a student budget. I also ask for your **patience**, and I assure you that **yes, I have read the FAQ**.

tl;dr; Moving back to Toronto with an empty fridge, and I have no idea where to start when it comes to dieting. Have read the FAQ, know about calorific deficiency, but need **structure** and examples."
jt5tw,2,2011-08-24,"$25,000* anyone?",[deleted],rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/jt5tw/25000_anyone/,"Hey all, so I'll break it down as simple and straight forward as possible. The company I work for is interested in this competition:

http://fvwc.army.mil/ 

They know I'm going back to school soon, but as you can see in my flair, I am no GDD or other major that has much of a background in game design (ex: enjoying learning games) or hardware manipulation (ex: hooking up a kinect to second life). They know RIT has programs MEANT for this stuff. I told them I would poke around when I got back up to school, but I know there are quite a few of you that frequent here.

The idea is if we win, money is split, and everyone goes home happy, RIT gets some good publicity. Yippie skippy. On the flip side, my company was so impressed with what I did this summer they want to start doing more co-ops and internships from RIT, and this would be a good way to get your foot in the door if you want something for the future. 

I'd prefer to not name my company publicly, because anyone who clicks my username can see I use... less than tasteful language. But if you're skeptical, I will gladly verify my identity with a mod.

Anyway, I'm just trying to gauge interest. We're thinking anything between 2-4 people. I apologize if this is a terrible idea and I'm wasting your time, just wanted to extend the opportunity. I figured since this is more of a competition than a job posting I'd be spared the wrath of xb4r7x for posting here. 

For clarity, my company would provide you with the assets you need. For instance, if we to have a project goal with an xbox and a kinect, my company would pay for those things for us to use (using academic resources for something like this is a disqualifier) or any other costs we would incur. Pretty much they would sponsor a team, and if that team won, there would be some reward cut out. 

*I don't want to make false promises here, obviously my company is going to want a cut, and depending how many people work on it we'll have to split, plus taxes etc. The reward would be discussed later. 

**TL;DR:**
My company wants to sponsor a team for this competition that can do one or both of the categories. Cut of the prize money and excellent recognition if you win, foot in the door for future employment and internships as a consolation, only time lost if you lose.  "

I'm a 22 year old American who recently graduated from college. I decided I wasn't ready for the real world, and I'm now planning a four month trip to South America. 

I leave in mid-September for Chile, where I will intern in Santiago and live with family for about a month. I'm hoping to hit the road in mid-late October and see more of Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. I am definitely planning (or at least hoping) to see the following (in no particular order):

* Machu Picchu
* Salar de Uyuni
* Lake Titicaca
* Iguazu Falls
* Iquito
* Buenos Aires
* And I'll finish the trip up in Patagonia with family (thinking of taking a plane from Santiago with the family; considering trying to get down there myself)

So, here come the questions: 

With about two months to travel and close to $5000 saved up (already purchased round trip ticket to Santiago), can I see all of this? If so, what's the best sequence to see everything?
What is the best way to see the Amazon (or one of its tributaries in Peru/Bolivia) without going into Brazil (I hear visas for Brazil are a pain to get)? 
Any small travel tips for the road? I plan on mostly staying in hostels/guest houses but I'm not afraid to rough it.
I have a good, light pack and good trail shoes already, but how warm of clothing should I bring? I don't want to pack too much, but I don't want to be caught unprepared for temperature changes, either.
Anyone have a favorite off-the-beaten-path place/sight?

I'm game for pretty much anything and not afraid to be spontaneous on the road. I've spent time in spanish-speaking countries and should be able to pick the language back up with some degree of fluency pretty quickly. I think I'm somewhat prepared, but if you see some glaring holes in what I've planned, please point them out. 

Like the internets, I know traveling is serious business. So, I humbly come before you , reddit, looking for advice.

Once I saw it I thought it was a sign just for me because of its perfect timing. The movie You've got Mail was on last night and I remember thinking to myself how awesome it would be to have an email buddy. Not that I'm looking to fall in love with all you Tom Hanks out there, especially since I'm no Meg Ryan, but you never know. 

Here's the other reason I feel like this subreddit came at a perfect time. I'm a recent college grad who like most college grads, are experiencing the stress, pain, and disappointment of job hunting. It's taking a strain on my life and those around me. My relationship with my parents has staggered because I sit at home all day with no purpose just wasting away and leaching off them. 

All of my friends have managed to find some sort of job or internship which for some reason pay them beyond entry level income so they're all baller status now. I'm not sure if this is the reason for our declining friendship, but either way my friends have stopped talking to me. They regularly hang out and make plans without including me. I've been trying pretty hard to think of any time in which I have offended my friends in any way to deserve this lack of communication, but I can't come up with anything. 

I know what you're thinking, that there's always at least one annoying friend in the group that nobody really likes and if you can't think of one then it's you. However, one other person of the group is already that annoying person that gets on our nerves but is still our friend. So I'm just left wondering, what happened to me? 

Sorry, if all of this sounds really whiny, but I'm at a low point in my life right now and I usually count on my friends' support to get me back in my spirits, but now I'm finding myself friendless as well. I feel very alone right now in a point where I really need someone there. If you're interested in being my friend, message me. If not, thanks for listening. "
jshz9,1,2011-08-23,[For Hire] 19 year old with little experience but willingness to learn and attack opportunities (Chicagoland Area),[deleted],YoungJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoungJobs/comments/jshz9/for_hire_19_year_old_with_little_experience_but/,"Hello! I'm a 19 year old from the south suburbs of Chicago, and a quick hop to a train station, that has been looking for a job for a while now.  The one *real* job I've had (an unpaid internship) was dealing with mostly large animal care/husbandry (no breeding or things like that; it was at a sanctuary), and that experience isn't exactly relevant in Chicagoland. But, I can say I'm no stranger or afraid of manual labor. It gives me sexy muscles.

I am not currently in school as I took the last year off to do said internship and some other things, and right now I'm trying to figure out what to do with school. So for right now, no schooling is going around.

Some things I believe I'm good at:

* Dealing with people. 
 * Angry people, happy people, sad people, kids, etc. I'm pretty good with that stuff, or so I like to think. No one's ever walked off in a fit of rage after talking to me, so I take that as a good sign. Answering phones, standing behind a desk, assisting people, directing people to places, asking to ""Hold, please"", telling your spouse you're out on a business lunch instead of participating in a cake eating contest in the kitchen which is what you're really doing, the whole shebang. I got it handled. Plus, I might get some rage comic material from the convos.
* Dealing with animals.
 * Cats, dogs, rabbits, rodents, large mammals, amphibians, reptiles, insects, etc. It might take me a while to get comfortable with reptiles (never been around any) but it's all good. Administering medications, cleaning their homes, playing, grooming, feeding, giving lots of kisses, etc. I love animals. I don't like to hurt animals. If you need someone who loves animals, I am definitely your girl. And if you need someone to just stand around holding slugs and caterpillars all day, well just tickle me pink.

* Dealing with computers.
 * I've been around computers since about 1998, and I'm also a teenager, so that means I'm pretty darn comfortable doing things on the internet (not just reddit). Social media and all that stuff, I've got you covered. I'm pretty good with Microsoft programs. I haven't used them often so it might take a short bit to get up to speed. I don't type  very fast. Fast enough, and probably faster than a majority, but really not that fast. And I promise I won't slam a computer into a wall when something goes wrong. [Printers](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/printers), however... Well, I can't promise anything, but I'll try.
 
* Monotonous things.
 * Counting, organizing, placing stock, lifting things, organizing other things, counting other things, setting price tags, organizing, counting, and placing more things in the back room, storing things, setting up displays, decorating windows, hanging decorations/signs, moving things, straightening up the stuff in and outside the building, I love that junk. I'll do it with a grin on my face and not complain if I break a nail or get covered in mud or rained on. In fact, I would love that. I stomp through puddles anyway.


So yeah. That's some of the things I can offer. I may not have experience but I'm willing to prove myself."
jshjk,2,2011-08-23,I've created something incredibly complicated. WTF do I do?!,LiverpoolGlasgow,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jshjk/ive_created_something_incredibly_complicated_wtf/,"I had recently begun seeing this guy (Let's call him Eric) who lives about 40 minutes from my college town. Although it was a rather premature relationship, it was definitely pretty serious. We were staying for days on end at each others' houses and he introduced me to his family and showed PDA in front of his family/friends (which, I came to find out, he never even did with his ex-girlfriend of 6 years). We would spend weekend nights in the city, go out to the expensive bars and clubs, and overall just really enjoy each others' company. He is very sweet, passionate, caring, and very intelligent. He also is about 6 years older than I am... which is a little different for both of us but we connect fairly well. In all honesty, if I were to pursue this relationship, I could see it going very well.

Well, I left early June to Mexico for a 6 week study abroad program and right before I left, he had me promise him that if anything happened with any guys while I was abroad that I would tell him. I promised. I never expected anything to happen and I don't think he did either, but it was precautionary since we weren't anything official. Just dating/seeing each other. Very casual.

Everything in Mexico was great. About the 2 1/2-3rd week in, I found out that one of the guys (we're gonna call him Bryan) in the program has this huge crush on me. So, being the awful partying young adult that I've become, I took advantage of this knowledge when we were drunk and I made out with him... very intensely. Being single, young, abroad, and every other excuse I can imagine, it was all innocent for me. Well... just before this incident, Bryan and his friend (Tom) had met these Mexican guys (they're brothers) while at a bar and I was introduced to them. So later that week I ended up drunkenly making out with one of the brothers (let's call him Pedro -- and for the record, I had never had a drunken hook up like this before Bryan. I'd only kissed people I had any serious interest in.) and both Pedro and Bryan had hickies on their necks from me... Pedro knew about me via Bryan and Tom and knew that Bryan had this huge crush on me so he knew everything that had happened already and was fine with us hooking up. Well, Bryan wasn't too keen on it. But that's not too important. So after the first hook up with Pedro, we start hanging out a lot. Like everyday after classes/comida and we're going out together with our friends and just enjoying life. Neither one of us had any intentions of anything serious, we both knew it was just drunken hooking up. Well, the school program ended but I stayed for a week and a half longer because I wanted to travel some more/spend more time in Mexico. During that time we hung out even more than before... it was all day every day. He would come over at like 7:30am before his college courses just to say hi and wish me a good rest of the day. So, naturally, feelings start to develop. Both of us were a mess the first few days after I'd left Mexico. He has some really serious feelings for me and I feel as if I just have some puppy love crush... but I'm just not sure?

So... I never got around to telling Eric what happened because the only means of communication I had while abroad was sending him messages online, like e-mail. And I figured that telling him via the internet was a really shallow thing to do. So I decided I would tell him once I got back to the States. Well... I arrived... and still haven't told him. I 100% plan on telling him but I have yet to figure out HOW to tell him and how many details to offer up. I'm not sure if I should wait until I move into my college apartment and he visits me... or if I should call him... or what. I really like Eric and am excited to be back home so we can resume our relationship but at the same time, with Pedro, we talk absolutely everyday via skype and although I try to pull back on the affection, he is very open with it and talks about how when he visits me and the friends he made (like Bryan and Tom, because we all go to the same college) that he's going to sleep in my bed with me (nothing sexual, just cuddle and cute stuff like that) but I have firmly told him many times that he's to sleep in my second bedroom on the futon. Pedro and I have discussed multiple times the boundaries of our relationship and we've agreed to just go about our own lives as usual until we meet up again and then we'll see how it goes. He is very much still hooked on me and my friends who are still in Mexico tell me how he always talks about me, smiles when he talks about me, etc.

So I'm really confused about many things: 1. Most importantly, how do I tell Eric and how much should I tell? 2. I still feel really cloudy on how my emotions and mine and Pedro's ""strictly friendship"" boundary mix. 3. I realize it would be really foolish, but I feel almost like abandoning something great with Eric to hope for something in the future (nearly impossible, I realize -- but I've been planning on an internship in Mexico for months now) with Pedro. 4. WHY AM I SO MUCH MORE INTO PEDRO THAN ERIC RIGHT NOW?!?!!?




TL;DR: Was seeing a guy in the States before leaving for study abroad. Made brief commitment that I'd inform him if I hooked up with anybody. Hooked up with two guys abroad- failed to inform guy in the States. Many complications arise."
jtkpt,1,2011-08-24,Please Help - Pursue or not?,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jtkpt/please_help_pursue_or_not/,"
First, Some background info:

I work for a corporation, I am 19. I have a mid level management job, and I just got an intern, who reports to both me and my supervisor, one of the directors.

The intern is a daughter of one of the directors.

Her internship lasted a month, and I grew to like her quiet a bit, and I can tell she has a thing for me too, we flirt and touch a little here and there, send each other secret emails and share jokes, lunches, etc.

She goes back to school, a 3 hour drive away, in a week, and then the chances of me ever seeing her get very low, unless I ask her out, however I am holding back because:

A relationship with a full time college student, while I am working and going to school full time can be tricky as it is, but with the distance gap it might be impossible.

Her father plays a very high role in the company and it would be rather unprofessional.

It is unprofessional to date co-workers, and if it gets out it could be damaging to my career.

So...what would you guys do? How do i proceed?

TL; DR : Read it, its not too long.

jvhn8,5,2011-08-26,"Reddit - Losing my girlfriend/best friend of 3 1/2 years, seeking advice and help in any possible way",rogo0694,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jvhn8/reddit_losing_my_girlfriendbest_friend_of_3_12/,"Hello Reddit,

I am a 23 and my girlfriend is 23 as well and have spent the past year together in our home but did 2 1/2 years worth of long distance relationship.

So recently this past weekend my girlfriend of 3 1/2 + years has decided that she wanted to leave the apartment that we have leased together to go back home for a few days to figure out what she wants because she is confused about what she wants from work, her job and in life. Of course this makes me extremely upset to know that she wants to leave and get away from the home that we have built.

To give you all a backstory, I met my girlfriend in college our sophomore year and I began to know her as more than a friend, more or less my best friend and decided to ask her out a few days after her birthday. We spent every moment together in college from waking up together, going to lunch, having dinner and sleeping at each others apartments. At the end of the year I found out she had to return back to Florida (We went to school in Philadelphia) as our college was extremely expensive and she couldn't afford the payments so we decided to do long distance.

Sparing the long and dramatic details, we did the long distance relationship from Philadelphia all the way to Miami, FL without any trouble at all, waking up to calls from her and calling her, texting throughout the day and calling each other, calling each other at night, taking time from school to visit each other, selling some of my possessions to be with her as much as possible and being absolutely committed to each other. We talked about spending the rest of our lives together, getting married, and growing old with our own family. I got to meet her family and they absolutely adore me (especially her father and grandmother as they cannot stop talking about me) and she has met my family and spent time with each one of my family members.

So finally we both graduate from school, FIU for her and Philadelphia University from myself and we were both at each others graduations, then after my graduation I moved down with her to Miami for 3 months to work at a restaurant with her before we moved back to her families house in Tampa for 3 months. During that time I lived with her mother and father and her and started preparing for the next step in our lives and decided to move up to Cary , NC.

The first 3 months were rough because I couldn't find a job but in February I found an internship that has turned into a Full Time Front End Web Development Job and she is still working at Applebees in Brier Creek as a Server/Bar Tender (absolutely hating it due to the clientele and so forth). Now that I have a secure job and just bought my first car I thought that all would be going well and everything was perfect, there were no arguments, no fights, everything was perfect as we would live life in our little family with our 9 year old Chow Chow.

So now back to the top, recently this past Saturday she came home from a terrible day at work and started talking about how she wanted to head home for a few days to figure out what she wants and what she wants out of life. Of course this makes me upset and I honestly don't know how to react because I know she is upset at work and I have been trying to help her get a new job (She has a 4.0 from FIU and graduated in Hospitality Management so I wouldn't think she have a problem at all finding a managerial job of some sorts) but she says she doesn't know what she wants out of a job. So the next day she says her sister texted her and I checked the Phone and found another guys name in the cellphone and they have been texting each other back and forth (she met this guy at work and he is a 27-year old scumbag who got arrested for dealing and possession of drugs) and she says that it is nothing serious, they haven't done anything at all and that they are just friends (which of course doesn't sit well). They were supposed to meet for lunch and she said she was going to  tell me about it and gets defensive of the matter because I caught her in the act.

(The previous week she said she went out with some friends and didn't come home Monday night, went out late till 3 am on Thursday and then late on the Saturday when she said she was going out with her sister for dinner) - So makes me even more skeptical.

So this past week has been extremely hectic as Monday we decided to talk again and I asked her about the situation with this guy and I asked her if she values this relationship, she needs to delete this guy from her phone, remove the text messages and not communicate to him and she said she does value this relationship and loves me very much. But then tells me she still needs to figure out what she wants out of life and is very very confused.

The next day I decided to call her father (who is now here in NC) and detail him about the matter and her choices (as I respect him as an individual and what he has done for me to give me a home for 3 months in Florida with them and he considers me a son to him) and he pretty much belittles her on the phone, making her cry and come back to me apologizing for acting stupid and the decisions she has made. I comfort her and take care of her (because she also has a terrible cold and cough) and the past 2 days were going very well as we started communicating more again and laughing and acting normal.

But then last night I went to see her at work after I got off and this guy that she was chatting with was right at the bar with his friend chatting away with my girlfriend and she was acting all friendly around him, I didn't mind but kept my eye on it and then as we were waiting for the restaurant to close, I went to the bathroom and came back and saw her deleting text messages from this guy and my heart sank and just felt very deceived and hurt.

We got home and I asked her why she kept the phone number and she said she didn't know and apologizes, I told her that is was completely disrespectful and hurtful she kept texting him. I asked her if she is lying to me and if she has done anything with him and to be truthful and she said she hasnt at all, and I told her that if she is indeed lying she needs to move out this weekend. Which of course got her upset and felt threatened by my statement.

I have been with her for 3 1/2 years, doing everything and anything to be with her, staying up late for phone calls, cooking dinners for her, taking care of our dog, cleaning the apartment, taking care of her, working extra hours to be able to go out together, anything that you could imagine I have done, I have never deceived her, talked about her behind her back or done anything wrong to hurt her and tried being the best boyfriend I could possibly be.

With her father up here already he is going to talk to her about what she is doing and what she has been up to (as I have been keeping in contact with him)

But my question is for Reddit (and I do apologize for the lengthy story, details and everything around this) but I would like to know what I should do, what do you guys think? Is my girlfriend cheating on me behind my back and just lying to me to keep things afloat? Do I just dump her and move on with my life (as my career is truly important to me). I want to rekindle things and rebuild our relationship as she is my best friend and my soulmate and I truly dont know what happened or what I did wrong for this to happen? I just don't know what to do because I am alone in NC, she is all I have and I want this to work out and to be with her, to be happy with her, to grow old together and not lose the memories and time that we have spent together. 

Any and all help/advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated and I do appreciate anybody's time who sends me a reply, thank you all




TLDR : Girlfriend say she is confused, find guys name/text in her cellphone, dont want to lose my best friend of 3 1/2 years, seeking help on the matter!"

I'll start....,theCHAMPdotcom,sports,https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/jv520/who_are_your_favoriteleast_favorite_sports/,"I am a strong believer in sports announcers greatly increasing the sports viewing experience, as well as ruining it...I only watch frequently basketball and football...here is my list of favorites and least favorites...

Favorite:

Football: 
Jon Gruden-I seem to learn something about football every time I watch a sporting event he is calling
Al Michaels-Just a legend, olive oil voice, my football season would not be complete without hearing his play by play
Basketball:
Doug Collins:Have yet to see anyone who knows and can articulate basketball knowledge as well as him, I will watch a bad game to listen to his wisdom
Hubie Brown:Older, little sloppy at times, but still fun to listen to with his many many years in basketball

Least Favorite:
Joe Buck: Completely smug, ever since he lost his mind on Randy Moss for ""fake"" mooning the green bay crowd I never liked him, it was funny and he thought it was blasphemy.
Mike Tirico: He carries himself in a way that makes me think he thinks he is better than everyone else, nothing made me happier to hear that he was once in trouble for groping espn interns and finding out how creepy he truly is.

Hello there! going to be playing Diablo 3? Well wouldn't it be swell to play Diablo 3 alongside an infamous group of fellow diehard fans right from the start who've waited years and years to once again spend hours upon hours searching for killer loot, slay hordes of deamons and their minions, learning the most efficient dueling strategies and figuring out the fastest ways to level new characters up!! Well I have a dream or vision if you will.. in diablo 2 LOD I had the privlage of being the founder of an awesome good mannered dueling clan both skill wise and people wise these guys were amazing if not some of the very best efriends a guy cud as for, we were just a bunch of great people to be around. I soon began to take a very active part in the GM dueling scene on escnl realm as my clan got better and began to host and moderate a channel where all the best and most enthusiastic good mannered players would hangout setup gm team duels or look for friendly people to help them get better at dueling/pvp or even with leveling up and questing. Well now Diablo 3 is right around the corner and iv had about 7years of continued growth in the esports field/world. Iv now been the leader of a new gaming clan for 3 years we've done various online tournamnets competed in about 3 local lan tournies and have kinda been very spread out and inconsistent as far as the tittles we play go. The games we've pursued as a team are cs 1.6 and source, tf2, dota, LoL, HoN, all COD tiitles for xbox360, Halo again all of them, Fifa 2011, Smash bros brawl, and the biggest and most played game Starcraft 2. While we love to play a load of games and enjoy eachothers company togeather in all of them we've grown the most and been far more serious about starcraft2 then all the rest combined! Currently HivGaming has 6 mid or better masters players on NA and a lone top 30 EU masters player. While we've had limited success as a pro sc2 squad we've all greatly improved together. Were currently working on setting up a more stringent practice schedual, begin casting our inhouse games myself (iv been practicing for MLG) and a weekly HiveGaming king of the hill series, were going to try and do pro player interviews at MLG and other live events that im attending, possibly do for the newbs day where we help out lesser players. Anyways as you can see the SC2 teams established were just refining its game and build orders ;). Just 2 months ago now another huge thing happened for my video gaming career, I was taken on at Major League Gaming as an intern to help develop and produce content on Starcraft2. As the first two months flew by I began doing more and more and covering more and more game tittles since I already knew all about games and im a fairly good jurnalist MLG grew more and more confident in my abilities. Now my final year of college is coming up on Monday and iv been asked to continue on at MLG and do as much work as I can get out. Anyways I can't tell you guys how estatic I am about this position and it gets even better... im going to be the frontman of sorts for MLGs coverage of Diablo 3 so im going to be streaming myself playing from the office, showcasing pvp matches as much as possible and my greatest hope is to get a tournament going that uses the gamebattles ladder system to choose the competitors or something along those lines. What matters is getting some coverage of Diablo 3 arena pvp'ing!!

DIABLO3 SQuAD REQUIREMENTS and FAQ
~Hive's d3 team will consist of two branches when it comes down to recruiting and organizing the players in a way that best represents the entire clan. One will be the PvP branch, who are the veteran battle tested and proven duelers who will represent the clan in official clan wars in the arena. The other will be the Corporation or Corp branch, this will consist of players who know Diablo games like they went to college for it and plan on being the richest, all characters max level best gear kinda players. The reasoning behind this is to attract a diverse group of amazing diablo 3 players who are cool people to play with, having players at the very top of these two branches will make doing anything in diablo3 very easy and fast for players im the clan whether you pvp or pve.
~have a desire to see Diablo 3 be taken as far as it possibly can as an esport event
~create videos on everything we can cover that showcases both pvp intensity and how to kill so and so boss tutorials
~a desire to always better yourself and those around you
~be active as possible on the HiveGaming forums and website because were a team that supports cross games and our fellow mates who repp us on the other games need our support ;)

Looking ahead to the coming months Hives goal is to have squads for the following games established (this list was hard to come up with and is now confirmed and set in stone as they say in england) SC2, Diablo 3, DoTA2, CoD MW4 360 and Halo4. These games are going to be some of the biggest titles to date and all showcase amazing potential as esports or are already at the center of them pro-gaming scene! Its by no means my goal to just let the rifraft in or going on some crazy recruiting rampage. Myself and the current roaster of HiveGaming currently number 27, were all very close, well aware of how much work it takes to get something like this going and everyone contributes as much as they can and where they can. I believe a gaming teams primary focus is to be successful obviously this refers to winning tournaments and being number one on the ladder, but that only comes with having a group of ambitious players who feel comfortable with their friends and people around them. Therefore Hives primary goal is to be the best possible learning center we can be for our players so they can improve and refine their natural knack and skill level for playing the game. Hive has a new website in development but if you have questions comments or suggestions visit www.teamhive.org and message an admin. Currently were super into competing in any event or tournament we can get into. I could really use a member knowledgable in media and forum editing and posting and were always looking for article writers. As a team were always growing and rarely have we had people quit. We have a mumble channel however were upgrading it to 100slots and changing the company that hosts it. Hive gaming is a blast to be a part of so let's hear what you've got and tell me why you'd make a good addition to the team!

I was depressed because there were a lot of bad things happening in my life at the time (Death in the Family, Grades, Unhealthy Habits, and Girlfriend Issues...). I recognized the path that I was starting to head down and realized I had to do something about it.

Through the course of the summer, I was working 40+ hours a week for a man who was more than inspiring in helping me change my ways. He sat me down once a week for about an hour to give me advice and ask me how I was doing. Along with this, I changed my eating habits and starting to lose weight quickly. With this weight loss, doing well at my internship, and reconnecting with my family, I was able to overcome the depressed feeling I had and become happy again.

3 months later, I am 239lbs, have a great support system with my friends and family, am doing well in school, and have the most self confidence that I can ever remember having. I wanted to thank Reddit because there were a few posts that I read that made me think that I could do it. It wasn't easy, but I am proud of myself and am continuing my journey of self-improvement.

jus8e,6,2011-08-26,How will I know if teaching English is right for me?,Yiehtk,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/jus8e/how_will_i_know_if_teaching_english_is_right_for/,"I began learning Korean a few weeks ago and have found it to be a lot more fun than I expected. Initially I went into it hoping to gain some fluency to better understand the dramas I watch, but was surprised by how much fun it was to learn the words and write in hangul. Even though it is a hard language, I have never experienced this much joy in the introduction of any other language I have attempted. When I tried to learn Spanish and French I was getting nowhere fast, and with Chinese and Japanese it felt almost hopeless, but with Korean it is like a rocket is racing back and forth in my brain making all the right trips and managing not to be an uncontrolled explosion.

Because I had always wanted to go abroad and I knew one way to go about that was to teach English, I was wondering what considerations should I take into account in order to make this decision? I am an English major with three more years left of school. I have only a fuzzy idea as to what career I would pursue after college, but I am looking into copywriting or something similar as it would allow my creative side to flourish. I will probably try to do internships and take career-oriented English classes (my school seems to have a few) so I feel confident I would get a job in my field. But really, any job that would net me 40K a year on average is good. I want a family one day and I need to be able to provide for them.

The major problem is that if I were to go abroad, that would be at least a year where I am not in whatever field I intend to go into. I would need to know if that would be a hit on my employment chances that I could not afford to take before I make that decision. How would an English teacher combat this problem? Does their experience abroad look good on a resume? Is it possible for me to work pro-bono (if side-jobs are illegal on a visa) doing English copy? How would maintained contacts in the field be possible over such a long distance?

I have heard that the cost of living is favorable with the wage and allows English teachers to save money. I am going to be about 30-40K in debt by graduation and if I could have a job that gives me at least $500 a month towards loans I would feel really secure because I would not be in the hole. If I could save more, that would be a godsend, because I would really like to pay off school within five years rather than ten, otherwise I would need to make 60K-80K after years five to seven in order to meet my financial and life goals. This is why I am leaning towards copywriting since as a field it pays better than others (but is also more difficult to get into). I have no idea what kind of job my future spouse would have, so I have to be prepared to be the breadwinner.

More importantly, what does South Korea look for in an English teacher? What qualities would give me an edge over another candidate? How could I best serve my students and make their experience with me top-notch?

If I am going to make this decision, what more do I need to learn over the next three years? What is a general timeline I should follow? How would I know if teaching English in South Korea is for me?"

jweb9,2,2011-08-27,Friend with Benefit faux pas has finally happened...and it's destroying my self confidence.  What should I do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jweb9/friend_with_benefit_faux_pas_has_finally/,"Hey okay, I am a 26 year old female and this issue concerns my 24 year old male FWB. 

I met said male over a year ago.  Before he came into my life I was on the verge of emerging from a two year, sexless, self-confidence melt down.  We met, quickly became friends and began a two month flirting and sexting affair.  When I finally asked the big brave question about what we were doing, he said that he was only going to be in my country for a year (internship and he's from Australia) and there was no point in starting a relationship.  He said that he found me attractive, loved my company and just wanted to have some fun.

I agreed as I really thought I could handle this situation.  I was not initially physically attracted to this guy, and it was his pursuit of me that eventually changed my mind.  There was a little bit of a rocky start to this situation as after our first few sexual encounters, he kinna freaked out and said that he didn't think it was such a good idea as he didn't want to mess up and end up loosing a good friend.

However, as the months went on the mutual attraction won out and more often than not we ended back home together after drunken nights out with our friends.  This 'arrangement' was never really organised and always seemed to happen after we had been drinking.  In between such encounters we became great friends, hanging out all the time just chatting and having laughs - we even went on holiday with some friends together.  He has since said that me and one of his male friends are his two best friends outside of Australia.

Given that this arrangement was never really 'official' there was no talk of exclusivity.  I have slept with one guy and kissed a few others since we started sleeping together.  I knew that he had too, it didn't really bother me - but I really wasn't interested in the details. 

However recently it has come to my attention that he has been seeing one girl fairly regularly.  He is aware that I know of her, but has never spoken to me about her directly.  I have heard him say to our other friends that there is nothing in it, that it's just a fuck buddy arrangement.

And now it's official, I'm jealous and feeling slightly insecure about the whole thing.  For one thing, he seems to go over to hers on random nights when he's not been drinking.  It seems that he only ever wants to have sex with me when he's drunk.  I also know that she is very slim (he described her as almost being 'too skinny') whereas I am, not huge, but of the curvier persuasion (which he always told me he prefers).  

We had sex three nights ago after a night out, and I know that he's at her place tonight totally sober.  

I do have feelings for this guy, and I have been pretty good at suppressing them until now.  I had a huge battle with self confidence previously, and because of him I have improved so so much.  I just hope that he doesn't undo the good work he has done so far.

He leaves to go back to Oz in two months, and this is how I see my options:

1.  Tell him how I feel (to what purpose though...?)
2.  Tell him that him seeing another girl bothers me for the above reasons, and not just because I want him all for myself.  
3.  Ask him why we only ever have sex when he's drunk? 
4.  Cut him out of my life before it hurts even more.
5.  Open to suggestions....??

I know it's a long one, but I'd really appreciate any honest advice.  If you want to ask me anything else...feel free."
jw5hb,34,2011-08-27,"Not really stunning progress, but wanted to share (280-230lbs, ~1 year)",[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/jw5hb/not_really_stunning_progress_but_wanted_to_share/,"It's been about a year since I started trying to exercise and eat better, and while I haven't made as much progress as I'd like, I suppose it's a good time to check in.  I'm 5 foot 11, male, started at 280 lbs and am currently at 230 lbs.  I want to get below 200.

[Before and during pic](http://i.imgur.com/yz9NT.jpg) (NSFL warning for stretch marks and floppy belly, also quickly thrown-together attempt at overlay)

I started last year right before the start of my senior year of university.  I had been staying in my grandma's basement without a job and had really just been continuing ruining my body and state in life like I had been for so long in my life.  I was really depressed and I think even a bit suicidal.  

When school started up, I had the help of some really encouraging friends to go with me to the campus gym 4-5 days a week for about 90 minutes each time, about half and half on exercise bike / elliptical, and weight lifting.  Because I had an apartment with a kitchen (and thus wasn't on the campus meal plan) and without other roommates who would buy food communally (thus exposing me to habits that may work for them but not for me), I was able to choose what I bought and control my eating pretty well.  

After I graduated I've been staying with my parents for the summer, and it's been harder as I only go 3 days a week with them (but they have a nice Lifetime Fitness membership) and they're really in the habit of buying foods that are temptingly bad.  I've really only lost about 5 pounds since coming home.

I think that doing exercise and watching what I eat has been helping me beyond just being healthier and losing weight.  Before I was much more of an aimless shut-in who feared graduating and entering the real world.  Now I'm feeling more confident and less self-conscious.  I just successfully completed a good summer internship that used my computer science degree, and in a week I'm heading to China to be an English teacher for a year.  I think I'm starting to turn my life around."
jvyji,2,2011-08-27,How long should I wait?,smr333,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jvyji/how_long_should_i_wait/,"Basically this could be the dumbest decision ever since my ex is a Redditor, but I'm taking that chance. If you see this, sorry, but my friends suck at advice and it's 2am. First time poster and obvious throwaway.

We have known each other since the 6th grade. He was actually my first boyfriend ever (Dated for 2 days when we were 11). We became friends when highschool started and kept our actual feelings from each other locked away. Dated other people and both had serious relationships. Senior year I admitted my feelings to him and we were together for almost 3 years. He broke up with me last week.

This man is the love of my life. He is everything I want in a man. I'm not someone to throw around ""marriage"" and ""I want to have your babies"", so I meant these things when we both discussed them. Our relationship was bliss. We had our issues and rough patches like everyone else, but I can honestly say that every single day, I was happy with him. We have the same sense of humor. A typical night for us was browsing Reddit together, watching shit on Netflix, me cooking him dinner and then great sex before cuddling up next to one another. We didn't live together, but I spent a lot of time at his place. The sex was amazing. Our conversations were wonderful, just like the conversations we had over AIM back in highschool. Our families got along. We would lie in bed and talk about our ""wedding colors"". He would do ANYTHING for me, even running out to get me Gatorade at 2am because I was having a ridiculous period craving. And likewise, I did everything for him. I worshiped him because he deserved it so; he was such a hard working, ambitious man and I admire him so much. I practically got off on cooking for him and serving him because I love making him happy (I'm a service oriented submissive - yes, we were BDSM folk - so keep that in mind before I sound too good to be true, lol)

Our relationship sounds like one big honeymooon phase I guess, but I assure you it was not the case. We fought. We disagreed. But what I loved was that we always were honest and worked it out. I had friends outside our relationship, and we made it a point to spend at least one night a week with friends, usually more. He has a great job and is doing great in school. I have an internship and solid outlets outside our relationship. We had a balance of together-ness and healthy solitude/interactions with others. I was so happy. He told my parents he wanted to marry me. 

I describe our relationship and how wonderful it is so that maybe you could understand my shock when he broke up with me. Just a few days before he had taken me on a date to see a movie and was talking about travel plans for our 3 year anniversary. Then it was ""I'm letting you go."" over the phone. I was shocked. I guess I still am.

He has a lot of suppressed emotional issues from his childhood involving guilt, anger and resentment for not being allowed to be a kid. He had a lot of pressure put on him at a young age for family reasons. His entire life, he's pleased other people and taken care of them. He rarely puts himself first, even when I beg him to. I've known it was an issue with him. I always encouraged him to do what HE wanted, not me. I wanted him to not feel afraid to make decisions and override me. The times when he did were the happiest in our relationship. I wanted him to feel empowered, not like the child without a voice he used to be. 

He started going to therapy a few weeks ago and it really helped him realize all he had suppressed. He was making great progress. I know that this breakup is a result of him figuring out who he is; when he left me, he said that he needed time to sort out his emotions, figure out who he is and work on himself. I respect that and I want him to be happy, even if it isn't with me. We have spoken once since our breakup and I do not plan on initiating contact with him. When he is ready, he can talk to me.

He did not give an answer as to whether or not we'll be back together. He says he doesn't know and doesn't want me to wait for him.

I feel like I don't have a choice. I love this man and I want to be with him, so I want to wait. I am a strong person and I can pull myself through this. I know that I will survive with or without him - I just WANT to survive with him. I want him to find himself and find happiness, but I'd really like for him to share that happiness with me one day. I've decided that I'm ""waiting"" until December, and then I'm moving on for good and leaving him in the past. 

My parents dated 8 years and broke up multiple times, but got back together and have been married almost 30 years quite happily. This gives me hope that losing someone can show you how much you truly want them. All I can hope is that he truly wants me.

TLDR; How long is worth waiting for the love of your life?"
jwpaf,131,2011-08-27,My parents will never be proud of me. ,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jwpaf/my_parents_will_never_be_proud_of_me/,"Well, today was an eye-opening day. I guess I realized I have to stop trying to see inkling of pride for me in their eyes. It's simply never going to happen. 

I will admit my faults here, I used to be a full time stoner and I made my mom's life hell as a teenager. when I graduated high school, it didn't seem like I was going to do anything with my life. 

It has been a few years now, I am no longer a stoner, I have been a very successful real estate agent, but then decided this was not for me. I then went into Public relations and communications and am now loving what I do. Of course I don't make as much money as I used to, but I'm okay with that. 

Yesterday was, in my opinion, my most successful night yet. About 2 months ago, my boss gave me a project I was to work on and kinda let me do whatever I wanted with it. I was supposed to raise money for a charity. Yesterday was the event, a fashion show that attracted many people and my interns and I along with many volunteers and caterers managed to make it happen. Long story short, I got a promotion and I couldn't have been happier. Yesterday was my moment and I couldn't believe how far I have come.   

Tonight, my mom basically told me I needed to get a real job. She says this to every job I've had. She didn't even bother to ask me what was the outcome of my project, and didn't bother showing up even if I invited her. 

I didn't say anything because I unfortunately live with them (my bf and I broke up and I moved out of our apartment - shit happens) and am grateful for them taking me in and letting me stay here. I always help her when I'm home and help her with money because they don't have a lot... 

I do things for myself and I always have, but I'm not going to lie, I wish my parents would be proud of me, just once. They do it with my sister all the time, and sometimes I want the same treatment. Just once. 


EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for their kindness and support. You all made me realize something important last night: I just have to keep doing my own thing and stop pleasing my parents. I woke up with morning with a new attitude about them and that's thanks to your advice. I had breakfast with my parents and asked them for their respect and that if they weren't able to do that for me, that I wouldn't be able to pay their bills anymore. That pretty much shut them up. Thank you, redditors, for showing me I have the upper hand here. "

jy52c,1,2011-08-29,Need advice for a 21 year old (me) at a crossroads in his life (X-Post from askreddit),LostAccountingStuden,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/jy52c/need_advice_for_a_21_year_old_me_at_a_crossroads/,"Sorry for the long post!! I'm pouring everything into this one giant post.

**Background**
I live in Central, NJ (yea I know) and am an Accounting student currently attending a ""target""-4 year university in Central, NJ for Accounting students. About 3-4 months before I was scheduled to graduate in May 2011 (with 122 credits, not the 150 required to earn the CPA license), the idea of studying a health profession (doctor or pharmacy) popped into my head. (I haven't taken one pre-health class: Gen Chem, Gen Bio etc)

At first I just brushed it off hoping the idea would leave, because I assumed almost every college student goes through the period of ""do I want to do this for the rest of my life"" phase. However, the idea didn't leave. It stayed and ultimately influenced me into cancelling my graduation in order to try both science summer classes (at the same time) this past summer of 2011.

You can assume what happens next. I had to drop both Gen Chem 1 and Gen Bio 1 classes (don't laugh please) because I was inadequately prepared for 8 credits in one summer session and refused to earn a C in intro classes such as Gen Bio/Chem.


**Modern Dilemma**
After 4 years of studying Accounting, I'm torn apart as to whether or not to work towards becoming a doctor (requiring the science classes at a 4 year University) which carries with it the hard work and satisfaction of curing sick people, or studying pharmacy (option at a 2 year college) which allows me to study the material which I enjoy. Medical school prereqs can be done in one year (difficult but not impossible) plus the MCAT.  Pharmacy prereqs requires 2 years no matter what plus most schools require the PCAT.



**FAQ + Answers**
""If you truly do not like Accounting, do whatever you enjoy because it's your life, not your parents'.""
I am literally 50/50 torn apart, and feeling the pressure from my parents to get a job to earn $ after 4 years. I would like to use my Accounting degree to earn some money.


""Don't switch careers just for the money""
I won't lie and say money had nothing to do with it, but I am looking more for the next-best enjoyable career, that comes with a financial peace of mind resulting from the unstable stock market (no I do not own stock).


""Businesses always need Accountants no matter how bad the economy gets*
That may be true to some extent, but it seems that those accountants that are ""always in demand"", are those with years and years of experience or those recent graduates with Cum Laude+ GPA's (recruiters know how they earned those GPA's and choose to ignore it). Not as much for those trying to obtain entry-level employment into the ""Big 4"" firms with no responses.


*The Opportunity costs are Enormous! Are you sure you're willing to give up your Accounting education to go 180 degrees into a completely field?*
Trust me, I'm aware of the amount of pressure I've received for even mentioning this idea in the first place.


*What if it doesn't work out? Will you go back to your Accounting degree with years of lost experience?*
Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but with my 122 credits, and no job offers after 4 years, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Everyone else seems to be getting job offers with almost relative ease.


*Once you pass the CPA exam, you'll be getting offers no problem*
Under current rules, a candidate, in addition to 150 credits, must have one year of experience working with a CPA firm to earn the license. That cannot be achieved without a job.


*Everyone's struggling right now. You're just not trying hard enough*
I'm aware my assertiveness may not be as strong as I should've been, but even in today's economy most students that learn a ""skills"" major such as accounting, engineering, pharmacy etc., seem to be getting offers without great difficulty. Even internships were extremely difficult to obtain.


*You've been influenced by someone/something or have been hanging out with the wrong group of people*
This actually holds merit because within my nationality, a lot of people are pre-med/dental, pharmacy, engineering etc. I only pray that there's no discrimination from firms against an accountant who doesn't fit the norm. If I were to switch majors, I would most likely receive support of people within my nationality, because that's what people do in the real world.


Hopefully I've covered everything and am eager to read everyone's response! =)"
jxsg4,4,2011-08-29,[Seeking]/[Share]Urgently need a place to live until Christmas in Palo Alto or nearby.  Short term would also be helpful.,Waterwoo,SFBayHousing,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayHousing/comments/jxsg4/seekingshareurgently_need_a_place_to_live_until/,"Hi Reddit,

**Bit about me**:  I'm a 23 year old Canadian university student temporarily in the Peninsula between now and Christmas to do an internship at Facebook, and I need a place to live, as I can't afford to stay in a hotel forever.  


I'm pretty quiet and laid back, don't smoke or do drugs, don't have any pets ( but don't mind if you do), and drink socially/occasionally. Aside from Reddit, in my spare time I like to go to the gym, hike, and watch movies.

Because Facebook provides 3 meals a day + snacks, I definitely will not hog your kitchen.


** Money**: 
I know housing is pretty expensive here but I hope my expectations are reasonable.  I am willing to pay up to $1200 for a room, up to $1500 for a studio/ 1 bedroom, and up to around $3000 for a 3 bedroom.  If you normally only lease for longer terms but are willing to do 4 months for slightly higher rent, I would also consider that.

**What I'm looking for**:

I'm fairly flexible which is why I put both seeking and share.    In either case I prefer somewhere relatively close to my work place near Stanford, but could go roughly as far as Sunnyvale or San Carlos for the right place.  I do want to stay on this side of the bay, and prefer places with good public transit (i.e. Caltrain) though I do have a car if necessary.

I have a strong preference towards places that are:
a) Furnished   b) Have ASAP move in times, and c) Let me lease for 4 months.
 
For my own place, I want either a studio or 1 bedroom, or a 3 bedroom/ 2+ bathroom place as I have two people that potentially want to split a place.

If sharing / just renting a room, I would prefer something with my own bathroom/ private entrance, but it's not a deal breaker.

Please help me out, or I'll be sleeping on a couch at work.  Fortunately I hear they do have showers there..."

**Languages:**

Python, C/C++, Java, Javascript (ExtJS/jQuery/Prototype/YUI), PHP, Bash, SQL, ASP, .Net, KML/KMZ, WMS, XPath, HTML, CSS

**Technologies:**

MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache 2.0, Git/SVN, Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, Gentoo), OSX, Windows, Solaris, oAuth, Samba, VirtualBox/ESXi/VMWare, Android, Google Earth Server/Fusion, Mongo, OpenStreetMaps, TCP/IP, Networking, Asterisk/Trixbox

**Education:**

Ohio University, Athens, OH
Computer Science, B.S.

**Experience: **

•	Organized the development of an emergency planning and response system built with Google Earth, KML/KMZ, ExtJS, PostgreSQL, and PHP. Released the initial effort in four days in response to the earthquake in Haiti. Provided one of the first applications to allow the sharing of data between citizens and the government.

•	Collaborated with a small team to design a custom PHP/JS framework including authentication, access control lists, a REST-like API, MVC, and more. The framework is now the base of all geospatial projects and has allowed for rapid application prototyping.

•	Assisted in the planning and development of a JSON based cell phone widget provisioning application. Reduced the code base for the widgets by focusing on OOP concepts and eliminating duplicated code creating a solid base for future upgrades.

•	Setup and maintained a server for application demoing and testing with automatic deployments and dynamic virtual hosts. Dramatically decreased the lag time between creating a product release and moving it to a production server.

•	Updated the user interface and refactored frontend and backend code for a near real time device tracking system. Migrated the system to the Zend Framework to provide a database abstraction layer as well as base classes for many other common functions.

•	Created the first Android based cell phone tracker for a GPS tracking system as a proof of concept.

•	Developed the first oAuth/Google Earth API based system to tie into an unreleased Google product. The initial concept was available online four hours after the requirement was received.

•	Optimized a Python based system for comparing hundreds of thousands of names and addresses to a compilation of very different government databases. Decreased the system run-time by over 1000% as well as reducing complexity and errors.

•	Developed a Python/ExtJS web application used to determine coverage based upon strict Medicare rules. The application replaced a desktop application and brought access to a much wider customer base.

•	Researched genetic algorithms, 3D mapping, machine vision, and other algorithms.

•	Trained and managed an intern that was later brought on as a full time employee. Utilized the intern as a resource on multiple projects that eventually became the cornerstone of the web-based offerings.

•	Collaborated with the open source community on project LCD4Linux to develop a plugin for Asterisk that displays telephone trunk status and statistics.

•	Implemented a system to maintain positive control of computer equipment. Prepared the equipment for redistribution or donation.

•	Launched a project to help control the distribution of expensive software. Developed a cheap hardware and software solution to match the project requirements."

jympq,0,2011-08-29,A story about S2,Wilthorse,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jympq/a_story_about_s2/,"Bye HoN, after finally getting the information out of a old friend Whom i taught how to play hon{his name will not be disclosed due to the ""Non-Disclosure Agreement""}. He was a small time coder and got lucky landing a full salaried job working at S2.(By fixing the little things: aka the ability to resell the hatchet in under 15 seconds) DeForest was the personal demise to his job. After not only making him relocate from South Carolina to California, the offices in San Francisco closed shop. Forcing him to relocate again, to the head office in kalamazoo Michigan.

After spending several months at the offices, coming in early to get work done in order to leave earlier to help his wife find a job in Michigan(The days he didnt leave early he ended up being the last one to leave the office).As time goes by He noticed around the offices massive amount of drama, harassment, &amp; Parties [using company funds]. Now my friend is a very shy guy, he doesn't like confrontation and unnecessary slander. Apparently being a nice guy and avoiding office drama slowly became the underlying cause for his drafted pink slip. Employee's slowly decreasing conversation with him, his work falling on deaf ears and eventually being completely overlooked. My friend being the intelligent person he was knew that the end was near...

After a big car accident scare a few weeks later, my friend had to call in to work as his wife was in the hospital. Apparently it was just what the CEO's were looking for to send him packing. The next day, my friend came into work early to make up lost time for the previous day when he was called into Marc's office with Malikens favorite suck up next to him Nome. Even with hospital notes, an early call in, &amp; large amounts of of unpaid free time my friend put into the game DeForest fired him...at a loss for words with both him and his wife jobless, they were stuck in Michigan for quite some time before being able to move back with his wife...into his wife's mother in law's in SC.

Still today, he cannot find a job. S2 refuses to acknowledge themselves as a solid reference for my friend. Now he is back in a trade school, brushing up and learning new coding and graphics design while being an un-paid intern for an indie company.


Too make a long story short, S2 Financially Released (Fired) a decent amount of employee's who actually made a difference for this game. You come to notice little bugs and fixes take several months to accomplish now. The CEO's of S2 find no money in; Balance, Community, Game-play Ethics, &amp; or your opinions.

Too put it blunt and straight from mouth to word: The S2 office doesn't give a sh1t about a single one of you. Not me, Not you, Not anyone . If luck is high on a given day someone from the office may glance the forums for infringing posts such as this. Other then that, S2 calls the forum &amp; the people who reside in it: A joke, not worth taking seriously, full of trolls &amp; children, And a pocket book with a Zip Code &amp; Alias.

[This does not include moderators, remote developers, &amp; GM's. They dont get paid to do what they do, They do a damn good job and their jobs are fueled by pure passion for a game so corrupt. P.S: Thank you mod's/RD's/GM's for all your hard work]
Dream heroes are nothing but a list of idea's S2 can use to develop their own heroes, taking bits and ideas from heroes that never see the light of popularity. The hero coding team consists of 2 people, who also fill the roles of graphic design &amp; balance [positions they could get paid for individually at various gaming studios.]

Contrary to popular and ignorant belief: S2 is not going bankrupt, in the hole or even remotely close to seeing red. The RETAIL release of Heroes of Newerth alone netted the company over 3.6-4.5 Million dollars. Although the average S2 Employee salary 1 to 1 1/2 years ago was 60-120k a year. S2 nearly 1/2ed their staff from retail release.

Too put things even more into picture, the release of HoN 2.0 /w the Item Shop has netted them x12(1,200%) of their net retail gain. Heroes of Newerth is doing very very well. Playing it along that EA is a desperate measure to keep the game afloat. While the cost of hosting just 1 server gets close to a grand. The daily sales of $10 hero SKINS and $30 ANNOUNCERS are keeping their pocket books full and their rims spinning.


Now for the information that will probably be so shocking, so utterly appalling, so ignorantly greedy. That i will be instantly called a lier and full of sh1t.

Quote:
In a few months time, S2 will be announcing/releasing an expansion for Heroes of newerth. In this expansion S2 will be littering you with a new client. The expansion will cost an estimated value of $15 to S20 USD. In between the period of now and then, S2 is marketability preparing legacy users with Early Access by giving them the process of ""Purchasing for the use of a hero"".

The core ideal with this expansion is to bring legacy players at the same level with previous free to play users. S2's speculation is to remove legacy players ownership of all the playable heroes and bring them to the same level as free to play users. Although everyone will have the ability to play an endless amount of games, you will have to purchase every hero with the only exception being that you will not have to re-purchase skins.
TL;DR: S2 estimates a profit of over S200 per account holder, essentially this is nothing for League of Legends has been doing this from the start but S2 has and always will show a pattern of deception. Gearing up and getting as much out of your pocketbook as possible before the release of DotA2 and the declaration of bankruptcy is filed to grab what they can and get out free as a bird. Leaving you with a client, an empty wallet, and a ruptured anus.


Take this post how you will, flame it all you want, call me a lier and a troll. But i am cordially leaving this game behind me and never looking back. It has been nothing but 2 long years of disappointment, anguish, &amp; frustration.

I hope the rest of you find solace somewhere, and may it not be in the arms of Brazilian trolls and broken hearts.

Best regards,
Omerta - A disappointed customer

jyl7r,2,2011-08-29,In need of some help,soma-,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/jyl7r/in_need_of_some_help/,"Hello anyone who finds the time to read all of this because I'll warn you right now I'm going to be writing quite a bit of shit thats been on my mind to whom I don't feel I have anyone in my life currently to ask for advice or even just get this off of my chest. 

I'm a 22 year old male from Canada and I currently feel quite depressed at the thought of my current and future situation. I know it's easy to look at life in a negative way but up until around a year ago I was extremely positive about everything in my life and about myself. I went to school for advertising in college and when I was in High-school I studied Fine Arts.  I've been athletic all of my life competing in some pretty competitive soccer and hockey. I love golfing and I'm a white upper middle classed child. I've had two serious relationships in my life and I keep in contact with both of the girls I had relationships with (one for 3 years and 9 months the other for a year and a half). 

The reason I feel depressed about my current situation is because as of late I haven't done much with my life. It's seems easy conceptually to go out there and get shit done but I just have absolutely no motivation to do so. I dropped out of college with one semester left to complete my program because I no longer agreed morally and ethically with advertising. I love being creative but to me it seems unpractical to make a living out of making art (although I one day plan on having an art gallery, but that's after I have a solid foundation. career etc.). 

My ex left me about 5 months ago because of how downhill things seem to be going for me. I don't need and nor am I looking for someone to help me bare the weight of my problems because I feel that for the first time in my life I should deal with things myself. I have a job as a mover because I'm too lazy to go out there and create a portfolio and look for an internship somewhere. I pay rent but my jobs hours are so scarce at times that I have trouble balancing my social life and my responsibilities to pay rent to my parents (I think they are doing it to teach me a life lesson rather than need the money because I know how much they make). 

I smoke weed and drink beer in moderation however not so much as of late. I started smoking when I was 14, and the same goes to drinking, but don't get me wrong I didn't do it all of the time, it was just myself and 4 other childhood friends whom all decided it was time to experiment and wanted to do it together. I've known these guys seemingly my entire life and to this day we're great friends. Unfortunately I feel kind of trapped by them sometimes. I have a lot of friends because I live in a large city (Toronto) but they people I always make sure I keep in touch with. The thing is 3 of them smoke pot at least thee times a day, which is fine but when I hang out with them it's fairly difficult to not smoke up. 

Everyday I go home from work or I wake up at 1-2PM because I had no work, I come online and watch youtube, search reddit and go on facebook. I then either go get high with my friends, drink with them or deal with the girls I can see myself getting involved with. 

Recently I had a thing with this girl, I met her about 5 months back one drunken night, I was shit faced with my two buddies and basically I was jokingly insulting them and vice versa making us all laugh like we always do. She thought I was funny and nice so she added me to f book. I never spoke to her after that. About two weeks ago it was my b day and the day before I was going to go out I decided I wasn't going to have a big event like I planned to, but she randomly messages me on facebook. I didn't even remember her so it was pretty much a stranger messaging me, she looked pretty hot in her pics so I went out with her and another close friend of mine. We danced, had a good night and ended up making out in her bed (no sex, didn't push it). The next day I remember that my other friend whom I had originally met her with told me he was banging her back in college so I figured the proper thing to do would be to ask him if it was cool if I pursued this.

I did so and he said ""ya bud no problem go for it good luck"" in a nutshell. We went out a second night, things were going great she was texting me and calling me all the time, but I just had this lingering feeling that I should ask again so I did. I called him up, this time he said the exact same thing but I could tell in his voice he didn't seem to be giving me the whole story. I texted him later and he said they dated for a bit, he hated her etc. and said I have absolutely no problems with you going for her at all. I figured since he was a guys guy he would probably want to hear me say this, so i texted it. ""ya man I'll just go for a one night stand"". Keep in mind, I've been friends with this guy for 9 years and he hangs out with my and my friends I've known for 17 years. 

The next thing I know the girl says we have to talk. He showed her the texts in his jealousy and fucked me big time, but never once had he told me they dated before that series of text messages, and even then he never specified how long and he had only lead me to believe that he hated her and she wasn't anything to him. 

I basically spent the entire night the next time I saw her explaining that I wasn't that kind of guy (truthfully. I've never had a one night stand because I've never been someone who was down with fucking a random chick potentially getting an std). She told me they dated 9 months on and off, he was very jealous when he was with her. When she originally added me he would try to delete me off of her facebook and shit (keep in mind I never once tried to contact her and nor had she tried to contact me). When she contacted me it was about a month after they split.

Now I don't know if she did this to fuck with his head. The variables I do know are this.

1. She came across as nothing but a pretty, smart, fun nice girl to be with
2. She seemed very down to earth (told me her past etc.)
3. I never expected this from my friend ever, I asked him on 3 separate occasions -.-
4. I now look like a fucking asshole

Now she still texts me probably once a day or every other day. I'll get a random call after her work or at 2 in the morning. I think I'm fucked regardless because it used to be a lot more frequent and I don't have a good financial situation to take her out or anything regardless of what happens. 

I never look for girls they usually end up falling into my lap because I don't like the chase, I'm too lazy and don't like the way society tries to dictate things in that way. When I go out to a bar, I don't buy girls drinks unless they are my friends and I don't want to fuck them. I dance, I have a good time and I go home (or sometimes if they are hot and I'm really interested in them I'll kiss em').

This is why I'm in a shitty mood and feel stuck in a hole.

My education is being wasted. I don't have money to pay for more and I need a new job but it's fucking hard to find one that pays above minimum with 40 hours due to the seemingly slow recovery from our national economical crisis. I smoke too much weed and drink too much booze now. I smoke cigarettes when I'm stressed, drunk or high and I don't like that. I'm knowledgeable in some trades because my dads a foreman, he owned his own business for 20 years and is now some big shot at a hardwood flooring company, basically reports to the owner only. My parents think I'm fucking up big time which I am. I want to want to do things but I just can't seem to do it. This chick only adds to my problems because I've just potentially lost a good friend over her, and I don't even get her at the end of the day. This is causing ripples in my friend community. I'm not financially stable enough to move out (I want to). 

That's a lot of dogshit to read and I actually don't expect anyone to complete this boring story of my life. 

If you have any advice other than get off your ass and do shit (because thats the obvious choice) then I'd love to hear it. 

I know I'm bitching and complaining but I've seen it done on reddit before and there are some really nice people out there that I love to see actually exist, and this time I need help :\

Much love 


Cheers


P.S. I went to school to be an art director in an advertising firm. idk why but I feel this is something that should be in there"
k08dj,3,2011-08-31,"21/F/5'3""/149 lbs (Aug 30 - Nov 22)",rofflewaffles,BTFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/BTFC/comments/k08dj/21f53149_lbs_aug_30_nov_22/,"Time for me to start my round two of BTFC. I've been pretty lazy this summer - since graduating in June, I've been bumming around at home, with little in the way of diet control or weight training. I've lost a fair amount of strength and put on some fat in the meantime, but I've already started whipping myself back into shape and I feel good about where I'm going from here.

**Goals**:

* Primary goal is fat loss, to be accomplished through heavy lifting and a combination of intermittent fasting and mostly paleo eating. I'm moving to Germany soon to start a six month internship, so I'm not sure about the details of my day to day life yet and what will best suit my lifestyle, but that's the general plan. I'm hesitant to give myself strict number goals, but I'd be happy going from my current pant size of 12 to an 8 or 6.
* Secondary goal is to get my strength back to where it was before I got lazy and improve from there. My realistic/optimistic goals are: squat 225/250, deadlift 250/275, bench 135/150, OHP 95/105. However, if I find that my lifting progression suffers due to restricted calorie or carb intake, I'm just going to bite the bullet and accept it until I've finished my cut.


Okay. Let's do this.


Edit: a little more info: I've just restarted my Madcow 5x5 plan and will be continuing on that until that becomes unfeasible for whatever reason; wasn't progressing linearly on SL 5x5 for a long time and just didn't like 5/3/1 so I settled on Madcow a while ago. My current lifts (I just started lifting again last week after a 2.5 month hiatus) are 185x5 squat, 200x5 DL, 100x5 bench, 75x3 OHP. Haven't tested to failure, but those are the weights I felt comfortable starting from again. I'm also rofflewaffles on fitocracy if you're interested in tracking my progress!"

* 210lbs
* 6'3

**Current habits:**

Gym sporadically; using SS/SL. I always seem to go for a three-week period before I splutter out due to work/school/whatever.

Diet is family home cooking, which to be frank, sucks balls.

**Goals:
**

* Keep and maintain a positive workout schedule
* Keep and maintain a positive diet
* Maintain both of the above while working on my school's newspaper for my final year of University, and through my internship.
* Lower my body fat to get some definition, and rock my Halloween costume.
* Raise my strength to a point where I am satisfied

**My Story**

Always been a nerdy kid, but I've never been very athletic; I've been a career goalie due to being unable to/hating running for long periods of time. I want to be fit in order to improve my self-confidence and for long-term health. 

Dieting is a big deal for me, as I've never had a plan. I'm looking forward to figuring out something that works for me on a student budget. Suggestions are welcome.
