68izba,2,2017-04-30,[CA] Reducing state tax withholding,Throwaway829462,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/68izba/ca_reducing_state_tax_withholding/,"I'm doing an internship in California this summer, and filling out a DE-4. I've done all the calculations in the form, and it looks like my tax will be very low (because it's only a few months), however it also looks like there's no way to decrease my withholding on that form, only increase it.

Is this correct? If so, how do I decrease it?

Thanks!"

This is going to be a slightly long post so please sit through this with me.
I'm really having trouble making a decision as to where to go to college, and I'm torn between MIT/Yale.
I applied as aerospace engineering, but to be completely honest, I really don't know what I'm going to major at college. I'm pretty sure it's going to be STEM(mostly math or physics related) or maybe course 14/15.

What I like about MIT:

Academics- You cannot deny that MIT is the better school academically for STEM majors. Easy job/internship opportunity

UROP- cutting edge research opportunities

Interphase- I applied to Interphase, and if I get in, it's defintely going to be a game changer for me. But I'll only know if I commit :(

What I dislike about MIT:

Stress- The most important reason that's keeping me from committing to MIT is stress/workload. I know it's definitely not going to be easy at Yale or any other top schools (that's not what I'm looking for anyways), but I think MIT's course load is just especially stressful. I don't want to be in an environment where I'm constantly super stressed and pulling my hairs out.

social life- I'm not into the ""work hard, play hard"" model at MIT. Don't want to die on weekdays and have huge parties on weekends

What I like about Yale:

Faculty student relations- since it has a super small STEM department, class sizes are super small, and students get to know their professors very well(which I really like). I talked to one professor and he said he will literally be on my ass to help me get internships

Student body- not everyone is STEM, and I will know people from different majors doing different things in the future. There are also a lot of well known political figures coming in for speeches

Less stress- definitely not going to be easy, but not as hardcore as MIT

What I dislike about Yale:

Opportunities- smaller school means fewer opportunities. Also, I'm not too sure about this, but does coming from a less well regarded engineering/STEM school reduce my chance of finding a good job? Because I've heard many people say don't go to Yale for engineering

What I dislike about both schools:

humanities requirements- not super excited about completing my General requirements

Finally, I have some questions that I need honest answers for:
1. Are most students happy at MIT?
2. Just how stressful exactly is MIT (Especially compared to Yale if anyone has experience)? How much do students sleep on average?
Thank you so much for reading!

TLDR: Trying to decide between Yale and MIT. Any help is appreciated!"

I'm a 19 year old guy studying Mechanical Engineering in college. I've never really wanted to go on a mission but always felt like I had to, like its my duty.

Almost everyone in my youth group growing up in my homeward has already left or come back and I feel like a failure for not going already. I feel like its my obligation to go because the prophet always says that all young men should go but i don't know 2 years seems like a long time. Also, I feel like like my friends and just the general atmosphere of the church expects me to go on a mission. 

Now almost all my LDS friends in YSA at college (I don't go to a BYU) are getting ready to leave and soon I'll have no friends and feel like a failure again. This semester has been pretty rough too as I started taking the big boy engineering classes (Thermo, Mechanics of Mat, Circuits etc) and it seems like almost everyone i meet is doing so much better than me. Either they're in a relationship, got an internship at [Insert Big engineering company here] or got a leadership position in a club [American Society of MechEs). Heck one of my good friends got an internship at Daikin. I Tried applying for internships, leadership positions, research positions on campus and I even did my best to find a girlfriend, but I came up with nothing. Now, I feel like even more of a failure, and I kinda just want to leave school for a bit. 

Thats why I am thinking about going on a mission, I just want to leave all this, and get rid of the pressure of going once and for all.  Plus I feel like no girl will want to marry me if I don't serve a mission. But I know these are not good reasons to go. So how can I gain a desire to go on a mission? I have a feeling a lot of the responses here will be to ""Pray about it"" but I feel like I never get any answers to prayers. Maybe I just don't pray about things long enough, I usually stop praying about something after a few days. It doesn't help that I am trying to overcome my pornography addiction and when I relapse I feel dead inside. Can you guys help me out?  "

I will be moving to another city for the summer for an internship and my apartment is not furnished. I don't really want to rent furniture, so I plan on just buying a cheap desk for my computer and something to sleep on. I want to get something for less than $250. That's really as high as I'd go and i'd prefer much less than that if possible. The mattress at my current apartment isn't terribly comfortable so I'm not spoiled when it comes to sleeping comfort. I just want something like a futon or foam mattress to sleep on, probably just put on the floor. Simple is good. I'm just not sure which to do as futons seem really easy to throw in my car if i need to, but then I also see stuff about futon mattresses as well? Like I'd need to buy multiple things for a futon, but maybe not for a foam mattress? I'm looking for a Full/Queen size in case I have any guests of the opposite gender spend the night. Amazon is fine with me to order from. Thanks in advanced."

I will graduate this spring with a STEM degree, and start working at my dream company full time.
I'm really excited but also, I have pretty bad anxiety/stress problems when it comes to this. I keep telling myself that I'm not capable of being successful at my career, and asking myself why they hired me. But on the surface, I KNOW I did a good job when I did my internship with them, otherwise they wouldn't have offered me a full time position after graduation. The pay is very very good, which I should be happy about but I honestly feel that I'm not even going to be worth that much.

Some problems I've noticed about myself:

I can't think off the top of my head. If i know I have a presentation coming up, or I have to speak at a meeting or anything, I spend SO much time preparing exactly what I need to say. Otherwise I get nervous and stutter.

I feel like all my ideas are stupid and people are judging me when I contribute ideas.

I take any kind of criticism way too hard, dwell on it forever, and it discourages me.

I need some advice on how to handle this.This career is so important to me and I just want to succeed while keeping my emotions from destroying me completely. Meditation? Good books on confidence? Can anyone offer any advice?
Thanks in advance.

I'm starting my career this summer and need advice on how to build confidence and thicken my skin."

Today I'm bringing to you a couple ideas for a fun prompt in which one of the following girls is fucked! After the list of prompt ideas is a list of girls I'm fine with playing.

For clarification, I'm also open to playing with other girls in an [F4F] scenario or even trans/traps in a [F4T] scenario. I could even be convinced into a [T4M] scenario if it's good enough.

**Prompts:**

1. *The Gym Leader's Reward:*
After winning against me in a Pokemon battle, you recieved your Gym Badge and the proof you defeated me. However, you were a little surprised when I invited you into my private back room for a little more of a prize....

2. *Crime Always Pays:*
As a young Pokemon Trainer, I've done my best to stop you and your criminal organization (whether it's Team Rocket, Team Galactic, or any other one) from upsetting the balance of the world. But I didn't expect to be defeated when I challenged some grunts at your HQ, and I didn't expect them to use mr against my will...

3. *Double Battle Royal:*
After a year of harsh training and a rigorous application process, you finally made it into the Battle Royal Club; a prestigious trainer's club in a fancy Villa beside a beach. Here, Trainers can fight each other in large Double Battles set to an arena near the water. The club also has plenty of rooms for the inevitable ""relaxation"" that comes after every battle for the four trainers involved...

4. *The Champion's Trophy:*
As new reigning Champion of a region of your choice, you now have the right to any one girl in the entire region. Which also means that you're expected to plant your ""Champion's Seed"" inside her as well. The catch? It's got to be on Video, and you're going to have to release it to the public as an official film of the Pokemon Champion. So make it a good tape!

5. *The Professor's Assistant:*
As an intern working with one of the most established Pokemon Professors, you've grown quite a crush on her, even if she is a bit older than you. However, don't think she hasn't noticed. Because she has. And being as lonely as she is, she has no issues with seducing you and introducing you to her interesting kinks...

6. *A Poke-Mother's Love:*
You set out on your journey not too long ago, but even now your Mother is lonely. Or maybe it's not your own, but your Rival's, or your friend's mother. But she's in need of some company, the kind only a kid like you can give...

I have accepted an Internship in East Plano and I would like to try to get an apartment nearby to cut down on commute. I've looked at lots of different apartments in Plano, but it's a little overwhelming especially since I think there's a bit of bias in those people leaving reviews. Someone directed me here and I thought you folks might be able to help! If people could just post some suggestions and maybe some backup info I would really appreciate it. 

Some background info: 
-I'm moving down from New York, will be down for the first of June.
-I'll be staying less then a year, specifically June-January
-I'd prefer to stay in a One bedroom apartment alone (although I'm looking at some other options) and I'm ok with non furnished. 
-I'd prefer to pay under $1000 a month including utilities. 
-I'm pretty low maintenance, basic essentials is fine by me (working water, apartment not falling apart right off the bat, no bedbugs)

We've included a TL;DR at the bottom.)

&amp;nbsp;

Hello r/bangtan! The weekend is, sadly, over and we're back to school/work :( But it's okay because today is not the Monday we give up, NO, NOT TODAY. TODAY WE...get another cup of coffee (or tea) to help us power through the rest of the day.

We've been pretty quiet on our end with school and work, but we wanted to take the time to discuss some future project ideas with you guys. We want to hear your opinions to determine the course of the future projects and how we will go about organizing these. So please, give us your honest opinions. If you think something might not work or doing it another way might be more efficient, please let us know! We value your ideas!

----

Before we start, though, we would like to make a call to future volunteers and coordinators. If you want to help out with projects, please shoot us a PM! If you have any general comments or ideas, please also let us know, in the comments below (or in a PM).

We're also looking for someone who lives in Korea who is willing to forward parcels to BH. The Projects team will reimburse you for any associated costs (e.g. shipping and handling).

-----

Alright, let's begin! Below, we will discuss ideas for the upcoming anniversary and, the organization of birthday projects, and a Secret Santa!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Upcoming Anniversary**

BTS has grown **A LOT**, almost exponentially, this past year and we want to do something to congratulate them on their success and their hard-work paying off. However, since like half of our coordinating team are students and the other half are full-fledged adults, we will be busy with finals, *possible* summer internships, and work for the next 2 months. Still, we don't want to pass up this anniversary. We want to give you guys the opportunity to congratulate BTS on their amazing growth, send letters and/or fan art to the boys; so, we've been talking about doing a relatively simple project that has a theme or unifying factor.

We've been thinking about doing an acrostic ""poem"", so that the first letter of every message comes together to make one big message. For example, if three people signed up, the message would be something like ‘BTS’ and the first person would write a message starting with B, the next person would write a message starting with T and the last person writes a message with S. For example:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **B**oldly chasing your dreams, you inspire me so much. 
&gt;
&gt; **T**hese 7 Korean boys are amazing. 
&gt;
&gt; **S**omething I really love about BTS is the music. 

&amp;nbsp;

The above is only an example of a short and simple acrostic poem; your own message can be as long or short as you like (within page limits). The only requirement is that you start your message with your assigned letter - for example, if your assigned letter is 'W', your fan letter should start with a ""W"". Artists are also welcome to participate, as long as they include the assigned letter prominently some way in the artwork!

Obviously, we would like to have a nice and long group message, hopefully at least 100 characters long (so at least 100 participants!).

Would you guys like to do this? Thoughts or suggestions? Reply to our **4th Anniversary** suggestions comment below. Please note that as the anniversary is fairly soon, the deadline we have is the end of May, so any project would have to be completed in that time span.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Future Birthday Projects**

Also in the line of ""*we're students short on time*"", we would like to talk to you guys about coordinating and organizing future birthday projects. As you know, the boys have really close birthdays, more specifically JK^(1 Sept) + RM^(12 Sept) and then Jin^(4 Dec) + V^(30 Dec). Jimin^(13 Oct) is also in the middle. Coincidentally, those are also the months when we go back to school and when we take finals. So, to make things easier for us, we thought about opening the projects two months in advance and close them as their respective deadline approaches.

To give you guys an idea, let's use JK + RM for example. Their birthdays are both in the first weeks of September, so then we would open both projects in early-mid June (date tbd). You guys would be able to send in letters and fan art for both birthdays as you wish during the two months or so the project is open, any time before the project closes. We will close the project strictly on the stated date - deadline extensions were getting too complicated to manage. We will post a reminder post 1 week before deadline instead. The closing deadlines are to be determined, but are likely to be 3 weeks before the actual birthday. This arrangement will allow us to manage projects better and give everyone enough time to manage their submissions.

What do you guys think about this arrangement? We think it will save us time, as we won't have to close a project early 'cause *quick! now we have to open the following project* aaand it will give you guys ample time to submit stuff at your own pace. Give us your thoughts and feedback by replying to our comment **Birthday Projects** down below.

&amp;nbsp;

One last thing pertaining to birthday projects before we changes subjects to talk about the Secret Santa project, presents. Last year we had a little discussion about ideas for anniversary gifts and individual member birthday presents, and a lot of you guys suggested either community or charity work. Which is great! And, it works out perfectly for us since we are a relatively small (but growing) community that's spread out around the world. This allows us to organize a present without the complications of shipping and organizing gifts from the other side of the world. The solar lanterns and KAPS were immensely successful, more than we could have ever imagined, and didn't it feel great knowing that together we made the world a little bit better? So, if it's okay with you guys, we'd like to keep doing charity and other community-centric gifts. 

Any and all suggestions for future birthday gifts can be left under our **Gift Suggestions** comment. It's okay if your idea is not a charity idea, as it might spark an idea for someone else. We want to brainstorm first without ruling out any ideas. So go ahead, pitch in your ideas!

Ok, now we're gonna hand the mic' over to Erin. She will be the main coordinator for the Secret Santa project, so we'll let her introduce y'all to it.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Secret Santa**

Erin here, better known as Erinzilla83. I started thinking about how I don't often buy frivolous things like perfume, video games, or kpop merch, because I can rarely justify spending money on myself for things that aren't necessities. If you're like me, then we tend to save stuff like that as wishlist items for Christmas and the holiday season.

Of course, then you have to worry if Aunt Edna is going to know the difference between BTS and B.O.B., or if you'll end up with a shirt that says Bieber on the back instead of Jungkook.  Wouldn't it be great if you could get merch from someone who won't ask you why you like that Chinese music and understands that sometimes you need 3 photocards of Kim Namjoon? Well, look no further my friends, because I have just the thing! A Secret Santa project for the sub!!

How is that going to work, you ask? Well, we will start off with posting up a survey form so we can get a rough estimate of how many people we'll have, where they're from, and what their budget is. After that, the next step will be a sign up form where we will gather some info such as who your bias might be, what other merch you might own (to avoid duplicates), and some items on your wishlist. From there, we will match everyone up!

In the survey post that will be coming in a few months, there will be an in-depth explanation of how everything will be set up and safeguard measures in case someone doesn't follow through. I want to thank the BTSProjects Team for being as excited about this as I was and for wanting to jump right in and help!

I hope this will bring a little bit of extra holiday cheer to the sub and give people a chance to connect with each other, as well as help some of you finish off that poster collection or get their first piece of merch!!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

##**Closing Comments and TL;DR**

As my mom says, *omaiga!*^(oh my god) that was long, so let's do a quick recap.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **ANNIVERSARY**
&gt;
&gt; We'd like your thoughts and suggestions on doing an acrostic 'poem' as a sub. We would also like to know if and how many people would be interested in participating if we organized this.
&gt;
&gt; You can reply to our *4th Anniversary Suggestions* comment with your ideas!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Birthdays**
&gt;
&gt; We have thought about ""grouping"" close birthday projects together to maximize time for submissions and to help our small coordinating team.
&gt;
&gt; For example, JK and RM both have birthdays in early September. So we would open submissions for both projects in early June, and allow you guys to submit stuff in the following 2 months or so up until each respective birthday deadline.
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts and/or suggestions about this setup? Leave them below our *Birthday Projects* comment.
&gt;
&gt; **Birthday Gifts**
&gt;
&gt; We'd like to do more charity gifts, if that's okay with you guys, as these are easier to coordinate and we can all have a chance to participate even if we are all spread over the globe.

68k454,19,2017-05-01,Please help me (30/M) figure out how to communicate better with my wife (30/F) before she leaves me,CJSteves,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/68k454/please_help_me_30m_figure_out_how_to_communicate/,"TL/DR: My wife of 4 years (together for 8) and I are struggling to communicate effectively. We are both at our wits end and I'm worried that she has already decided to leave me and is not interested in trying to work things out. 


My wife and I have been together for almost 10 years. We met in college, dated for about 6-8 months, broke up when I took a year long internship across the country, and got back together about a year later, eventually getting married in 2013. 

We struggled with communication during our first relationship, and it drove a wedge between us (at least it did for me, but maybe I was not clear enough about this in the early days of our relationship). My opinion about our situation is that any form of dissent or questioning about ""why"" she felt or thought something is perceived as criticism and causes her to withdraw and get defensive. Usually what happens is I will try to understand what's causing her to be upset, and eventually it feels like she will ""turn the tables"" on me to make me out to be the bad guy for asking why and trying to understand her thought process. 

She has told me multiple times that she feels hurt and ashamed or like she is insignificant when I ask questions or have serious discussions with her. I am naturally a problem solver and very contemplative, so it is hard for me to take something at face value and just move on, especially when it comes to emotional matters since I am not often a very emotional person.  

I had been working out of town since 2010 which has been a real challenge for us. I used to have my own apartment in the locations where I would work, most of the last 6 years I've been on the West coast and her on the East. I would get a long weekend (4 or 5 days) each month to come home, and I currently get 4 weeks of vacation time each year. We usually spend all of my long weekends and vacation together, either at home, with family, or taking a trip of our own. During a normal work week for us, my wife and I chat via text throughout the day, and usually spent about an hour on the phone each night, and several hours on video chat or phone over the weekend. The conversation rarely turns to any ""deep"" or complex topics, I think because at this point we both avoid those things to avoid hard feelings. 

Over the last 1-2 years, my wife has gotten increasingly frustrated with our long distance status. At one time she basically told me that she wanted us to be together and to have a baby or she wanted a divorce. In the summer of 2016, she had a miscarriage at around 10-12 weeks. She has an IUD, so it was inevitable that the pregnancy would fail or be fraught with problems given the IUD. She told me about it over the phone about 4 weeks after it happened (Neither of us knew she was pregnant until the miscarriage, and I had just been home for a long weekend and she opted not to tell me in person). I flew home immediately from across the country and spent nearly a week at home comforting her. In conversations then and since, she has made several comments about how she blames me for the miscarriage because ""I supported her getting the IUD, and she didn't really want it"". My recollection is that I suggested it as a possible option, but never said anything remotely close to ""This is the only option and you must do it"". Also, she herself wanted to get off birth control medication as it had too many ill effects on her, contributing to her migraines, skin problems, and was generally miserable on it. 

Changing gears... 

At the end of 2016, I was offered a new position that would allow me to work from home, so I took it to be with my wife more and hopefully start what a path to a more normal life. Right now, it still requires me to travel, 5-10 days a month I'm out of town, but the rest of the time I work from home. She works at a professional career full time, so we see each other nights and weekends like a normal couple. I'll admit, I'm unhappy being cooped up at home all day, and I don't like the area of the country we live in (she knows this, we've talked about it, and I probably do let it get me down too much).

I've been working in my new role now since about February 1 of this year. Things have been rough at times, which is to be expected when you've both lived independently, separate lives for almost 10 years, but I thought things were going well and that we were making headway to the life we wanted. About three weeks ago, I could tell I had frustrated her with something I did or said, but like usual, she said nothing and I had to try and coax it out of her, usually by being overly apologetic and saying things like ""I'm sorry if I did anything to upset you. Was it when I said XYZ?"". I was out of town the week after that, and back home this past week. Wednesday she was still clearly upset, and as we were going to bed that night, I asked her ""Are you sure you want me to be here?""  

This question resulted in 2-3 hours of conversation in which she told me she's been increasingly unhappy, and that she doesn't think it's going to work out. I asked if she would consider counseling, and she said she'd think about it but that it would ""only fix things for a little while"". That night she asked me to sleep on the couch and I have been kicked out of our bedroom ever since.

Each day has been essentially normal, wake up, we each take turns taking the dog out every other day, make coffee for her (since she has to get ready for work and I work from home). Although, each night it's back to the couch, and each day, there's no physical contact (holding hands, kiss on the cheek, hugs, cuddles, etc.).

Now, I have no idea what to do. I love her tremendously, despite all our challenges, I have come to expect we would be together. She has been a ""constant"" for nearly 1/3 of my life. We have a dog we both love dearly, and many shared interests and goals. She is one of the kindest and most caring people I have ever met, and she inspires me to be more in touch with my feelings and emotions, and those of others. 

I'm scared I will lose her, but also am beginning to lose faith. I made a career change, agreed to live somewhere I don't like, and am trying my best to support our relationship and it feels like she doesn't want to try, and no matter what I do I seem to make it worse, not better. What am I doing wrong that is making our relationship go haywire?!"
68k4qd,35,2017-05-01,Does anyone feel they like don't measure up and never will to other ABCDs in their generation?,idkwhatever96,ABCDesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/68k4qd/does_anyone_feel_they_like_dont_measure_up_and/,"I have never been the smart kid, at least when it comes to science and math. I am also very introverted and as a result have struggled socially throughout school because no one wants to be friends with the shy, nerdy kid. I've always felt like I've been an embarrassment to them since I'm not the amazing kid they expected. Most of their friends' kids have their lives together. Good grades, great resumes, good, well paying jobs straight after graduating, and they even have strong social lives. End up dating and marrying someone just as great. They just seem so happy. Meanwhile I'm the not so smart, chubby, quiet kid. Every time I meet family friends, I want to die on the inside when they ask if I'm enjoying college and I just feel worse about myself. I feel like our accomplishments and at least for us females, our bodies are constantly scrutinized. I know what people say doesn't matter, but it's easier said than done.

It's not that I'm lazy. I do work hard and get help when needed. I'm not like failing classes. I'm just average I would say. I am involved in some student orgs, one with a leadership position, and I did have an internship. However the internship was an unpaid one at a nonprofit, which while I enjoyed, doesn't measure up to those at private hospitals and corporations (I'm a public health major). I just feel like there is so much pressure to be perfect, and follow this certain timeline of life and it gives me anxiety, and with my last year coming up, it feels worse. So much to the point where I have bad dreams about school that are so realistic it's scary and have trouble falling asleep because I start thinking depressing thoughts. I even randomly break down crying, especially at night.

In regards to the social stuff, it's difficult for me to make friends. It's painful for me to go up and talk to people. I can't even stand being in social situations for too long or I feel overwhelmed. I recently had to let go of a toxic friendship because she was taking advantage of what I've said above, acted possessive, played on my insecurities, and basically used me to feel good about herself.

68kdje,28,2017-05-01,"Long textpost, Just wanted to thank you guys",superdietcoke,learnjava,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/68kdje/long_textpost_just_wanted_to_thank_you_guys/,"In August of 2016, It was nearing the end of my summer and all I accomplished was being useless and getting high. With Community College being the only further education in my immediate future, I knew I had to take action so I don't get stuck working for minimum wage.


I looked through the subreddit and I saw a lot of people recommend Helsinki's Java MOOC which meshed with me pretty well. I saw how it taught you in increments and constantly built on top of the concept it taught + reinforce those concepts by having graded exercises right after.


For reference, I attempted Java in high school and barely passed with a low C. I finished the course and took my first Java class at my CC and it was honestly a joke. The easiest time of my life in terms of academics. I received an A in that class and the next quarter, I took the second class in the java sequence. I got an A+ in that class and decided to self-study some of the more advanced topics before I attempt advanced java(GPA matters too much to risk anything).


This resulted in an entire quarter in which I wasn't taking a java class so I decided to take initiative and apply to a job listing that was looking for local CC students to ""tutor"". Now the pay was 15/hour and I wasn't really looking forward to tutoring but experience is experience right?


Long story short, the boss was impressed with me and rather then becoming a tutor, I work at home 100% of the time and log the hours I work, while getting paid 18/hour. My job consists of developing simple to intermediate eclipse projects that will aid the younger kids in learning java long with math. I just hope this will be something that will help me in securing internships next year(If you guys have any advice concerning internships, please tell me).
This sub truly changed the course of my life and I have nobody else to thank but the people who stick around to help and guide the beginners(which I still am). Thank you from the very bottom of my heart.

I have a question: I encrypted my Phone with the LineageOS Encryption. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 klte. After I encrypted it, I formated my sd-card as an intern storage, so it will also be encrypted. My problem now is that I have to type in my password when I boot my phone, but I am not sure if it is really encrypted. That is because my phone never told me, that encryption was successfull. I just left it encrypt over night (like 10 Hours or so) and when I got up in the morning there still was the loading screen of lineage. I also never saw a progress bar when I started the encryption, there was just the android mascot for a few seconds and then it turned right to the loading screen.
Is there a way to test if my phone is really encrypted?"

I will graduate this spring with a STEM degree, and start working at my dream company full time.
I'm really excited but also, I have pretty bad anxiety/stress problems when it comes to this. I keep telling myself that I'm not capable of being successful at my career, and asking myself why they hired me. But on the surface, I KNOW I did a good job when I did my internship with them, otherwise they wouldn't have offered me a full time position after graduation. The pay is very very good, which I should be happy about but I honestly feel that I'm not even going to be worth that much.

Some problems I've noticed about myself:

I can't think off the top of my head. If i know I have a presentation coming up, or I have to speak at a meeting or anything, I spend SO much time preparing exactly what I need to say. Otherwise I get nervous and stutter.

I feel like all my ideas are stupid and people are judging me when I contribute ideas.

I take any kind of criticism way too hard, dwell on it forever, and it discourages me.

I need some advice on how to handle this.This career is so important to me and I just want to succeed while keeping my emotions from destroying me completely. Meditation? Good books on confidence? Can anyone offer any advice?
Thanks in advance.

I'm starting my career this summer and need advice on how to build confidence and thicken my skin."

But the thing is that I feel like I'm not going to find a girl never. I don't have time to go out to bars and stuff because I'm a college student and I'm doing an internship. There's no lgbt club in my school. 

I have tried using apps, but not a lot are available in my country and most of them don't have users. Yesterday I uninstalled one because, for some reason, only men were sending messages to me. 

And I'm scared that I'll never enjoy this part of me. I'm scared that I'll end up dating a guy and pretending to be someone I'm not. That's sad, I don't want it.

This was primarily due to depression and anxiety that I had alot of trouble with after high school. I didn't really want to do anything nor was I interested in anything. I also didn't know what I wanted to get into career wise. 

I've always had an interest in medicine and particularly psychology, but as it relates to depression, I never really believed myself capable of being a physician, though I did well in high school. Specifically, I'd like to go into psychiatry, as that's always what I've had the most interest in. 

My dilemma now is that I need to make up for lost time. I want to do everything in my power to make myself a good canidate for medical school. I'm already aware of the grades I need to get and how I need to do on the MCAT, but I'm wondering what else I should be doing during my undergraduate years. I'd like to get in on some academic research at my University, as well as do some job shadowing in my area, but I'm not too sure where to start. How does one usually go about applying for job shadowing or getting into that per se? 

I'm also aware that internships are important, but again, I'm not sure where I could find them. Is there a particular place to look or process invloved with finding and picking out internships? 

To conclude, what would you say are the most important things I should be doing to make mysef a good candidate? What did you do and how did you go about getting into medical school?"

#**Steven Koecher Disappearance**

Steven was a young man who vanished suddenly on **December 13, 2009**. He was a resident of **St. George in Utah.** St. George is a beautiful city, not big but not little either. The climate is mild all year and has everything someone could need. Unfortunately, Steven disappeared from St. George without a trace. 

##**Steven**

Steven's birthday was on November 1, 1979. He was born into a devout LDS family in Bountiful, UT. He has four siblings and his parents,  Deanne and Rolf. His family is very large, counting all of his relatives. He was a college grad who wanted to have a career in public relations and communications. 

Steven was a talented guy. He loved playing guitar and he even tried writing music. He wasn't selfish and served a mission in Brazil like his father had. He loved genealogy and would take his parents on tours of cemeteries to show them what he'd found. He was a good person who thought the absolute best of people, and naturally he was an Eagle Scout. 

**Jobs**

He worked as an intern at the governor's office in Salt Lake City from September 2003 through May 2004. He wanted to move but before that, he worked as a stringer for the Davis County Clipper newspaper. His father was the editor here. He would usually post as Steven Threll (his middle name) so he couldn't be tied to his father's position. March 2007 came and he took a new job working for the online version of the Salt Lake City Tribune but was laid off in June of the next year. After he lost his job, he tried sales at MatchBin.com in October 2008. 


Then in March 2009, he moved to St. George, UT. He wanted away from the Utah winters that affect the northern part of the state but still keep his job at MatchBin. He unfortunately was let go once again in April because they didn't think he was working out in sales. In December, he round a part-time job working for a window and blind cleaning company handling out flyers. He was also subcontracting so he could earn money putting up Xmas decorations. 

Moving to St. George made things tough for him. He couldn't seem to find a full-time job and was becoming more depressed from having no money. He was behind on rent and his father offered to help him pay it, but Steven refused. This was only days before he was never seen again. 


**Life's Pressures**

Obviously he must have had some serious anxiety and depression from not being successful and making his family proud. To me he always seemed to strive for that. His family expected things from him (or he *thought* they did, we have no way of knowing for sure) and the pressure was on. 

• A successful career     
• A successful marriage       
• A family of his own      

His siblings and cousins were already doing these things, and he felt like he was letting his family down. 

**Strange Behavior**

December 9, few days before he left for Las Vegas, Steven drove *500* miles to Ruby Valley, NV so he could visit the family of a girl he dated for a short time. It was an unannounced visit and she wasn't home. He stayed with her parents, Kathy and John Neff, all through lunch before leaving for St. George. He made stops in Wendover, NV as well as Springville, UT and Nephi, UT. Total he had driven *1,200* miles in three days. He didn't seem to be doing it for any particular reason. It is theorized to be stress induced  behavior and that his mental state could have led to amnesia. 

On December 10, he sent his father a text and called his mom. They talked for a while about how he would be there for Christmas on December 23. This is the last time they talked to their son. On December 11, Steven was seen helping two kids who were locked outnot their home. The next day he was seen leaving his home and stopping for gas in Mesquite NV, 40 miles from home. No one knows why he went here. He had bought Xmas gifts in St. George the same day and that was his final transaction according to his bank records. He was seen coming home at 10pm and spotted by the same person leaving about a half an hour later. 

He talked to people from his church from his phone telling them he was in Vegas but didn't say why. His friend called him about a church meeting, and he said he'd be there. After this call, however, no one would hear from Steven again. 

##**Surveillance Camera Footage**

Steven's **2003 white Chevrolet Cavalier** was found abandoned on **December 14** in the **2600 block of Savannah Spring Avenue**, a cul-de-sac in **Henderson NV.** This is part of an upscale retirement community called **Sun City Anthem**. Two security cameras caught Steven parking there on **December 14** and walking away with a stance that was determined. He seemed to know *exactly* where he was going. About 6 minutes pass between the time his car is first seen (**11:54am**) and he is seen walking passed the first security camera. (**12**) Then the second camera catches him walking at about 25 seconds past noon. Basically he waited inside of his car for *six minutes*  before exiting. So it seems likely he had an appointment with someone for 12, and came early to be sure he made it. If he had only made a phone call or wrote a note or sent a text while he waited, maybe we'd know more of what was happening. 

The footage shows Steven walking down the sidewalk and turning left, then he crosses a street and moves out of sight. He doesn't seem unsure or cautious about getting there, he is determined and dresser casually with jeans and sneakers. So nothing business like for a job interview. He is seen carrying a folder and its theorized he may have had resumes and flyers or sales contracts from the company he worked for. He could have been contacted to put up Xmas decorations for one of the houses. He appeared to know *exactly* where and what he is doing. He doesn't approach any houses to leave a flyer, and he doesn't stop to check the house numbers. 

When his car was found, it appeared he had been living in it. There was a shaving kit, clothes, blankets, and a pillow. He likely did this when driving all around. He even had the wrapped Xmas presents he bought. Missing from the car was his cell phone, wallet, and his license. He left his laptop and cell charged at home, so he seemed to me to have planned to be back home soon. 

Strangely, about *five hours* after he was seen on the surveillance video, his cell signal was picked up several miles north. Then, *two hours later*, it was picked up again in Whitney Ranch, another subdivision. At 6am on December 14, the day after he was seen, someone used the phone to check voicemails. The signal remained in the third location for two days before the phone died and the signal was lost. 

##**Parents Notified**

Three days after his car was found, his parents got a call from the parking police. His father and brothers immediately set out for Nevada to look for him. They searched Henderson and Las Vegas, posted flyers and checked all of the hospitals, restaurants, and the jail. They also checked the morgue. 


The place the car was found confused them. The area isn't easy to find by any means and is off the path for usual visitors. The car started and had a half tank of gas. There were no problems with the car to explain why it had been left. It is theorized he may have been meeting someone, and got into *their* car. There were many searches around Henderson and the Las Vegas areas yet no evidence was found.


 **Searches and Leads**


There were extensive searches focusing on the last place he had been seen. They searched areas around Las Vegas as well, but no evidence was found. 

*The case is still open with police investigating any and all tips.*

The most obvious place to look is where he left his car and where his cell phone signal was found after he left the cameras view. It could be important to see where he was staying when he talked to the members of the church that day. Maybe it'll shed light on where he spent the night. He left St. George at 10:30pm and would've been in Vegas after midnight. The drive isn't a very long one. 

His family believes he went to Nevada for a lead on a job. He wasn't quiet about the fact he was in Vegas, but he didn't say *why*. By all accounts it seems his disappearance was not planned. He didn't take his money or his passport. He didn't bring his computer or his charger. He hadn't touched his bank account since he disappeared. If this was voluntary, it was a completely impulsive decision. His odd behavior is explained by his family claiming he was trying to stay busy. 

**Theories**


Some speculated maybe Steven was gay. Being a part of the LDS church, he wouldn't be able to accept himself nor would they, he may have left to start a new life. Maybe he had met a guy online. I'll admit, it's strange that he was a good looking 30 year old devout LDS and hadn't gotten married. Young marriage is encouraged within the Mormon church and community. His mother made a remark once about how he *just* needed to find the right girl. Of courses, there are men out there who are straight and stay single for many reasons. So this theory is up for grabs. 


His mother thinks he committed suicide based on his behavior, but other members of his family disagree. They believe he was a victim of foul play.  If Steven disappeared by choice he would have contacted them by now. He was very close to his little brother Dallin. 









**Susan Powell**

Investigators tried to link Stevens disappearance to that of Susan Powell's for a short time. They vanished in the same week, but no ties could be found. Susan got a lot more media attention and the drama unfolded. Susan's father-in-law was obsessed with her. It was possible he had done it. Her husband, Josh, was suspected but he died in February 2012. This death made it clear to all involved that Josh killed Powell. 



**Sightings**

There was a man from the area who reported to police he had spoken to Steven twice in a Best Buy parking lot a *month after* he was last seen. It was Superbowl Sunday. The man and his wife agreed it was in fact Steven, and when he went to report it to the police, the detective was suspicious because or the date. The man had a time stamped receipt from the store but the detective was unmoved. The man went to Steven's parents who agreed it sounded like Steven. 


Employees working at IHOP in Flamingo reported seeing Steven several times and that he appeared homeless and confused. His family staked IHOP out but didn't see Steven. He was reported riding busses in the Las Vegas metro area but these weren't verified. 







##**No Sign of Steven**

His car wasn't checked for DNA *or* any other evidence. It is unknown if anyone was with him while he was driving around or when he was in Nevada. The family had drug sniffers check his car, but they found nothing. A private investigator was called and he canvassed the area. No one admitted to seeing Steven. There was a white SUV on the tapes that turned out to be a real estate agent. She doesn't remember seeing Steven at all. 

His father passed away in February of 2011 without ever learning what happened to his son. Now every December, his family and friends come together for a tree lighting ceremony in his honor. The police don't know what to believe. There's no evidence of foul play yet no evidence or explanation otherwise. 

***I might be posting  a thorough timeline in a part 2 post on this. It will be  detailed to the best of my abilities. If you have ANY theories I'd love to hear them and maybe edit to include the plausible ones if asked. Thank you for reading.***

I have one semester left, Currently I'm on COOP (extended internship)
Monthly Income: $2400
Rent + Utilities: $1000
Credit Card Debt: $3,000
Loans I already have (Stafford): $20,000
Cost of tuition + housing at school : $9000
Two options: 
1. Take out loans to pay for final semester then go to work a full time Civil Engineering job (salary around $60,000)
2. Intern a fourth semester and have the internship pay for my school (they pay for you school if you intern more than three semesters). But this delays my graduation until december, where I'm not earning that higher salary.

I will not be able to work during school because it's too stressful on me, so I'd like to save to have spending money during school.
Also, what should I do about my credit card bills? I can't figure out my budget and how aggressively I should be paying that off. Or should I not pay it off as much so I can pay for more of my tuition?

I have a 3.2 GPA and am strongly considering pursuing a Statistics M.S. I haven't been the best student due to a mix of my own fault, work, overloading myself, etc. I was planning on getting my applied mathematics minor but was wondering if I should let this minor go in exchange for upping my grades in a few important classes.


I am considering retaking two classes, probability + statistics and linear algebra. Would this be worth it, given my less than stellar GPA and that I have Bs in these courses? 


For more background into my situation: 

* I am also getting my computer science minor

* no formal research experience

* a couple of (BI centered) paid internships

* a couple of data analysis side projects on GitHub

* plan on having strong GRE scores, letters of recommendation, etc.

* Am looking for a more applied non-thesis M.S. program but I'm open to any program."

(LONG post)",WORSTBOWLHAVIOR,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/68oqwj/18_fresh_out_of_my_first_year_of_college_should_i/,"I'm from Boston, and I just finished my first year at Northeastern University, studying Finance and Accounting with a minor in Comp Sci. I applied to a couple internships for this summer and am having a unique dilemma.

**Internship A** is a small, start-up consulting firm that focuses on business analytics and business development. It was created to ""meet the growing demand for business consulting services that can provide data-intensive analysis and create automated reporting &amp;amp; dashboards."" During my interview, I was interviewed by its only employee, who I felt OK about, didn't really click with him, but it wasn't like I disliked him. It is also a home office. He explained to me that he does a range of things. He doesn't try to focus on one thing. For example, for one client, he could be working on helping them decide their pricing models. For another client, he is analyzing survey data for a company in order to find more efficient ways to manage their large data collection. 

* For Internship A, I would be working 30 to 40 hours per week. And the pay? Fucking $23/hour. HOLY CRAP. The work I would be doing is helping with these clients and making presentations for him. I would be working alongside him and another intern that is also my age. 

**Internship B**, I have not interviewed with yet. They are a large company, an institutional investment firm specializing in index and customized index-based strategies. I would be interning in the operations department which handles all of the back office functions for the company.They are a large company and manage 202 clients across 30 states. Their strategies include ""pure index tracking, as well as a broad array of enhanced, alternative and customized products designed to meet our clients' needs."" I am 


* For Internship B, I emailed them, and they said it would be a paid internship. I plan on asking about the wage at my interview.  They also said an intern would be expected to be given a desk of accounts for which they are responsible for while working full-time.  The responsibilities include reconcilements, performance calculations, exception management

Here is my dilemma. I was offered the internship for A last Thursday. The offer that was attached with my email said I have until Saturday to decide. I called and asked him to give me some more time (because I am feeling iffy about working for him and want to learn more about Company B i didn't say any of this to him). When I told him this in my phone call, he seemed short of shocked. He said that the latest he could give me is Tuesday afternoon, because there are other candidates waiting. The thing is, my interview for Company B is Tuesday at 2PM (tomorrow).. I emailed them and explained my situation and asked if ""there was any way I could be let known if I get the position shortly after my interview"" and the man I emailed said he would be deciding the day after with his team, Wednesday. Now I'm not sure what to do.

**Should I email Company A asking for more time? I feel like he has already been aggravated with my extension. The pay is so exceptionally high though, but I'm mainly looking for experience over money right now-- my family isn't having any trouble financing Northeastern luckily. Right now the plan is to wait out my interview with Company B and see if I like them better. But what if I do like their internship better, but they reject me on Wednesday, after I already rescinded Company A's offer since the deadline is Tuesday? Then I'd be left with no internships. Or what if B offers me like $12/hr?""



**Extra Details**
Commute distance isn't a factor, they're both the same. 

My family can finance Northeastern well thankfully, so all of this internship money would be pocket money for me.

I feel like he would work me like a madman for the $23/hour. He also seems like he has a lot on his hand since he handles clients from such different topics and subjects and works alone. The reason he is hiring interns is because he wants to test out having additional employees, he said that he is getting more and more work to do. I am more interested in working for Company B, as it resonates with my major, Finance instead of Company A which is business analytics. But then again, pay is also a factor, and I haven't even seen or talked to Company B yet. I will only have a short time to decide after my interview."

Eddie Mara was recent college grad and after years of spending his summer’s doing internships and jobs across the country he decided to spend his last summer before heading out into the real world at home with his family. Two weeks into his vacation he saw his neighbor Mrs. Anderson unpacking groceries from her car.

Now Mrs. Anderson was the kind of neighbor that most guys would kill to have. Sure, she was a bit older but her body could pass for a girl in her mid-20’s. Growing up Eddie was constantly helping her out around the house. Mrs. Anderson’s husband was always away on business trips so he paid Eddie to help out around the house. Needless to say, Eddie had a crush on his neighbor for most of his life, and seeing her again after all these years she was still a knockout.

He decided to help her out for old times’ sake and after catching up Mrs. Anderson offered Eddie a bit of work for the summer. Naturally, he agreed. It meant getting to spend for time with his hot neighbor and make money.

A week later after mowing Mrs. Anderson’s lawn she called him in to have a drink and talk. Eddie found about how Mrs. Anderson was having trouble with her husband and how she was wishing that she could have pursued her dreams instead of settling down as a housewife.

“And that’s the reason why I’m taking your body” She let out menacingly.
Before Eddie could even react, he felt the world around him go black. By the time he came to all he found a lavishly decorated bedroom, Mrs. Anderson’s bedroom. As he got up he felt something was different, no everything was different. At that point he saw his own body walk into the room.

“You’re gonna make a great housewife honey, don’t you worry.” His own voice said. Looking down he saw Mrs. Anderson’s clothes, her body, everything. Eddie’s summer was just getting interesting…"

I'm a sophomore in high school, and the classmate in question is a junior. I'll call him James.

James and I are interested in a lot of the same stuff at our (small) high school: we both participate in drama club, work with A/V tech to do a variety of things (including daily televised morning announcements), and are interested in computers. We have one history class together.

I met James at the beginning of this year, during the school's winter play. I was stage crew, he was the lead. From the start, I had a bad gut feeling about him. Outwardly, he's incredibly friendly, talented, and likable, but I got creepy vibes from him.

We started talking more in January, when rehearsals started for the spring musical. Around this time, I started dating my boyfriend, and James constantly asked me if I had hickies, and pretended to point them out on my neck. I've never had a visible hickey and I'm private about that sort of thing, so I don't know what provoked those questions.

Several times, he's pointed out that my shirt is ""too low-cut."" I wear relatively modest clothes for the most part, and I don't have any special assets that are worth commenting on. In general, he seems to love making sexist jokes (of the lame, but still sometimes hurtful, ""Go make me a sandwich"" type).

Through all of this, he's still very friendly to my face. He talks shit behind my back, but he often acts like we're best friends when we're together.
A few weeks ago, while both of us were working as stage crew for the local middle school's musical, James came up behind me while I was helping a kid with their costume and poked my butt. I turned around, and he said, ""I had to, it was there."" This particular incident cemented my feelings that James is not a nice dude.

Like I mentioned earlier, we work together in our school's TV studio to produce the morning announcements. I have a job operating cameras, and I know how to do it well, but James regularly tries to tell me how to do my job. It's not just minor corrections; he explains from scratch how to do the tasks I perform every day.

James works with our school's IT department. I'm interested in a career of that type, so I decided to apply for a summer internship with the department. There are five or six internship roles, and James also intended to apply. I told him about my plan to apply, because I thought he might have some tips, as he's part of the student IT program. He immediately discouraged me from applying, and told me I didn't have the necessary computer expertise (he knows nothing about how good I am with computers. And I'm pretty damn good!). He told me I'd end up doing nothing but cleaning SMARTBoard filters. I talked to the teacher managing applications, and she told me that he was full of it.

I applied anyways, and my interview was this morning. Before I went, James talked to me, and told me that my interview time had been changed. He also told me that I was dressed inappropriately for an interview. I checked with the same teacher as before, and she told me my time hadn't changed, and the interview was informal so my clothes were fine. Apparently, James was full of shit again.

My interview went well, and I expect to get the internship. That means that I'll be working with James for weeks during the summer.

In addition to these main incidents, there have been other minor times when James has lied to me. He also teases me about my hair (I have a blonde streak in otherwise brown hair) on a near daily basis, and he's usually condescending towards me. I honestly think he's a sexist douche. He makes me feel like less of a person.

I don't want to tattle on James for anything, because we work together on so many things, and we'll be doing those things for another year at least. I also don't want to give up the things I love (drama, computers, etc.) just because he's involved in them.

Is there anything I can or should do about what James does?

tl;dr: My classmate makes weird and sexist comments on a regular basis, lies to me about mundane things, and might have tried to sabotage my internship interview. We're involved in lots of the same extracurriculars at our school, so I *really* don't want to mess up our relationship further by reporting him, because he'll be around me for at least another year."

I have two wonderful, loving parents who will do anything for me.

I am a college graduate with minimal student loans due to my parents taking the heat.

After I graduated, I landed a job in my field. Worked there for about a year and went to better job with much better pay.

I make 40,000 a year. Not too shabby for someone who is young with no kids.


I actually like my job and my boss. I don't worry where rent will come from. I'm from a poor area. I've seen poverty. I have no right to want more or to complain. 

But I still want more.

I've applied to grad school twice. Both times, I didn't get into any of them. 3.5 GPA, experience in my field, graduated college early, worked through college, unpaid internships, etc. But my field is highly competitive with very, very few slots. It's extremely hard to get in. 


So I work. And I work. And I work. 

I work in a government facility at least 24 days month. Yeah, including weekends. 

I've applied to other jobs. I always get an interview, make it to the second round, and usually end up in 2nd or 3rd place for the job.

In the past 6 months, I've been rejected from graduate school again, been rejected from new jobs, and my boyfriend of 6 years cheated on me.

Yep. 

I've kept going.

The day after I found out my SO was cheating, I still went to work. I made it until and hour after lunch. I had to call my boss into a private room where I broke down. It was humiliating. That's not who I am. I cried on my boss and he just turned off his ""boss"" mode and turned on his ""dad"" mode. And I STILL finished a few things up before he forced me to go home. 

That was almost a month ago.

I'm at work every day, on time. I don't slack off. I work over 40 hours a week. 

I needed a win. I'm not dying, I'm not starving, but I needed a win.


I was eating lunch with the the guy that's equivalent to being like, 2 places under the CEO asks me to come to his office. This government facility is high up enough that people know his name and when he speaks, everyone listens. 

I've seen him in passing and spoke very few times in the little over a year I've worked here. 

He asks a bit about my aspirations and background. 

And he says, ""I see you here everyday. I see you just quietly working and I have noticed you. You are not living up to your potential. For a recent graduate, you're where you're supposed to be. (Entry level) But this is where you are, and (raises hand) this is where you should be. I see your potential. And I am going to help get you there. If it's writing a letter of recommendation or just introducing you to some people I know. I do not want to see you get stuck at where you are at.""


And we talked a little more. One of the people I truly look up to in research is going to be at my place of employment tomorrow and now I'm going to be meeting him tomorrow. 



Like it was just a win. To hear praise. To know that I'm noticed and hear that he's offering a bit of help. 

Because I truly work harder than any of my coworkers, which my boss has mentioned before. It's not an exaggeration. I actually do. I sign up for the side projects, I help people, I take the tough cases, I actually go the extra mile, etc.  


Even if nothing comes of it, it was like a light shining through the darkness I've been in lately. 


It was just what I needed to hear. Because a lot of the time I'm 
working so hard and, while my boss is happy about it, I feel like I'm giving my all for nothing. 

It was amazing to be recognized by someone I see in passing. 


It was a good day. I needed a good day. "

With it being challenging, I have struggled so far in the class. I expect to get a C in the course. I was honestly wondering since I have struggled so far in the Audit course, if I will struggle with my internship since it is in Auditing as well.

-Social isolation/rejection.

You don't really fit in into any social groups, you just seem like the outsider despite you trying your best to interact and mix with them. Now some of you might be isolated due to social anxiety/autism thus unable to speak up in social situations, but one thing's for sure if you're good looking, people will naturally gravitate towards you and start making small talks with you. They just assume you are shy. Whereas if you are ugly, people will think you are creepy/weird and generally shun from you. The halo effect is very real.

-You heard people call you ugly before.

More often than not, if you heard this coming from multiple people, it's likely it's true to some extent. People don't just call others ugly for no reason.

-No attraction from the opposite sex.

You hardly notice any girl, if not none showing an interest towards you. Contrary to popular belief, girls could actually be very open on displaying their attraction towards you. I lost count of the amount of times I saw girls playfully slapping Chad on his shoulders and teasing him. Fuck that was suicide fuel. Whereas girls throw me a look of disgust whenever I try to talk to them and tries to end conversations as soon as possible.

-No one compliments you other than your parents and grandparents.

 All along I thought I was at least average or above average because of my parents reassurance. It's only when I went out to reality in high school and intern when I realized this was far from the truth. They probably dont want to shatter my self-esteem, merely just telling me to be more confident and I would find a girlfriend.
So here you have it folks, feel free to add in more."

68rly8,3,2017-05-02,the story of my first real breakup. NC for 8 days now,smelerby,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/68rly8/the_story_of_my_first_real_breakup_nc_for_8_days/,"I’m new to this subreddit, but reading all these stories helped me a lot so far and I thought I’d share my own. I think it’s going to be a long one, so grab a snack and let me tell you the story of my first real breakup.

I met this girl at work. I’m 21 and she’s 18. We fell in love pretty quickly and started dating 2 weeks after we’d met. It lasted for about 8 months and both of us were really happy in the relationship. We were two completely different people, but never had any issues or big fights. Just a few little bumps, which I think happens in any relationship.

At the end of February my then gf went out with her friends, which she had done before and I was completely fine with. This time was different than other times though. The day after two friends of mine messaged me, saying they saw my gf dancing and being “a little too friendly” with some guy. I messaged her about this, asking what actually happened and we got in a big fight. I knew she didn’t do anything with this guy, but I felt like she had pushed the limit and thereby not respecting me, even though she said she was “just being social”. I think I had a hard time with this because my first girlfriend (we lasted only 3 months and I don’t think it was “real love”) cheated on me. I told her this, but she said it wasn’t fair to compare her to the other girl. Which I realize now.

For the next two weeks we had little contact, because she wanted space to think about me not trusting her. Of course I made all the classic mistakes by not giving her that space and trying to fix things between us, which eventually pushed her to breaking up with me. 

When she broke up she said she was probably going to regret the decision, as our relationship was amazing and she had always imagined us staying together and having a future together. She had said that before and we had also talked about getting our own apartment within a year or so, so I genuinely believed she broke up with me because she just needed some time apart to clear her mind and get things straight.

Of course, again, I made all the classic mistakes. Kept contacting her, trying to talk about the relationship and fix things, because it felt right to me. Also tried to talk to her after work two times, which caused her to be upset with me even though I tried to have a calm conversation with her. We just needed to be together. This went on for about 3 weeks until she eventually told me she still loved me, but after what happened she wasn’t in love with me anymore and she felt like she had more freedom to do whatever she wants now. Seeing these words on my screen broke me even more than when she broke up with me, because this felt like all the hope I still had, was gone now. She broke NC twice, but it was to talk about something that happened at work, which eventually caused her to quit. She wouldnt talk about us.

For about two weeks after this we mostly didn’t have contact, but I broke NC a few times to check up on how she was doing and if anything had changed on her side, but it hadn’t. She responded to my texts, but only with one word answers and showed absolutely no interest in how I was doing etc. I tried this like 3 times over the course of two weeks, but nothing seemed to change and she told me she wanted to be left alone, since we couldn’t remain friends after such a good relationship. Now she doesn't even seem to miss me, which I can’t handle. She had always been the one in the relationship that spoke about her feelings all the time; how happy she was, how she wouldn’t let me go without a fight and how sure she was of our future together. She would already miss me the day after we saw each other, but now she’s fine without me. A few weeks ago she told me that she really wanted me to be happy, but she hasn't cared once to see how I'm doing.

The thing is: in the end she did give up without a fight and that’s the thing that’s been the hardest on me. I made the mistake that caused all this, but her not fighting for us broke my heart. And still I fought and I fought to make up for the mistake(s) I made, but she wouldn’t have any of it.

When I realized this, I decided to go NC on her. It’s been 8 days now and it’s killing me. I have the urge to show her I learned from my mistakes and that I’ve grown from this experience, but I realize it probably won’t have the effect I desire. Instead I try and keep myself busy. I have been going to the gym for about 2 years, but during the relationship it mellowed down a bit due to having less time. Now I’m going 5 times a week and those 2 hours of the day are the only 2 hours that I don’t feel miserable. 

I work 40 hours a week  as an intern at an office, 16 hours in the grocery shop I met my ex (she no longer works there, thank god), work out 5 times a week and try to do lots of things with my friends. I also started watching shows on Netflix again, which I did a lot before I went into the relationship. Even though I’m occupied most of the time, I’m never too busy to miss her. It’s been almost two months since the breakup and 8 days of no contact and I’m still hoping for her to message me, which is tearing me apart.

I’m still in doubt whether NC is the right thing here, as I’m still torn between wanting to move on and wanting her back, because I feel this breakup isn’t fair to how good the relationship was. For now I’m holding on the NC though. It hasn’t gotten easier yet. I feel “fine” for a day or 2 and the third I’ll break down. The past few days have been terrible. I’m irritated and tired (since I can’t sleep at night) and it’s really wearing me down. I have two exams this week which I really have to focus on, but I’m struggling. 

I’m having a hard time letting her go and can’t seem to block out my love for her even though everyone around me says that I’m better off because she never even tried to fight for us. But I would be lying to myself if I said I can see that she isn't the one for me. I still kind of believe that she is.

Any advice for me here? I’m still broken and could really use some help..

TL; DR:
She broke up with me because I didn't trust her. Me not giving her space post breakup pushed her further away from me and made her go from ""There's still a chance we could get back together"" to ""I don't want a relationship right now"". 8 days of NC and I'm struggling to keep myself together.

68snon,167,2017-05-02,The Intern,Bbtossacct,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/68snon/the_intern/,"I work at a small manufacturing company headquarters in midtown Manhattan, with about 25 employees in our office. We have 200 employees in a factory in New Jersey and another in South Carolina. Last May, after 3 years, i had just been promoted to Assistant Human Resource Manager, and my boss called me into his office.

""Ken, meet Spencer.  He will be interning this summer. He is a Junior at Fairfield university, majoring in business"". He smiled, rose, and extended his hand. Cute I thought. Too bad I didn't dip the pen in the company ink well so to speak, or else I'd definitely hit on him.

""Ken, need you to spend the morning getting Spencer and his paperwork completed then run him through rules and regulations. Then take him over to Marketing and introduce him after lunch. He will rotate between departments the next 3 months. 

I gazed at the eye candy as he dutifully filled out his paperwork. He had wide shoulders and a thin waist but hard to assess his body behind the navy blazer and shirt and tie. ""Spencer, we are a casual dress work environment, so you need not wear coats and ties. When you intern in sales, however they do wear coats and ties on sales calls. If you want, you can leave your coat and tie in my office, and pick them up after work."" Already undressing the lad you pervert, I thought. 

Spencer stood and pulled off his jacket and tugged on his tie.  Definitely some body definition. And when he turned and hung them on the back of my door, glimpsed that sweet tight and high ass. Damn what I'd do to get him out of those khakis 

Took Spencer to the deli across the street for lunch. Learned he lived in Connecticut, played soccer in high school, and liked the Yankees. He asked about me and I filled him in. He asked if I was married, and I chuckled and said I was gay. It was so cute how flustered he got. "" Oh sorry Ken... oh that sounded bad.. I mean I'm sorry I asked about your personal life..um not that lm sorry you are gay""

No offense taken, Spencer.  

Dropped him off I'm Marketing and got back to work. At the end of the day, he poked his head through the door. ""Hey Ken, came to claim my coat and tie"". He said with a smile. Stood up and said, ""let me buy you a drink, and you can tell me how your first day went. His eyes lit up and said ""that sounds great! "". Sat at a table in a hotel bar around the corner and ordered 2 beers. The waitress eyed us, and asked for ID. After she left, I sighed. ""25 and still getting ID'd"". ""You obviously don't come here then, or she'd know you"". I laughed ""nooo let's just say I go to a more ""male friendly"" environment"". 

""There's a gay bar around here?"" Spencer said with the innocence of a puppy. ""Yep around the corner.""  ""Were queer and were near"" I joked. 
"" can we go there?""
""Mmm not sure that's a good idea. Young good looking guy like will have the pervs all over you""

""Well we will just tell them we are on a date. They won't bother us. Please I've always wanted to see what a gay bar was like"" he pleaded

We walked around the corner and I was thinking hard. Shit took me almost a year to get up the nerve to go to a gay bar, and shit I was gay. What straight guy wants to go to a gay bar. We walked in and was fairly empty. Couple guys eyed Spencer, and he really surprised me by taking my hand and walking over to a table. He leaned in and whispered ""that should hold em off eh?"" With a smile. Around 6 crowd picked up and I groaned when I saw Rick. ""Ex"" I said looking at Rick at the bar. ""And a prick"". Rick turned spotted me and smirked. He walked to the table, and asked who the ""new cutie"" was as if Spencer wasn't even there.  Spencer looked at the asshole and said ""I'm Spencer. Kens date. Then leaned over and kissed me hard. Don't know whose expression was more surprised mine or Ricks. Rick left and Spencer looked at his watch. ""I need to catch a train. In case you haven't figured it out I'm gay too. I think you are cute. Any chance we go out Friday?""

My jaw dropped. "" sure""

Week flew by, and Friday afternoon Spencer came in my office knapsack over his shoulder. ""Think we could drop this off at your place before we go out?""  

""Sure"" 

""Overnight stuff in case we are out after the train stops running ""

Felt my cock twitch. This guy wanted toasty over?  Got to my place and handed Spencer a beer. He put it down and started unbuttoning his shirt. "" mind if I take a quick shower before we go out?""  He stripped in front of me.  He walked over with a smile and unbuttoned my top button ""care to join me?""

In my head, I imagine a visual tool that has a various racks (server or networking rails) that you can drag and drop objects (like servers, switches, firewalls, etc) like stencils onto various RU positions, and then click to edit details or aspects about what is occupying the rack.

The same for patch panel inventory, where each port on a panel can be defined as to where it terminates (simple Label), what is plugged into it in that room, and also the switchport to which it's patched.

Device 42 seems like it has some of these features, but I'm hoping for some other products out there that are somewhat visually rich, so we could easily print a front and a back of a rack and hand it off to an intern to do things like decommission or reboot, or swing a new cable/fiber over."

68v1kb,18,2017-05-02,Me [27M] living abroad have gotten into confusing situation regarding living situation with GF [24F] upon return,throwaway980-987,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/68v1kb/me_27m_living_abroad_have_gotten_into_confusing/,"So I have been living abroad for the past 8/9 months, with another 3/4 to go. I will be returning to the city I left, where she lives, 100% no questions asked. It has not been easy, but we have made it work. Important to note that we dated in the same city for only 4 months before I left.

A few months ago my gf said she wanted to start looking for a place of her own (currently has roommates, sick of having roommates generally). I understood and supported. It evolved into her kind of roundabout asking me one day (she said just before asking that she didn't want to bring it up this way) what I thought about living together. It's not something I'd really given much thought to before that, given there wasstill 6/7 months to go at the time. I felt a little put on the spot, and replied with the first thing that came to my head, that I thought the best thing for our relationship would be to not live together immediately after being apart for a year with relatively little time in the same city. Obviously there are pros and cons generally to living together, but I gave my thoughts in the moment. It's definitely not a ""never"" live together answer,it's something i definitely that would be a great thing if the relationship has the proper time to grow once we are back in the same place. She felt like I never even gave having the conversation a full chance.

She has continued to look for places of her own, as she has said she wants her own place and it would definitely be a good thing for us. This obviously puts a lot of pressure on her, which I am extremely cognizant of. There are other options, like just continuing with roommates until we have a chance to be together in the same place and let moving in take its natural course. However, I feel boxed in, where if I go back and suggest that it seems like I've been manipulating her and making her waste her time. I just want her to be happy where she lives, I can't wait to get back to see her and be in the same place regardless of living situation. I've never really been able to articulate this, I feel like I will be attacked in some way.

The current situation is that she thought she could get over the honest thoughts I gave about moving in together right upon my return. She is exhausted from searching for places (note a place wouldn't actually be needed until August), and feels depressed and hurt and embarrassed by it all. I don't know where I went wrong (though I am obviously open to critical assessments of my behavior, I've tried to be as unbiased here as possible), or how I can fix things. She always says she feels alone and has to do everything for us. I feel trapped and afraid to give my opinions. I don't want to make this overlong, but I think there are also some trust/anxiety issues (e.g. I took a summer internship abroad, which extended my time away and which I was upfront could happen, and I was basically accused of being unfaithful; I have been too chicken to bring this up again, which I know is my own problem/failing in communication). As in any relationship, there is always more interrelated context, but I will leave it at this.

Thoughts, insight, criticisms all welcome! I need help.

TLDR: living abroad, discussions about moving in together when I get back have taken a bad turn.

EDIT: sorry for such an early edit, but she just said in response to me telling her she's never pathetic to me and that I'm sorry I made her feel embarrassed that ""she'll just never be enough"". Needless to say I don't think this is true, and if she wasn't enough we wouldnt have made it this far."
68w5ay,5,2017-05-02,"Need help with college situation, I'm into her and she might be into me. What's the next step? If it doesn't work I don't want to ruin our friendship.",mostimmaculatehair,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/68w5ay/need_help_with_college_situation_im_into_her_and/,"Hey guys/gals, first post here and would appreciate help from the fantastic Reddit community ;) .

|Some Background info|: 
I am a first-year student in the UK at top university studying engineering. I have quite a heavy workload, and being from an immigrant family my parents expect me to work really hard (which tbh I sorta am), hence less ""social time"" than other university students. I have never had a girlfriend, but have kissed girls at clubs and other events in the past couple of years (though I never really loved any of them). I am by no means very attractive, but would say about average. I am looking for a long relationship with the girl I'm into, probs like everyone here ;)

|The current situation|:
1) So I met a girl in my lectures/volunteering project and we get on really well. She is in the same accommodation block as me (70+ students) and I have been to her flat a couple of times, though with friends from my flat too. I have spent alot of time one-to-one with her (in a project I'm working on with her,) and I find her funny etc. and I think she gauges the same qualities from me. I don't think she has ever had a boyfriend either even though she is very sociable and hot, maybe for the same reason as me (she is from the same ethnicity as me).

2) So over our holidays I messaged her alot on FB and there was definitely chemistry. We made loads of jokes at each other and just generally flirted. Everything seemed great!

3) Fast-forward to now, the start of the exam-term and we meet on the first day, just for a quick catch-up chat. It was nice, but quite awkward, not quite as direct/exciting as our messaging on FB. Since this, we haven't spoken once, even though I go to the same lectures and see her sometimes from a distance. I once just nodded at her but no talking, felt quite intimidated as she was with all her other friends.  It's been 10 days and I haven't messaged her once either, I feel like if I do I will look desperate :( . I am really lost on the next step. 

|Reddit I need your help|:
a) So the first problem I'd like to solve is our friendship. How do I get back in contact with her without seeming desperate. My friends in the flat make jokes at me when I mention her, hence I find it awkward when I'm with them and her currently. The only time I could catch her is on route to lectures before she's met her other friends (so she'll sit with me). I have a slight feeling she likes me but I feel like we need to be friends before I can make a move. How can I be sure she likes me, and could she think I don't like her from all the awkward ignoring? I am not as socialble as her (hug friends etc., very good public speaker). 

b) I think it is too early to make a move now, during exams, and she may not appreciate it. I probably won't see her over summer as I have an internship and I'm sure she's got things to do.  So It could be as late as October (when term starts) to ask her out. I do not mind asking her out this late if it leads to something long term. Is this a good move? 

c) Finally, how do I get rid of this awkwardness from all around me. By this I mean; friends making jokes about her etc, me and her awkwardly acknowledging each other but not actually having a conversation. How do I initiate conversation again after a long time and hint that I am interested still (even though she may have got mixed reactions from me)?

Thanks

We moved in together after college, working jobs that both of us knew we were better than. My anxiety was really bad and she was really focused on her next career move. I was as well, but I kept putting more and more energy into the idea of ""us"". We were not that happy, because we were both so stressed. We weren't sleeping together, we weren't hanging out anymore. No real physical contact. It was an end that was coming for a while. We ended up moving away to different, big cities and officially broke up in May '16. 

She finished her internship and moved out to the other city I was in. Then she found out that I had rebounded (casual- no relationship AT all) with a distant friend. She went from ""I'm coming back for you. We're going to work on things"" turned into ""we're completely done."" Eventually we were able to become good friends again because we have so many close mutual friends. We made out on New Year's and drunkenly talked about starting over in like...March? but...

She had been seeing someone else while she was interning and they are still ""talking"". The new girl has traveled out here to see her,  and vice versa, the new girl is falling for her... but doesn't want her to be friends with her 'crew'-mainly me- anymore. The new girl has been described as kind of mean and manipulative. NewGirl is thicker than me, NewGirl challenges her, NewGirl makes more money than I do.  She(my ex) has made a couple comments that imply that she doesn't want to completely let things go with her ""friends"" because she doesn't exactly know what will happen with NewGirl and will not call her her new girlfriend...

So what do I do? Have this dramatic movie moment and finally say that I miss her and still love her and don't think our relationship was a phase (same-sex)? Do I leave it alone? Our friends don't think she's trying to avoid the hurt of a breakup, so am I giving her too much power by saying how I feel? 

We had plans, we were in love at one time, we invested in each other.  I truly think we've matured a lot over the past year and if we tried again it could work again. I can't stop thinking about her. when I'm sad I want to talk to her, when I see something funny, I want to tell her, I want to see her everyday and I want to work things out and try again. and I didn't want to make this too long, but the only reason I'm still holding on is because I think she has a similar feeling, but we're both waiting for the other one to make a move. We're both capricorns, but I express my emotions outwardly and she doesn't. What the fuck do I do? "
68waim,66,2017-05-02,"The Sitter, part 1 [Mf]",DaddyGriff,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/68waim/the_sitter_part_1_mf/,"I closed the front door quietly behind me, my eyes becoming accustomed to the gloom of the house. Hanging my jacket and loosening my tie, I glanced upstairs to see only the faint glow of the nightlight from the baby's room and nothing else – and, more importantly, no sounds of crying or screaming to pierce the cool night air that I had brought with me. Strangely, though, there were no sounds coming from downstairs, and only a low light creeping under the living room door. 

Walking softly, I gently pushed open the door to the living room, and could instantly see that the glowing light was coming from the silent TV, which was showing some late-night cable horror movie – I could see an attractive busty redhead running upstairs in a tiny skirt, mutely screaming, followed by a cloaked figure. 

Across the room, supine on the couch, head propped on a pillow and remote dangling loosely from one hand, my babysitter Katie lay, somehow still managing to look beautiful even when sound asleep, quite the feat. Her thick long dark hair framed her heart-shaped face, and her outfit – knee-length green skirt, thin cardigan sweater (a little impractical for a comfy night on the couch, but I wasn't complaining) – clinging to her ripe, 18-year-old body. We had known Katie and her family for about 6 years, since we moved to the area, and I'd seen the lithe brunette transform into a tan teenager who turned heads wherever she went. As beautiful as she was, though, Katie dated infrequently, and, admirably, remained focus on her college studies. Even now I could see a small pile of textbooks next to her on the couch that she must have been scanning as she fell asleep, with the TV on mute as a silent companion. I looked down at her, eyes scanning her face and body, my head full of memories. 

An image of pulchritude, Katie had developed well and early, and her current 38D-24-34 figure (my wife had taken her clothes shopping a couple of times when she was younger and her parents were away) was truly a sight to behold. She occasionally stayed with us when her parents were out of town, and even though she was now old enough to be on her own, and had been for some time, she enjoyed staying with us, sometimes cooking dinner for the family, or playing piano for us. I won't lie – having a gorgeous young woman in the house, wandering down to breakfast in tank top and pajama pants, or exercising on the back deck in tight yoga pants, did wonders for my libido. I found myself especially randy on the nights Katie stayed with us, and would screw my wife with a notable vigor, my mind racing with the possibility of Katie in the next room, hearing us fuck as she lay in bed. 

I had come to terms with the strange mix of feelings I had for Katie – that of a surrogate father, who wanted to help take care of and nurture her, as well as the dark lusts that she stirred up within me – and we had a comfortable, slightly flirtatious relationship. We would often sit up and have a couple of beers when my wife was working late (which, these days, was increasingly often) and she was warm, witty and pleasant company, her throaty laugh filling the room and her wide, dancing eyes marking me, telling me that she knew all of my secrets.

Even as this thought flitted through my head, those deep brown eyes opened and Katie stirred, propping herself up on one arm, her ripe tits pushed together into the V-neck of her sweater, the deep cleavage enticing. I forced my eyes to lock onto hers as I smiled. 

""Hey, sleepyhead,"" I said softly. 

""Griff!"" Katie started, looking around. ""I'm – I'm sorry, I didn't mean to fall asleep, is the baby-?""

I laid a comforting hand on her upper arm. ""Shh... the baby's fine, sound asleep upstairs."" I gestured to the monitor on the dresser, from which issued the soft sounds of breath. ""The baby made it through a few hours, so I guess you get paid tonight,"" I added, smiling. 

Katie sat up, rubbing the sleep out of one eye daintily, and I sat next to her on the couch, turned to face her with my arm along the back of the cushions. ""You're such a tease,"" she said, lightly slapping my wrist. ""You know you never have to pay me, I like to help out so that you guys can go out and romance it up."" She winked exaggeratedly, giggling.

I frowned. ""Fat lot of good that did tonight,"" I said. 

Katie instantly picked up on this, sliding a little closer, a hand on my knee. ""Something up, boss?"" she asked with a smile – always trying to cheer everyone up.

""Ahh, you don't want to hear my troubles,"" I said, patting her hand. The night's young, I'm sure you could still go out clubbing.""

""Griff,"" Katie said, sternly but with the ghost of a smile still on her perpetually pouty, bee-stung lips, ""I'm sitting right here, ready to hear all about it. But first – how about I get you a beer?""

A smile crossed my face again. ""You're an angel, you read my mind.""

""Don't you move, mister man,"" she said, bouncing from her seat and hurrying to the kitchen, her firm ass switching in the little skirt. I felt an inappropriate thought about her – probably the millionth - cross my mind, and silently cursed myself for it, feeling like a dirty old man. Never forget, you're 20 years older than her, I told myself. Before I could chastise myself further, Katie popped back into the living room, 2 cold bottles of beer in hand, and sat with me, closer still this time, putting one in my hand and taking a sip from hers. ""Shoot. Tell Katie all your troubles,"" she said, her head on one side, coolly regarding me with those amazing eyes.

""Not much to tell,"" I began, taking a sip myself. ""Things were going fine – well, not bad – when I dared to mention that Jen's been working late a lot, working weekends, and we haven't had a lot of time together. She took it badly, kind of blew up at me."" 

""Poor thing,"" Katie said, rubbing my knee. ""I can't say I'm surprised, though. Maybe it's not my place to say –""

""No, go on, please,"" I urged, smiling at her. 

""Well, it seems like she's putting a lot on you. Working all those hours, expecting you to pick up the slack around here – I'm learning all about it in my social studies class, she's cast herself as the victim. Has... has your sex life slowed down, too?"" she asked, looking down. 

""It's like you've been peeking in our bedroom, cutie,"" I said, shaking my head. ""She hasn't come near me in months."" 

""That's what I thought,"" Katie said, her hand still on my knee, stroking softly now. ""Sorry, I interrupted your story, please, go on."" I dragged my eyes from the deep well of her cleavage to her pretty face and smiled reassuringly before continuing.

""Things got worse when a girl from my office saw me and came over to say hello. As soon as she walked away from our table, Jen practically accused me of sleeping with her. After the meal she announced she's sleeping at her sister's house tonight.""

""Why would she do that? Accuse you of sleeping around?""

""Well, I can understand – a little. This girl, Bryce, is very flirty, and she was pretty much ignoring Jen.""

""What does this – girl – look like?"" Katie asked, sipping from her bottle.

I looked up, as I remembered Bryce stopping at our table, touching my arm, thrusting her boobs in my face. ""She's an intern, maybe 19 or 20 - about 5'8, long dark curly hair, big brown eyes, big tits – and she knows it. She shows them off whenever she can, and dresses kind of slutty."" As I looked back down, Katie was smiling, her eyes alive, like we were sharing secrets.

""So is that your type?"" she asked, giving me a knowing smile, knowing full well that, physically, I had pretty much just described my teen babysitter to a tee.

""Well, aside from the slutty part,"" I admitted, setting my beer on the table. ""I like my girls to look a little more professional and demure.""

""You like them to act that way, too?"" Katie asked, leaning closer.

""In public, sure,"" I said, leaning in conspiratorially, enjoying this. ""But in private, when we're all alone...""

""A total slut?"" Katie asked. ""Someone that will do whatever you say?""

""Something like that,"" I replied, not losing eye contact, a wry smile on my face. The beer, along with the wine I'd had with dinner, was creating a low buzz in my head and I knew I shouldn't be having this conversation with Katie, but something else told me to press on. I was talking about sex with a beautiful young brunette, which was certainly the highlight of my night. 

""Griff?"" Katie asked, biting her lip, a slight look of nervousness crossing that beautiful face. 

""Yes, Katie?""

""You know we can trust each other, right? And that I would never dream of betraying your confidence – to anyone?""

""Of course, sweet thing,"" I said, patting her hand. ""I trust you completely.""

""Good. So did you fuck that girl?""

I almost spit out the mouthful of beer I had just taken; laughing and coughing, I set my bottle down. ""Excuse me?"" I said, still smiling. 

""Bryce, the girl who was flirting with you at dinner. The one who's your type – almost,"" she corrected, smiling. ""Is your wife right? Did you fuck her?""

Hearing that word from the mouth of this innocent young girl was shocking but, I had to admit, arousing. We had never talked this frankly before. I shook my head. ""No. No, I didn't,"" I answered.

""Never even thought about it? Not even one innocent little kiss?""

I tried to maintain my serious, innocent face, but it didn't last and a smile broadened there. ""We did have a little make-out session at the New Years' party at work, just a little drunken grope in one of the conference rooms,"" I admitted, remembering the brief tryst on the huge oak conference table, with Bryce's tongue in my mouth and my hands on her luscious ass, her legs around me as we ground together. 

""Just kissing?"" Katie asked, leaning further forward now, pupils dilated, as excited by this conversation as I was. ""This sounds like a pretty hot girl. You didn't get to second base?"" she asked, eyebrow raised. ""Third? Alllll the way to home plate?"" she added in a breathy, sex-operator whisper.

I shook my head, too far gone now to pretend innocence; I had to tell the whole truth, grateful in a sense to have someone to finally tell the secret to. ""I had her tits out of her bra and I was sucking on them while I rubbed her pussy through her panties – she was shaved, and so fucking wet – I made her cum that way. ""

""Lucky girl,"" Katie said; her voice was low now, almost lustful. ""Did she return the favor?"" Katie's eyes darted to my crotch, where the memory of my New Years' Eve liaison was evident in my growing hardon. 

""She went down on me,"" I said, my mouth dry, cock aching-hard now, from the frustrating evening I'd had and from this sexually-charged chat. ""She was good, too. No gag reflex that I could tell.""

Katie's chest was heaving a little faster now, and her cleavage was slightly flushed and pink. Maybe it was my imagination, but I swore I could see her nipples stiffen and push at the material of her sweater. ""Did she... swallow it? Did you cum in her mouth?""

""Partly,"" I said, dragging things out – I was enjoying turning this teen sexkitten on, seeing her in a whole new light. We were practically face-to-face now on the couch, an electrical charge building between us. 

""Griff?""

""Yes, Katie?""

""Where did the rest of the cum go?"" Katie said, licking her glistening pink lips. 

""I shot some of it in her mouth, and the rest on her tits. She cupped them and held them up so I could milk my cock dry onto them, then –""

""And then what?"" Katie said, her hand on my arm, fingers digging into pliant flesh. 

""Then she licked the cum off her tits, and sucked my cock nice and clean... before we rejoined the party.""

There was a long pause; Katie's eyes bored into mine, and her nipples were now obviously poking at her sweater. She set down her beer, returning her gaze to mine.

""Have you fucked her since?"" she asked, biting her lip, her voice coy now.

I shook my head. ""We've exchanged a few flirty looks at work, but no.""

""I bet she wants to. I can't blame her. You're a good-looking man, Griff.""

I threw out a tester. ""A good looking married man,"" I said. 

Katie shrugged. ""I can read between the lines. Jen's not exactly nice to you, and she's never around. I can't blame you for responding when a pretty young thing flirts with you, or wants to get closer to you -' she slid a little closer on the couch, out thighs pressed together, the heat of her firm young skin transferring to mine ' – or even when a young woman – maybe even one you've known for a long , one who's always looked up to you – tells you that she wants nothing more, right now, than for you to pound the shit out of her."" Katie grabbed hold of my tie, pulling me closer to her, and my hands slid around her waist. ""I wouldn't blame you at all.""

In an instant, my tongue was in Katie's sweet, hot mouth, and my hands closed over the perfect globes of her ass through the skirt, pulling her onto my lap. As she parted her legs, straddling me, the skirt slid up around her waist, and as I looked down, I could see her panties rubbing against my straining hardon. Katie pulled hard and my tie slipped free and flew off; she was mewing as she kissed me, grinding hard against my crotch and panting.

""Why'd you have to tell me about fucking that lucky little slut's mouth?"" she said, between kisses, her hands on my chest, unbuttoning my shirt. ""I was being such a good girl, and now you've got me so fucking wet I can't stand it, Griff.""

""Are you jealous?"" I said, unbuttoning her skimpy sweater to reveal her full, ripe tits in a black bra that matched her panties. 

""FUCK yes!"" Katie groaned as I kissed my way down between her tits, sighing as I tasted her, her fingers tangling in my hair. ""I get jealous enough when you fuck Jen in the next room... I can hear her moaning, taking your big cock, begging for more... I lay there, and I shove my dildo in my pussy till I cum hard... I put my pillow over my mouth so you can't hear me...""

I had her bra off now; it lay in a pile on the floor with her sweater and my shirt. ""Well, I want to hear you tonight, babygirl,"" I said, licking her nipples, making her moan. ""Do you want me to fuck you?""

""Oh... god, yes, Daddy... please... PLEASE fuck me hard, fuck your babygirl, I've wanted it so fucking long...""

Everything seemed hyper-real; the light in the room from the flickering TV screen seemed drawn to Katie's smooth skin as I ran my fingers over her. My hands were inside her panties, kneading her ass cheeks, while I suckled on her hard, pink, pencil-eraser nipples, biting gently, making her gasp and cry out. Katie was grinding hard, rubbing her pussy up and down on my bulging erection through our clothes, tongue flickering at my earlobe, her breath coming in quick pants, pulling back to cup my cheeks and look down into my eyes, dark passion written across her face. All of this seemed like a sudden, intense dream, but Katie's fingers hungrily tugging at my hair as her tongue flashed across my lips let me know it was very real.

""I never knew..."" I began, drinking in her beauty. ""I didn't know you wanted this.""

""Griff, I've wanted this... wanted you... for the longest time. I didn't want to cause trouble; didn't want to be a home wrecker... but you know what?""

""What?"" I said, smiling, licking at her fingertip as she touched my face softly.

""If that bitch isn't treating you right... then I will."" 

In one fluid movement, Katie slipped off my lap, kneeling between my parted legs, wearing only her college-girl skirt and panties, dark hair tumbling around her face, covering one eye as she smiled up at me. She ran her hands down my bare chest, and stroked my thighs as she cooed in delight at my throbbing hardon, threatening to burst out of my pants at any moment. 

""This is all mine tonight, Daddy,"" she said, leaning forward to lick along the pulsing ridge of flesh, hands gripping my thighs as she kissed up and down, my prick responding, pulsing harder, like an iron bar now. ""Do you want me to take it out? Does Daddy want me to... lick it?""

I nodded dumbly, fingers digging into the couch, beyond lust now, hungry for this girl like never before, months of pent-up passion built up in me far past the point of no return. My head was buzzing with desire; if Jen had walked in right then, I would have happily fucked Katie on the rug while she watched. Katie was grinning wickedly, shaking her head, dark locks bobbing.

""Uh-uh, Daddy. That's not how it works. You're gonna tell me what you want... every... dirty... little... thing..."" she purred, between kisses on my thigh, ""and Katie's gonna do it. Whatever Daddy wants tonight... you're in charge. I know that's what you want... what you've always wanted. You're a man who deserves what he desires... so take it.""

Her dark, lustful words filled my chest with fire; it had been too long since I'd been the man I used to be, the cocksure college boy who did as he pleased. I felt him pushing to the forefront of my mind; tonight he would come back. Tonight would change everything. 

I stood up, my pulsating hardon in Katie's face as she knelt before me, her hands placed primly on her knees. She bit her full, plump lower lip, gazing up at me, long eyelashes fluttering prettily.

""Take my cock out, babygirl.""

A grin flashed across Katie's glossy lips, but she immediately returned to an expression of mock-servility. ""Yes, Daddy,"" she breathed. 

Katie kept her eyes on mine, large, brown and deep, as she unbuckled and unzipped my pants, pushing them down to my ankles, my boxers tented before her. Katie slid her hands up my thighs, licking her lips as she breathed on my hardon, making it pulse anew.

""Like this, Daddy? Am I doing good?"" she asked, her voice becoming more and more a breathy, innocent-little-girl whisper. I nodded indulgently, stroking her hair, making her close her eyes and lean into my hand, smiling.

""You're doing fine, baby. Keep going, I want you to see everything.""

""And... then I can taste it?"" she asked, her voice full of Christmas-morning excitement. My smile widened.

""Yes, Katie, baby. If you're good, you can taste it.""

""Goody,"" Katie murmured, licking at my cock through my boxers, up and down, opening her mouth around the head, gently suckling it through the cotton. I moaned, my hand still on her head, watching her close her eyes and savor it, like she was getting her first-ever taste of some sweet treat. 

""UhhmmMMMMmm..."" she moaned, releasing it from her full lips with a wet pop. ""Oh, Daddy Griff..."" she trailed off as her nimble fingers worked at the waistband of my boxers, pulling it out... and then down, releasing my cock from its prison. It bobbed free, pulsing in her face, and as she bent to lower my boxers, and raised back up to face it, the throbbing head slapped against her soft cheek.

""Oh, Daddy,"" the hot little brunette groaned, smiling, immediately gripping the shaft gently with her small hands and stroking gently up and down. Her ministrations caused my foreskin to slide back, the swollen purple head pushing free, hot and seemingly bigger than it ever had been before. Katie leaned in, eyes closed in apparent ecstasy as she rubbed my stiff, thick cock over her face like it was an ice pack on the hottest day of summer. Each time the head passed over her wet, parted lips, she gave it a soft kiss or a gentle lick, lapping at it like a thirsty kitten, causing pyrotechnic sensations to shoot up my spine. I sucked air through my clenched teeth, winding her long dark curls in my fingers, gripping a hank of hair to guide her head. Katie got the message and looked up at me expectantly, eyes full of innocent wonder.

""What should I do now, Daddy?"" she asked, her voice carrying only a hint of teasing. 
""Close your eyes, baby,"" I ordered, voice gentle but firm. Katie obeyed, giggling as she closed her eyes tight.

""Now imagine that in front of you is your favorite flavor of Popsicle. Can you do that?""

Katie nodded enthusiastically, playing the young naïf to the hilt. ""I like watermelon best, Daddy.""

""Good girl. Right in front of you is the sweetest, juiciest, tastiest watermelon Popsicle you ever tasted – and it's such a hot day today. Don't you need something sweet to cool you down?""

Again Katie nodded, eyes closed, her sweet breasts jiggling with the movement. ""Oh yes, Daddy, you're so nice to bring me my favorite treat. Can I have it now? I'm so hot...""

""Since you've been so good... yes, you can have it, baby,"" I said, my cock rock-hard and aching for her touch. Katie opened her eyes, said just one word – ""Yummy!"" – and promptly licked, slowly, from the base of my erect prick to the head, letting out a moan of sheer satiation. Holding the base in her small hands, she began licking over every inch of my cock, treating it for all the world like the best watermelon Popsicle ever. Little moans and sighs escaped her perfect lips, soft slurping and licking sounds that only served to further engorge my throbbing prick. Her large expressive eyes flicked up to lock onto mine, showing me the pleasure she was taking in tasting my dick, then returned to the task at hand, as she coated my shaft and balls in saliva, her soft pink tongue making long strokes on my rigid flesh. 

""Enough licking,"" I said, roughly. ""Suck that Popsicle, you little slut.""

As if she had been waiting for the command, Katie opened wide and plunged her mouth over the end of my dick, sinking down on it to the root; holding there for a moment and forming a tight seal with her lips, she slowly pulled back, a long slurping sound coming from that heavenly mouth as she sucked fiercely, only releasing my cock with reluctance, a long wet trail connecting my swollen head with her wet lips. 

I was speechless as she looked up at me, panting and licking her lips, before sinking down on it once more, repeating the entire process, a long, slow, wet, tight suck, before my prick emerged glistening from her teen lips, wet from root to tip. 

""Like that, Daddy?"" she said coquettishly, head to one side. ""Is that what you want?""

""I'll show you what I want, slut,"" I said, my voice dark with passion, loving the way her eyes flashed with each nasty name I called her. I grabbed her hair once more, taking control. I rubbed my wet cockhead back and forth on her lips a few times before pushing inside, and Katie, eyes wide, opened her mouth to take it, moaning blissfully – 'MmHMM!"" – as if this was what she had been waiting for - to have her mouth owned, fucked hard, for me to make her swallow my cock. 

Katie's hands went to my thighs, and then slipped around to cup my ass, as I worked my dick in and out of her mouth, and I could feel the muscles at the back of her throat working as she breathed through her nose, taking every inch. Her beautiful eyes watered but she held firm, letting me guide her, hold her, letting me pump her mouth like I needed, the wet shaft slamming in and out, making sweet slippery sounds, my balls slapping against Katie's chin, her wet slurps and slobbers turning me on more and more. Her fingers gripped my asscheeks, urging me on, and I was happy to oblige, months of passion spilling free, all of the dark thoughts I had harbored about this stunning girl finally becoming reality; I was going to make her my dripping sex-slave, for as long as I wanted. 

I pulled my cock free to let Katie breathe, and she panted, tits heaving as she drooled on my cock, lapping at it with her pink tongue, her twinkling eyes locked on mine. She licked down to my balls, licking and sucking on them, moving from one to the other, going to town on me with gusto. 

""You like Daddy's cock, babygirl?"" I asked, holding my shaft up, watching her roll her tongue around my balls. Katie nodded, releasing my sac from her wet lips.

""Oh god yes, Daddy Griff,"" the brunette moaned. ""It's so good to finally have this sweet cock to myself, to treat it right, the way you deserve –""

I cut her off by hurriedly grabbing Katie's upper arm and pulling her to her feet, roughly turning her around and bending her over the couch. Katie gasped and smiled, her hair in her face and her breath coming in quick puffs. She propped herself up on her hands, her legs spreading wide as I flipped her pretty skirt up over her ripe ass, revealing two firm, full peaches of flesh in black lacy panties. Katie looked back over her shoulder at me, eyes entreating, hungry to see what I would do. I kicked off the rest of my clothes, standing naked behind her, looking her over and holding the base of my cock, the head swollen and wet. Katie bit her full lower lip, her low moan filling the room, and rolled her hips, sticking her luscious ass out at me, silently begging for me to touch, to taste, to do what I pleased. 

I smiled, knowing that drawing this out would prolong the eventual pleasure, and reached out slowly, putting a hand on her ass over the dark lace, rubbing, caressing the ripe skin. Katie moaned loud, her head back, her body quivering with lust.

""Oh Daddy... Daddy Griff... have I been a good girl? Are you gonna reward me... or have I been so, so bad...?""

""You tell me, babygirl,"" I said, kneading the soft, hot flesh a moment longer, and then raising my arm, slow and even, making sure she could see it, palm flat, up over my head, holding there. Katie whimpered louder, biting on the couch cushion, eyes staring, everything about her body language begging for me to complete that movement of my arm, to bring my hand back down, to make hard, sharp contact with her ass. I held it for another long moment, teasing Katie deliciously, until she could take it no longer and opened wide to cry out.

""Daddy, pleas-""

Her words ended abruptly as my hand flew down, spanking her perfect ass, the loud SMACK! echoing through the room. Her behind was pliant, soft yet muscular, toned and firm but yielding and supple. My cock throbbed, my eagerness to feel those cheeks in my hands as I plowed her pussy evident, but all in good time. Katie, eyes closed, was moaning, eyes watering, a look of intense pleasure on her beautiful flushed face. 

""Oh, Daddy,"" she sighed. ""Daddy, Daddy..."" Her ass wiggled invitingly at me, and I raised my hand once more, the fingers tingling from the hard contact, and brought it down once more – SMACK!

Katie cried out again, her moans the stuff that wet dreams are made of, and I began spanking her succulent ass with spirit, making her body shake. Katie tossed her head back, her dark locks flying and her big tits shaking, the sounds coming from her delicious mouth becoming more and more like raw animal grunts. She looked into my eyes, mouth open, and I saw the passion writ large there, the joy this was bringing her.

I slowed my fierce slaps on her firm bottom, then stopped, and Katie, panting, rested her head on my hands as I caressed softly. Grabbing the waistband of her delicate panties, I pulled them down, exposing her ass, now marked in red, clear handprints standing out, stinging-hot. She practically purred as I softly stroked her flesh, Daddy making it all better. 

I knelt down, my tongue starting to follow my fingers, kissing her ripe ass, licking softly, blowing on the skin, and Katie writhed on the couch, trying to hold still, breath hissing between her teeth.

""Oh my god Daddy,"" she said softly. ""Thank you... I'm a bad little slut and I deserved that... you punished me so good."" She smiled, licking her wet lips. She added, panting, ""have I... earned a... reward?""

""Oh, I definitely think so, baby,"" I said, pushing her panties down more, then, as they interfered with the spread of her legs, tearing them free, the sound of the tearing lace seemingly very loud in the small room. I tossed the panties aside (after putting them to my mouth and nose and glorying in the sweet smell of her arousal) then returned my full attention to Katie, and to the sweet, smooth, bare pussy that was now exposed to me. Katie was moving her hips, rocking, unable to keep still, so turned on I could see her pussy juice glistening on her thighs. Unable to hold my hunger back any longer, I kissed my way up her thighs, licking as I went, Katie moaning into the couch – ""oh god oh god oh Daddy oh God yes –"" as I did so. I stopped, mouth poised over her eager young pussy, the lips wet and slightly open, inviting, the nub of her clit poking free slightly, begging me to feast on it. I obliged, starting to lick up and down on her sweet, wet cunt, long strokes of my voracious tongue. 

Katie began to buck and writhe instantly, and my hands held firm on her ass, gripping, digging into the soft flesh, my tongue licking around her hole, lapping up the sweet juices. There's nothing like the taste of a sweet young pussy (call me crazy, but brunettes really do taste better) and Katie was no exception; I licked and lapped, eyes closed, savoring the spiced-sugar and summer-afternoon musk of her, my dick pulsing and throbbing between my legs, knowing that soon it would be buried in this honey-hole. 

Katie was trying hard to muffle her screams and cries with the couch-cushions; I could hear her, moaning through gritted teeth, no comprehensible words, just cries of lust. Every moan urged me on, and I plunged my tongue inside, licking, wriggling deep, causing a new wave of movement to take over the brunette's body. 

""Oh... ffffffFUCK!"" Katie cried before biting on the couch cushion again, and I smiled slightly, flickering my tongue in and out, only emerging so that I could suck on her delicious pink clit, gnawing gently, then sliding my hot tongue back inside to fuck her like a wet little cock, exploring as deep as I could into this tight, steamy hole. My lips were clamped to her pussy lips, my trimmed goatee tickling and scratching at her inner thighs, and Katie's hips were bucking wildly now as I suckled and slurped, noisily eating her wet young cunt like my life depended on it. Oblivious to anything else, I closed my eyes and licked, lapped and sucked my way to her orgasm, which I could sense was building fast; Katie's arms and legs were trembling, and her pussy began to pulse around my probing tongue, her breath fast and frenzied. Her head came back up off the couch and she reached back to tangle her fingers in my hair.

""Oh Griff... oh yes, that's it thatsitthatsitthatsIT... oh Jesus, I've never... oh my GOD..."" Katie jabbered; I plunged on, tongue wildly dipping in and out, wriggling deep, exploring the wet folds of her tight pussy. She pushed back against me, needing me deeper, my face buried happily between her long tan legs. Katie pulled at my hair, making only mewing sounds now, beyond speech as she rode my tongue to orgasm:

""Ohhhhh.... Oh my Daddy... oh DADDY GRIFF YESSSSSS!"" she screamed, her cunt juicily squirting on my outstretched tongue, my chin becoming soaked with sticky-sweet juices. I kept up my attentions, licking and lapping as Katie bucked her hips, gasping as each tremor overtook her, shuddering with pleasure as she slowly... slowly calmed down, her body relaxing, limbs unclenching. Katie lay with her head against the couch, breathing hard. 

""Oh my fucking god,"" I heard her say softly. ""Griff... why doesn't she want your tongue inside her 24 hours a day?""

I laughed, and Katie turned, sitting up on the couch and slipping her arms around my neck, kissing me deeply, licking at my face like a cat, tasting her own sweet pussy on my tongue, my lips, my chin. My hands roamed over her, pulling at her skirt, and she helped me pull it off, stripping herself naked before me. 

""God... you're so fucking beautiful,"" I said, looking down at her as she sat on the couch, pink skin glowing in the low light. Katie blushed prettily, cupping her tits and smiling slyly up at me as my hard cock waved and bobbed in her face, her eyes flicking to it before returning to mine. 

""You like, Daddy Griff?"" she said teasingly, her fingers rubbing over her stiff nipples and her small hands hefting her round tits, holding them up for my approval. In response, I gripped my shaft by the base, sliding it between those perfect globes, and Katie wordlessly wrapped her breasts around the hard rod, spitting on the head and shaft to ease my passage in her deep cleavage. 

""Oh... Daddy Griff does like it..."" she said, tossing her hair back over her shoulders, holding her tits tight around my dick and watching me as I slid up and down, spitting on the bulbous swollen head every time it emerges from her tits to bump at her sweet lips. As I pumped harder, rougher, she opened up and her mouth enveloped my cockhead with every slick thrust, the force leaning her back against the couch as I propped one foot up beside her, my hips pumping as I fucked those perfect tits, that heavenly mouth. Wet, sloppy, slippery sounds emanated from that teen mouth, intermingled with the occasional happy moan or sigh. My own hands replaced Katie's, holding her tits tight around my dick, and Katie's wide eyes, burning into mine, glowed as she slurped and suckled, her fingers straying again between her spread legs to her wet little cunt.

""NO, baby,"" I admonished, not losing my rhythm in and out of her cleavage. ""There'll be no touching that sweet little pussy... not yet. That's all Daddy's,"" I said, losing myself in our little game. 

Katie nodded, mouth full of throbbing cockhead, obediently returning her hands to my ass to squeeze and caress as I titfucked her. 

""Is your pussy all wet for Daddy?"" I asked, teasing, as I stroked. 

""Mhmmm!"" Katie mumbled around my dick.

""Do you want me to fuck it?""

""MmHMMM!"" Katie groaned as she nodded as best she could. 

""God... I bet you're so ready for me to push this cock into your sweet cunt and fuck you nice and hard...""

""MHMMMMMM!"" she practically screamed around my cock, the vibrations sending sweet sensations through my body. I relented, pulling out of her mouth, and sliding out of her tits, leaving her sprawled on the couch panting. 

""Oh Daddy... Daddy Griff, please..."" she moaned, writhing on the couch, showing off that body to me. ""Take me... any way you want me... I'll be good...""

""I know you will, slut,"" I said, my voice dark and rough with lust. Grabbing her, I forcefully flipped her on the couch, manhandling that body until she was bent over, knees on the couch and her hands propping her up, that ass and pussy presented to me. 

""Oh God, Daddyyyyyy,"" Katie practically whined. ""Are you gonna fuck me doggy style? You gonna pump me like that, and fuck my pussy so good?"" She looked back over her shoulder at me, cheeks flushed, waiting, and I stepped up behind her, rubbing my wet, aching cock on the cheeks of her ass, making her moan louder.

""Oh you're gonna keep fucking teasing me aren't you? Please fuck me... fuck me, fuck me, Daddy!"" Her voice was pleading, and I could see from her gleaming thighs that her pussy was soaked by now and ready for another release. I slowly raised my hand, making sure she could see it poised over her ass, made her think she was in for another spanking – and then, suddenly, plunged my rock-hard cock inside that tight, slippery pussy, right to the hilt, my balls resting against her. 

""OH FUCK YESSSSSSSSSS!"" Katie screamed, gripping the couch, mouth open in an O of pleasure. ""Oh DADDY... fuck me, fuck me fuck me fuck meee..."" 

I took a moment to let it sink in; my cock was buried, every inch, inside this velvet-smooth, silky-soft vice-tight pussy of an eighteen-year-old brunette vision of sex, throbbing hard inside her, each pulse sending shudders through her body,

and she was begging for more, for me to take her hard and deep. I didn't intend to waste another second doing anything other than exactly that.

Reaching up, I took Katie's long dark hair in my hand, winding it around my fingers, her head pulling back and her mouth open as she realized I was taking the reins. I ground into her hard, cock stiff, hips rolling, making her whimper with pleasure – and then took complete control. Hammering in and out of her tight little hole, I pulled hard on her thick sheaf of raven hair, making Katie feel every inch buried in her steaming, sopping-wet cunt. Months of sexual frustration, of fantasies about Katie, burst free and I pounded her pussy with complete abandon, making her body quiver and tits shake, and making the couch rock on its feet. 

""Oh Daddy... Daddy... Daddy Griff... OH GOD DADDY, DON'T STOP FUCKING ME!"" Katie shrieked, slamming her body back onto my thrusting prick, meeting my movements, skin slapping against skin, taut and firm. She reached back, gripping my forearms as I plowed into her, that sweet and velvety cunt taking everything I had to offer, stretched tight around my length.

""Daddy?"" Katie asked between gasps and moans, her head turned to face me, her lips wet and her face rosy with exertion.

""Yes, Katie, baby?"" I replied, slowing my speed but not the power of my thrusts, impaling her on cock over and over. 

""Can I ... can I cum? I want to cum so bad..."" she groaned.

""Well, let me think about that,"" I said, a teasing smile on my face, sliding slowly out before slamming home in her pussy once more, making her shriek. ""Are you my slut now?"" I asked.

""Yes... oh God, yes, Griff, I'm your horny little slut,"" Katie hissed, relishing the word, the dirty talk. She rolled her hips, moving my dick inside her as she continued. ""I only want this big fat Daddy cock inside me, anytime you want it. I'm your whore, day and night, and I'll never charge you a penny, Daddy... just please, take me, own me, brand me, and FUCK me till I cum...""

I was in no mood to argue, and dug my fingers afresh into Katie's lush hips, driving my cock like a jackhammer – long, hard, fast attacks that felt like I was splitting her teen pussy open. Katie lowered her head, hair in a dark curtain around her sweaty face, and took it, biting her lip and groaning with each hard thrust inside her. My own sweat dripping on Katie's perfect ass and lower back, I increased the power and speed of my fucking, and the pitch and frequency of Katie's animal cries increased in tandem; I could tell she was riding her way to orgasm now, and I planned on making it an earth-shattering one. 

""Oh fuck,"" she exclaimed, her voice incredulous, ""don't stop. Daddy, FUCK my slutty little pussy, hurt me so fucking good..."" I could feel the muscles of her pussy walls undulating, contracting, bringing her closer and closer, and I released my hold on her hips, grabbing Katie's long hair once more, pulling it forcefully back as I renewed my assault on her tender cunt. Over and over I pounded deeper, and Katie pounded her fists on the couch cushions, body writhing mindlessly in desire. 

""Yes, Daddy, yes, Griff, that's it, keep it right there, oh God – oh GOD I'm... oh FFFUCKKKKK MEEEEEEEEE DADDYYYYY!"" came the primal cry from Katie's throat, the bridles of her hair in my hands, leashes to hold my good little doggy slut as she came, gripping me tight, locking my cock inside, buried tight and deep, the sweet juices of her pussy spurting out and down our thighs, each judder and jerk of her body making me cock pulse, a chain reaction lengthening her orgasm and making us ride it out together. I held myself tight inside Katie, pulling her up, my chest against her back and my hands on her round tits, kissing her neck as her breathing began to slow toward normal. 

""Oh Griff,"" Katie mewed against me, hands in my hair, cupping my face, turning to kiss my cheek. ""You didn't cum..."" she said, sounding a little disappointed.

""That's because we're not done, babygirl,"" I said, kissing those full soft lips. ""Not by a long shot.""

Stay tuned for Part 2, feedback welcome!"
68wiha,27,2017-05-02,Taco Bell Actually Pays Their Interns,ProjectSpreadability,tacobell,https://www.reddit.com/r/tacobell/comments/68wiha/taco_bell_actually_pays_their_interns/,"I’ve been putting myself to a project of determining what makes successful corporate social media page. I feel that a successful social media page for a company would be one that many people share, spreading from their friends, to their friends’ friends and so forth. It’s just hard because the content (AKA free ads) that these pages put out often feel like blatant corporate grabs. The most successful company social media pages are the ones that blend in and can use contemporary internet humor in a way that other users find enjoyable and want to share with their friends (ultimately, successful free advertisement). 

There’s a lot of pages like this that I’ve seen fail (such as the Keebler company twitter page, which resulted in the majority of the responses being people trolling, all asking what the sexuality of the Keebler elves were…..here’s a link if you need any proof: https://twitter.com/KeeblerElves/status/836282261070716928). But then there’s the Taco Bell twitter, which is what all company twitter accounts should aspire to be. Their page works so well because they have a target audience and they know what that audience thinks is entertaining. While doing my research, I actually learned first-hand how important it is to understand your target audience and what they want when I got banned from a subreddit for posting irrelevant content (I kind of misunderstood what the subreddit was about). 

But to continue on the Taco Bell twitter, the success of the page goes to the interns running it. They’re witty and relatable, which makes their content spreadable. 

I didn’t feel like the answer for their success was entirely found though. Their content is spreadable because their social media interns have a set demographic they aim to please and know what content they will like, but how do they find such good employees?

The answer I’m about to offer seems a bit obvious, but good paychecks attract good employees.  

https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Taco-Bell-Social-Media-Manager-Intern-Salaries-E10091_D_KO10,37.htm
https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/digital-content-creator-internship-taco-bell-JV_IC1146798_KO0,34_KE35,44.htm?jl=2380153992
I found exactly what kind of pay the social media interns at Taco Bell get on Glassdoor (in the links above), as well as their benefits and it definitely explained the incentive for working hard. The company’s standards are pretty high for the position, including intermediate Photoshop skills and multiple years of college, but they get their money’s worth while making it worth it for their employees as well. YEAR-ROUND HALF-DAY FRIDAYS. And around $55k a year. You get what you pay for, and they pay for the best, ultimately making a successful page for spreadable media.

68wwll,1,2017-05-02,20F4A - Slut needs a dom daddy,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/68wwll/20f4a_slut_needs_a_dom_daddy/,"
I really want to suck cock while i am dripping with cum from my other holes. And I would very much want to do a scene where we both enjoy a cream filled dessert out of my pussy (or ass ;) ). 
  
Let's do a role play centered around a craigs list or tinder date. One of us would write a fake 'ad' (in the scene) and we would start from there, with our online interactions about setting up a fun date and then work up to our meeting and having wild and crazy fun! I would want the craigs list ad to be quite raunchy and explicit but I would prefer to play as a naive but enthusiastic girl, but i can also be a little older and mature if you have a good reason for it. It would also be fun if you weren't the first date i went on tonight. I want you to be fun, articulate and creative-the best scene suggestions will get my full attention
  
I want to do something involving two sisters (both played by me, or one older sister who we both control). I would like this to be either a kind of competition or a learning experience for me and my sister. However I don't really want this to be a dom/sub thing that much. We can compare our holes, mouths, armpits, and flavors! So if that is something that interests you, and you want to teach two girls-PM Me!
  
or
  
Today I want to focus on armpits. They are incredibly sexy and a mostly overlooked erogenous zone here on dpp. Things we could do can range from chatting about them or doing a role play centered around smelling/licking/cumming in my armpits or if you want to get a little strange, my armpits could have pussies for you to use too. A couple of ideas could be that I am applying for a summer internship but part of the interview involves my scents. Or we could do something like a glory hole but with my armpits and other holes as well. Of course a gang bang would be fun too but this might work best as an intimate one-on-one kind of thing. Message me with what you'd like to do and let's get off!"
68wy0r,7,2017-05-02,CS co-op experiences from students who've already done a work term or two?,mydgnim,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/68wy0r/cs_coop_experiences_from_students_whove_already/,"I'm applying for my first CS co-op, and I was wondering if any of you wiser CS students could share your good/bad co-op experiences and any tips on how to avoid bad co-ops (or find a really good one, barring a ""brand name co-op"").

My co-op coordinator has told me that we are very much pressured to accept the first job offer we get, so I'd like to try focusing my applications on places that have good internship programs.

Thanks!"
68x33h,2,2017-05-02,Needing help to make sure I am on the right path for last year of college,bap015,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/68x33h/needing_help_to_make_sure_i_am_on_the_right_path/,"Here's my info:
22yr old  
Currently pursuing Electrical Engineering Degree(4th year)  
Monthly Expenses Estimated: $797.00 per month  
Current Job: $7.25per hr 11.5 hrs per week  
Job starting in the summer: $20.30 per hr 40hr per week with overtime available   
Outstanding on Credit Card: $4618.90  
Students Loans: ~$26,000  

Here's my situation I am seeking comments if I'm going about this the correct way. For the past year I have had to be focused on my schoolwork very hard and a luckily received an internship at a solid company for the summer. In your opinion should I pay down all of my credit card debt and work to reduce my monthly expenses? I plan on taking this path since I only have three classes left until graduating and I also will need to save from this summer plus work next school year, at a better paying job, in order to pay for my last set of classes($1018 per quarter $3054.00 total). 

Just some more info:    
Internship offers no benefits(health,retirement,etc.). 

Planning to invest in the future but don't think with all my debt that it's an appropriate time.

Have made a budget to track where all money goes along with target dates to pay off credit card

Like I said earlier I just want assurance that I will be using my money to my maximum advantage. If you need anymore information please let me know and I will answer as quickly as possible.

My plans have recently changed since I am unable to intern towards my bachelor's this summer and registered for online classes and I desperately want to make it to the farm for my third year in a row. 
Tickets on stubhub are almost equivalent to buying from the website with their fees so does anybody know of some ticket giveaways or anything of the like? 

I just really want to have the unforgettable experience I always hoped for at Roo (with my best friend for once since she is going!)
My previous years have been soloroo for the most part, and admittedly I had a kind of bad experience last year after getting injured soon after arriving on the farm.

I appreciate any advice/help and hope to see all of you beautiful souls on the farm if I'm lucky!"

68xxws,1,2017-05-02,I'm [26/F] unsure if I should take chance again with my ex [29/M].,wandererpie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/68xxws/im_26f_unsure_if_i_should_take_chance_again_with/,"Okay. I can't think rationally with this, that's why I came here, to get an outsider's perspective. Just a warning. It's rather long.

""Dan"" and I was together for 3yr. For the most part, we were in LDR. I met him when I was 22 and he was backpacking through my country. We hit off instantly and entered into a summer fling that evolved something serious and we decided to do LDR. 

Back then, I thought our biggest hurdle was our culture clash but it wasn't. It was expectations. We agreed I would move to his country and live together. The problem: we disagreed on when. He wanted me to come after my graduation but I wanted to wait until I worked my field so I could obtain experience. We argued a lot about this and it became a huge contention between us. Whenever we visited each other or had a phone call we would fall into the same argument, over and over. It got so bad enough that we left each other angry and despondent but we were too stubborn and too in love to end it. 

Just a few months before my graduation, I sent out feelers in his country near his place without expecting much but surprisingly, I got a hit. Few phone interview and I was offered the position of paid internship with the agreement that I would complete my studies first and they were willing to sponsor for my visa. I was excited like a kid on Christmas and I wanted to surprise Dan the next time he visited, so I kept to myself. 

Dan came to see my graduation. He told me he was proud of me and we went out to celebrate and I was over the moon to tell him about the surprise but I never got to that point because as soon we sat in the restaurant, Dan was sullen, critical and mean. It felt he was picking on a fight and I tried to ignore it because we were supposed to celebrate. Then he made a remark about my choice of career and it set me off. We were arguing, not loudly but enough to catch the attention of the other patrons and I was embarrassed to be put on the spot so I asked if we could shelve our argument for another time. He snapped and became increasingly loud in his displeasure. I got upset because everyone was looking directly at us and I began to gather my things and proceeded to leave but he said: ""If you leave right now, we're over.""

I got fed up with his attitude and I turned to shout at him, ""I just need time to calm down because my boyfriend is behaving asshole on my graduation day!"" and I left, crying on the way. Next day, I figured he was calm enough to talk about it and I called him but he didn't pick up. I texted him, no response. Getting irritated at this point, I went to his hotel only to find out he had checked out. I began to frantically worry and I tried to contact him but without much success. I contacted his parent and friends but they seemed confused as I was. I began to wonder if he really meant his ultimatum. I didn't believe because it seemed it was made out anger and I felt humiliated in public not to take him seriously.

I grew anxious over time without hearing him for days. Out impulse, I flew to his home to confront him because I deserved respect. I deserved to be told to my face that we were over for real into calm fashion. I wish I hadn't. I found him with another girl. I was absolutely wrecked. I could've sworn my heart was breaking then. I never confronted him and I just went back home. 

The company that offered me internship contacted me again to ask me when I should start working. I honestly forgot it and I nearly turned it down but I caught myself in time. Yes, the reason I wanted to move was because of Dan but I fell in love his country while visiting him and I wanted to live there. I figured I had nothing to lose. If I didn't like it, then I would move back. Easy peasy. 

So I moved here. Best thing I ever did. I was incredibly happy working here and I met people. Made friends. Went out the city to explore further than I did before and fell in love again enough to apply for dual-citizenship after months staying here. For a time, I felt better. I felt more myself again. The internship turned into a permanent position and a year passed by.  

One day, I stumbled of one of his friends and we talked for a bit and parted ways. I guess that same friend told Dan I was here because I found him at the lobby of my workplace. I think he was more shocked than I was. He approached me and made small talk. It got so uncomfortable that I was staring at him awkwardly before he finally got around to ask me out for coffee and I agreed because I wanted closure. 

We talked. He apologized for leaving that way. For ghosting. For humiliating me at the restaurant. For every pain he caused. He sounded very remorseful and sincere but I felt myself harden at those words. 

I asked him why he did those things. He told me that he felt he was putting so much in this relationship without getting back in return. That he did everything for me on my terms. Looking back, it was somewhat true. He felt I put my career first and him second and he grew resentful at me. I asked him why he didn't tell me. He told me he knew he was being irrational and he didn't want to be one of those guys who demanded to have his world revolve around him. Still, he couldn't help but feel it and it bled over our relationship. It took him time and distance to realize he was behaving immaturely. He said he regretted it, that he wished he could go back in time and kick his younger self and make him take all back. He said I was the best thing ever happened to him and that he missed me.

He asked me if there was a small chance to try again and I said I didn't know. He said he knows that it's not possible to go back that way but that maybe we could start another better foundation and go from there. It sounded rehashed. Sincere but . . . like he practiced his mirror over and over to say the right words which meant he thought about it a lot. It was everything I wanted to hear but . . . 

...I can't help but think that he threw away as if we were nothing. That I was nothing. That the next week after ghosting me, he was in the arms of another woman. I know he didn't cheat me. In his mind we were broken up but not for me. I can't help but think I deserved more than a shouting ultimatum in a public restaurant. What to say he wouldn't do it again for another stupid resentment, frustration or something else? 

I still love him, despite everything he did. I want to try with him again but I'm not sure if I'm doing it out of sunken cost fallacy. To his credit, he has given me space after I asked for it and often sent me a text that's very friendly and respectful. But I don't know. It's been two weeks since last time we talked and I'm no closer to figuring this out. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Had long distance relationship turned sour due resentment, my SO broke up with me and I didn't realize until I found him with another woman. Time passed, we meet again, he apologized and asked me to try again with him. "
68y53s,4,2017-05-03,Moving to Brentwood for a college internship,Stormcloaks_Rule,nashville,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/68y53s/moving_to_brentwood_for_a_college_internship/,"Hey all,

I have a college internship in Nashville this summer, and my company is paying for all of the interns to live in Brentwood.  This is exciting, but I'm also a bit disappointed to be living in a more spread out area further away from Downtown (I've always wanted to live Downtown in a large city).

I've never lived in a big city before, so I figured I'd ask you guys:  is it still possible to have the ""downtown experience"" while living in Brentwood?  Since I will be working Downtown I figured it would be easy to hang out Downtown after/before work a little bit to get a bite to eat or have a beer, and possibly get an Uber to ride back and forth there on weekends (seems that Ubers are only around $10 to drive from Brentwood to Downtown).  

Does this sound doable?  Do any of you do something similar?  I also read in another thread that after commuting to Nashville for a week you won't want to go back there for the weekend.  Can anyone give their opinion on that?

Additionally, what is the general attitude of Brentwood?  I've heard that it's a lot of conservative old people, but is the vibe generally friendly or stuck-up?

Thank you so much for the help.  I'm still young and have lived in a city with about 4k population for 90% of my life, so I apologize if any of these questions seem dumb to you."

Gaea is what the scientists called it--an animal at the bottom of Earth's oceans that encompassed nearly the circumference of our planet. We had tracked earthquakes to its heartbeat, tsunamis to its breaths, and volcanic eruptions to its muscle twitches. Its body extended through every landmass in the world. The most popular theory was that the landmasses *were* its body, an extension of debris caught up in its scales.

The days of Pangaea came from its youth, when it had yet to grow around the planet. But as the years passed and its reach grew from the north pole to the south, the land had split apart into the things we called *continents*.

Funny, we had spent so much time looking to the heavens for our gods and one slept right under our feet.

Professor David Michelob worked at the International Gaea Research Institute. Almost overnight, everything he had spent his life learning and publishing all went down the drain. Earth's tectonic movement? Just the expansion of Gaea's scales as it breathed. Hurricane weather caused by massive warm fronts? Gaea must've exhaled.

For the first time in his life, he knew as much about seismology as the Freshman students he taught at Stanford. And also for the first time in his life, seismology was the most needed skill on Earth.

""The tick's still there,"" Erin said, her face illuminated by the blue glow of a computer screen.

The digital clock read 2:02 AM and the only light in the room came from that and the computers. Over fifty people hunched over their respective stations in an eerie silence filled only by the whir of computer fans.

""Once more,"" Erin said again at 3:05 AM.

David twisted his hand and matched the digital clock to his wristwatch. There was no mistaking it. For months they had tracked the separate chambers of Gaea's many hearts and for months, David prayed that his theory was wrong. But the data just wouldn't agree.

""Do we raise a flag?"" Erin looked to David with bloodshot eyes. ""Maybe its something else?""

""Perhaps,"" David said, prayed. After all, they were tracking bubbles in the ocean, large masses oxygen pushed out every time one of Gaea's right ventricle so much as twitched. ""Just to be safe, we should probably inform the President.""

If his theory was correct, all world ending events started with Gaea, more specifically, her awakening. If she so much as yawned or stretched, every volcano would erupt, every landmass would split in two, and tsunamis of biblical level would flood the Earth and drown everyone inside it.

So probably better to be safe.

""Yeah,"" David said again, this time more certain. ""You get the President, I'll get the UN. Lets--""

""Again,"" Jake, the intern called out from his machine.

David's mouth stayed open. He peered through the darkness at his intern's glowing blue face. ""You sure Jake?"" he checked his wristwatch, then the digital clock. 3:10 AM.

Jake was a bright boy, but still only an intern, and this proved it.

""I think you're reading it wrong,"" David said with a grin.

""I got something here."" someone else.

David felt his face flush. He glanced at the clock. 3:11 AM.

""Movement here too.""

""I got something.""

""The readings are off the charts.""

He gritted his teeth and peeked at his watch. Still 3:11 AM.

""Erin,"" he muttered.

""Should I call the President?"" she squeaked.

David shook his head. ""No, call your loved ones."""

I have always been interested in learning how to program. Would it be a good idea to decline the offer and enter a coding boot camp instead? Would these skills be worth it in the long run?"

Last but not least, I want to share the fact that I'm SUPER EXCITED TO ATTEND UCSB THIS FALL! GO GAUCHOS!"

I'm thinking of taking one of two paths:


    Get an internship or entry level job in digital marketing (agency / in-house)
    
    Pros: training on the job, gaining relevant experience that'll accelerate learning

    Cons: Low pay - not enough to fund my own campaigns + tools, quality of training depends on company +
    position, Agency life = working late hours + lots of outside 'team-building' events with co-workers -&gt; 
    leaves little time to build passive income on the side, could lead to burnout?


    Get a ""9-5"" full-time, entry level job not in marketing

    Pros: Higher starting salary, fixed schedule with free time after work &amp; on weekends

    Cons: Cannot transfer knowledge from job so must invest more time learning on my own

I know there isn't one 'right path' to take, but with your knowledge and experience, would you recommend one over the other? I'm interested in hearing your story and learning how you got started with affiliate marketing. What's your profession? How difficult is it to balance full-time work with additional work in your spare time? Has it negatively impacted your health, happiness, and/or personal relationships? 

And if you're doing it full-time, how long did it take to get to where you're at now? How did you stay motivated?

I was supposed to be working an internship but got turned down so now I have decided to turn up.

I am aware that tickets are available via the official Man Utd. website but I was hoping to check with you guys and see if anyone is unable to make it to the game and has 1 ticket that they are trying to get rid off.


If by the grace of the God, someone has a ticket to the Aresnal game, please let me know and I will book my flight to arrive a day earlier(saturday) so I can make the game.

68zifs,1,2017-05-03,Very Late Decision to Apply to Med School,sq13,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/68zifs/very_late_decision_to_apply_to_med_school/,"So, here's the rundown:

•Junior @ non-target public school, studying fin and comp sci
•Couple of past internships in corporate finance and institutional investment firm
•Standing offer of summer analyst internship from one of the biggest investment firms in the nation (trading bonds, very technical)

Basically, I've been working on a daily basis toward landing this offer since last May. I finally have it, and I couldn't be forced to give a singular shit. I mean, it was hard to get this offer on ~levels~. I had a lot working against me, so I just studied every night, in addition to class, pre existing interviews, and everything else. Let's just say my demographic is extremely represented in medicine, and rarely seen on Wall St. 

Ultimately, I realized I didn't want to see how long I could last before burning out...and I'm definitely not in it for the money (although it is nice). After the past couple summers, I realized it is just not something I want. Maybe that's entitled of me, but I deserve a shot at something I'm good at and makes me feel fulfilled. I know med school/residency isn't a walk in the park, but average hours for me last summer were 70/week, and will probably be 80-100 this summer, should I accept. 

And hey, feel free to drag me through the comments. I know 'hating finance' is a pretty generic and common feeling amongst many entry level investment bankers, but I'm good at the work. But in the end, it's not sustainable for even a few years. My reasons for wanting to attend med school are concrete and well thought out. But, way too long for this post, so I'll move on.

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

I have one year (2 semesters, possibly 3 if I add an extra)  before graduation, and 12 cred (4 courses) left for my finance degree.

Have completed 1 year math (1 sem calc, 1 sem stats)
Need 1 yr chem, bio, orgo, physics and all accompanying labs. Have done a bunch of philosophy course which I know aren't required but many schools like humanities coursework.

I'm already enrolled in bio I and physics I for this summer, along with a class for my business degree. 

cGPA: 3.4 (hopefully 3.5 after finals)... kinda low but I took mostly all mba substitutes my school offers instead of 400 level

Internship experience, obvi not directly relevant to med

A couple leadership positions over the past 2 years, one of which was investment club; other was non profit ( but all finance related experience) 

I have interviews for patient care assistants (working directly in emerg. ward under RNs), but nothing concrete. However, it would be a good first step of relevant clinical experience, and it's better than wasting away at a job I know I'll eventually despise. Moreover, I can't think of a solid person for an LOR at this point in time, so pursuing this experience and absolutely killing it could help with that. 
•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

So, could I make it to a decent MD program by applying next summer? Do I have time to study for mcat before next year's application cycle? Should I stick to Wall St. this summer or gain clinical experience? Can I make a good case for starting prereqs so late? Is my background going to help or hurt me?

I really want to suck cock while i am dripping with cum from my other holes. And I would very much want to do a scene where we both enjoy a cream filled dessert out of my pussy (or ass ;) ).
  
Let's do a role play centered around a craigs list or tinder date. One of us would write a fake 'ad' (in the scene) and we would start from there, with our online interactions about setting up a fun date and then work up to our meeting and having wild and crazy fun! I would want the craigs list ad to be quite raunchy and explicit but I would prefer to play as a naive but enthusiastic girl, but i can also be a little older and mature if you have a good reason for it. It would also be fun if you weren't the first date i went on tonight. I want you to be fun, articulate and creative-the best scene suggestions will get my full attention
  
I want to do something involving two sisters (both played by me, or one older sister who we both control). I would like this to be either a kind of competition or a learning experience for me and my sister. However I don't really want this to be a dom/sub thing that much. We can compare our holes, mouths, armpits, and flavors! So if that is something that interests you, and you want to teach two girls-PM Me!
  
or
  
Today I want to focus on armpits. They are incredibly sexy and a mostly overlooked erogenous zone here on dpp. Things we could do can range from chatting about them or doing a role play centered around smelling/licking/cumming in my armpits or if you want to get a little strange, my armpits could have pussies for you to use too. A couple of ideas could be that I am applying for a summer internship but part of the interview involves my scents. Or we could do something like a glory hole but with my armpits and other holes as well. Of course a gang bang would be fun too but this might work best as an intimate one-on-one kind of thing. Message me with what you'd like to do and let's get off!

Another maintenance, another post by Spreadsheet Lyn.  
I wonder what will arrive after maintence?

****

* -So today is the end of the Candycloud event dungeon (finally) so its time to wrap up the chests data for it.  
* We also have had a week of the new ~~swipe~~ Store Chest, the Spring Bloom Box so time to have a proper look at it.  
* Treasure pouch, Lucent and Hidden chests.
* Since I am a ~~insane~~ slightly OCD Lyn I typed up all the guild crafting recipes, of which you can now use.  
* A lot of minor improvements in the back end of things

*****

**Candycloud Calamity**


First of all, apologies for the form, I messed up in the beginning, the part to put in the criticals for the tokens wasnt too clear.


So the event ran for 21 days, with a mediocure fight that was very mechanic locked.  
The chest gave average rewards, which for the most part were account bound crystals. The real treasure were the cloud tokens.  
Of which you got  a 50/50 chance of getting 1 or 2 from the main reward which gave an average of 1.5 tokens/chest.
Crits had a chance of 7.78% ± 18.11% and on average gave 0.7 tokens.

Two boxes a day gave a total of 4.4 tokens from the chests which over the period was 92.4 tokens.  
Now to start it all of maintenance on the 12th went well overdue, so we got 12 free tokens from that.  
On top of that there were the 6 purple dailies that gave a total of 9 daily. 189.  
There was also the Alienware promotion code which gave the 7 day premium, outfit and 3 more boxes. 13.2.  
And finally if you had 1 NCoin you could get 3 daily. 63.

The grand total is 306.6 obtainable through gameplay/free stuff and 369.6 if you had 21 NCoin. Not included is the daily dash rewards which would raise both.   

So you could get on average (Free/Free+F10):

* Forging Orbs/Oil: 3/3
* Gem hammers [\(enough to open slot 5 if ye are particularly unlucky\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/bladeandsoul/comments/68ugba/legendary_gem_hammer_abusiveuseless_cost/) : 7/9
* Gems: 2/3
* Taikhan's Skin: 4/4.9

My impression of this is the complete opposite of the valentines event where there was a good chance you wouldnt get the gem from that. This event seems to have been a followup to the changes to the weapon evolution, designed to get folks up to about Legendary 7. With the capability to get 3 hepta gems it also gave a solid chance of being able to get an Octo gem from combining them.  
So it was a crap event dungeon but overall had really good rewards.

**Spring Bloom Box**

Every so often Nsoft must put out a mating call for whales, but from time to time it can directly benefit more than just whales.  
The Spring Bloom box is one of these. At a base cost of 139 NCoin/HMC and rich in healthy oils it is in a sweet spot for both.  
The buy price of the chest is about 40g EU and 30g NA, but the output is significantly higher for both regions. So if a F2P player has the gold for it they can get their worth out of as well.

Swipers have the advantage though as the NCoin version  has discounts for higher bundles.

Overall I cannot really add too much to my analysis page except for a meta-stat: 33% of people claimed they were special snowflakes and got up to 50 items per box, also in a side note 33% is the same figure of folks who couldnt read/understand ""One entry = one box""  
*shrugs*



****

**Treasure pouch, Lucent and Hidden chests**

Nsoft, we seriously have to have a talk, I know you want to incentive people doing lower level dungeons, but please not like this.



Container | EU | NA
---|---|----
Pouch | 3g 75s 75c | 3g 05s 33c
Lucent Promises | 4g 13s 24c | 3g 61s 07c
Hidden Promises | 3g 05s 67c | 2g 79s 49c

Of the three the pouch is the easiest to get, most folks can solo yeti for it and they drop like candy from other dungeons (in bundles too).  
The promises chests are from the HM9+ dungeons with Hidden being from the hard mode. 
Of the three the Hidden one has the lowest value, hardest to obtain but lowest value.  
This is not good physiology for the players, there is a lesser ""reward"" from heh hardest dungeons than from a soloable dungeon.

Also it has been pointed out to me that I am missing the Rare chests from Sanctum, so if anyone can take a pic of the drops and send it onto me I would be extremely thankful.

**Crafting API/List**

As you may have suspected so far I dont have much of a life, and so I embarked on a project that nearly had me tearing my tail out - cataloging the recipes from the crafting/gathering guilds.

Nsoft I know this is a second callout to you in one post, but seriously, get the intern who did the crafting guilds back and get them to finish it.  
What I found:  

* [Consistency is a lie](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290239355099021313/309058459717074945/unknown.png)

* The abyss has got really nice eyes, but it blinked first.

Regarding levling up the guilds if anyone knows the XP thresholds for them I would really appreciate it.

690wqx,0,2017-05-03,Question about securing a first job,bk2345,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/690wqx/question_about_securing_a_first_job/,"I'm sure you guys are sick of questions like this, but I would be truly grateful for some advice. 

At this point, I've been a graduate with a BS in Mathematical Sciences (Actuarial) and a minor in  Computer Sciences since last November, with a 3.3 GPA, Exams P and FM passed while in school, and am currently studying for the July MFE exam.

Up until this point, my only experience is as a part time Calculus/Statistics tutor since September of last year.

As a result of a combination of my school not having a very developed actuarial program, and me not picking up the slack, so far I haven't been able to secure an actuarial internship for this summer. I know it should be way too late, however throughout the past few months I've found and applied to a handful of different internships all over the country, making it clear I'd be willing and eager to relocate. (For instance, for whatever reason it looks like an internship in Jacksonville with allstate opened up in the last week looking for recent graduates). 

For the last month or so, I've also been applying to the underwriting and risk management  related summer internship positions that have been posted recently. I'm not sure how likely it is to secure an internship out of state though, no matter how clear I try to make it that I'm in it for the long run. I'm not really holding out much hope for an internship this summer.

LONG STORY SHORT- For reasons I won't waste your time trying to explain, I'm out of sync and fear that after this summer, even if I do pass the MFE exam, I'll be out of the running for anything directly actuarial related (internship or otherwise). In addition, it's starting to seem like any Business or Financial analyst position I look at either requires way more programming experience than I have, or I appear overqualified when I leave actuarial exams on my resume so it doesn't look like I've been doing absolutely nothing these past few months.

How can I get back on track? Is there any way for me to sneak my way into an insurance company as an intern (paid or otherwise) for the fall? Is there any shot in hell of me getting any of these out of state internships? Is my only option graduate school?

Basically - what am I not doing now that I'm going to regret this fall? 

Again, I'd be tremendously appreciative of any help!    "

691cyv,2,2017-05-03,Me [28/M] is beyond confused at what to do with [27/F] who is with someone yet thinking about me,Heartbrokenv,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/691cyv/me_28m_is_beyond_confused_at_what_to_do_with_27f/,"OK this is gonna be long so I appreciate anyone that reads this and responds. I’m looking for advice but I also just need someone to listen because I don’t have the type of friends where I can open up about stuff like this. 

So thanks in advance. 

Ok, so I’ve been talking to this woman for 2 years now around feb 15. We started off slow, talking and texting but it felt so natural to talk to her, never had trouble keeping the conversation going, it was great. We met a few times but things were moving slow (She said shes old fashion) and that’s no problem it does not bother me. Around July I guess things start getting more serious in but I hardly saw her because she was working, internship and school and that’s fine I want to see her but I know shes busy and as long as we are talking that’s ok. 

Then around August we got in a little argument, she said we would see each other and I was super excited and then she backed out and I let emotions get the better of me and just said goodnight and stopped talking to her for the night (didn’t want to say something I didn’t mean). I didn’t think anything of it, yea I was mad but people get mad. She told me the next day that she couldn’t sleep because she didn’t know what was wrong and that she couldn’t deal with these emotions while shes in school and we should only be friends. A huge overreaction for me just being upset for one night in my opinion.

We still talk over the next few months and around thanksgiving she starts to get close to me again in what shes saying and we go on a few more dates. We go past Christmas and everything is going awesome, im happy as can be and from what I can tell so is she. Couple days into January and she tells me she wants to focus on her last semester of school and that we should only be friends. What? This is out of nowhere. But I 100% without a doubt love her so I reluctantly agree. 

We talk for the next few months I send her valentine’s day gift and she loves it. We continue to talk and mind you over all these ‘breakups’ she sends me hints like “youre so perfect” snaps that have a broken heart that say “when you miss someone” Things that make me think she still really likes me but really did need that time to focus. Her reasoning was that she felt it was unfair that I was there for her but she wasn’t there for me while in school and I tried to explain to her that’s how a relationship works and that I’m there for her and one day I may need her to be there for me it doesn’t have to be equal parts attention and affection every day. 

During this time of her last semester of school her grandmother had passed away a few months prior and her other grandmother more recently. I knew she was going through a lot so I would send her little things to hopefully make her smile. I sent her a jar of 30 some quotes and she got mad at me for sending her things but also said it was her favorite gift. I sent her a frame of both her grandmothers and her picture and a quote to go with it and she liked it but mad at me for sending it.

Now we roll up on my birthday. I invited her out of course but she was going away with her girlfriends so I go to the bar with my friends and some friends my friend brought out. One of them was this girl he worked with who I had met before who was very cool but not my type and I had no intention of ever talking to her as more than friends. Anyways my friend told her to bring a cake so she did, I thought that was awesome of her even though I don’t want cake when I’m drunk. Anyways my friend said take a picture with her for snap, ok cool whatever. So we take a picture and I think nothing of it. Till the she sees it and gets super upset (again she said we were just friend’s multiple times and as recently as a month before this). She accuses me of letting her sit on my lap and that I’m holding her, which shes 5 foot tall I’m 6’2” and I had to hunch over and I 100% agree it looked like that but she wasn’t (she didn’t believe me). I explained to her that there is nothing going on that its just a friend and she says I guess you let all your friends sit on your lap I again explain that she isn’t but it shouldn’t matter anyways I’m not dating anyone according to her. 

So time goes on and we continue to talk. We always talk, every week for hours. She calls me one night a little tipsy and tells me how much I mean to her and that shes misses me and misses the affection I showed her. But the next day she dodges the question when I try to ask if she really feels that way. We continue to talk and she drops hints that she still likes me but we are still friends so I adopt the policy of maybe if I let her come to me instead of trying to force it. 

New years 2017 rolls around. We hit valentine’s day and she messages me and says shes misses me. Few days later she says she had dreams about us getting married. Asked me if I send her anything lately cause she misses things I sent her even though she gets mad (said you probably think I’m crazy). Tells me how perfect I am, I always say the right thing, etc. Drops other things like I’m the only one she can count on and trust and more. That I’m always on her mind. She goes out of town with her GF and sends me a message asking if I’d make love to her and saying she feels all types of ways when shes around me. Then the next day says forget it I was tipsy, so I didn’t respond to that cause it made me mad and she got mad at me for not responding. I said I didn’t know how to respond to that. Then 2 weeks ago she says we need to have a talk so after all of that I’m excited.
Then something shows up on my IG explore page and it’s a picture of her with a guy and her kissing him on the cheek. Since she had no issue calling me out on my picture I text her and say I see your IG. She says this is why I told you we need to talk in person. I said I’ve jumped to a lot of conclusions over that picture so if the talk is what I think it is I don’t think I can handle an in person talk just text it to me. She says this is what you do you avoid conversations and I told her I’m not avoiding it I just don’t think I can handle this conversation face to face. 

So she calls me. She tells me shes getting to know someone. She tells me during this long conversation a few things that are driving me insane. One is that she can’t get over that picture with the chick on my birthday but even acknowledges that we were only friends so she has no say, I again explain that shes not sitting on me, we are not or never were talking  and like she said we were only friends so what possible reason did I ever have to lie about it? She also tells me that the guy shes talking to knows about me knows how special I am to her life and knows that she will never give me up and that its not an option. She also said when shes with him shes thinking about me and that I’m always on her mind.

So yea if you  made it this far thank you for reading. I’m not sure what advice you can give me besides move on, and while I want to my heart is broken, I had never felt this way about anyone before and I don’t know how to stop caring. 

I don’t understand how I can be single, she was single and she can say she never wants me out of her life and that she always is thinking about me. I will continue to ‘be there’ for her because I truly do care about her but I will not be a lap dog I will not show her the same affection I will move into truly being a friend and that’s it.

691ro9,47,2017-05-03,Theories on Aizawa Shouta's past,Suyefuji,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/691ro9/theories_on_aizawa_shoutas_past/,"* Aizawa’s main heroic accomplishments prior to teaching were night strikes against underground villains and villain groups.

* * **All Aizawa’s known/published accomplishments were probably fights against minor villains.** Based on his fights that were publicized, Izuku and Shigaraki both established a pattern of a surprise strike followed by a quick capture. This helps avoid media attention but is probably impossible when fighting very strong villains. Based on his quirk, I’d guess that he specializes in hostage fights here (by negating the hostage-taker’s quirk). [We also know that he works at night from images in the manga](http://www3.mangafreak.net/Read1_Boku_No_Hero_Academia_6_15#gohere).

* * Aizawa is noted to avoid media attention, to the point that most of the class doesn’t know even his hero name. We know from All Might’s fights against Af1 that certain hero-villain battles can be wiped from media records. **These fights are most likely all secret strikes against powerful villains that were covered up to prevent the Stain phenomenon.** 

* * We also can assume that **Aizawa has a lot of strong combat experience.** He’s qualified to teach at U.A. Unlike 13, there’s no note that he has less combat experience than other heroes at the USJ. Furthermore, the times that we have seen him in combat, he shows crazy strong reflexes, uses a very complex weapon as if it was a natural extension of himself, and quickly analyzes his enemies by threat.

* * **Aizawa is experienced with the killer instinct.** There’s no other way that he could have known, while face-down in the dirt, the direction that Shigaraki ran when he attacked Tsuyu. He wouldn’t have time to search for his target and there’s no indication that he had noticed the students prior to that. 

* At least one of Aizawa’s students is deceased.

* * **Aizawa acts irregularly and irrationally when his students’ safety is on the line.** His combat style focuses heavily on strategy and analysis. Yet he chooses to heavily overextend himself at the USJ to protect his students. Not only is it a suboptimal decision from a personal safety standpoint, **this is also not the safest decision for the students** (which would have been for 13 or some combination of students to blow their way out of the stadium while he plays rear-guard).  This is one of the few times we see Aizawa make a rash/suboptimal decision. During the school trip arc, His fight vs Dabi is also interesting. His immediate solution is to capture and interrogate Dabi, and he shows no hesitation to **torture a villain right off the bat – surprisingly unheroic.** Dabi even notes that he’s in a rush and his first response is to taunt Aizawa about the safety of the students. 

* * [Students of U.A. have been killed during internships before.](http://www3.mangafreak.net/Read1_Boku_No_Hero_Academia_124_12#gohere) 

* * As a teacher, Aizawa is known for ruthlessly expelling students who don’t meet his standards. He specifically targets Izuku immediately after learning about him on the basis that he is **too likely to get himself killed**. He’s also expelled an entire class of first-year students before. His steadfast explanation for this is that it’s **too cruel to let a dream end midway**. He also puts up with Izuku because he has been convinced that Izuku will strategize a way to **get out of a fight without dying**, as he notes to Kouta in the school trip arc.   

* * Expelling an entire class of students shows Aizawa’s irrational side as well. **It’s not plausible that the entire class of top 0.2% of the students for that year were somehow all garbage.** My guess is that he was still reeling from the death of a student, possibly one he had particularly cherished, and that caused him to lash out by dropping the entire class “for their own safety”.

692izd,2,2017-05-03,Senator Dal Otran,Dal_Otran,SWRPmeta,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWRPmeta/comments/692izd/senator_dal_otran/,"Name: Dal Otran

Species: Chagrian

Sex: Male

Age: 29

Height: 5’10 w/o horns (6’3 w/ horns)



Dal Otran was born on Champala to a wealthy aristocratic family but they cared deeply about the plights of the less fortunate and instilled that same care in their son. His father was the primary shareholder of one of the finest producers of custom luxury ships in the galaxy, *Aissel Ships*, while his mother was a well known and respected professor of Galactic Politics that had once been an advisor to one of the Supreme Chancellor's of the Republic. It was not surprising that, as Dal reached his adolescence, he began to work in the offices of several different senators as an intern. He was an intelligent young man, deeply passionate and equally as naive, which made him perfect for simple jobs like getting caf and sending mass messages to constituents. However, he did manage to learn a lot by being a fly on the wall and so, when he started university, he had a plan in place.

He breezed through his classes at the top university on Coruscant and quickly got himself a position as an advisor to the Senator of Champala. Most people that were a part of the senator's council did not see Dal as a rival, which he used to his advantage. He became indispensable and helped the senator in a lot of important moments. His time and effort invested eventually paid off when the senator retired. She supported his decision to run for the position and, although he was only 26 at the time, he won. Now that he was a member of the Senate, he hoped to do a lot for the people of the galaxy.

He quickly became known amongst the Senate as a young idealist that would retire with a long list of accolades, but, ultimately, nothing to be remembered for. After a couple of years as a part of the Senate, he was beginning to realize that problems that existed within it and often pushed for new legislature that would stop the corruption and laziness of many senators. Unfortunately, he did not have the political influence to pull it off. That was when he started to realize he would have to resort to *playing the game* like the other senators did. 

He used his influence over *Aissel Ships* to have secret tracking and surveillance devices built into the ships that were bought by senators. He hated doing it but felt like it was a necessary evil. After all, if the senators had nothing to hide then there would be nothing that Dal could take advantage of. Unfortunately, there was a lot he could take advantage of. One of the senators in particular was hiring prostitutes and holding parties aboard the ship where drugs were offered. Dal was disgusted and fought with himself over what he should do. Ultimately, he realized that it would be better to have a corrupt politician under your thumb than to send him to court where he would get off with little to no punishment. And so, Dal Otran left his office one day with a data pad in his hands, ready to confront the senator and blackmail him into changing his votes. Then the bombing happened.

Dal didn’t remember a lot of what happened when he woke up a few weeks later. He was told that he had been close to the explosion and was seriously injured. His right side was seriously burned and he completely lost his right arm. His right leg was also seriously damaged but he would be able to keep it. He was lucky to have survived and he was grateful for it, but he quickly realized this was an opportunity. This was a chance for him to gain political power without resorting to such underhanded maneuvers. He would make a name for himself with this war and use his power to help people.

He stopped the treatment of his scarring early so that he was left with some visible scars on his face and his lethorn. The scars weren’t anywhere near as gruesome as his injuries had been at first but he left them there as a sign of the war. He also had his right leg enhanced with some cybernetics rather than amputating it. His right arm was replaced with a cybernetic prosthetic that had no synthskin on it. It was sleek and well designed but clearly mechanical.

When he inevitably returned to the Senate, his passion was reignited and he began to put his plan into motion. As a living symbol of the Reformation’s acts against the Republic, Dal garnered a lot of sympathy and, more importantly, a lot of political support. Now, he is pushing to have the Senate more involved in the war. He was rounding up support for a bill known as the Wartime Diplomatic Envoy Act that would force every Republic Star Destroyer to have a diplomatic envoy aboard it that would report directly to a committee of Senators. He plans on leading the committee while also leading one of the diplomatic envoys sent along one of the more important fleets.

692j3n,5,2017-05-03,"My [21F] parents [40M/F] don't want BF [21M] on any vacations, and I want to confront them about it",SpoiledwithVKs,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/692j3n/my_21f_parents_40mf_dont_want_bf_21m_on_any/,"Something has been bothering my BF – my parents never invite him to family vacations. They are mid-rich, enough to take 4-5 vacations a year, with or without me. I am cheap, and I budget myself and the vacays I plan with BF. My parents invite me to their vacays…kind of. Long story short: mom knows I don’t like how they disregard BF when planning 6 hr drive vacays (which they know we can handle) and so the last 3 vacations she’s bought plane tickets for me and told me last minute. Said I had to pay her back if I didn’t want to go. Also, when I explained I was looking into summer internships and courses she shrugged her shoulders and said, “oh well, hopefully you can bring your work with you”. 


I confronted her on that sneaky nonsense…but I have not properly confronted her, or dad, about inviting my BF. I notice my cousins and their SOs go to family vacations all the time. BF and I have been dating 3 going 4 years and I’m tired of waiting for my parents to offer something. They won’t need to pay a cent, BF and I have expressed we’d pay for ourselves, and we’ll accompany with them whenever they want. But every previous time I’ve asked for them to invite him, mom said 1.) she wants it to be “family” only, and 2.) She wants to spend as much time with me before I move out of their lives entirely (*which I expressed won’t happen).


At this point, BF just wants to feel a part of my family. He doesn’t care about the vacay itself, just the idea behind it.


I thought this convo should wait until vacation planning comes up again (if my mom doesn’t pull the same shish ie last minute); mainly because maybe BF and I should help plan a vacation with my parents, instead of trying to hop on and possibly mess up a plan they already laid out. BF feels hurt that I want to wait confront parents, like I am procrastinating on it to avoid confrontation. And he has a point. I know I’m a huge pushover with parents.


How should I confront my parents on this? What should and shouldn’t I ask? Any parents out there have this experience? What would you find reasonable/unreasonable for your kid to ask? If inviting is too much, then what sort of compromises sound good?  I know in the future I will politely persist about pay/planning these vacations, but like I said, my mom made these last 3 vacations (1 is this month) last minute without my say at all, to avoid the “invite BF” convo. And honestly, I’m tired of them using the “family only” card, and I'll sit the next one out if he isn’t invited. Any advice is greatly apprecaited!
 
  
  ---   
  tl;dr: Parents plan last minute vacations to avoid me asking about BF coming along, even though we offer to pay our share every time. Tired of prompting the invite, and tired of it being rejected with the ""family only"" card. How should I confront them? Am I being ungrateful? Is this unreasonable to ask?"

692pwx,0,2017-05-03,"Get an additional student loan, or pick up a second job and save religiously?",ostrichsockss,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/692pwx/get_an_additional_student_loan_or_pick_up_a/,"I feel like this definitely requires some backstory:  
I'm 21 and in my third year of college. I'm studying engineering, and should graduate in May 2019 (so two more years). I was accepted into school with a full ride scholarship, but in order to pay for the other expenses of college, I took out 2k federal loan (all of my current loans and interests rates will be listed below.) Unfortunately, after my first year, bad decisions and bad situations meant losing my scholarship. So in order to continue with school (which wasn't really optional, in my eyes) I had to take out more loans then I ever really planned for.  
So for the past two years, I've been maxing out my federal loans. However, I go to school three semesters a year, as per my program, so the standard unsub loans offered do not cover the full costs. In order to cover tuition in full, I've had to take out two additional loans, that are still federal, but have higher interest rates and are in my mothers name.  
The next two years of my education will actually be slightly cheaper than the previous two, because two of my next semesters will be full-time (paid) internships, rather than class. I still pay tuition for these semesters, but it's significantly cheaper, and I'm making good money.  
So my dilemma. I've crunched the numbers, and for my last year of school, I'd need to takeout **an additional loan for about 5.5k** (likely the same as my past additional loans, with an interest rate around 4.3%, federal, unsub, in my mothers name) or **save** 5.5k by then. So why am I torn:  
I'm about half way to 5.5k in savings already, but my boyfriend and I are trying hard to save for a home. We want 20% down, and we know that'll take a while. Plus, in the meantime it serves as a really good emergency fund.  
My boyfriend is a recent engineering grad, and though he makes money, he is in a lot more debt than I am. His totals about $75k, and has much much higher interest rates. The more I'm saving, the less I'm helping him with out expenses, and the less money going towards his loan payments (we live solely off his income, with about 1.5k saved a month, give or take).  
I feel as though after I graduate, we'll be in a significantly better place than we are now, and fully capable of playing off my loan payments, which are in reality, pretty minuscule compared to what my bf is paying now. So my question; **is it worth it to take out an additional loan when I have the means to save and pay out of pocket?** 

My current loan information:  
$1,980 (1.072%)  
$6,432 (1.073%)  
$11,486 (4.29%)  
$7,420 (1.068%)  
$5,266 (4.272%)  

Edit: Though the higher interest rate loans are in my mother's name, *I* will be repaying every penny. My parents are in a really rough place financially and I've been without their assistance for quite sometime. "

On other thing, I'm more inclined to accept first the ones submitting their own suggestions rather than leaving me to pick everything)

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the kids had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of kids, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous, underage cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny little (age?) year old, fresh out of puberty. The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my teen daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw Kaley (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that Kaley was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as Kaley? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**jailbait**

You will play as a young girl who has grown pampered by her mum, not to the point of having everything you wanted since your parents are not rich but you would get the clothes you always wanted even if they look like more fit for a grown up woman (such as the short tops or low waist pants your mum used), make up kits (which your mum taught how to use and look pretty at school), some jewellery (such a golden thread with your name) and even some lingerie. As you find yourself feeling and behaving as an adult, you start getting some men's attention but that only makes you more into being a grown woman, right? Being wanted (even just for the age or looks) becomes something you find very entertaining.

I'm looking to play as someone who come across this young but yet well developed teen or pre-teen and either convince her to his perverted desires luring her someone of power or as someone who she would feel attracted as she starts to explore her sexuality and object of her desires (you can play sub, dom or mixed)


**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavour by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favourite cake or buy tickets for her favourite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realising she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries

**special photo shoot**

I play an older male photographer that's renting a house in your neighbourhood but you don't know that and end up swimming in my pool only to get caught by me. Instead of getting mad at you I offer you a deal that if you let me photograph you and I'll let you swim in my pool. Of course, as a young and impressionable girl you absolutely love the idea and go off to get a bunch of different outfits to pose in for me that you already owned. Some Halloween costumes, some normal outfits, some outfits your parents don't approve of, and the swimsuit you were already wearing. The photo shoot gets more and more lewd as time goes on and before you know it we're having sex in the backyard where anyone can see it.

**being punished**

your big brother finds that thong Sarah got you a a joke birthday present.. Mum told you to throw it out weeks ago. If she finds out your done for. And now he has hidden it somewhere and threaten to tell.... Unless you let him punish you. A spanking?!.. It seems fair he can't ground you without mum getting suspicious. But it seems a bit unfair to make you wear the thong during it.. He drapes you over his knee and you find the sting of his hand doing funny things to you. Your pussy wakes up and moistens you can't help but moan.

**explanation**

Due to the lack of opportunities your dad/son/relative finds himself not able to release for a while longer then he is used to....as a result he feels a bit uncomfortable being around in attractive girls (perhaps you or someone else)...it gets difficult to keep all those hardons secret...so he makes a plan to wait for your family to get over...and hopefully after everyone settles then take his time stroking his cock until all the jizz is released... From here we can decide what happens after

**Beasts**

A.) I'd like an innocent little girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) A innocent little sleepover with your 2 friends and you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them and want to learn everything, but no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practising on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty.

I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** are: dry humping/hotdogging, tight/skimpy clothes (cameltoe, nipples poking, lingerie digging in hips, etc.), lingerie (cheap or expensive), thick hips/big ass, name calling, some flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing .
remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png

6937tf,1,2017-05-03,Looking for some University Insights and Advice,afroarmadillo,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6937tf/looking_for_some_university_insights_and_advice/,"I am in the process of choosing where to spend my last two years of University and would appreciate some insight.


To help you get a better idea of where I am coming from I'll go into a few minor details. I am a veteran; all of my undergrad will be paid for. I want to have a B4 job upon graduation with a long-term goal of transferring into IB. I am aware of how challenging it will be to find a role in IB, so my expectations are tethered. My background in the military was technical (sysadmin, network engineer, minor coding) and I am improving my proficiency in excel as much as possible. I am looking at four schools at the moment, but am always looking for input into others. 

* **USC**: Out of the four schools I will list, this is my first choice. From the research I have done, I will have the best chance of landing a B4 internship while at USC. I have not been accepted yet, but I have a very competitive GPA as well as many extracurriculars. The only downside I can see is job location, but I don't know enough about the LA B4 offices for that to matter enough.

* **Chapman University**: I love their campus and have spoken with many accounting students there. They seem to have a good program with good recruiting to match. I enjoy living in Orange County, but I do not know enough about the B4 OC offices for that to factor. 

* **Cal Poly SLO**: This is the school I have researched the least. It seems like their recruiting is split between Northern California and the LA offices. I haven't spoken to any Accountants who have attended SLO, therefore I have little information to go off of. I do like wine though. 

* **CSUF**: Have spoken to many students with mixed results. The program is huge, making it very competitive, but after speaking with alumni and current students, I have been told that many students aren't as prepared, which would make it easier to stand out.

Fast forward to now. I'm tired from putting up with your late night demands. I'm hungry from the diet you forced on me (""I can't be seen with a fatty, can I?"") I cry myself to sleep most nights because of the cruel things you say and do to me.

I can't believe I was excited about this job, now I can't wait for the internship to end. Then I get the call. It's my boss at the agency. You gave me a glowing review and offered to take me on full-time.

I'm so shocked, I stammer stupidly ""I'll take it.""

Of course! I think as I hang up, you were hazing me all this time and now I'm in. For the first time since I got this job, I'm excited to go to work.

I have no idea what's in store for me.

I'm pretty open to whatever celebrity (real or fictional) you want to play. Message me with kinks you want to include- I want this to be dark so no limits (except bad grammar). You can be really nasty as long as you're cruel and demanding enough to back it up.

I was unable to land an internship during my time here, so I got a job as a student assistant performing desktop support. Prior to this, I have worked in various customer service/retail positions.

I have been working for the school for about a year now, and I have made it very clear that I am interested in becoming a business systems analyst. Since then, my manager has been tasking me with improving/implementing new systems such as our sign-in kiosks and our secure file servers where students can upload documents to read. He has been trying to help me gain experience for when I am no longer eligible to work as a student assistant.

Unfortunately, I am having difficulty even landing an interview for a business analyst position after applying to over 80 locations around my area. It seems that the only positions that I am getting callbacks for are help desk positions with even lower-level responsibilities than my current job.

As for my next steps in finding a job, I am currently studying for the ECBA, and I expect to take the exam next month in June. I am also going to go to the career center next week and have them critique my resume and cover letter. Is there anything else I can do that will help me land an interview? 

Should I try using a recruiter?

Is there such a thing as an entry-level position below that of a Jr. Business Analyst/Business Analyst 1?

What are hiring managers looking for in entry-level business analysts? My confidence is being shot with each application, as I believe that I have the necessary soft-skills, technical skills, and formal education to at least be given a shot at an interview.. There must be something else that I'm missing that I can improve?

Thanks for any help you can spare!"

I am a graduating high school senior who has just completed AP Computer Science A. I took the AP exam yesterday a feel that I did well. While I don't necessarily plan to go into programming in the future, I enjoyed the class and it seems like a marketable skill for internships and part time jobs in college. 

I'd like to become Java certified at the basic level (SE 7 Programmer I). I have the entire summer to prepare for the exam if I have to, but looking at the topics it all seems parallel to the AP curriculum.

[This season had the HOH curse. Almost everyone who won HOH pre-jury got evicted the following week. I can't believe Bianca and Patrice survived week 2. Eva played too hard and was sent packing. Everyone kept winning HOH and POV in the same week and then got sent home the following week which I thought was hilarious. Neil was a comp beast! And Clark's blindside was epic. Everyone kept trying to evict Bianca! There were so many people getting second chances. Spencer played another great game but still finished in the same place as his original season. Amanda was a good winner.](/spoiler)

Currently, I am a freshman studying Mech E. Our university also offers a very good petroleum engineering program.

In short, my question is if you recommend I switch to petroleum engineering?

The reason I ask is I chose ME because of its broad applicability. However, I've begun to lean towards a career choice within the oil/gas industry and maybe subsea engineering (I'll try to get internships ASAP to actually get a experience of what it is like). However, while there is a pretty good chance I will try to pursue a career in that field, I'm not 100% sure, hence why I didn't originally apply for PGE and chose ME instead.

I know that isn't much and you don't know a lot of my other details/circumstances/etc but I'm just wondering if there is any harm in staying within ME or drastic benefit in switching to PGE?

Furthermore, how do ME's fit into oil companies? In other words, I've been told that while you can be a computer scientist for a big oil company like Exxon or such, you're not the ""prime"" dude doing the most important work. Similarly, a mech E might be hired by Facebook for some reason but the Comp Sci guys are still the prime workers (unless this is a misconception, please let me know).

So I was wondering if the ME's are in a similar case as a Computer Scientist in the case of oil companies/industry?

EDIT: and for whatever its worth, I also plan on taking petroleum classes at the least as an ME, so hopefully stuff like Drilling/Production, Resovoir Engineering (I to III at my school), and am not averse to teaching myself subjects if that's what needs to happen"

6960tk,1,2017-05-04,Best Option to Finance my MBA,throwawaypf9999,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6960tk/best_option_to_finance_my_mba/,"Hey all,


I was fortunate enough to be accepted into a top MBA program starting this fall. I'm wondering what the best course of action would be. I'm 26 and single.


I'm expecting tuition + fees + housing + food + healthcare + fun money to be around ~$100k per year. 

Currently, I have:

* Cash: $65k (Will use this to fund all pre-MBA shopping and trips)

* 401k: $55k

* Taxable Investments: $50k

* IRAs: 25k

* Debt: $0 (Paid off 40k in Student and car loans a couple years ago)



My options for financing are:

* Federal Loans: $20k @ 5.31% + 65k @ 6.31% with a 4.5% loan origination fee 

* Private Variable Loans: Starting at 3-4% but with rising interest rates this seems risky

* Private Fixed Loans: ~6% but there is no loan origination fee



Currently my plan is to apply for a private loan just to see the rate I get compared with the Federal Loans. However, I am leaning towards financing my MBA with 100% private loans right now, and drawing down from savings for fun items (travel, parties, etc.). 



However, my other idea was financing the first year of my MBA with full loans (~$85k cost of attendance + $10-$15k of fun money) and then pay it off at the end of next summer once I know my recruiting status post-MBA. Ideally, I'd like to pay off my first year loans when I know where I'll be working post-MBA ($40k cash + $40k investments). I'd also dump any money from an internship + signing bonus directly into the loans.



Since the graduate student loan interest rates are so high, I'm not sure it makes sense to sit on my investments hoping their growth outpaces my student loan interest rate. My cash + investments could substantially reduce the amount of loans I'll be accruing interest on. 



Does anyone who has been through this have any advice? I'd be especially interested to know if people have any advice on taking federal vs. private loans for graduate studies."

    I'm currently doing an internship in an bio-organic chemestry lab and I need to find a protocol for screening organic acids from fungal. They have grown in Petri dishes with agar-agar, sucrose and various microelements.

**This is my idea :**

-I take a little bit of my medium with the grown fungal in it and put it in an eppendorf. Then I add some water and grind.
-I put the eppendorf at ultrasound to diffuse the acids then I centrifugate in order to separate the membranes.
-Then I take some supernatant for analysis.

**What is the best option :**

-Analysis by HP-LC with a ion exclusion column. I would use a UV detector with a test sample containing common acids found in fungal and compare it with my results. But since there are a lot of sucrose in my sample there might be a problem. Should I remove the sugar first ? How ? or can I find a column that can separate sugar from acids with a good enough efficiency ?
I could eventually use solid phase exchange chromatography with an anion exchange phase and a pH&gt;4 so the carboxylic acid are in their basic form and bind to the stationary phase.

-Analysis by HP-GC and MS detector: I would first derivate the acids with methyl chloroformate so they become more volatile. and then use a column similar to [this one](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/analytical-chromatography/analytical-products.html?TablePage=14540499). With the MS detector and its database, I would then be able to identify the acids. But there is still this sugar problem, will they disrupt the analysis, how can I remove them ?

I'm not close to his future wife. To put it nicely, she's kind of mean. My FH and I have strong opinions of their relationship, we think it's very dysfunctional. 

They are constantly fighting, I'm talking physical fights. It gets so bad that our friend has to call his mom to come pick him up and take him out of the situation. Neighbors have called the cops on them. It's bad. 

She's unbelievably controlling. Our friend can't do anything without checking with her first. 

He has told my FH that the only reason they are getting married is because he's terrified she's going to move away with their son. I told my FH that he still has rights even if they're unmarried but our friend thinks being married will be a lot better for keeping his child. 

So, our friends family members actually had somewhat of an intervention with him and they ALL told him they thought this marriage was a terrible idea. Their main reason was because of the fighting. Our friend didn't listen but he did tell his fiancé that his mom isn't on board with the wedding. 

Their wedding is 2 months out. In about 3 weeks our friend will be leaving for an out of state internship. Last night he called my FH and told him that his future wife wants to elope and get married next week, but not tell anyone and still have the celebration they've planned. He claims her reasoning is she's feeling too much stress from his mom from not supporting them and wants to do it now to make it easier. 

Reddit...i think this is an awful idea. I'm fairly sure the reason she is moving up the wedding is to stick it to our friends family. She wants to prove to them that she has complete control by doing this without them since they're not being supportive. 

I'm also starting to think that since he is leaving for the internship soon, she wants to offically get married before he goes because she is worried once he leaves he'll remember what it's like to be happy and not have her bossing him around 24/7. We were all kind of hoping that if he went away for a month before the wedding he'd come to his senses. Her making sure they're offical married before he leaves kind of ruins that hope. 

If their relationship with our friends family/mom is bad now, I can't imagine how hurt they will all be after they elope...

So FH and I are unsure of what to do. Our friend needs 2 witnesses and asked us to do it. I obviously don't really support this wedding in the first place but I REALLY don't support the elopement. FH is our friends best man, so he's trying to he supportive but he doesn't know how to basically tell him don't do it."

University Student here.

I was wondering how important is it to have a social media account? Some have told me that this is the only way that people can get in touch with me and that is an important tool...

Just yesterday, a classmate gave me a strange look when I said that I don't have FB... When I stated that they can contact me in another way... They sheepishly asked for my email... ( I guess emailing is not common now?)

-----
Background Info:

- FB: I used to have FB, and got addicted to playing Farmville and whatnot. After my first year of college(cegep), I just deactivated my FB. Consequently, it made me feel better because I don't have to feel the need to keep up with all those ""fun times"" that people seem to be having...

- Tumblr: Used to use it as much as FB, until I realise what was drawing me to the site was the number game of having most likes/reblogs/followers...

- LinkedIn: This website makes me feel worst than having a FB... I feel as if I have nothing to show in terms of achievement for in comparison to everyone else... Everyone else seem to be getting a promotion, job, internship and makes me feel anxious about the future... [This is 'tool' that is supposedly the most important of them all]

- Instagram: Never had one. But, looking at all those beautiful photos, reminds me of FB once again...

--------

Not sure what to do... A lot of the social media, seem to negatively affect me. But, sometimes, it just draws me back despite making me feel insecure...

The worst would be when I stopped using FB/Tumblr... I just felt lost. I didn't know who I was, the distraction just seems to be gone. FB, Tumblr... They seem to have distracted me for so long... I got this feeling. It's this weird feeling of emptiness. And, I am still dealing with it.

Replies are greatly appreciated.

Listen up because I don't want to have to go through this twice.

Or rather, since this'll be written, I don't want you wasting time re-reading it, as any drop in productivity is sure to draw the attention of management and I don't think ANY of us wants that.

Huh...

Brenda, since you're transcribing this, I'll leave it to you to tighten this up and sort things out before you send it to the troops. Last thing I need is to look like a rambling jackass. Give it some zazz. I'm going for J.K. Simmons meets that 'Earners Speech' guy from that movie, what’sitcalled...

Where was I?

Oh! Right...

I'm sending this out to address some of the recent happenings, good and bad, since the unfortunate incident which wiped the company newsletter from existence is aparently ongoing.

For those who do not remember the company newsletter, or feel that we never had one... 

Good.

Those feelings are perfectly natural. Hold on to that and ignore ANY false memories of having read or even HEARD of such a thing. Anyone spouting lies about how we once had a company newsletter is to be reported immediately so they can receive an INTENSIVE retraining seminar.

To those already scheduled for one of those retraining sessions- be sure to shave your head, don't wear a hat, and shut your eyes before going in.

No reason.

Just helps the process.

So, with that out of the way, on to item 1.

As we're all aware, the commons room has been declared a 'Gravity Optional Zone' between the hours of 9 AM and 11:30 AM for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with any sort of farcical company newsletter or the lack thereof.

At any rate, while the awesome spectacle of unaided flight appeals to us all, it's time to put an end to the dangerous general grab-assery that has been going on.

While we've clearly posted signs, wards, and specifically asked Jimmy the Intern to plead with people not to enter during that time, it seems like folks just cannot help themselves.

Because of that, we've been experiencing an increase in work related accidents during those hours, and I don't think I need to remind anyone of the 'Deb incident.'

Speaking of which, while burns from floating through a wave of drifting coffee from an unmoored pot of dark roast ARE severe, she's good as new and will be returning to the office next Monday. In fact, thanks to the company HMO, I've been told that her new face is actually a CONSIDERABLE improvement on the old, so a few compliments are in order. From what I've been told, 'nice mandibles' or 'those teeth... MY GOD, HER TEETH AND SO MANY EYES' are acceptable, but be sure to keep it classy.

Last thing I need is to host another damn seminar on workplace harassment because of you shaved apes.

Apart from workplace injuries and liability issues, it seems that this phenomenon has also been resulting in a drop in office productivity. 

In specific, I'm referring to the way that Johnson's morning snack break has started to draw a crowd. 

Look, people, I know that it's a spectacle, but we CAN'T just leave our desks whenever we see him waddling to the break room. Not only is it slowing us down and cutting profits, it's also rude. We all know the man has a problem with his weight, so let the poor guy eat in peace.

I know that if I weighed 800 lbs, I'd probably want to be free from the oppressive clutches of our cruel mistress gravity as well, but employees gathering to watch him while he does his Baron Harkonen impression is just disruptive.

I say let the man enjoy his chips in peace, and if he wants to do it while on an 8 foot high horizontal drift while making whale sounds, more power to him.

While the Union won't let us shut down the commons room during the period of reduced gravity, that doesn't mean that we can't make the break room safe for everyone.

Speaking of the Union, there've been some recent issues there that need to be addressed.

Now, we've got no reason to disbelieve the Union when they say that theirs is a realm of eternal peace, love and joy, but keep in mind that once your brain's hooked up to it, your body WILL be broken down for its nutritional value, leaving nothing but a withered husk. So if it IS a hell-blasted deathscape (or alternately a death-blasted hellscape) in there, there's no way back, so don't come crying to me.

Remember- this is a 'Right to Work' state, so you are under NO obligation to join the Union regardless of what the disembodied voices shriek into your subconscious.

On a more positive note, Management has asked me to pass on their compliments on the increased figures this last quarter.

Well...

Not really 'asked,' per se. More of what you might call a violent mental assault consisting of pictures of smiley faces and thumbs ups that left me bleeding from the eyes and seizing on my office floor for two hours.

Seems like a pretty positive message to me, and hey, my Runes of Authority have NEVER glowed brighter.

Great work, team!

Moving on, I've been informed that some of the fine folks in accounts are putting together a surprise birthday party for Intern Jimmy!

Bring cake, ice cream, and any party decorations to celebrate the continued existence of one of the youngest members of our corporate community!

There is, however an issue that comes using this memo to circulate the news and inform people of the joyous event. Reading this memo informs EVERYONE in the office of important issues, staff meetings, and the hideous unknown dangers that are all standard to office work, but if Intern Jimmy gets ahold of it, THERE GOES THE SURPRISE.

With that in mind, I expect ALL copies of this memo to be withheld from him, and NONE of the information passed on within his earshot lest it illicit the awkward question of where the speaker heard the scoop.

Instead, please do your best to gently nudge him out of the way of danger using what you know. 

I know there are some of you who may be tempted to lead Jimmy INTO danger, thinking that it'll toughen him up and give him valuable work experience so he actually EARNS those college credits, but let me remind you that any of the petty cash used for decorations or food WILL NOT BE REFUNDED if he dies before the birthday party.

So there.

Anyway, last bit of news.

This week has seen the return of an all-too-familiar pest. That's right, I'm talking about our old buddy the Mind Flayer, and the janitor is RIGHT on my back about having to pick up another skinless carcass every other day.

Not blaming the victim here, but we seriously need to do a BIT more to identify the troublemaker so management can take appropriate disciplinary action.

Now, I know we're not sure WHO'S been using their INCREDIBLE telepathic abilities to shuck their coworkers like ears of corn even after we posted all those bulletins asking them not to, but I DO have a means of finding out.

The next time anybody, AND I MEAN ANYBODY gets the creeping sensation that their flesh is about to rip itself right off their bones... 

DON'T. 

PANIC.

Stop. Take a good long look around at anyone in the room with you.

If you notice any say... glowing eyes... aura of power... an unnerving stare paired with a copious nosebleed...

That there is PROBABLY your Mind Flayer.

So just go ahead and use your last few seconds to try and scream out his (or her) name.

Odds are, you won't get through the whole thing, but that's all right. If someone else already yelped out the first syllable, just pick it up where they left off. That way, I figure 2, maybe 3 more inside out employees and we'll have our Mind Flayer's name down!

There are probably some of you who are asking if there is any way of identifying the Mind Flayer before he gets down to some serious mind flaying.

First thought on that is...

Nope.

That said, we never HAVE found any of the skin afterwards, so you may want to be leery of anyone who seems to have a lot of extra skin, and I do mean a LOT.

And no, it's not Johnson, so don't go pointing fingers. He's very sensitive about his weight, and besides, he clearly lacks the mental capacity to wield the awesome strength of human will as a weapon.

We're looking for a Mind FLAYER, not a Mind Nudger.

Besides, I already checked him out and that is ALL him.

Unless he's been eating the skin. In which case... Good for him. Skin's the healthiest part.

So, that just about wraps things up for the Memo.

On a personal note, Brenda, try to be a little bit more careful about copy-pasting documents when you need to make multiple drafts, and for the love of God, please don't keep all those browser windows open.

Last thing we need is private company documentation winding up in front of a bunch of internet lookie-loos.

That happens, you're going the way of the company newsletter."
698pdl,27,2017-05-04,Become a Linux Kernel Developer,Romeus_78,linuxquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/698pdl/become_a_linux_kernel_developer/,"Hello everybody. My name is Roman and I am 38 years old. I have been working as a programmer all my ""aftergraduate"" life. At the dawn of my career I had a chance to ""slightly touch"" system programming, but then I had to go to desktop development and thereafter to the web development. I have been working as a a web developer for ten years and I am able to go further with that, but frankly speaking I always loved system programming. That why I have decided to shift to linux kernel development. I decided that about half a year ago. I read almost all 'Modern operating system' by Tannenbaum and 'Linux Kernel Development' by Robert Love. I read and use some topics from excellent 'LDD'. I have completed some linux and open stack administration courses (You could see that in my LinkedIn profile). Of course I have investigated many more resources that I listed above. I wrote some linux kernel modules and now I am on a halfway throuhg the very interesting eudyptula challenge. But now I faced with the problem.
My problem is - I don't know how to get hired by a linux-related company. Most of them willing to hire interns without solid and strong background, or they want to hire top nocht professionals. The main problem here is that I am 38 and I am a linux newbie. They require 5,8 or even 10 years experience in their professional domain whether that storage, virtualization, network or any other domain. And this relates to any 'linux-related' company, even startups. The lowest requirement that I encountered is 3+ years experience. I tried to pass interview in some companies but I always heard one answer - ""you need more kernel-related experience and participation in big projects"".
Now, I don't know what should I do to break that barrier. My first option is keep going and try to make some elementary patches to the kernel. But as I know this is very long term and hard process and of course if I will be succesful in that then a patch or two is not a replacement of extensive experience in system programming. My second option is to try to find some companies and work for them for free for month or two to prove that I am able to do such kind of job and then be hired. And my third option is try to find a company that willing to hire old junior.
My question is - are there any other ways to change my professional domain and become a linux kernel developer ?"

&amp;nbsp;


I've always struggled with my weight, ever since I was put on Lithium. I also struggle with some pretty hardcore ADHD, which, of course, has affected my productivity. 


&amp;nbsp;


Currently, I'm taking a year to be a service intern in a service corps program. My work placement site last semester and this semester hasn't been the greatest at giving me much work to do. This semester, I go in to my site a max of 1x/wk, and do most of my work from home. Which is fine... when I have something to *do.* Right now, because of reasons, there's been nothing productive to really do this week, and not much since Lent, really. This has meant a real lack of structure for my days, which all has not contributed much good to my mood.


&amp;nbsp;


In addition, with this lack of structure, lack of regular access to a salad bar, (in 2015, I was taking multiple classes at a university, and my lunches were in the cafeteria, with friends. In addition, I'd made a three hour gap in my AM schedule that I used for an hour of working out, showering, and then going to said lunch. All that helped me get from a size 16 to lower on the size 12 range, and I was able to fit into some 8-10 clothing, which felt really good) and also health insurance f*ckery that has led to me not being able to afford any meds... I've been steadily gaining weight, to at least where I was before I started losing weight last.


&amp;nbsp;


So, I just feel like a fat failure, and I hate it. My motivation is going down the drain, and my room's a mess. I just feel like laying down and crying, but I'm not really even a crier. (It's awkward.) I *have* been doing some working out, did so yesterday and the day before... but it's not really helping my mood, it just all feels useless.  


I could really use some positivity and support. _ - _"

I'm on here often, however I'm using a throwaway for this post to remain anonymous from the companies being referred to.   So, I didn't think I was going to get any of the internships I applied to or interviewed for this summer as it's the beginning of May.  Now, within a 3 day period I have received offers from the top 2 companies that I was interested in.  One is a transportation engineering internship and one is a land development internship.  I'm having a really hard time figuring out which one I should go with.  They both seem like great companies and are about the same size.  The land development one sounds more interesting, however I think the transportation one will be more technical and possibly more beneficial to my development.  Again, that's just an assumption.  I don't have actual experience in either fields and I'm interested in your input on what to expect in either of them or any guidance that you can provide.  I have to make my decision tomorrow.  I appreciate your help.

I've been rejected from every engineering related internship, so I don't have any experience, so I probably won't have a job once I graduate. The only internship I could get requires me to live back at home with my mother, who stole a year's worth of rent from me; my family is from the other side of America, so I have no other family to stay with. If I live with her and refuse to give her money, I'd have to quit because I wouldn't have a place to stay anymore.

I'm so stressed out about finances, I can't even think about love anymore. But when I see my friends and roommates being successful, or having their girlfriends around, it physically hurts. I feel like I'm being left behind in every possible way. Having no family around me, I don't have anyone to turn to.

I filed a appeal to get back into my program, but I have no idea when or if I can get back in. I have $18 in my account, and even though I got a $10/hr job that pays weekly, I couldn't even afford gas to get there this morning.

My life has gone to complete hell, all my worst nightmares are coming true and I don't see a way out. I feel completely trapped. If there's a next move to make, I'll always make it, but I don't even know what to do next. The silver lining gets thinner everyday.

I have lived in the mountains of Western North Carolina for my entire life. I grew up in a small town close to Asheville, and went to college in Boone. Aside from a 3-month period in which I completed an internship in Charlotte, I have never lived in a big city.

This past November, I traveled to Chicago to visit some friends and stayed there for a week. I absolutely loved being there. I like being in a big city where I can walk everywhere, in a place where there are plenty of other gay men around and lots of activities to do that don't involve hiking or nature. I also understand that Chicago is very affordable for a major city.

I graduated with my BSBA in Computer Information Systems and Supply Chain Management this past December and have been searching for a job since then. Despite having multiple promising interviews, I have not received a job offer from any company yet. My lease ends at the end of the month, and I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I have a place in my hometown I can stay for free at the moment, but I really don't want to go there.

I feel like now is a great opportunity to make this move that I dream of, but I'm afraid to without a job or place to live. I really don't want to have to live with my friends (they were a couple but recently broke up) there. I've applied to several jobs there, but being across the country from Chicago doesn't exactly help my chances very much.

I currently have about $3K in the bank. My student loan debt is currently at $18.5K, but a family member has offered to help me make payments while I am looking for a job. I have a car with 200k+ miles on it that I am willing to sell to help me raise money, and I have a part time job for the time being. If I move, I plan to sell almost everything I own except for some clothes, my laptop and a few other items.

Do you all have any advice on how I can make this move in the most responsible manner? Where can I stay when I get there, and how can I find a job there? Thanks in advance for all your help!"

69bnqv,4,2017-05-04,My co-workers are awful,luaudesign,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/69bnqv/my_coworkers_are_awful/,"I'm only 2 months at this job but I already know most of then from other company. They're constantly joking at everything all the time, nothing is ever serious with these guys. We lunch in a place where there's a group of 10 or so pretty dentist interns that also lunch there mostly at the same hour.

They never talked to these girls AFAIK, but last week I hit on two of them that were in a table next to hours. I knew they'd burn the move so I awaited for all but one of them to get up for desert/coffee and then talked to the girls. I knew if I had talked to them while they were at the table they'd shout shit like ""hey, leave the girls alone!"", ""Is he bothering you girls?"" and such.

The girls liked me and I also liked one of them during the interaction, but I didn't make a fast move right then, because I see them everyday anyway. So I planned on asking her number next chance I got to talk to her, and to get her by herself if possible. But then my friend that was still at the table goes on and tells the others, making it a big deal how I approached the girls, and their reaction. Talking loud AF, the entire place could hear it. So I got worried that they'd fuck everything up next day, and tried to be more discrete.

That was last Wednesday, we only worked again on Tuesday (yday). I tried to avoid being ""about the girls"" in there, so I just took my plate and went through the buffet. The girls were in a bigger group and already eating. I didn't even look at the table to avoid prompting trouble. But then comes the guy that was at the table, talking loud AF again, about the girl I'm into: ""did you guys see? the hot shorty staring at him all the time nonstop?"", ""damn, you caught my crush""... they talked about it the whole time. They talked all kinds of shit to burn me, everything they could do, they did. The girls got up and headed out, but then 2 of them stopped later at a distance to wait for 3 or 4 others went to the the WC. One of these 2 was my target.

And this is were I made a mistake, I think. I had to be somewhere after lunch and I had finished my plate, so I got up and paid, and headed out. I was going to pass by her and maybe say at least a ""hey"" on my way. I should have done it. The group that was behind caught up with them, and then it was a group of 6 girls, and only 1-2 of them knew me (I didn't pay attention if the other girl was there). And then my co-worker started screaming my name with a mocking tone: ""hey, where you going"", ""what you're doing?"". Clearing implying I only got up to head towards them. Fuck. I passed by them, looked at her, she didn't look back.

I'm pretty sure she was thinking ""please, don't talk to me"". But I can't figure out if she a) was afraid of me involving her in the negative attention the guys were throwing at me, b) thought I bragged about her to my co-workers, c) thought I got dumb-confident after the crap my friend was talking about she looking at me, as if I wasn't even into her until I heard d) that I went towards her to perform in front of the guys e) that she simply didn't want me to talk to her right then and now under those circumstances. I even did another mistake, after passing them, my friends were screaming so much I - fuck - turned around and looked back at them. At least that made them stop the BS, but I don't know if it'd had been better to ignore them so it wouldn't look like I was performing, or worse because they'd scream even more crap.

Who needs enemies with ""friends"" like those?

In any case I'm 99% that the ship has sailed and moved onto other waters. But if there's a way to save this I would really appreciate ideas. Thanks those who read, I had to at least get this out there."

I'm a transfer student and I got accepted into UCSB as a Financial Math and Stats Major. However, I also got into UCLA as an Applied Math Major and I'm really undecided between the two schools. This is due to the fact that I heard that UCLA Math is very competitive and that many people are depressed as a result of the difficulty of their major. Of course UCLA may be more prestigious but I'm really worried about the learning atmosphere there and if I can do well. On a side note, I visited UCSB once and I really like your campus!

My questions are:

1) How is Financial Math &amp; Stats at UCSB?

3) Do you have free time for extra curricular activities and/or internships?

What I don't get is that you haven't shown a single sign that shows you regret your decision. Maybe you don't. 

As more days go by, I start to get more frightened of the future, because I'm starting to realize more and more that there's a big chance you won't be in it. God, it hurts. 

I don't know what triggered this, but I miss you beyond comprehension today and not knowing how you feel about all this makes it even worse. It's the waves I guess...

I had vent somewhere and I feel like my friends are starting to become annoyed by the fact that I'm not getting over this. I don't want to bother them with the same stuff over and over again. Thank god for this subreddit."

My girlfriend is a student at a public university. She is a 24-year-old senior with an internship and a semester left to graduate. She was counting on getting one last Parent Plus loan but she was informed today that she can't get that because she's 24 (she had been paying for college either out of pocket, with Pell grants, or with loans for past several years. Shitty family situation meant early years were pretty off and on hence being in the age conundrum). She doesn't have enough credit to get a loan on her own. With one year left, apparently not enough credit and no ability to do the parent plus loan, what are options for her? She has one year left; there's got to be a way to pay for it right? Help me Bernie Sanders, you're our only hope."
69eg79,1,2017-05-05,Should I look in to this job opportunity?,EmeraldSunshine,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/69eg79/should_i_look_in_to_this_job_opportunity/,"Hi there! I was hoping to get some advice. The people here seem really well rounded and offer solid advice.


I work in the telecom business as a data coordinator. Basically a book keeper. I have been at my current job for almost 3 years. Started as an intern and pushed to become a full time permanent employee. 


A couple of co-workers and now my mom (who works with me) have made the decision to go to another telecom company. One of my coworkers told my mom that they have a position opening he thinks I would be great for. They have offered everyone that went to them much higher pay. And my mom keeps pushing me to apply there to get hired. And so far, from the other two employees who work there, the place is great and friendly. Sounds like a win win, yeah?


Here is my dilemma. I just found out this week that I am 5 weeks pregnant. The thought of being able to make more money for my growing family is really appealing. Though, that would be to anyone regardless of family status. The company in question hires people on first as contractors, this way if it doesn't work out right away they can let the person go without a huge fuss. I totally get it. As a contractor though, you get no PTO and you have to buy insurance through the company, and that's ridiculously high. Good thing about the insurance is I can be added to my husbands because I would be losing insurance once my mom moves to the new company. (Still on her insurance, she let me stay this one last year) But, once they hire you on a permanent employee, you get all those benefits. 


The one guy who left my current employer a few months ago is already in the final stages of becoming a permanent employee. My mom wants me to move over there so I can make more money, and I want to too. But I am worried about trying to change jobs now that I am pregnant. Mom said to interview, and if I get accepted, I tell them afterwards that I am pregnant. Like a, ""Hey I just found out I'm pregnant"" type thing. But I'm worried that if I do that, it would hurt my chances of them taking me on a permanent hire. 


I have not yet reached out to this company. I'm in a tough spot. Do I take the risk at a new company? Be able to make more money but not have PTO and when I tell them I am pregnant they toss me to the curb? Or do I stay at my current job, wait out the pregnancy and maternity leave and start looking then? But I worry there may not be anything worth value for jobs a year and a half from now. 


Financially, my husband and I can provide what we need to. We own a home and have the normal bills. With a baby money would be getting tight, I already know that. So exploring a new job to get more pay sounds so good right now. 


I'm really torn about what to do. I can see pros and cons from both options, but I'm also really scared to leave and take the risk. Am I stupid for even considering trying to make a switch now?

69f1zd,16,2017-05-05,"With a boyfriend, money, and family, I can't decide which university I want to go to",miyukiis,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/69f1zd/with_a_boyfriend_money_and_family_i_cant_decide/,"Hi guys, sorry if this is long but I need to vent and I was wondering if I could use fellow college girls' opinions.

First of all, I'm a transfer student from community college and got accepted into two colleges I applied to - UVA and GMU. I was floored I even got into UVA considering how picky they are (20% acceptance rate versus 60%) and they obviously hold more prestige than GMU. They are both known for having good business programs but I need to decide by May 15 which one I want to go to.

Pros and cons of going to UVA - I am pretty much guaranteed a good, if not decent job when I graduate with my BS in marketing. That's what I really want. Their curriculum is extremely challenging and well-rounded (a valuable education I'm looking for) and I get to experience 'college life'. I visited the campus and I fell in love with it. The con is I'll be away from home and it is twice as expensive to attend. My dad says 'don't worry he'll pay for it' but I don't want a heavy financial burden on him. It's almost $70K for two years. I'd also have to live on campus, it's an hour and a half away. Also, I'll have to quit my current job, and who knows if I can get a decent part time job that will let me do my homework over there. Also internships are apparently challenging to get. I'll be away from my family and my fiance, who knows if I can visit them every weekend or vice versa.

Pros and cons of going to GMU - it's $30k more cheaper. It's closer to home and I can still keep my job here at the community college working in the testing center. Being guaranteed a job is not as promising as I've heard mixed reviews about GMU, but hopefully I can get one when I graduate as it's near the DC/Northern VA area (but it's not as guaranteed or promising as getting a degree from UVA). Their business curriculum is decent from what people, and my boss, have told me. But their opportunities are apparently incomparable to UVA in terms of job recruitment. I can also live off campus at home and commute from work, while being able to see my fiance (he's traveling back from New Mexico to live with me and my dad and brother with a diesel mechanics degree). 

Basically, I don't want to regret picking one over the other. I feel like going to UVA is a once in a lifetime chance and it's amazing I even got accepted. GMU is third tier while UVA is almost top tier, but at what cost? What should I do? Any kind of guidance or something to think about helps. "
69f68a,4,2017-05-05,I [21 M] don't know what to do with my school project group [21 M&amp;F],Lumenis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/69f68a/i_21_m_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_school/,"Hi!


I'm a student in a video game oriented bachelor, and from Januray to April I had to do a big project, along with 3 other students, for the end of the school year. The project went quite well, we had a lot of good ideas, and were able to produce enough to show something we were proud of. We were so proud at that time that we decided to push the project forward, and to continue to work on it after the end of the school year. We even registered to a contest for student video games, and were selected to compete with 20 other projects. Everything sounds great at this point.


But the thing is that I'm tired of it. Before this bachelor I studied computer science, but I'm sick of it now. And for our project, as I was the only one in the group to know how to code, I had to do all the programming. I forced myself because it was for school, and I knew it was for a short period only, but now I can't get myself to code again. I hate it. It has been one month since the end of class, and we're supposed to be in an internship (which I haven't found yet, but that's an other problem). During March we all took a competitive exam for a school, and we all passed, but there's an other step in two weeks, and an other one in June after that (it's a pretty big deal). So basically, it has been a bit more than one month since I didn't work on the project, even for a second, because I was busy looking for an internship and preparing myself for the entrance exams. And, also, I don't want to do it anymore.


But they seem to want to continue, they're pretty into it. When we talk about what we're going to do, what is left to do for next month etc. one of them is always saying ""it's up to you guys, you are programming and drawing, so as you feel it"", and I think that even if it would disappoint him if I decide to ""quit"" he would understand, but the other two, even if they don't say it explicitely, **really** want the project to continue, and I'm quite sure they would make a big deal out of it if I quit, they're always saying ""it's important, the contest gives us visibility, and a full game in our portfolio is a valuable asset"" etc.


So here I am, between my exam and the search for an internship, and I don't know what to do. I *want* to quit, because I don't want to code anymore, but it would mean the end of the project, as they don't know how to code and without a programmer a game doesn't exist. I want to stop working on it, but I don't want to start a big drama, and I don't want to let them disappointed and forcing them to give up on something they like and believe in.


Also (I don't know where to put this so I'll just write it here), I'm not interested in the game anymore. While working on it, we were all in a constant buzz because we liked what we were doing, but now that I took a step backwards from the game, I don't want to work on it, it doesn't interest me *that much* anymore.


**TL;DR: I started making a game with friends for school, and we wanted to finish it after the school year, but I don't want anymore because I'm sick of programming and it would take too much of my time, when I already have a lot to do. BUT without me, the project is over, as I'm the only one in the group to know how to code.**"

College student here that received an internship offer in mid-April for 10 weeks, June to mid-August. I attend university in another corner of the country. Now that finals are over I can actually start looking at housing. I've never been to NYC and everyone tells me housing is 1000/10 on the stress meter. My office will be in the Flatiron area and I'd like to be around $1500/month for housing expenses.

From what I've read on this sub and others I can either try my luck on:

* NYU housing, which I'm told is filled up at this point

* Craigslist (I'd rather not), which is supposedly all scams 

* do an Airbnb for the entire 10 weeks

* Or try something in the sublet domain like [Flip.lease](https://flip.lease). My concern with this option is having to fly in and sign immediately, which may or may not be viable...


Which option is the best for an out-of-state situation / which should I go with? Also, which neighborhoods or areas should I be looking at? Thanks."

69gq3c,13,2017-05-05,Need some post-graduation advice,Cristal_God,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/69gq3c/need_some_postgraduation_advice/,"I am graduating next week with a bachelor in Chemical Engineering and would greatly appreciate some advice about the job market. Here is a brief background about my experience:

I will be graduating from the University of Minnesota and I have worked as a paid research assistant at my university in the summer of 2016-the research project was related to ammonia.

During my last semester, I have been applying to a plethora of full-time, internship, and co-op engineering jobs related to chemical engineering, e.g. manufacturing, process development, quality, etc. However, I have not heard back from most of the companies-the responses I have received decided to move on with other candidates. While I am primarily looking for engineering jobs, I have received interest from companies hiring chemists. As graduation nears, without a clear path to take, some thoughts have arisen that I have been struggling to resolve:

1.	 Currently, the chemist positions I have heard back from (only interviews so far) are contract positions (1 year) with good companies, i.e. Ecolab, and Cargill; however, I am a little discouraged by the pay rate ($15-18 per hour) and how this may adversely affect my ability to find or work as a chemical engineer instead of a chemist. If you have any experience related to this, I would greatly appreciate to read what you have to share!
 
2.	My other plan was to continue applying over the summer, working in an unrelated job to pay for student loans, in the hopes that companies will be hiring during the fall time (around September) or even over the summer.

Although I am interested in working as a chemist to start somewhere, I am afraid that it will market me as a chemist and adversely affect my job prospect afterwards looking for jobs related to chemical engineering. Additionally, since it is a contract position for one year, I would not be able to capitalize on any opportunities to work as an engineer during that one year. Any information about contract positions would be greatly appreciated. Based on what I have written, my options, and any experiences you guys have related to this subject, what would you guys do?

Thanks a lot!

69gq82,8,2017-05-05,college over,sirtophat,mylittleandysonic1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittleandysonic1/comments/69gq82/college_over/,"not sure what to make of it. getting the degree I went for (computer science 4 year) and at least got one internship, as shitty as it was, but I didn't use all the free time as effectively as I wanted to and didn't end up being able to get even one date like I'd set out to once I transferred from the CC to the 4 year for the last 2 years. the classes were almost all easy and I never had the problems you hear about in common complains about coursework but I came out of the whole thing feeling somewhat unfulfilled. maybe things will pick up once I move to a city somewhere and start working at a real programming job.  I somewhat wish I just tried to go straight to the workforce after the associate's, but being able to go to national tournaments with the college's Smash Bros club was fun and 

tried for a while to think of another thing but drawing a blank at the moment, aside from being able to be away from a somewhat annoying home environment, nothing too terrible but often enough distracting and frustrating, along with having to sit through dumb arguments from the other room sometimes. but then that ties into the problem that being away from that didn't translate to all the additional productivity WRT my side projects/things I make with other people/etc that I expected it to. it might've even been a detriment because when all your time is free, all of it starts to mentally feel equally unimportant such that you can just watch youtube or whatever for now and do the other thing later - at home if I cared about getting something done I'm more motivated to just do it before I have to go fill the bird feeder or whatever.

I guess the moral is don't expect college to be much of a help if you're ""romantically challenged,"" and if you want good internship opportunities, go to a college closer to a tech center or at least a sizable city. also be careful not to gain 40 pounds from campus food.

I wish I didn't have to go to the Celestia forsaken graduation ceremony but for whatever dumb reason it's extremely important to my parents. I'd rather just stay away from and try to forget that whole place - there were some good times but I have too many other negative feeling associated with it. frustration, boredom, stress over financial aid problems and my advisor being too dumb to do anything right and his mistakes almost delaying my graduation.

I also don't want to have to redo all my subscribed subreddits on another account. I guess I'll give you guys a boring update. I haven't killed myself, and I haven't fucked anything else up. I guess I am ok by definition.  /u/151andChocolate/submitted/ for my submission history.

I've just been focusing on school, and my summer internship is about to start. I won't be going home at all for the summer. I'm still not in the mood to date anyone, so I let a rumor run wild that I am lesbian around school. Guys were pursuing me more than I wanted them too. I got drunk and horny and decided to fool around with another girl in my program a couple times. Neither one of us wanted anything serious. It's not something I haven't done in high school with girlfriends before, so it's no big deal. I don't talk about it with anyone back home because my parents would probably freak out even more than they did before when they found out about my brother and me. Incest and then lesbian; I think my dad would just start murdering people at that point. I remember when they cut off helping my brother financially when he got an apartment with his lesbian best friend. He mostly spent that extra money on gifts for them, me and charity to foster kids, so the joke was on them.

I did tell my best friend, the one marrying my brother this summer. She finds it hilarious. Later on, she actually let it slip that she actually wouldn't have minded sharing him with me from time to time after we all talked about what happened between me and him, but he told her to tell me that she wasn't interested in that. Apparently, he didn't want me to try asking him to go down that route. My friend made it clear he is seriously done with incest entirely and wants us to go back to the way we were. I am not really sure we ever can go back to the way we were. We're friendly again at least. I answer his calls and talk to him weekly now. It's helping him, but I don't think it is helping me get over him any easier.

I did start going to a therapist, but I stopped. I was never comfortable being honest about the incest, so I had to make up a story where my brother wasn't my brother. I just wanted to spill my guts out and say whatever I wanted to say, but it just got complicated fabricating an elaborate lie. It was just so fucking frustrating, so I decided to just cancel all my future appointments. I was also running out of things to be angry about, and there were times I was just sitting there trying to think of something to talk about because I had finished my ranting and raving already.

I think I am becoming numb to the whole thing. I am still in love with my brother, but I am not angry anymore. I only really think about him when I am by myself and alone with my thoughts. I work and go to school. I don't really have much time to do anything else. I am always in study groups or my roommate is having a party when I am not working or going to class. 

I don't think am going to even worry about love and dating until I graduate. I am in no rush to have any kids unlike my brother. Guess what? His wedding was going to be in the fall; they got the wedding moved up because my best friend just found out she is pregnant. Her birth control failed, and she doesn't want her baby bump to be huge for the wedding. I am surprised it doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. She was afraid that I would be angry at her and stop talking to her. Instead, I joked that it would be funny if we had a male stripper for a combined baby shower/bachelorette party. I think I could hear her tearing up when she was laughing over the phone. Don't get me wrong, if my best friend decided she wanted to be with someone else, I'd take my brother back in a heartbeat if he came to me. I just think I have just gotten used to the notion that he and I will never be together and come to terms with it."

69h3rp,152,2017-05-05,Reflections After 10 Episodes,cls-moriarty,ColinsLastStand,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColinsLastStand/comments/69h3rp/reflections_after_10_episodes/,"The last two months have been a whirlwind. The busiest, craziest, and most tiring of my life.

Funny thing is, the last two months of my life have also been the most exhilarating and rewarding I’ve experienced in my 32 years on this planet. I’ve never felt so creative, so excited, and so personally and professionally fulfilled.

Life comes at you like that, sometimes. With highs and lows, sometimes in extremes, stitched together just-so in order to create a new tapestry you couldn’t imagine possible even days and weeks earlier.

Moving on from my old life wasn’t easy, nor intuitive. It was overtly frightening, leaping without looking. I wrote about, made videos concerning, and podcasted on video games for a staggering 18 years of my life. I started from the most embryonic state imaginable, with nothing but a ton of free time allotted only to bored teenagers, and an insatiable appetite for the craft. I had no expectations of (or much desire for) success or fame. But I became one of the lucky ones. My hard work and determination paid off. It is a classic bootstraps story, a classic midnight oil story, a classic burning both ends story. It is all the proof you need that you are the captain of your own ship, and you play a major, central role in charting your own course.

But the story doesn’t start and stop there. I’ll always be the first to tell you that, without the kindness and belief of those around me, and the opportunities they provided for me, I would have never risen from freelancer and intern to Associate Editor to Editor to Senior Editor of the world’s biggest video game website. I would have never co-hosted one of the most famous, popular, and beloved gaming podcasts the world has ever seen. Likewise, without the love, support, and kindness of those who followed me for those many years, I wouldn’t have been able to walk away from that situation strictly on my own terms. I could have stayed -- I’d still be there right now, had I chosen a different path -- but I saw opportunity. Something new beckoning on the horizon.

I knew that next endeavor would also ultimately end for me -- nothing is permanent -- though I didn’t anticipate I’d choose to walk away after only a couple of years. But I did, once again on my own terms, and once again because of the strength provided to me by the thousands upon thousands upon thousands of you out there who, somehow, some way, became my ardent fans and supporters. Somewhere along the way -- in a million different ways, at a million different moments in time -- you and I became intrinsically linked. That fact, and that fact alone, has been one of the truest, realest blessings of my life. If my mind is the engine, and my heart the compass, then you guys an gals are undoubtedly the fuel.

Jumping into the abyss was scary. It still is, actually. But we all deserve an opportunity for true happiness. Not just contentment or “this is what I do, so I guess I’ll do it forever,” but actual happiness. A reason to wake up in the morning, to excitedly approach each day with an authentic eagerness. I hadn’t had that in years. It’s hard to explain to an outside observer how lost, lonely, trapped, and depressed I had become. I kept telling myself, “this is who you are, and this is what you do,” but in reality, I am who I am, and I can do whatever I set my mind to. (That’s true for all of us, by the way.)

Colin’s Last Stand is the result of an internal and external maelstrom, a tugging of the heart and the mind, the creation of something out of a raging wildfire. I didn’t know if it’d work. I didn’t know if anyone would care. And those remain open questions: I still don’t know if it’ll ultimately work, and I still know if anyone will ultimately care. But the signs sure are positive, aren’t they? My modest financial goals were eclipsed many times over. My estimates for how many views my videos would get, how positive the interactions would be on YouTube, what the like-to-dislike ratio was, how Reddit and Twitter and Facebook would respond. all blown to smithereens. It turns out there’s an appetite out there for something with actual heft and meaning, and all of you out there determined the barometer’s incredibly positive reading.

I’ve never worked this hard in my life, and that says something, not only to me, but to family and close friends, who know that there were many times in my life when I was nothing but a workaholic. I’ve given myself one real day off since my resignation; otherwise, I’ve worked my ass off. I’m sleeping less than I’ve ever slept. I’ve lost weight. I’m up at weird hours, writing a script, or jotting down some notes, or interacting with CLS’ amazing fanbase across the Internet.

I’ve never been this happy, because I’m doing exactly what it is I want to do. I’ve never felt this fulfilled, because I wasn’t only able to live my dream once, through my 20’s, but twice, into my 30’s. And even if it all falls apart and it all goes away, I will know that I tried, that I gave it my all, that I left it all out on the field. Every ounce of me has gone into this. I’ve given it everything. And I hope it shows, even if there’s so much left for me to learn, to figure out, and to improve at. I am a one man army, and I’m doing my absolute best, each and every day. I will never, ever mail it in.

I lost a lot these past couple of months. Friends I thought were friends weren’t. Allies I had assisted didn’t return the favor. I barely stepped foot in my own apartment that I had once adored, and a city that I had spent so much time in and learned to love ended up a cold husk I no longer wanted to be anywhere near.

But in that destruction came a sort of beautiful awakening. I moved to a new city, one that feels so welcoming, so different, and so unique. I got a new apartment in a new building, blocks from the beach (I need to connect to my LI roots, after all). New friends and allies appeared and extended a hand. My oldest friends -- the Ramons and Mike Popes of the world -- reaffirmed their love and affection for me. My family -- my father and mother, my sisters and brother, my brother-in-law and sister-in-law, my cousins, my nieces and nephews, down to the absolute last person -- showed their undying affection for me. Old friends, acquaintances, and faces I hadn’t heard from in years patted me on the back and reminded me they knew who I really was.

And my girlfriend -- my fucking unmovable rock of a woman -- stayed in my corner and vigilantly watched my back. You want to talk about loyalty? You want to talk about thick and thin? You want to talk about utter devotion? You have your definition in Erin.

Never before had I seen where so many people stood. And while it was painful in many ways, it was incredible in others. The cast of characters I have in my life today are nothing short of incredible, and the opportunities being presented to me to this day, even outside of Colin’s Last Stand, are extraordinary.

But, as always, it circles right on back to all of you. The fuel. You stood by me, too. You had my back, too. You were as eager to support me, watch my videos, and show your love as I was to move on with my life, to try something new, and to hope above all else that it’d succeed. None of you out there -- whether you watch an occasional video or support me at the highest level on Patreon, or anywhere in between -- can truly fathom how much I owe you. Nothing is lost on me there. Not a damn thing. You and I? We have a bond. The proof, as it turns out, is in the pudding.

Colin’s Last Stand continues to evolve, to (I hope) get better, and to -- above all else -- inform, educate, and catalyze a little bit of thought. In a world full of so much filler and so much bullshit, I want CLS to provide a respite. I hope it’s working. You’ll be the judge of that.

I thank you from the very bottom of my heart for what you’ve done for me. I won’t let you down.

Your friend, -Colin"

So I'm a recent CS convert, having come to the field from a liberal arts background. My dad is in the field as well and passed my resume along after my having taken a few CS courses as part of an associate's degree program. Turns out, instead of getting an internship as I had anticipated, I got a job!

I have one colleague, though, who keeps making comments about how I wouldn't be here without my dad (I'm sure he did help my resume get noticed, I'll admit that!) and that even if I had bombed the technical interview, they would've given it to me blah blah. My dad isn't high up at the company so I don't think his opinion was weighed much in my hiring.

Whether it was or wasn't though, I can't tell if I'm getting these comments due to my background being different or due to my being the only young female on the team. The other college hire (who has a BS CS and is male) never gets any comments of the sort and his dad works here as well. 

I love the job and I feel that despite my off-kilter roundabout education experience, I've learned a lot in the 9 months I've been here and that for the most part it's been pleasant. 

I just don't understand the motivation to discredit my accomplishments. "
69h69e,166,2017-05-05,Summer is coming - Intern practice,michael_harari,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/69h69e/summer_is_coming_intern_practice/,"Soon enough it will be July 1, and many of you will get signout on a few dozen patients, handed a pager and told to not kill anyone. Its a scary transition. I am on a rather light rotation now, so I figured I would give some practice intern scenarios.

You are a night float surgery intern, covering bariatrics, transplant and plastics. You receive a page from the surgery ward.

""Ms. Smith just go to the floor from PACU and she is is tachycardic. Whats your name doctor?""

  You look down at your list, it says
&gt;Rm 201-A Smith, J. -  Gastric bypass POD 0. Bari 1 diet, tylenol/toradol/fentanyl. BMI 55, DM, HTN, OSA

You check the EMR, and see that her last set of vitals are: BP 160/90, HR 115, RR 19, SpO2 99%. Foley was removed 8 hours ago, and she voided once in PACU. The operative report says that the OR time was 90 minutes, blood loss was minimal and she received 1250mL of LR.

You go to see her. She is very anxious, and complains of severe abdominal pain and severe nausea. Her abdomen is tender to palpation. The laparoscopic port dressings are clean and dry. 

* What are your concerns?
* What are your initial course of action? What orders are you going to place? 
* Are you going to wake a senior resident up for this?

Edit:
Several people requested labs. Hct is 34 from 42, wbc is 15, electrolytes are normal apart from mild hyperglycemia


Edit: People have posted a lot of stuff. The ideal way an intern would manage this is:
&gt; 
&gt; At least at first, you should call the senior right away. At first you should call with basically everything. 'Hi, this is reddit, bariatric team intern. I have a POD 0 bypass patient who is tachycardic in room 201, going to check that out, ill find you after' 
&gt; 
&gt; Next, see her, get new vitals, physical exam. Is she toxic looking? Is she gasping for breath? Does she have real peritonitis? Urine output should be part of vitals. Bladder scan her if your institution has it, straight cath her if she cant void. 
&gt; 
&gt; Getting labs would be fine. After you prove that you arent an ISIS assassin sent to kill everyone on your service, it would be fine to draw the labs before calling. CBC, chem, type and screen (sometimes they expire the night of surgery). Get an EKG too, prove that shes in sinus and doesnt have ekg changes. For a different patient you would also get cardiac enzymes.
&gt; 
&gt; KUB is fine to get, its going to show free air though since she is POD 0. Air can stay for a variable amount of time, usually a few days. CO2 insufflation which is what we use in laparoscopic cases gets absorbed faster. Sometimes you can see mass effect on things from a large hematoma.
&gt; 
&gt; The differential here is bleeding, leak, pain, PE. A leak is definitely possible, but less than a day ago she had a leak test in the OR. Its possible, but its a pretty bad technical error for it to happen immediately post op. 
&gt; 
&gt; Bleeding - check her CBC. Its going to be lower than baseline, the exact amount that would trigger suspicion for a bleed depends on the surgery that was done, and is hard to give exact numbers for. 
&gt; Leak - Again, POD 0 leak would be pretty bad. I would not image this patient overnight, but it would be a good thing to suggest to your senior, as it shows you are thinking.
&gt; Pain - Very common in post op patients, and we tend to run bariatric patients on relatively low doses of narcotics because of the risk of respiratory complications. Pain is the last thing you should consider though, since its the only thing on this list that wont kill the patient. 
&gt; PE - Bariatic patients are at elevated risk of dvt. She should have gotten subcutaneous heparin immediately before induction of anesthesia, and should be on it now. Even if her crit drops a little, I would leave her on it. If you have to a-stick her for labs (as bariatric patients are often hard to get blood on), go ahead and get an ABG, but since she has no symptoms of a PE this is not really high on my list.
&gt; 
&gt; Last is not on the list, but is NOTHING. Sometimes postop patients haven an inflammatory response which can cause tachycardic, fever, etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; Several people said they would get UGI series or CT scans. While a leak is definitely possible, POD 0 is pretty unlikely. I wouldnt image her overnight.
&gt; 
&gt; Treatment at this point would be to bolus her a liter or LR or plasmalyte, make sure she knows how to use her PCA. If she is maxing out on her PCA, increase the dose. Examine her again in an hour. Make sure the nursing staff knows she needs strict ins and outs, and that all her urine should be quantified. 
&gt; 
&gt; Other things - 
&gt; Do not place an ngt - this patient has a fresh staple line, and while its probably ok, you dont want to be the intern that put an NGT into the peritoneum
&gt; Dont stop her subq heparin until you are sure she is bleeding. These patients are at high risk of DVT
&gt; You should be afraid. Its better to be afraid of everything and to learn what is ok than to be the intern that ignores everything until someone codes.

Tomorrow Ill put up another case. Good job everyone!

69hges,6,2017-05-05,"I'm 24, never had a ""grown up, career"" type of job. Please help me start now.",LeilaintheDark,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/69hges/im_24_never_had_a_grown_up_career_type_of_job/,"Hi, I have been lurking for a while in this wonderful community, and thought I would post to seek advice. I’m feeling really desperate and disheartened these days after sending out dozens of resumes with customized cover letters, and not getting any responses. Any advice or words of encouragement/perspective would be greatly appreciated (telling me I messed up is ok too.)



Background:

I got a bachelor’s of fine arts in filmmaking at New York University, during which I did an unpaid internship. After graduating, a tiny company actually wanted to hire me, but they didn’t want to deal with sponsoring an H1B visa down the line (I’m Canadian.) I did a few (very few) freelance gigs during my OPT (practical training) year, and oh I also did another unpaid internship at a tiny company. (Stupid I know.)

Did not secure H1B, moved to Toronto where I knew almost zero people (hometown is in another part of Canada.) I applied to stuff on the internet, and immediately got a full-time job as an assistant video editor at a small company. My first “real” job, though it wasn’t the most professional of environments. (For example, one day the owner of the company gave me a $50 bill as a “tip” in front of other employees.) 1.5 months later, I was laid off along with many other editors because they ran out of budget.

Somehow, I could not get another job in my field for the life of me after that. I sent out about 100 applications and got absolutely no responses. At the time, I didn’t think about getting a job in say, administrative assistance. I ran out of money, started working as a cashier, then a waitress, then a bartender. I was 22, and time flew.

I freaked out when I realized I had been bartending for almost a year. So I quit and went to Beijing to teach English (also random and kind of dumb.) I know a few people recommended teaching English abroad on Reddit, but it was definitely not right for me for various reasons. Anyway, I quit after 4 months and came back to Toronto a month ago, and it feels like I’m back where I started, except with a nasty gap on my resume.



Notes and questions:

* I had pretty severe low self-esteem, which is a lot better now thanks to therapy. But I still get really awkward and anxious asking friends and acquaintances for help. I have done it before, but I think what I got back was more pity and avoidance rather than help. What is a good way to use your contacts?

* I wasn’t just messing around this entire time. In my spare time, I worked really hard on a film analysis Youtube channel, as well as personal writing projects. I’m pretty proud of these to be honest, and I try to use them as evidence of passion and working independently in some cover letters. Should I just take it out?

* I have a lot of skills, but it seems like there are new skill requirements in my field all the time. I learned a bit of After Effects on my own, and now many positions are seeking full-on animation experience along with video editing. I learned Photoshop and a bit of Illustrator, and now they're seeking InDesign as well. How far should one take the fake it 'til you make it thing?



Moving forward:

At this point, I’m trying to get an entry level position in pretty much any company that doesn’t need special certification. I learn really quickly, and can be trained to do whatever (though I wouldn’t fare well in sales.) I also don’t get responses for receptionist or administrative assistance positions, either because they get so many applications that they don’t even see mine, or because my work history and gaps is a red flag.



*Could you give me some advice, or a wake up call? Is there some other path that I’m not seeing through my panic? Thank you for any help!*



TL;DR: spent my twenties barely hanging on doing random gigs, trying to start a career now."

My tl;dr - the ""rich"" are not as wealthy nor as privileged as reddit likes to believe. The perception of ""the rich"" that reddit has only really applies to the likes of the 0.1%.  

A little background about me: My parents came to the US as poor immigrants (as did those of many of my friends). I'm currently a high school senior about to graduate and head into college. I attend a public school (my older brother attended a private, but I went to a public as my parents couldn't afford to send us both). I live in a wealthy county, but my parents are not super well off - they struggle financially to maintain a lifestyle here (with the high taxes, property costs etc) but do it to give me a better future. I am thankful for the chance to attend a good public school, as are my friends, and acknowledge the IMMENSELY hard work put in by my parents to make this possible and same for pretty much everyone else at my school. (Siderant: But apparently, by reddit's rules, wanting to give your children any type of ""privilege"" is evil so you should actively try to make them suffer even if you have the means to do otherwise...).


Ok so onwards to the points frequently brought up by redditors.


1) ""Daddy's connections"" - everyone seems to have this idea that everyone in the top 10%/5% income bracket has a parental network that extends into every major tech, finance, medical, and consulting firm in the world. Apparently, all you have to do is fail through college and your parents will plop you with elite internships and a 6 figure job straight out of undergrad with ""connections"" and ""privilege"".

My dad literally only has ""connections"" with a few people at his small workplace, and none of those connections have any relevance to me at all, nor have i ever used any. This is the same case for 99% of the people I attend school with. I have a qualified friend who sent literally 40+ unsuccessful emails for internships - the struggle is universal. Even for those that have some meaningful connections, they often are pursuing studies in non-related fields, again making those connections invalid. We are not the kids of fortune 500 CEOs. Upper-income bracket families do not equate to billionaires in terms of networks.

 
2) ""Tutoring"" - Misconception: Any time anyone struggles with anything, their daddy will just plop down 300$/hr for an elite tutor and pump up their sat/gpa no problem.

Reality: Less than 10 kids in my grade (out of 300) probably use private tutoring for subjects. SAT/ACT tutoring is also not used that often either, and is surprisingly affordable should someone actually want it. The VAST majority just buy cheap used study books. Even those who do tutor extensively often struggle. Tutoring helps some kids a little bit, but it almost is never something that makes ""a world of difference"" in terms of tiered advancement. The most elite kids in my grade never tutored once. 


3) Workload - Misconception: We go to the bahamas every weekend since we're rich and we don't have anything better to do.

Reality: People are literally killing themselves studying and overloading on extracurriculars to get into elite colleges. There are some who choose not to - that is their choice, and they are on comparatively worse trajectories. The whole of it all is actually quite meritocratic/work-based, not handed on a silver platter in any form. No, having a wealthier parent does not magically guarantee acceptance into any university. To the counterpoint, there are actually statistical studies that show higher-income children need higher numerical stats (GPA/test scores) to get accepted into a school compared to lower-income children (Affirmative action rules). 


4) My last point is on the parents of the kids i go to school with. 

Misconception: They got lucky or were incredibly privileged to begin with

Reality: Almost all of them are incredibly brilliant. I've had chances to talk with them and learn about their extensive/difficult educations, and I can safely say that the vast majority of my friends' parents are not only brilliant, but have suffered extensively to reach the ""privileged"" position they have in life. I respect them immensely.


Sorry if this came off as ranty, but again, that's what this sub is for. Thanks for listening, and if anyone has any questions I'd be happy to answer.

So here's my thoughts on it:

I have watched SourceFed before Nerd even existed and before Sam was an intern and DJ was on camera. I have been a HUGE fan of the show because of the hosts. Even when the content wasn't my personal favourite I watched because of the chemistry, passion and personalities of each and every host on the show. I watched as some of my favourite humans left the show to move on to different projects and watched as new people came in and added new and fun dynamics. I watched Sam evolve from this shy and frankly awkward boy, into a confident, talented and professional host/writer as he progressively got better and better on this platform. I remember connecting a lot with his personality but also his transformation into a confident and successful adult as I was going through the same transformation in my life. I've struggled with mental illness and severe depression for years and SourceFed made me laugh and see a brighter side to life when I was on the brink of break downs. Even though it was just a show it helped to make me feel better when the world got me down. I love all the hosts and continue to support them all on their other endeavours but wanted to give a special shout out to Sam and all the incredible work and growth you have gone through since your start on this channel. You are incredibly talented, charismatic, intelligent and funny. I watched your dedication and passion with the Nerd channel and got into comics because of your 101 videos. I know it must be fucking devastating to watch something you poured your heart and soul into for years be basically stolen, and subs fall but your hard work and passion will always show in the content you continue to create and those videos you and the whole team created will live on forever in the internet machine. 

Also DJ you are just as awesome and talented and you were my absolute favourite host on the tv show show etc, you are another huge reason I decided to explore comics and now have found my perfect creative outlet (: I look forward to reading your comic and seeing your future projects.

All five minutes of it. On a HealthyRide rental.

But she lived. And could walk, if barely, by late summer. She attended the remembrance in early September for the cyclist who got killed on West Carson -- on foot. Eventually, a couple months ago, she was cleared to get on two wheels again. Only problem was, and this is a good thing for her, she got an internship in Washington D.C., so wasn't back here very often.

She was back in town for a week, though, and wanted to ride across the Bloomfield Bridge. Arrangements for earlier in the day with various folks fell through, but a retry coincided with me leaving the mayoral debate at Rodef Shalom Temple a mile away.

They'll text back and forth, initially just memes and funny things, but then she'll start opening up to him. Venting to him after you and she get in an argument. Sharing all her frustrations with him. She'll want to hang out with him more. They hug when they see each other. ""He's just a friend"", she'll say. ""OK, love, enjoy your movie. I'll see you later"", you'll say.

Then once school's out for the summer she'll stop responding to texts as frequently. She'll stop reaching out to you. When you finally confront her, she'll drop the bomb: ""Let's go on a break"".

But we all know what that means. 

For the rest of your time in school you'll avoid her in the hallways. You'll hear news about her through other people. The dates she's going on. The people's she hanging out with. The new, exciting things she's doing. The hobbies and interests she never told you about. You resent her.

You'll move on. Go to college. Meet other girls. Have your heart broken some more, but less painful. You even might break some hearts yourself. Your undergraduate years will pass by fast. You'll get a degree and graduate, get an internship, start working an office job. You'll start questioning the meaning of life more. Why you show up in khakis and a button down shirt every day. 

You'll do online dating, poring over your profile to make sure it hits all the right spots: ""I love kayaking"" (means your adventurous), ""I make a mean lasagna"" (signals that you're not a typical bro and you like to cook even though you've only made the lasagna one time from a Rachel Ray recipe and don't really cook anything else), ""My favorite musicians: [list of slightly indie musicians to make it seem you have cultivated a sophisticated interest in music but really you don't know enough about music to appreciate it beyond liking 'the beat' of a song].

You'll go on dates, finally meeting Stephanie. The One. 87% match on OKcupid. She does drag-n-drop web development for a cake decorator. You're perfect for each other. After a year and eight months you'll propose to her. You'll get a house in a moderately-priced suburb that you paid for but Stephanie will dictate the decoration and layout. You'll get a kitchen island (""it raises the equity value"" she'll say). 

You'll become comfortable. Stop exercising. Eating more garbage. Stop *trying*. She'll randomly cry, ""You don't love me! You'll run off with someone else!"" She'll brow beat you, becoming the trope sitcom wife, fists on hips and head condescendingly tilted. You'll be relegated to your 'man cave' with video game posters on the wall and Doctor Who whisky decanter. 

You'll have sex quarterly. Each time both of your bellies making it harder to engage in the act. Maybe you'll try for having a kid, but even then it would be more of a medical procedure then an act of lust. 

You'll have a kid and both of you will drift apart. You'll start going to board game meetups with strangers at the local Panera, just to get out of the house for a few hours. Wearing your Zelda t-shirt you'll get some positive attention from Caroline. She wears glasses and is cute, a little chubby. She works at the RenFaire in the Spring and also does home healthcare assistance. 

You'll text each other. Initially just memes and funny things, but then you'll start opening up to her.                             "

69m70y,1,2017-05-06,I [M23] lost her [F20] because of her depression. I feel like I’m going down with her.,OoXx123throw123xXoO,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/69m70y/i_m23_lost_her_f20_because_of_her_depression_i/,"First of all I want to apologize for the grammar mistakes I’m about to make. English is not my first language. I’ll try to minimise my mistakes. And it’s a throwaway account because some people might recognise me.

I met her (let’s call her Z.) around this time of the year in 2016. It was nothing special at first. The usual stuff that happens if you start to date someone. She told me relatively early that she’s suffering from depression and that every relationship ended in her getting cheated on. That’s why it’s extremely hard for her to trust someone or communicate. She thinks she isn’t capable to maintain a healthy relationship. To make things worse, she isn’t going to therapy because apparently doctors only want your money and don’t care about you. „They won’t help me“. Major red flag I know. But let me tell you a little bit about myself. I’m not an depression-expert, but I had to fight with my own depressive episode back when I was 14. It went so far that my mother broke down crying infront of me because she thought that she lost her child. That was the moment I decided to change my life. I started working out, eating healthier and tried to be more open about my problems. I managed to pull myself out it. I can imagine how she feels. I know how it feels to be left alone. When everyone and everything is hurting you. I know how it feels. I never directly told her this but I wanted to be there for her. I knew that I couldn’t make her depression disappear. Especially not without her going to therapy. But I wanted to show her that not everything is evil. 



What started as a friendship quickly developed into more. When the time came I asked her if she wanted to become exclusive and she said yes. But gave our relationship only 5 months. She thought I won’t stay longer than 5 months with her because she’s too complicated and not ready for a real relationship. Red flag number two. The honeymoonphase was beautiful and I could really imagine spending the rest of my life with her.



I fucking love her family. That’s something I have to mention. Her parents are cool as fuck and her dog loves me more than anything. He would always jump and cry when I was visiting Z. and her family. They are living in a house outside of the city. It takes like 40min for me to get there with public transportation. Nothing too special. Her mother always told me that she thinks I’m good for her daughter. That she’s happy right know because I’m there for Z. I was there for her when she had problems with her schoolwork. I was there for her when she felt lonely and depressive. I was there for here when she was sick. Bought her food, rolled her into blankets to watch netflix together and cuddle. I skipped university classes to spend time with her. I’m a physics student so I spend a lot of time doing lab protocols or solving math homework. I’m not a bad student but I’m not an A student either so it never really affected me that much. I dedicated my whole freetime after university and the gym to her and it was sometimes not enough. She would tell me how I would choose the gym over her. That I’m only going to the gym to impress other girls. That I’m too muscular. Which I'm definetely not. I told her that I need this. Because it was one of the major things that helped me dealing with my own depression but I think she never believed me. Additionally she is an extremly jealous person. Not the „I fucking stalk you“- type of jealousy but the one that really hurts our relationship. She would just go into „no communication mode“ and would sit there silently. I tried everything to ease her mind but nothing worked. Her mother told me that’s something she has to deal with almost every week. And that’s probably one of her worst traits. It made my life so hard. I would get jealous myself because she was writing with other people while I wanted to talk about things. I was never really jealous in any of my relationships but if you get the silent treatment while she is constantly writing with other men…I don’t know. But help me god if I was talking to other girls. But I trusted her. She never did anything that really concerned me. She started tagging the same guy over and over again in facebook memes. That’s the thing that got me the most probably because that was something she always did with me. But those are memes. Nothing that would break my trust in her. But then the honeymoonphase ended. Man I was not prepared…



So we hit our „5 month goal“ and everything was fine. Of course the things I already mentioned bothered me. And I tried to talk to her but it was always the same. I would go down the stairs when she was silently lying in her bed looking at her phone and talk to her parents. Most of the time it was her mother. She would tell me stories about Z.‘s life before depression hit her and how I have to decide wether I want to stay with Z and hope for the best or leave her. But she can tell me that Z really loves me and cares about me. But the way she is showing this is different and she can understand when I want to breakup with Z. And then she said something that really haunts me until this day: „Every men in her life left her at some point (she’s not living with her biological father). Everytime things get worse they left her or cheated on her. And she thinks that you will leave her too if she says something wrong.“ So I decided to stay with her. Be there for her and love her like a madman. Tried to cuddle with her after a discussion or bring her sushi when she's sad and hug her for minutes. When she ignored me while I was talking about a problem I would just stop and hug her and tell her that I'm trying to do my best for her and that I love her.



But nothing I did changed anything. I think it made things even worse. Z started to talk to me less and less. Her messages started to get more distant. Only „yes“,  „ok“, „maybe“ and „I don’t care“. Sometimes it would be „doesn’t matter“ and this was by far the worst. She would always write this, when I was asking her about her day or her plans for the next day. She would just say that she has no time this weekend to see me. And I would just answer like: „ Ahh Okok. What are you up to? Just tell me when you have some time. We can go to a nice restaurant.“ I always tried to get her out of her bed. But sometimes I would just lay down with her cuddle with her while watching netflix. I never tried to force her to do something. Her answer would be „doesn’t matter. Wouldn’t change anything“. Now imagine your girlfriend giving you this answer every fucking time you ask her about her plans. I told her that I have a tight schedule too and have to plan around hers if she wants me to spend time with her. „It doesn’t matter if I’m going out with my friends or go to the cinema with my parents. I have no time.“ Now logically she has an argument. But that’s not how relationships work. I don’t want to know everything about her day and what she’s doing. Is it too much to ask her what she’s doing?



Now to the real problem I’m facing right now. I’m sorry for the long post but it feels so good to write everything out. I could write 10 more pages but I  just want to give you the most important information. I tried to deal with this for 4 more months until I couldn’t deal with it anymore. I told her that things aren’t really going in the right direction. I think our relationship won’t hold if things progress like they did before. Of course she sat there. Silently. She would lay down in her bed, facing aways from me, and just listen. I dont even know if she even listened. I told her how I felt. Told her that I don’t feel loved. No „I love you“ from here since 2 months, no compliments or even a „thank you“ for the food I cook for her or buy her. I felt used. I was honest. Maybe a little bit too honest. But I was devastated. I tried for too long to swallow everything down. I told her that she has to try talking to me. We have to talk about problems. I know that she keeps everything for herself but I can’t change anything if she remains silent. I know I’m not perfect. No one is but I really wanted this relationship to work because I fucking loved this girl with all my heart. And then the she went towards her wardrobe. Opened it and gave me every sweatshirt, tshirt and pants she „borrowed“ from me. 



You can’t imagine how fucking savage this was. I spotted the jacket I gave her on our 4th date or so. She later told me that she would cuddle with this jacket when I wasn’t around. My heart broke into 1000 pieces. I gathered my things and went downstairs. Her parents instantly knew what happend and her father was furious. Called her egoistic and that he’s done with her depression. She should get help. He’s very popular in his niche and owns a fairly big company where Z. and I are working. I’m working there since December as a working student and she is doing an internship since April. I don’t plan on leaving this company. Not because of a relationship that has ended. Her manager would complain about her because she was just on her mobile phone texting. That made her father extra furious because we both tried everything so the company gives her enough money so she can have her tattoo she wanted. She signed a contract for a 35hr week and 450€ per month. You don’t need to be Einstein to do the math. Her father as the CEO talked to the HR Department and couldn’t do anything. I spend one complete night to find a loophole in the contract. I had a good connection to the Head of HR so I could get her one with a possible payment of over 1000€.  And now we sit there. She just threw a relationship away. I’m devastated and her father is angry.



I tried talking to her after some days. I just wanted to have an explanation. I refused to go down without any form of explanation. She told me that she’s not ready to have a relationship. It’s too onesided and it’s only fair if she lets me go. She always told me that this relationship won’t work an that she can’t have a healthy one because of her depression. That’s not going to change and she doesn’t want me to suffer for it. I’m having a hard time right now. This move just crushed every little piece in me. She once told me that she can’t make decisions. And the only real decision she made was to get rid of me. FML



I can’t be angry about her. She made a descision and I have to accept it. But it destroyed me. It destroyed me really hard. I can’t sleep, can’t eat, I lost my breakupgains instantly after I got them because I’m so fucking exhausted. „I want to have a relationship but can’t do it. I have to find myself first and can’t have you wait for me.“ The last words I recieved. And the words of her mother still haunt me. I feel so useless right now. Everything I felt when I had my depression is coming back. I met her mother with the dog I haven’t seen in weeks in the office the other day. He instantly jumped me and was happy like he used to be. I nearly cried thinking about never seeing this dog again. I lost all of my self esteem. One side of me thinks that this isn’t over now and that the depression in her is talking. I can still see her in groups on whatsapp and line. She is just writing like always. Her flirty way of talking to those people is now so painfull to watch. I had to mute every group. Today she was writing to someone she really likes to flirt with: „I really love you for your bad sense of humor &lt;3 I hope you know this.“ And they were playfully talking about marriage. This sentence could have saved our relationship. Just a simple „love you“ and a hug. But it didn’t happen because of her depression. But it's no problem for her to say it to people she never met in a groupchat. You can not imagine the darkness I’m about to enter. And everything because I tried to love her with all my heart.
Reddit I need your help…




Tl:dr
Met depressive Girlfriend who I dearly cared for just to get dumped after I talked about my feelings in the relationship. „I want to have a relationship but can’t do it. I have to find myself first and can’t have you wait for me.“ The last words I recieved. I’m devastated and her father‘s furious. Almost cried after I met her mother with her dog in the office. Now I’m just a mess. Constantly watching breakup motivation youtube videos and eating ice cream. 
I think I'll start watching Adam Sandler movies.

Yesterday I got the call that they hope to schedule an interview with me next week...

Cue the freak out. The voicemail said the interview could take an hour. I've never been in an interview for that long...I have done many job &amp; internship interviews in my life and I get nervous for each one, but never in my life has my anxiety been as bad as it is now. The idea of going in for this interview terrifies me and I have been crying all morning imagining sitting in front of a panel for an hour. I feel like all of a sudden I'm not qualified and that I don't know enough to even interview for 20 minutes and it's going to bea disaster.

My parents and friends and boyfriend know I applied. My parents have been asking me if I've heard anything &amp; I know how excited they would be if they knew I got an interview but all I can think of is how disappointed in me they would be if they knew I was sitting on my bathroom floor right now crying  and shaking because I don't even want to call back but then I'll just get the guilt anxiety because I missed an opportunity.

I used to not be this way :( I want to be the girl that kills interviews and gets excited for opportunities again.

PS: what's making this so much worse is I am desperately trying to get a therapist and have called three but got sent to voicemail. None of the three have called me back and it's been two days. I'm starting to feel like there is no hope for help as I'm sick of trying to explain my thoughts to my family and friends and boyfriend who I know can't understand.

Anyway thanks for reading. Just feels good to get this out. And if anyone else has a similar experience or anxiety about an opportunity please share."

I got an internship position at Texas Instruments from July 2017 to January 2018, and am currently searching for an apartment / flatshare / room. I'm a French electrical engineering student (24 year old) doing my master degree in Switzerland (EPFL).

I don't know the area around Freising at all, so I'm hoping you guys could give me a few recommendations ?

Some considerations:
I don't own a car so most of traveling will be on foot or public transportation (maybe I'll get a bike, depends on the distance between my place &amp; TI).
I wouldn't mind a longer commute (like, 30-40 minutes, not more) as long as the apartment is in a good location. (What are good locations in Freising?)

I'm hoping to find a place with a maximum rent of 500€ for a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom or studio apartment or flatshare. Is it a decent budget for Freising?

I might aswell consider searching around Munich area, I've heard the public transportation around Munich are pretty good, is that doable to commute everyday back and forth Munich to TI?

I'll be continuing my search so any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated! I'd also love to hear any TI stories you may have!

I took the AAMC practice exam #1 last week and scored a 504 (127/123/128/126) and i just now took the AAMC exam #2 and scored 501 (126/123/127/125) and i feel miserable about it. I made some simple mistakes and I feel like my actual score would have been closer to 503 on exam 2. I have my actual exam scheduled a week from now (5/13) and I am not sure whether I should just go in and take it and get it scored, or whether I should just take it as a practice and void it. I am open to both DO and MD schools.

* cGPA: 3.82 
* sGPA: 3.75

* 1 year of academic research (no pubs)
* 2 summers of internship at a reputable chemical company
* ~180 hours clinical volunteering
* ~50 hours non-clinical volunteering

It's really depressing that I scored this badly on the AAMC exams but I feel like I can improve with more time. However, I am afraid that medical schools will reject me if I don't improve to above 510 if I choose to have this exam scored. I was wondering if I could have some of your guys' input on my situation.

I have a desktop with a Ubuntu partition (using i3-gaps, after some difficulty), and I'm slowly getting comfortable using it. I only use my windows partition for gaming. I also have a macbook that i use more for daily tasks/uni work (i study theoretical physics at undergraduate level)

How much do you know about GNU/Linux?

I know a basic amount, fairly comfortable with it although i do often use guides and have tabs open to help me!

Do you prefer the Windows or MacOS design? (Or if you know what a Desktop Environment is, list your favourite)

MacOS by far. Although, i love the idea of tiling window managers like i3(-gaps)

Is your hardware fairly old or obscure, or is it modern / common?

Desktop: i5 6500, 16gb ddr4, gtx 979
Macbook is a 2015 macbook pro retina

What will it be used for?

Multiple things, really. Daily use, browsing the internet(Reddit, YouTube), music etc. I view a lot of pdfs, for coursework/revision. I'm also doing an internship involving computer simulations of materials (although using a supercomputer to actually do the work). Hopefully will be using more for physics related things like simulations and development and stuff as i go. Gaming I'm not too bothered as i can use a windows partition, but if i were to use Linux on my macbook i think I'd like Football manager and Baldurs Gate to be supported.

Do you have any special requirements?

  Nope

Distro Chooser Results:

I think it said Scientific Linux or similar, although i think i accidently said i was advanced with Linux (which I am not! Still learning as i go)

Thank you in advance!"
69oxf6,149,2017-05-06,Holier Than Thou thinks my womb is old and dried up,IAmBaconsaur,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/69oxf6/holier_than_thou_thinks_my_womb_is_old_and_dried/,"I would like to share a fun tidbit about my own mother, Holier than Thou, who believes she is the most amazing Christian mother who has ever graced this earth to the point she believes she should teach parenting classes. She's a raging Narcissist and has caused my Dad to divorce her, one brother to be VLC, I am NC, and my other brother (who was usually GC anyway) has become her only child.

Anyway, this little nugget of wisdom came when I moved back home after college, and after my internship. I had to do a long internship (6 months) after graduating college, and I started mine a little later. When I didn't get a job where my internship was (I tried desperately, but no dice) I had to move back in with NMom and EDad. I was there for a grand total of four months I wanted out of there so badly.

She was a total brat when I moved back in, including taking credit for my education, career, yadda yadda, she's so super important. So while I was living with her she decided to bestow upon me the knowledge and wisdom she had. One night, and for the life of me I don't know why she said it, but she decided to give me advice about who to marry.

Now, those of you with enmeshing NMoms know, dating was hard with her. I'd been out with different guys a few times, but nothing lasted long, and she made a huge deal out of it every time that I needed to ""find a nice Christian man"" to marry. So this night in question she tells me ""You need to find a nice Christian man with some children, you'd be a good mom""

Excuse me? I have to find a man with kids already? It dawned on me. I wasn't married yet at 23, so she thought I was getting too old. Nevermind that she was 23 when she got married and 25 when my brother was born, but damn it, I was too old.

Joke's on her though, she's never met my DH (who is, annoyingly, a good Christian man, but I don't hold that against him) and she will never meet my children. And I'm fairly sure I'm able to have children still, I'm still years shy of 30 and have had no reproductive health issues."

Long rant, but I'm on Adderall, bear with me.


When I was in middle and high school, my parents saw that I was smart and good at standardized tests, and they wanted me to go really far. So they pushed me really far. They expected me to be the daughter that wouldn't cost them anything in tuition money, because I would earn a good scholarship on my own merits. They enrolled me in a Christian church youth group, not because they were particularly religious, but because they wanted me rolling with a ""good crowd"" that was less likely to get into bad shit, and because the community service I did on missions trips was good for a college application.


But they didn't realize how heavily this group was trying to indoctrinate the next generation of young believers. We weren't southern baptists; we were in New England. Young peoples' religious faith is waning but the Christian youth movement is very strong. They'd take us to conferences, set it up like a fucking concert in a big stadium arena with Christian rock bands and low light and fire-and-brimstone preachers. They made you feel like even when you feel socially awkward and shitty and unliked, God loves you anyways, if you play by His rules.


They also fetishized persecution and martyrdom. They tell you you're being unique and non-mainstream by being Christian even when others tell you its uncool. They use skits about suicide and self harm and drug abuse to try to bring you closer to god, basically by traumatizing you with graphic imagery and fear. After Columbine especially, this myth circulated that a girl was shot to death for proclaiming she believed in Jesus. On Christian camping trips and shit they'd read you these violent stories of people dying for their faith and frame you in a similar heroic narrative. There was an article on it recently, some teens aspired to be martyrs, said they felt it was their spiritual calling. I was told there was no greater privilege or honor or act that would earn a reward in heaven like dying for your belief in Jesus. 


They tell you that all the bad thoughts and things you're going through are due to spiritual warfare, because the devil wants your soul and you arm yourself against him with Scripture and faith. They teach you that the key to happiness, the antidote to teenage angst, is to keep all worldly evils out of your life, and ""accept Jesus into your heart.""


I had sexual and romantic feelings for my best friend in high school, to date the only girl I've ever had genuine interest in. Tried to talk to my mom about it, she said it was fine but probably a phase, and that I couldn't tell anyone at church or youth group about it, or they might be disgusted with me and not write me recommendation letters for college. My sister tried to talk to one of our youth leaders about something, and he told her men are biblically suited for leadership, and that he was only an assistant to the female youth leader because she was working in a childcare capacity, and thats a woman's role.


I still remember the fucking seething self loathing I put myself through in middle school being at church camp, which my church paid to send me and my sisters to. They'd crowd us in this dark stuffy room and play emotional music, and then everyone thinks they feel the ""Holy Spirit"" or some shit, they put their hands up in the air or fall to their knees because they feel God compelled them to. I stood in the middle of it, wondering why I wasn't hearing any voice in my head telling me to do that, wondering what was wrong with me that God wasn't giving me visions of angels or compelling me to do anything. I went through the motions trying to fit in with everyone around me and secretly wondered if it was obvious I was faking it, or if many others there were faking it too.


In retrospect, if you crowd a bunch of hormonal teens together in a dark room with loud music you're bound to have some people saying they feel a spiritual experience. There's something about being in a crowd at a concert or whatever that makes you feel that way, like a part of something bigger and more profound than your individual existence, Jesus or no Jesus. It was basically group hypnosis. I remember my sister was ""overcome with the Holy Spirit"" and fucking passed out in worship late one night, and was carried out to the lawn and laid out like a fucking saint who'd had a vision of rapture. She woke up talking about visions of angels and demons, when really it was 90 degrees that day and theres a great chance she was dehydrated and undernourished, because she was a vegetarian and they didn't have a lot of food for her.
I went to one of my counselors crying about how I didn't feel anything like that, and wondering why I wasn't good enough to deserve that kind of attention from God, and she told me ""everyone has different spiritual gifts, some people speak in tongues or see visions, you'll spread the truth of God in other ways.""


And I tried for so many years to buy into that bullshit. I lost my virginity having anal sex because my boyfriend said it wasn't like regular sex. I wanted so desperately to experience sex, fulfill my natural curiosities, and I didn't know anything about sex because I was terrified of it. The youth group pushed abstinence very hard, and my sex ed was severely lacking. My first boyfriend learned everything from porn, so his expectations were very unrealistic. I bled. I hurt. I hated myself. I remember being over my boyfriend's grandparents' house, in the basement in this dank room, and he asked for a blowjob, and I tried it, and I cried on my knees on the ground because I felt so dirty and sinful. He was trying to comfort me because he didn't want me to tell anyone, because I was 15 and he was 18 and he was worried there'd be a problem with statutory rape.


Eventually I just...grew out of it. I kept going through the motions. I got confirmed in the church to ensure a smooth passage to college. By 17 I was an atheist (though now I'd consider myself closer to agnostic). My boyfriend senior year was in college, and really hot, as well as a complete secret from my family. He was instrumental in my personal sexual development because I actually enjoyed it with him. We experimented with bondage, we got hotel rooms, he validated all that I felt and was curious about. It wasn't painful or dirty, it was natural, and beautiful. On our first date he ate me out in his car in the mall parking lot. Beautiful.


I pulled off everything the way my parents wanted me to. I got a full ride to a decent university. I didn't cost them much money in loans. I'll be graduating a year early without any debt.


In my years away from home at school, I explored my newfound independence and sexual autonomy. I explored what I was always afraid to, what I had grown to love in previous relationships. I got involved in the kink community. I started to take nude photos of myself that I loved, and post them and get exciting attention and validation from people. I was beautiful, I was sexy, I was independent, I was powerful. I learned about myself, what I liked and didn't like. I grew to love casual sex, to crave it-- as a way to feel intimacy with people, as a way to express myself, as a new way to understand who I was and who I could be in relation to other people.


In my kink explorations I started to dabble in sugar. I knew I was a submissive. I knew I liked older men. I knew I would like some extra money for makeup. So I gave it a shot. And I loved it. I only ever did it casually, never a full commitment. I didn't want to be dependent on anyone, because I had gotten that far on my own merits. But I'm about to graduate, and I have no plan. I'm talking to a prospect now that will give me full-time sugar after I graduate, in a way that looks like a legitimate job. I'll be making money, traveling, milking every drop out of life, in ways that most people my age don't get to right after they graduate. Instead of unpaid internships and minimum wage jobs, I'll be a personal assistant (emphasis on the personal) to a wealthy investor. I can observe on the job, learn the ropes of what is very lucrative work, make connections, and do better for myself than most people from my background ever get to do, while having the kind of sex I like to have. I'll be well taken care of. If I make it over a year, I'll have a pension from real estate profits that will subsist me for the rest of my life, give me enough income to cushion myself from ever falling too hard.


I don't believe in the myth that if you work hard enough and are a good enough person, you will succeed. I see my generation saddled with student loan debt, underemployed, living with their parents, fed this crap about achieving your dreams when the economic prospects just aren't there.


I see no moral value in ""the struggle."" I think that if you make it through your early 20s, pay off your student loans, and find yourself gainfully employed and emotionally fulfilled, you are strong, but you are in the minority. I see no purpose in being strong enough to succeed in an inherently broken system. I see no glory in an ""honest living,"" working just to pay the bills, just to survive. I see no shame in doing what will make me happy and comfortable and elevate my position in life. People born with more privilege than me, they make their connections through family and social ties, they have access to networks and resources that will keep them from ever having to worry about falling too hard. My connection to the next step in a career, into my entry into the 'real world,' is just a connection made through sex, instead of through schmoozing or career fairs or family. My deepest and most meaningful and intimate connections with people have all been sexual, anyways.


I think that all money is sort of dirty. Having your body and your labor rented for money in any job is sort of dirty. Trying to impress people in interviews, sell them on your inherent worth not as a person, but as an asset to them in order to carve out your niche in a scarce, competitive workforce and put a roof over your head and food in your mouth-- demoralizing, dirty. No more or less dirty than being some older fella's arm candy for a few years. I see my peers struggling with exams, with papers, with suicidal thoughts, knowing they'll graduate with far more debt and interest on that debt than they'll ever be able to pay off. I hear them joke about ""getting a sugar daddy,"" but they never take that step. I love sex, over the past few years I've learned so much about myself through sexual exploration, I'm confident in myself, and I'm okay taking that step.


I don't come from any money. I'm a first generation American. Money is mobility, to be able to move around and see more of the world and of life, without being worried about missing too much work. Money is freedom, to seek out other options without fearing about missing a payment, to pursue your endeavors and dreams, to do the work you actually want to do-- to support the organizations you believe in, to never worry about being a burden on your family or anyone else.


I've had to make so many decisions in the past few years that have been detrimental to my mental and emotional health because of money. I took on so many responsibilities that the stress brought me to suicidal levels of anxiety and depression, just to hold on to scholarships I couldn't afford to lose. I have this opportunity to be in a position where I never have to make a decision like that again. I'm probably going to take it. Wouldn't you?


I know these two parts of my post are sort of disjointed. But where I've been and what I've done is who I am. We all have fucked up things that happened in our formative years we have to square with. I don't mean to insult anyone's personal beliefs or station in life. I recognize I'm lucky in ways others are not. But I just needed to type this all out, say it to someone, fire it out into the abyss. Because I obviously can't tell my parents."

It would have been the second anniversary of my ex and I. While I realize that it's for the best we broke up, I'm still a little sad about missing what we used to have, and feeling a little lonely/sad.  I've tried my usual coping skills, tried journaling, tried cooking and cleaning the apartment. The feeling is still there.  Any of you guys have any tips or ideas?

Some background: girlfriend and I had dated for about two years and had been living together. She went to go on an internship an hour and a half away, we still were able to visit and whatnot, when all of a sudden (to me) she says she doesn't want to be in a committed relationship anymore. She also said that my not being able to sleep, eat, or leave bed for a week or so hardly was ""bullshit"", ""senioritis"" (graduate with two BA's in a week, woo!), and that she was tired of me expecting her to pick up the fallout of not doing well (this after I went to her with this after she got into me for not communicating well enough to her liking -- and she's dealt with depression, too. So that really hurt). So I'm on the one hand very much able to recognize red flags and where I am better off being with someone supportive or not at all, but still miss the good times, I guess?  I've journaled about it some. But like I said, still feel off/sad. "

I got an internship position at Texas Instruments starting on July, and am currently searching for an apartment / flatshare / room. I'm a French electrical engineering student (24 year old) doing my master degree in Switzerland (EPFL).

I don't know the area around Freising at all, so I'm hoping you guys could give me a few recommendations ?

Some considerations:
I don't own a car so most of traveling will be on foot or public transportation (maybe I'll get a bike, depends on the distance between my place &amp; TI).
I wouldn't mind a longer commute (like, 30-40 minutes, not more) as long as the apartment is in a good location. (What are good locations ?)

I'm hoping to find a place with a maximum rent of 500€ for a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom or studio apartment or flatshare. Is it a decent budget for Freising?

I might aswell consider searching around Munich area, I've heard the public transportation around Munich are pretty good, is that doable to commute everyday back and forth Munich to TI? Should I have to pay full price for monthly pass or is there a reduction for interns ?

I'll be continuing my search so any recommendations/advice would be greatly appreciated! I'd also love to hear any TI stories you may have!

69r026,2,2017-05-07,Shopping for insurance as a student.,jadedandjaded,Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/69r026/shopping_for_insurance_as_a_student/,"Hi /r/insurance.

Hopefully I'm in the right place for these questions:

Data:

- I am a transgender student (junior) at college in MA (Boston), 21 years old.
- I am a U.S. citizen, born and raised (if this matters for buying insurance)
  and am from NYC (with an NY driver's license, but would like to ""move"" for
  good to MA).
- My parents and I are not on good terms (so I don't have access to their
  insurances if they have).
- Money: I pay for school by working full-time over the summer and part-time
  over the school year, and thankfully this leaves me with a reasonable amount
  of money for food and living and just a bit of money for not life-critical
  things (splurging for cute things, recently replacing my computer, whatever).
  I'm really glad I'm well enough off that I don't need to get a loan and get
  fucked over that way. I will admit I'm not rich, but I have enough float (to
  the tune of $1-2k at any given time) to get me through bad times if need be.
  If I need more money, I can get it (minus a couple hundred bucks for a
  therapist appointment to get over the violations that happen to my body).
  It'll suck, but a girl's gotta do whatever she's gotta do to survive.

A friend recently had his storage unit become flooded, and this made me realize
""I should probably fucking insure my shit."" Staring at the big items that exist,
located either in:

- my dorm room (or wherever I'm living in for internships over the summer,
  usually either MA, NY, or CA - and this summer I'll probably be working in MA)
- dorm storage (which is not temperature regulated and not locked)
- self-storage unit (temperature regulated, locked)

I have around $30k (when priced new) of things. This is mostly furniture,
electrical engineering equipment (most were prizes, ""thanks, Keysight
giveaways""), computers and laptops, etc.

My questions (regarding insurance):

- Is it possible to obtain insurance for all these things, especially given
  they're not at the same location? Is ""renters insurance"" what I'm looking for?
- Will I be able to insure things I don't have, say, receipts for?
- I occasionally rent a car/van/truck (usually from U-Haul, if not Enterprise).
  I haven't gotten into an accident of any sort yet (raps table), but for future
  reference, is it possible to pay a nominal fee on whatever insurance policy I
  may already have so I don't have to get insurance separetely every timee I
  rent? I will rent a vehicle probably around 2-4 times an year (at least 2 for
  moving shit around, maybe 1 or 2 trips to a beach to relax and not deal with
  the world), so I don't know if this would be a cost-effective measure. The
  term ""liability insurance"" came up while I was doing some reading, but this is
  honestly over my head. Throw electronics in front of me and I can whisper into
  it, but this stuff, not so much.
- Speaking of moving shit around, say I'm moving shit from my dorm room to my
  self-storage unit and to my new summer location. What if something happens and
  the vehicle burns up in a fiery rage (or similar catastrophic sadness). What
  do I do to make sure my stuff is covered and I can recoup losses?

My questions (that may not be suitable for this subreddit):

- I get covered nominally by my school's insurance, but... it sucks.
  Is there a way for me to get my own health insurance, particularly one that is
  good for transgender people? ""lol preexisting conditions"". I suppose money is
  definitely a concern here, but I figure if I need to make extra money at the
  risk of STDs and shit, I'll have good insurance anyways to take care of
  whatever I might catch, right? (doing some research here, apparently ""Blue Cross Blue Shield Massachusetts"" is the best for transgender care, but I don't even know what I'd be doing to sign up for it, or even how much it costs)
- Seeing as my parents and I don't get along, I really don't want to get called
  by a nursing home later in life demanding money from me or debt collectors
  trying to get money from me for my parents debts if they have any. Apparently
  this is a thing, and this is not acceptable. They have savings and the like, I
  know that for a fact. How can I make sure I don't have to deal with this?
  Emancipation?
- My local credit union keeps screwing me over (weird hours, checks don't cash
  and I have to walk in person to deal with things, a debit card replacement
  took 5 weeks because they don't have a machine to make them in house and have
  to send for it out, so I had to borrow money or beg for food or go whore
  myself out to make ends meet, all the while with 3k basically inaccessible to
  me, etc.). I'm looking for a new bank, probably one of the big ones. Is Bank
  of America what I want?
- I also would want to do the thing where I start scurrying whatever money I
  don't need and letting it ""grow"", so to speak. How can one do this safely?
- Taxes: I'm pretty sure my parents have been filing me as a ""dependent"" or
  whatever that is, so I haven't touched taxes at all, just kind of hoped for
  the best in this area. Are they taking advantage of me, and are there things
  with taxes that I can do that I can do/should do?
- I am starting to look at surgeries, and the topic of ""advanced healthcare
  directives"" came up. Is this something I'm going to have to save up for and
  pay an arm and a leg to have a lawyer do? My biggest things here are basically
  ""don't let my parents touch me and bury me as a dude"", ""let friends X, Y, and
  Z make any decisions if it turns out my body was a dud all along"", and ""maybe
  cremate me and toss me into an ocean or something so I don't waste anyone's
  money or time with a land plot and burial"".
- Life insurance. Is this something I need to deal with?

If any of you work in the Boscamberville (Boston, Cambridge, Somerville) area
and are an insurance professional or consultant or whatever, I would be happy to
pay you a fee with what little money I have for helping me, because I'd rather
spend some money right now for peace of mind than losing all my shit and having
nothing.

Thanks all,

Jenny"
69rcvg,3,2017-05-07,(UK) Paid Below Minimum Wage - Help,saltyfriesbeforechoc,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/69rcvg/uk_paid_below_minimum_wage_help/,"So to fully describe my situation, I'm a graduate interning at a luxury brand. Before I got the gig, I disclosed that I have a hip injury and that I will be putting off my operation for, for the duration of the internship (6 months).

I was also told that this internship has the potential of becoming a full-time role, however I know for a fact this was a full-time job before.

The six months had finished, and I was asked to stay on for an extra 3 months. The thing is I was planning to operate in the summer with the intention of being able to focus on getting stronger through physio and training in those three months. With that in mind, I asked for three reduced working days per week.

My boss let me know that I would be paid less accordingly, so I asked to this weekend to think about it.

I then realised that when I break it down, I am already being paid below the legal minimum wage. I work 42.5 hours and I'm paid £13,000 pro rata.

I disclosed this to the HR intern and she said off the record they recently realised this and quietly adjusted it without telling us. This does not include the new minimum wage increase on April 6th (which I'm somewhat sure has not been included).

I was wondering if there is anything legal or otherwise you guys could help me with? I want to know where I stand legally? have they breached my contract? Am I entitled to ask if they're pulling my leg with the job offer?"

-analysis of variance
-logistic regression
-model selection methods based on AIC, BIC, likelihood

I'm currently trying to find an internship in my final semester.

All the big jobs in data now seem to be as a ""Data Scientist"" developing algorithms mainly in Python to scrape websites, and model data with things like classifiers, nearest neighbours, decision trees and deep neural nets with backpropogation etc.

Do I need to learn advanced algorithms to get a decent paying secure job nowadays? Can I find a good entry level job that will train me up with my current knowledge or do they all expect me to be an algo master?

69rz63,2,2017-05-07,[x-post from /r/depression] I [23M] lost her because of her depression. I feel like I'm going down with her.,OoXx123throw123xXoO,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/69rz63/xpost_from_rdepression_i_23m_lost_her_because_of/,"First of all I want to apologize for the grammar mistakes I’m about to make. English is not my first language. I’ll try to minimise my mistakes. And it’s a throwaway account because some people might recognise me.

I met her (let’s call her Z.) around this time of the year in 2016. It was nothing special at first. The usual stuff that happens if you start to date someone. She told me relatively early that she’s suffering from depression and that every relationship ended in her getting cheated on. That’s why it’s extremely hard for her to trust someone or communicate. She thinks she isn’t capable to maintain a healthy relationship. To make things worse, she isn’t going to therapy because apparently doctors only want your money and don’t care about you. „They won’t help me“. Major red flag I know. But let me tell you a little bit about myself. I’m not an depression-expert, but I had to fight with my own depressive episode back when I was 14. It went so far that my mother broke down crying infront of me because she thought that she lost her child. That was the moment I decided to change my life. I started working out, eating healthier and tried to be more open about my problems. I managed to pull myself out it. I can imagine how she feels. I know how it feels to be left alone. When everyone and everything is hurting you. I know how it feels. I never directly told her this but I wanted to be there for her. I knew that I couldn’t make her depression disappear. Especially not without her going to therapy. But I wanted to show her that not everything is evil. 



What started as a friendship quickly developed into more. When the time came I asked her if she wanted to become exclusive and she said yes. But gave our relationship only 5 months. She thought I won’t stay longer than 5 months with her because she’s too complicated and not ready for a real relationship. Red flag number two. The honeymoonphase was beautiful and I could really imagine spending the rest of my life with her.



I fucking love her family. That’s something I have to mention. Her parents are cool as fuck and her dog loves me more than anything. He would always jump and cry when I was visiting Z. and her family. They are living in a house outside of the city. It takes like 40min for me to get there with public transportation. Nothing too special. Her mother always told me that she thinks I’m good for her daughter. That she’s happy right know because I’m there for Z. I was there for her when she had problems with her schoolwork. I was there for her when she felt lonely and depressive. I was there for here when she was sick. Bought her food, rolled her into blankets to watch netflix together and cuddle. I skipped university classes to spend time with her. I’m a physics student so I spend a lot of time doing lab protocols or solving math homework. I’m not a bad student but I’m not an A student either so it never really affected me that much. I dedicated my whole freetime after university and the gym to her and it was sometimes not enough. She would tell me how I would choose the gym over her. That I’m only going to the gym to impress other girls. That I’m too muscular. Which I'm definetely not. I told her that I need this. Because it was one of the major things that helped me dealing with my own depression but I think she never believed me. Additionally she is an extremly jealous person. Not the „I fucking stalk you“- type of jealousy but the one that really hurts our relationship. She would just go into „no communication mode“ and would sit there silently. I tried everything to ease her mind but nothing worked. Her mother told me that’s something she has to deal with almost every week. And that’s probably one of her worst traits. It made my life so hard. I would get jealous myself because she was writing with other people while I wanted to talk about things. I was never really jealous in any of my relationships but if you get the silent treatment while she is constantly writing with other men…I don’t know. But help me god if I was talking to other girls. But I trusted her. She never did anything that really concerned me. She started tagging the same guy over and over again in facebook memes. That’s the thing that got me the most probably because that was something she always did with me. But those are memes. Nothing that would break my trust in her. But then the honeymoonphase ended. Man I was not prepared…



So we hit our „5 month goal“ and everything was fine. Of course the things I already mentioned bothered me. And I tried to talk to her but it was always the same. I would go down the stairs when she was silently lying in her bed looking at her phone and talk to her parents. Most of the time it was her mother. She would tell me stories about Z.‘s life before depression hit her and how I have to decide wether I want to stay with Z and hope for the best or leave her. But she can tell me that Z really loves me and cares about me. But the way she is showing this is different and she can understand when I want to breakup with Z. And then she said something that really haunts me until this day: „Every men in her life left her at some point (she’s not living with her biological father). Everytime things get worse they left her or cheated on her. And she thinks that you will leave her too if she says something wrong.“ So I decided to stay with her. Be there for her and love her like a madman. Tried to cuddle with her after a discussion or bring her sushi when she's sad and hug her for minutes. When she ignored me while I was talking about a problem I would just stop and hug her and tell her that I'm trying to do my best for her and that I love her.



But nothing I did changed anything. I think it made things even worse. Z started to talk to me less and less. Her messages started to get more distant. Only „yes“,  „ok“, „maybe“ and „I don’t care“. Sometimes it would be „doesn’t matter“ and this was by far the worst. She would always write this, when I was asking her about her day or her plans for the next day. She would just say that she has no time this weekend to see me. And I would just answer like: „ Ahh Okok. What are you up to? Just tell me when you have some time. We can go to a nice restaurant.“ I always tried to get her out of her bed. But sometimes I would just lay down with her cuddle with her while watching netflix. I never tried to force her to do something. Her answer would be „doesn’t matter. Wouldn’t change anything“. Now imagine your girlfriend giving you this answer every fucking time you ask her about her plans. I told her that I have a tight schedule too and have to plan around hers if she wants me to spend time with her. „It doesn’t matter if I’m going out with my friends or go to the cinema with my parents. I have no time.“ Now logically she has an argument. But that’s not how relationships work. I don’t want to know everything about her day and what she’s doing. Is it too much to ask her what she’s doing?



Now to the real problem I’m facing right now. I’m sorry for the long post but it feels so good to write everything out. I could write 10 more pages but I  just want to give you the most important information. I tried to deal with this for 4 more months until I couldn’t deal with it anymore. I told her that things aren’t really going in the right direction. I think our relationship won’t hold if things progress like they did before. Of course she sat there. Silently. She would lay down in her bed, facing aways from me, and just listen. I dont even know if she even listened. I told her how I felt. Told her that I don’t feel loved. No „I love you“ from here since 2 months, no compliments or even a „thank you“ for the food I cook for her or buy her. I felt used. I was honest. Maybe a little bit too honest. But I was devastated. I tried for too long to swallow everything down. I told her that she has to try talking to me. We have to talk about problems. I know that she keeps everything for herself but I can’t change anything if she remains silent. I know I’m not perfect. No one is but I really wanted this relationship to work because I fucking loved this girl with all my heart. And then the she went towards her wardrobe. Opened it and gave me every sweatshirt, tshirt and pants she „borrowed“ from me. 



You can’t imagine how fucking savage this was. I spotted the jacket I gave her on our 4th date or so. She later told me that she would cuddle with this jacket when I wasn’t around. My heart broke into 1000 pieces. I gathered my things and went downstairs. Her parents instantly knew what happend and her father was furious. Called her egoistic and that he’s done with her depression. She should get help. He’s very popular in his niche and owns a fairly big company where Z. and I are working. I’m working there since December as a working student and she is doing an internship since April. I don’t plan on leaving this company. Not because of a relationship that has ended. Her manager would complain about her because she was just on her mobile phone texting. That made her father extra furious because we both tried everything so the company gives her enough money so she can have her tattoo she wanted. She signed a contract for a 35hr week and 450€ per month. You don’t need to be Einstein to do the math. Her father as the CEO talked to the HR Department and couldn’t do anything. I spend one complete night to find a loophole in the contract. I had a good connection to the Head of HR so I could get her one with a possible payment of over 1000€.  And now we sit there. She just threw a relationship away. I’m devastated and her father is angry.



I tried talking to her after some days. I just wanted to have an explanation. I refused to go down without any form of explanation. She told me that she’s not ready to have a relationship. It’s too onesided and it’s only fair if she lets me go. She always told me that this relationship won’t work an that she can’t have a healthy one because of her depression. That’s not going to change and she doesn’t want me to suffer for it. I’m having a hard time right now. This move just crushed every little piece in me. She once told me that she can’t make decisions. And the only real decision she made was to get rid of me. FML



I can’t be angry about her. She made a descision and I have to accept it. But it destroyed me. It destroyed me really hard. I can’t sleep, can’t eat, I lost my breakupgains instantly after I got them because I’m so fucking exhausted. „I want to have a relationship but can’t do it. I have to find myself first and can’t have you wait for me.“ The last words I recieved. And the words of her mother still haunt me. I feel so useless right now. Everything I felt when I had my depression is coming back. I met her mother with the dog I haven’t seen in weeks in the office the other day. He instantly jumped me and was happy like he used to be. I nearly cried thinking about never seeing this dog again. I lost all of my self esteem. One side of me thinks that this isn’t over now and that the depression in her is talking. I can still see her in groups on whatsapp and line. She is just writing like always. Her flirty way of talking to those people is now so painfull to watch. I had to mute every group. Today she was writing to someone she really likes to flirt with: „I really love you for your bad sense of humor &lt;3 I hope you know this.“ And they were playfully talking about marriage. This sentence could have saved our relationship. Just a simple „love you“ and a hug. But it didn’t happen because of her depression. But it's no problem for her to say it to people she never met in a groupchat. You can not imagine the darkness I’m about to enter. And everything because I tried to love her with all my heart.

Met depressive Girlfriend who I dearly cared for just to get dumped after I talked about my feelings in the relationship. „I want to have a relationship but can’t do it. I have to find myself first and can’t have you wait for me.“ The last words I recieved. I’m devastated and her father‘s furious. Almost cried after I met her mother with her dog in the office. Now I’m just a mess. Constantly watching breakup motivation youtube videos and eating ice cream. 
I think I'll start watching Adam Sandler movies.

Help me."

I recently got my first full time job as a developer after a very constructive 6 month internship in fairly good software house. I was doing HTML/CSS/JS almost exclusive and mainly angular 1.x to 2 depending on the project i was needed. 

In the new company i was hired mainly for these skills i acquired at the internship but i was asked if i would be interested in meddling with the back end as well WHICH is written in C# ASP.net MVC &amp; API. Of course i said yes because knowledge is gold but the closest i got to ever to c# is java back in college (sorry for the lame comparison). I did watch some tutorials to get me going, but some parts of the language i dont get and i am seeking help to deepen my knowledge in the language. I heard there is a C# certification from Microsoft and i was thinking of going for it. Does it worth it ? What sources should i study for it ? 

Thanks and sorry for the long post."

He got an internship at a reputable company and everything. He had a crush on me in high school but I did not like him that way. We maintained a friendship. We dated other people and I even entered my first same sex relationship in college.

One time, he did too much molly one weekend. He called me the next week and asked to come to my house to talk. He came over and let me know he was feeling suicidal and really sad from the molly. But he seemed to recover from this.

As college went on, he got kicked out of his frat, quit his internship out of nowhere and completely failed and dropped out of his classes. About 8 months ago, I got texts from him randomly one night and the texts told me that ""I was a terrible person and he no longer cared about me"" that he ""hoped I turned my life around"". No one has seen or heard from him in about a year except for random texts where he insults people and tells them they're terrible people. No one knows where he lives or works or what he does.

His texts seem like they are coming from a totally different person or someone who is on drugs.

Come to find out, he was suggesting L. Ron Hubbard's books to one of our mutual friends and is balls deep in Scientology. I am forever sad at this loss. I loved him and know that if I reach out it will only push him further away. It suckssssss"

I have a big interest in computer science and I understand that Singapore has a lot of internships. What kind of internships could be gotten for someone with not too much experience, and could they potentially be paid internships? And where would I look for these exactly, maybe there's a central hub of some sort? I'm not limited to internships and would be happy to try something else. The thing is I'll be walking into the country knowing absolutely no one. I'm a fairly outgoing person but I wouldn't know exactly where to meet people my age with similar interests. That's why I thought it would be good to find some sort of institution that I could be part of. I visited Singapore last February and loved it there. It completely blew my mind.

I'm currently doing an internship at a car dealership and I've been tasked with evaluating how effective their training modules are on salesmen who undertake the modules delivered by my department.

I've been provided training modules provided to every salesmen in their database, every sale they've made in 2016 and 2015 (what model car) and what the customer satisfaction % is each month. I only have to analyse 30 salesmen's performance over 2015-2016 in which sales of the model car they sale have been weighted depending on how hard it is to sell (eg one car may be worth 1, luxury car worth 3 units).


I've set the data out as

Month/Year | Dealership equivalent sales | Salesman Sales | Dealedship customer satisfaction (%) | Salesman Customer satisfaction (%) |

I'm wondering if there are another ways to analyse the data to give an argument that the training HAS had an effect on performance, currently I've:
-Graphed company vs salesman sales (with points showing where training occurred)
-Graphed salesmen sales vs satisfaction (%) from dealership and individual feedback
-3 point average of sales figures
- Pie chart of whether the goal to reach 93% customer satisfaction has been reached
-Dividing monthly dealership sales by consultants to see if the salesman has exceeded the average sales number

Any help would be appreciated!!"
69v9yb,0,2017-05-07,Looking for some advice regarding virtualization of a restaurant POS system,aesthetic_facility,virtualization,https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualization/comments/69v9yb/looking_for_some_advice_regarding_virtualization/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a CS student currently working my way through college at a small family run restaurant, where I wait tables. My boss has asked me to help him figure out a solution so he can access the POS system on his iPad, and use that to take orders outside. As our outdoor seating season approaches, I am eager to find a solution for him. 

Our current POS system consists of 4 generic-brand touchscreen terminals running windows XP POSReady (what even is that) each with 2gb RAM and a small hard drive. Additionally, we have a touchscreen Acer tablet running windows 7 that has been used for the outdoor seating in previous years. This tablet has broken, and my boss needs to replace it, however he made a comment about how much easier it would be if he could just use an iPad. I told him that didn't seem too hard to accomplish.

There is also small Dell tower server that runs the whole system. I don't know the specs of this server but lets just say it is maxed out in terms of resources. It is not virtualized, it runs Server 2003 on metal. 

The POS software itself is called Profitek RM System, it's honestly really sketchy software. Pretty sure it runs Java. The client piece is pretty lightweight. 

So basically I need to figure out a way he can remote into a Win7 environment from his iPad. Immediately, he does not want to upgrade anything else, but I want to do this in a way that would provide room to scale in the future, so that eventually we could just have thin-clients all around and have the whole POS system virtualized. 

I have used ESXi at my internship and am pretty comfortable with it, but that's about the extent of my knowledge regarding virtualization. 

Some questions I have:
What app should we run on the iPad? 
Should this all be accomplished via RDP, or some third party type thing such as LogMeIn?
Most obviously, what should I run as the hypervisor? I know this is a matter of preference, but which would work best with an iPad? Do any hypervisors have an App piece to them? 

I've done a little research on VMWare Horizon, but that's about all I got. 

Thanks for any advice or suggestions you might have!

I'm really passionate about the field I'm going into, internal medicine, and the idea of having more responsibility in the hospital is exciting. But it's really hitting me now that I'm going to have to work resident hours for 3 years... At least it's not surgery or something. But still, ~70-80 hour weeks?!? I've done them in third year but got burned out pretty quickly. I only got through those weeks because I knew that the rotation would end in a month or so. So I'd count down the days, and make it through that way. But residency isn't just a month! I'm going to have to do it for much longer! And in fourth year of medical school, most of my rotations weren't even that demanding, but I still struggled to work even just 40 hour weeks just due to burn out.

So yeah. Definitely still passionate about internal medicine, and I get that that will get me through the days... but the hours are sooooooo intimidating, and I'm legitimately scared I won't make it through intern year. Just looking for encouragement here! And looking for advice for how to think about the hours in a more positive light, and how I can have more of a ""can-do attitude."""

I have the choice between two housing situations: one living by myself and one living with other interns in a 'hacker house' coliving situation. The co-living house has about 4 people per room in bunk beds and costs the same as the private room.

The reason why I'm considering the co-living situation is because the establishment has an incredible amount of positive reviews and seems to be a mecca for interns getting to know each other, entrepreneurs working together, and making life-long friendships. It also seems to be an excellent place to make friends, go to events and really experience what the bay area has to offer. However, I'm worried about the bathroom situation in the co-living house since it's about 5 people per bathroom.

Living alone does not offer that and may be a lot more lonelier, but it does have the added benefit of privacy and being able to cook whenever I want. Also, no bathroom issues there.

Any advice or suggestions? I've been too indecisive on this so I've been thinking about it for about 2 weeks now...

69vzxv,14,2017-05-08,My Suicide,Chainingcactus,suicidenotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidenotes/comments/69vzxv/my_suicide/,"We've all thought about it, some more than others. In this case, I'm talking about myself. I doubt anyone will take the time to read this, as I've made this reddit account with the intention of making this post, and this post alone. I felt it necessary to get this out, and have potentially the small realm of possibility that someone, just maybe took the time to read this. 

Okay the story begins here: Freshman year of High School, we all remember it differently, and typical it's a fond, yet vague memory. However for me, it's when things got, well, pretty bad. It just started with weed, harmless enough right? After all, pots never killed anyone. However, it acted as a gateway for me and quickly escalated into other things like drinking, cocaine, dropping acid, popping pills, etc. It eventually climaxed the summer before sophomore year, I was home alone for an extended period of time and self destructed. I tried to kill myself by overdosing on Oxycontin and Aderall. Obviously, it didn't work. I woke up about 18 hours later from what I told my mother on the phone was the result of me staying up the previous night playing video games.

It was after that incident that I gave up doing and trying drugs for the most part. I still shared the occasional joint at parties and drank once in awhile but nothing more. Things were good for awhile going into my sophomore year. I joined a robotics team and developed relationships with some of my closest friends. Nothing too depressing or eventful happened that year.

Then came junior year. I fell in love with a girl. Someone who finally understood me, someone I could tell everything to and give everything to, and that I did. We did all the typical couple things, and to that point I still had my occasional meltdowns and less than satisfying thoughts, but they became bearable with her by my side. 

As many of you probably already know, junior year of high school is/was stressful enough. ACT/SAT, applying to colleges, and trying to figure out just what the hell you're going to do with your life. I did fairly decent on my ACT, scored a 24 on my 4th and final attempt and applied to roughly 6 different universities in my area, and some across the country. I'm by no means a genius but I wasn't incompetent either, I fell somewhere in the middle like many of you.

Summer time came, I seemed to forget about all of my worries and stresses for the most part. There was really only big tidal wave in my life at that point and that was my girlfriend, my everything moving 3 hours away for college (she was a senior, I was a junior.) It was a tough pill to swallow, not being able to see your best friend every single day, and have those priceless moments, all the time.

Senior year. Brings us to the present tense of this story, but we'll start from the beginning of this year. Just before school went into session, I had to break up with my girlfriend. I use ""had to"" very lightly because I obviously did not need to, but I deemed it necessary. Why? I felt the light leave from us. It was like constructing a massive puzzle, and just when you think you've solved it, you realize pieces are missing. It was devastating for both of us, but it was for the better. Or so we told ourselves to refrain from further breaking down.

It took months to get over, and as I write this, it still hurts. I couldn't even type details of the love we shared, many men are afraid to admit it, but love cuts deeper than anything. 

As I was getting over her, I started to hear back from Universities as the year went on. In the end, I was rejected by 5/6 of the colleges I applied to, and the one I was accepted into was no longer apart of the picture, however I was offered an internship through a multinational company, which is my current plan.

Things were okay for once, until my doctors decided to put another hole in my ship. Type 1 diabetes. Yep, just my luck right? Every day I give myself 5-6 shots, check my blood all the time, and constantly have to explain to people why I have it, what it is, and ""if I'm okay."" I think the worst thing is seeing your close friends try to turn into your parents about the whole situation, constantly asking about it.

Which brings us to the present. If you've read all the way to this point, props to you, because I even took breaks writing this.

Every single night for the past month I've drank to the point of passing out. I likely will tonight too, writing and publishing this isn't easy for me. My mind has had a constant weight on it, the thought of living through this hell we call life. It really makes you not care about anything and wonder if it's easier to just end it? Last night at around 4am I left my house and drove around for about an hour until the sun barely peaked over the horizon. I found this beautiful bridge in a city I knew nothing about, and sat on the edge, watching the sun creep up. It was reminiscent of a film I once saw, but not quite. I've never been that close to ending my own life, and the reason I didn't was very simple; I hadn't written my note yet. That was the only reason. I couldn't leave my mother wondering what happened to her only son. 

I came home this morning, still pretty early, and drafted my suicide note. Doing so was perhaps the most difficult thing I've ever done, and likely will do. I know not where life will lead me after this post but that leaves me with the conclusion:

This is not a suicide of death, but rather one of life. We carry on as damaged souls through a damned world, but don't beg the question as to the meaning of it all. Should I choose to end it, I doubt many will read this, should I choose the latter, and live, I guess we'll see what happens.

Thanks for reading."
69w9mf,2,2017-05-08,Paying for graduate school (MBA),lettuce_head,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/69w9mf/paying_for_graduate_school_mba/,"Hi PF, 
I will be starting a full-time MBA program this fall and will need to pay entirely out of pocket.  Tuition is ~$60k and full cost of attendance is ~$85k per year, so ~$170k total.  I have a good bit of money in savings/investments and curious to see how others would approach given the following information.

Current savings/investment breakdown is: 

* $40k cash savings 
* $80k taxable investments
* $45k in Roth IRA (some rollover from Roth 401k)
* $35k in Traditional IRA (some rollover from Trad401k)

Right now my plan is to use the $40k cash savings to help offset living expenses, leaving about $130k to figure out how to pay for.  The way I see it I have several options:

* Option 1:  Use $40k cash savings for living expenses and take out federal loans at 5+% for first $40k and 6+% for remaining balance.  Federal loans also have sizable origination fees (1+% for first 40k and 4+% for balance)
* Option 2:  Same as Option 1 but private loans instead of federal loans.  Benefit would be potentially lower interest rates (as low as 3+% for variable rate and 5+% for fixed for entire balance) and no origination fees (usually), but risk would be far less flexibility for repayment.
* Option 3:  Dig deeper into taxable investments, even potentially IRAs, to minimize as much as possible how much I have to take out in loans.

Something to note with Option 1, there would be the option to refinance to a lower rate upon graduating and getting a job.  One caveat to consider against all options is I am engaged and will be getting married next spring.  After graduation and (hopefully) becoming employed, my significant other and I will be looking to buy a house sooner rather than later (talking a couple of years, not necessarily months).  This makes me nervous about completely emptying out my investments to where we have no cash later on for a downpayment (Option 3), but also nervous about having a significant student loan balance disqualifying us for a mortgage (Option 1 and 2).  Of course this ignores potential cash from wedding gifts, internships, job signing bonus, etc.  My SO will not be able to contribute much in the way of savings because she just recently finished up a 4 year professional degree (pharmacy), and despite her high earning power she herself has 6 figure student loans to work on paying down ASAP.

Again, interested in hearing how others would approach this situation given the information provided.  Please do not attack the decision to attend grad school itself, that's not what this post is about.

But now, for some reason, I feel very anxious and panicked. 

The only reason I can think of is that it might be because I am away from home (internship abroad). While I am a bit homesick, I wouldn't say it was something to panic about. Maybe because I have no support network here and feel very alone (I cannot speak the local lingo so I'm pretty isolated)? Anyway it seems odd since I've never been this anxious all the time about everything... 

The heart palpatation's really throw me out. Usually they only last a few seconds but the one yesterday lasted 1-2 minutes and made me feel dizzy (probably didn't help that I panicked during that too for fear of nobody finding me if I collapsed). Its because of this that I've decided to write on here because I want to know if this is a normal symptom of anxiety or  maybe something else?... I can relate to all of the symptoms of anxiety except the lacik of appetite (ha)... Also I wake up in the night bolt up right and shocked.

Is this weird? Is it normal to be anxious for no REAL reason?

69x99j,1,2017-05-08,Everyday just keeps getting harder.,PigThumbs,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/69x99j/everyday_just_keeps_getting_harder/,"16 y/o female here. I'm not really sure how to start this, as I'm not really an active reddit user so I don't know the territory that well. To give a brief background, I started experiencing depression when I was about ten. I believe that's around the time my I was present when my mom's ex beat her up and I experience brief sexual abuse from him that same night. It's hard to tell how much that effected me since when I think about that night I just feel numb and I don't really talk about it with any therapist. One day I was in the 6th grade and after a rather overwhelming bullying session I told a security guard at the school that I wanted to kill myself. I'm not sure if there was any truth to it back then but I was feeling all the these emotions that I didn't know how to process. My spiral into clinical depression truly began when my grandmother made me tell my school counselor that I didn't mean it, and that I was okay. I'm sure she meant well. She was afraid Is would end up in some nut house and turned into a brainless zombie. I believe I was in 7th grade when I started having seizures. The doctors didn't know what was wrong and I really thought I was going to die. I also don't talk about that much because it all kinda seemed like a bad dream. Anyways, because of the seizures my mom started living with my maternal grandmother and I (I also have two older siblings) in order to support me. The thing is, they really hate each other. During the couple of years my mom was living with us they were fighting non stop. I'd come home from school, excited to show them an A I got on a test and they'd be too busy fighting to care. After a while my grades started slipping and I stopped going to school. Because of the bullying I thought it'd be a good idea to go to a cyber school. But even that eventually failed because I just spent all my time at home playing video games. My mom was pretty fed up, so by the end of the school year she made me sit down and finish all the assignments I never completed. I can see now that she was just looking out for me but at the time I wasn't thinking rationally so I attempted suicide. I took a bath and grabbed a knife in an attempt to slit my own wrist. The knife however, was far too dull to penetrate my fleshy exterior so I resorted to drowning myself. It was surprisingly peaceful. I played my favorite song in my head and inhaled a lot of water, trying my hardest to resist the urge to lift my head out of the water. It would have worked but I guess my mother sensed something and she came in the bathroom, saw me, and pulled me out. I think she thought I was faking, since there was little water in my lungs. Little does she know that one more minute and all my worries would be gone. I can laugh at it now. I think almost every depressed person has that moment when their like ""Wow, I can't even commit suicide right"".  Anyway to fast forward a bit. For my 9th grade year I wanted to go back to a school where I can interact with kids my age. After spending the summer searching, a private school finally accepted me. I was lucky because the school was receiving a lot of donations so my grandmother only had to pay $50 dollars a month. This was also the school where I finally reached my potential, and where I found my love of science. I had a 3.6 GPA, I had great relationships with teachers, and I also had friends. I felt like I was finally happy, until they kicked me out for missing too much school. Even though I was happy, crippling depression was still there and sometimes I couldn't get out of bed. I can see my fault in the situation but I truly felt betrayed. I remember in a last ditch attempt to advocate for myself there was a meeting set up with the principal, the school councilor, and other important staff members. The worst part was when I realized there was no way they were letting me back into the school I cried in front of them. These people who once cared so much about acted as if they didn't even know me. I envisioned myself graduating from that school maybe as a valedictorian. I'd get a full ride scholarship to CMU, maybe even Stanford. All of my hopes and dreams once again being ruined by my depression. I transfered to a rather ghetto public school. The change in environment was sudden and apparent. I also have social anxiety so being surrounded by kids who yell constantly was very overwhelming. So instead of trying to make friends again I just kept to myself and focused on my grades. I was so happy that I got a 3.8 GPA my first report period. But once again my joy was short lived. I forgot to mention that my grandmother finally had enough and kicked my mother out after my she beat her up and destroyed some of her clothes. I guess this subconsciously effected me, on top of everything else that has happened to me. I tried to push past it all but it finally became too much and once again this school year I started missing school and my grades suffered severely. Last report card period I had a 2.3 GPA. I'm sorry if I'm focusing really heavily on my grades but that's pretty much all I have left to care about. I don't even really care about myself. I still have some things that I'm holding onto. I've secured first and second place on the debate team for my school and I start a paid internship this month. These are things I'm really proud of. But I sit here this morning after getting roughly 4 hours of sleep because everyday just keeps getting harder. My final debate is this friday and I haven't even prepared for it. I have a mountain of make up work that I promised myself I was gonna do over the weekend and I haven't even touched it. I believe my grandmother is dying and she expects me to take care of the finances instead of my older siblings who are both over 18.And I have to go to court tomorrow because I've missed so much school. It's like I'm outside my body watching me fuck up my entire life and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry this post is so long, and that you had to suffer through the grammatical errors. I honestly don't even know what I expect to gain out of this. I think I just wanted to put things that I've kept in my head into words. Maybe I'm an overreacting teenager, I'm sure people have it a lot harder than I do. But I'm in constant pain and I don't really know what to do anymore. "

I've lost 25 lbs so far since November but I still have about 60-65 to go to be comfortable with my weight/health. 

Anyways, it's starting to feel like having a B.S. In Health Promotion/Public Health is sort of a joke as no one hires and they definitely don't seem to hire new grads when other applicants have 10-15 years experience on me. 

I don't want to get an MPH because I feel like before I spend the time and money on a masters I really really really have to want to do this field and right now my motivation is ""it's interesting"". It's not where it used to be from 19-22. I really just want a job making 35-40k at least so I can start ""growing up"" and paying off debt like everyone else out of college. 

I have an internship with the YMCA and it's not something I enjoy and the pay would be 12-14 an hour with a bachelors which is a joke to me. If anyone has any ideas of where to work/what's your story/how to indulge myself in Health today, that would be really helpful. Thanks in advance. "

(PATH is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work for free as ""interns"" for companies) (Opinion Piece)",rubblaz,AustralianPolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/69y4gm/are_the_path_internships_really_voluntary_path_is/,"**(Opinion Piece)**

-------

**What is the PATH ""internships"" program?**

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

It is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work as ""interns"" for companies.

--------

**How long does the ""internship"" last?**

Up to 12 weeks.

--------

**Are those ""interns"" paid any money?**

Those ""interns"" are not paid any money by the companies.

The government keeps paying the ""interns"" the Newstart payment and additionally $100 more per week.

--------

**Are those companies paid any money?**

Yes, those companies are paid $1,000 to employ each ""intern"" even if they don't give them any job after the internship.

This program is like paying money to companies so they employ people for free.

--------

**Are those ""internships"" really voluntary?**

The PATH ""internships"" are referred as ""voluntary"" in official documentation by the government:

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

&gt; PaTH internships are voluntary and can be ended at any time, without penalty.

I have read the proposed legislation in the website of parliament and I think that's not true, let me explain it.

The proposed legislation is here:

http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5734

The ""Explanatory memorandum"" of the bill is here: 

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/ems/r5734_ems_d5756521-50de-48bf-aca9-2dd011ab2ff4/upload_pdf/496999.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The text of the bill is here:

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r5734_first-reps/toc_pdf/16140b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The proposed legislation says that the Centrelink payment, while undergoing the PATH ""internship"", can be cancelled ""as a result (whether direct or indirect) of a voluntary act of the person that was not reasonable"" (page 9 of the bill), do you see that the wording is very *vague*? ""not reasonable"" could mean anything, if the ""intern"" refuses to do something that the employer wants then to do that could lead to the payments being cut.

The ""interns"" will be afraid that if they do something that displease the employers then their Centrelink payments will be cancelled and they will need to apply again and wait some weeks before receiving the payment again.

And those ""interns"" will not have any savings, because the Newstart payment is very small, so they will be suffering a lot if it is cut.

Please notice, this is very important, that the companies that will be hiring the ""interns"" won't be respectable companies like IBM or Microsoft, no, those companies will probably be very small companies or subcontractors or recruiters, so those companies will not necessarily have a high level of ethics, which means those companies will probably be more prone to exploiting the ""interns"" noticing that the ""interns"" will be afraid of losing their Centrelink payments.

Note: I submitted a previous version of this post to r/AustralianPolitics about one month ago and a moderator deleted it because it was not a balanced discussion, and that moderator criticized one paragraph in my text, I asked that moderator that if I am allowed to publish this post deleting that paragraph and that moderator didn't reply to me, I also sent a private message to that moderator which was not replied. I always wanted to follow all the rules of this subreddit that was why I asked if it was OK publishing this post without that specific paragraph. I don't have much experience writing political commentary nor I have a degree in journalism, that is why I make mistakes sometimes with my posts not being a balanced discussion; but I'm always interested in fixing those mistakes that is why I asked twice if I can publish this post without that specific paragraph. I think I understand correctly what the moderator criticized of my post before and I think I am solving it writing the post in this way (this post *doesn't* have the paragraph that the moderator criticized in my first post).

I think that was just the final nail in the coffin). I'm finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science and I already have some professional experience thanks to internships. I took the survey on Canada's immigration website and it said I should qualify for Express Entry, though I still need to take the IELTS and get a job offer.

This leads me to my question: where in Canada is a good place to live and work for someone in my field? I know Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal are kind of the bigger tech hubs, but I also know that some of them have pretty high costs of living, especially Vancouver.

It would be cool if you could back up your answer with some statistics or something, but I'm also super open to people just pitching whatever they think is best."

My mom died when I was 18. She had ovarian cancer and when she found out she was diagnosed she had passed just seven weeks later. My family was crippled as she was the glue that held us together. My relationships with my brother and sisters definitely took a change for the worse. I started working all the time and smoking weed almost every day a few months after. Prior to this I had been wanting to go to community college and eventually transfer, though I wasn't set on a career yet. I never really knew my passion. 

Fast forward seven years and I still feel like I'm in the same boat. I have a degree in psychology, though I'm not particularly sure that I want to do anything with it. I did an internship helping at risk youth from falling deeper down the rabbit hole of addiction and honestly it just took a lot out of me. I took a lot of the job home with me and I always thought I wanted to be there to help at risk kids and adolescents but it was very tolling and I don't think it is for me. The kids were all great and I learned so much but my god it was so damn sad every day...I don't want to work a job where I see people at their worst all the time.

Been waiting tables for the last five years and became pretty damn good at it. Got up to lead server at the restaurant I work at in a great corporation, and am making upwards of 800-1000 a week there. I have a lot of money saved up because I've been full time the past few years but I just feel stuck. I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I know I don't want to work in a restaurant forever. They want me to try and work my way up to management but I can't stand the way they run things and it's all politics and ass kissing and things that just aren't me.  

Part of me just wants to end it all and stop wasting my own and everyone else's time. I think about suicide sometimes. Not like I'd try it, but I think about it. Especially on some of my worse days. My dad keeps telling me to go to grad school but I have no idea for what. He has such high hopes for me and idk...I always feel like I'm letting him down. I've been smoking weed every day since a few months after my mom died. I don't think it's a negative thing because I love weed (lol) but part of me thinks it's holding me back from my true potential, I just don't know what. I stopped for a few months about a year ago and all I accomplished was I read a few more books and went out to socialize a bit more, I didn't figure out my career path or my life at all so I just went back to smoking. 

I saw a therapist for a while after everything with my mom happened. I saw her every week or once a month for four years, until she started charging me for appointments I didn't go to and was basically committing insurance fraud...which left a bad taste in my mouth for psychologists and dissuaded me from working in that field as well.

I have no idea what I'm going for in this post. I'm
so damn anxious about my future that I keep staying stuck in the present and past. I'm not expecting a pity party with this post, I just never talk about anything to anyone and this is the only
outlet I could think of. If anybody is in the same boat as me, or has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. "

I'm a friendly person, and I'm always ready to meet new people and get some new friends!

I actually would love to check out starbucks, and try the famous Pumpkin-Spice latter (Haha, such a diva, but people say it's good and I've NEVER tried it).

Some things I would like to point out:

* I'd prefer someone from age 18 - 25.

* Doesn't matter about your gender

* Doesn't matter about your sexuality, as I'm in the middle myself.

* I love to play video games, draw, take photos, and find new things to enjoy.

* Don't be pessimistic, I want a person who is gonna be energy full and wouldn't make me feel awkward when I wouldn't know what to say. Basically a very friendly person!

I'd want to get to know the person first before meeting them in person, so whatsapp or snapchat would work really good for me!

69z6gn,5,2017-05-08,"Went to an undergraduate school that doesn't ""do"" GPAs. Went on to do a master's degree in a Foreign country and got a pretty mediocre/bad GPA. Help. (sorry so long)",terput,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/69z6gn/went_to_an_undergraduate_school_that_doesnt_do/,"Hi all, 

I've been agonizing about my transcript/GPA/grad background for a while now, wondering how the hell I'm going to get into a good school. 

Very long story short:  

My alma matter in the states is one of those ""radical"" small liberal arts schools that provide detailed ""evaluations"" rather than grades.   I got excellent evaluations that talk about how great and smart I am.  But I did a semester abroad and when I was graded got something like a 3.5?

After I finished my undergrad degree I decided I wanted to move abroad.   I taught for a year but my visa didn't get renewed and I figured out that the easiest way to get a new visa was to enroll in school.  I proceeded to do an undergraduate and a graduate degree basically just so I could have a visa (I was in France where the cost of public education is nil; I paid something like $1000 dollars for all of my degrees and was able to work on the side). 

Since I was really just enrolling...to enroll ( I did this for a number of reasons; mostly because I was in love, had friends, and was obsessed with this fantasy I had of living in Paris.  That was all I really cared about at the time, I wasn't thinking about the future)  I went to classes so I could keep enough of a GPA to survive and not lose my visa, but I didn't really care about the degree I was doing.  I was vaguely interested in it, but I also skipped entire classes b/c I was supporting myself and working the entire time.  

Fast forward a few years and I've been working for non profit organizations for years, most recently for a legal aid non profit.  I'm basically a paralegal now, love the work I do, and passionately want to go to law school.  

However, I am very worried about how I will ""seem"" to law schools.  

A) My undergraduate grades are not grades.  My evaluations are very good, I have no idea how they would calculate my GPA?

B) My undergraduate and graduate grades from France are...from France.  France grades on a 1-20 point system.   It is almost impossible to get anything above a 15-16 (nobody gets 20 out of 20); a 15 would be an A, a 14 would be an A-, a 13 a B, a 12 A B-, and a 10-11 a C.  

During my undergraduate in France, I got a final score of something like 13 the first year and 13.75 the second year; this would come out to something like a B + average.   But I'm not even sure how law schools calculate foreign GPA and I'm afraid that anyone looking at a score that says 13 / 20 will think it's really bad when, in fact, it's not. 

Then, my final graduate GPA was something like a 12.  Not great at all.   I actually did fairly well in most of my classes that I went to...but I skipped entire classes that conflicted with my work schedule, and I ended up getting a D in some of them b/c I only sat for the exam. 

Now I feel like such an idiot.   The thing is, theoretically I could just not mention that I went to school in France.  I was working as a teacher and did a cool internship in Africa with a non-profit as part of my master's practicum, so I could just mention those things and not mention the degrees.  

But some of the schools that I am interested in applying to require that I submit ALL undergraduate and graduate transcripts, and attorneys eventually have to pass ethics tests.  I do NOT want to lie by omission and have it bite me in the ass later on. 

I know this is long.  I know that maybe I just need to suck it up and face the music but this all feels kind of cruel.   I just didn't really ever think those grades would matter, I'm not sure why.  I guess cause I'm an idiot.    My undergrad evals are so good that I hope they will shine through, but I am fairly sure that anyone in admissions that sees that I had a B - average and got 0s in certain classes in grad school will look down on me for it.  

Thoughts? Help.

I'm a 21yo ex-college student. I recently (within the last week) returned home after coming clean to my parents after lying to them for a year about being enrolled in school, plus some school debt I hadn't told them about. I had an extremely hard time last year, and after a year of trying to distract myself with friends, work, and partying, I finally told them about everything. 

I'm back home now, and I feel even worse about myself. I have little to moderate motivation and so many feeling of self-hate, pity, and feelings of being inadequate and unskilled. 

When I was in school, I was a very successful student and student leader, but after one especially bad academic semester, I lost my relationship, my job (and housing since I was an RA), and my student leadership position. Since then (about a year and a half ago), I've been on this downward spiral and I just feel so awful about myself. 

I don't really know what to do now. Last week I sorted out my finances and applied to some internships but now I just feel stuck. My parents are upset but are trying to help, but they think things are just as easy as flipping a switch when in fact it feels like I have to climb Mt. Everest.

Tl;dr : i fucked up and I don't recognize myself anymore, and it just sucks. "

My options:

Stay in my current city, MAYBE be able to share a flat/room with 6 other people for $800 for the full summer due Friday. I have a job, but definitely won't be anywhere near my partner.

Maybe try to stay a few states away with my sibling, will have to get a new job and a place to stay until June in the town I'm in now. Pro is that I'm near my niece and there is a chance my partner may get an internship up there.

Try to find a place I can rent out month-to-month and figure it out from there? I'm having a really hard time finding anywhere like this though. 

I have just cut this really close and I don't know what to do and I can't imagine being abroad for the whole semester away from my partner, let alone including the summer in that too. I'm afraid I'm going to end up homeless while waiting for her to get info on where she's going to be.

Now, in my post, many woman claimed they not only wouldn't do this, but claimed JFK, president of the united states, seemed ""creepy"" and they aren't attracted to just ""some random dude"".

I am not saying I believe all women would agree to have sex with JFK, but I think no woman would reject such an opportunity, in the moment of actually meeting the president, so abruptly and easily. As we have seen in other posts about refusing sex/LMR, woman sometimes are afraid to say no to ordinary men, so I can only imagine how they would react with the most powerful man in the entire world in front of them...

So I am graduating this month and already am getting a couple job offers. I live in Philly so the demand for social workers is pretty high. 

I just need some advice because I had an interview at Staffmore LLC, a job placement agency that offered me a job as a therapeutic staff support worker in a school (I have a lot of experience in schools). The job seems great, I had a good first impression with the LLC, but they didn't really give me a chance to say yes or no. Also I completely neglected to ask about my salary. 

They're already going forward with sending me the link to an online training, asking for my clearances, and basically hired me without me officially saying yes (but it IS a job placement so I'm assuming they figured that's why I'm there). 

Then I got an e-mail from another agency that I had been to on a home visit with an old client (during an internship). I am going to go on this interview but say I like it better, how do I handle telling the first place this? I've never had a full-time job, only part-time jobs to get me through school so I'm pretty new at this. 

Any advice would be helpful.

6a2bgs,7,2017-05-08,Final Analysis of Taco Bell's Twitter Success,ProjectSpreadability,tacobell,https://www.reddit.com/r/tacobell/comments/6a2bgs/final_analysis_of_taco_bells_twitter_success/,"For about a month, I've been doing research based on the question of how can a company social media account make spreadable content. What made me interested in this concept was a chapter in a book called Spreadable Media by Henry Jenkins, which talked about the idea of how the internet can spread messages to dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of people, which makes it a valuable marketing tool. (If you're interested in reading more about that idea, check out my first post on this account).

So I turned my attention to the most successful, spreadable company social media account that I knew, the Taco Bell twitter. I'm not the first person to recognize its success, as it won a marketing award in 2013 (http://adage.com/article/special-report-marketer-alist-2013/taco-bell-ad-age-s-marketer-year/243852/). I've been looking into the factors of what makes it successful.

I'm sure there's a lot of other ways a company account could be successful, but here's a list of factors that contribute to the Taco Bell twitter's success:

-catering to a target audience on a medium that will reach them (on top of that, this audience is also their largest 
consumer demographic: 18-35 year olds).

-hiring social media marketing employees who can relate to/entertain that demographic .

-paying the social media employees a livable wage (52K-55K a year), giving them incentive to work hard and put in their best effort.

-encouraging interaction between both taco-fanatics to one another and taco-fanatics to the account (also making incentive for them to reach out, such as making challenges with their food for people to replicate).

-interacting with relevant celebrities.

-keeping up with relevant trends.

All these factors together has created spreadable content; content that twitter users enjoy retweeting and sharing with their friends, which meets the ultimate goal of the company having another medium to advertise on (I was referring to it as 'free advertising' before, but after I found out how much the company pays their inters, I realized it's not so free). Although it's not free, it's still a more personal, specialized form of advertisement. Keep up the good work, Taco Bell social media interns.  "

I had a few internships while I was there, one was soldering PCBs for a company that sells modular synthesizers, one was helping the IT department at my school, and the other was cleaning toilets at a shitty studio run by a kid younger than me with a trust fund.

I've had a few live sound gigs since then, a few at local bars, and one at a private school for the kids recitals.  Every audio job I've applied to that can offer some sort of consistency and salary requires years of experience that I don't have.  I never get responses even when I lie about my experience.  At this point I'm ready to just work at some office doing anything that can give me a salary, but I can't seem to get a job like that either.

About a month ago I left my small city I grew up in to head to Chicago where I figured there might be more opportunities.  I made it to about 5 hours outside of the city where I have free rent for a while to save some money.  I'm working at a fast food place and I'm not making nearly enough to save for a move to Chicago, it's really looking like I'm going to have to give up and move back to my small city I grew up in where there is no audio opportunities.

Am I just delaying the inevitable warehouse job for the rest of my life?

I guess I'm asking people who hire for audio jobs or people who have been in this situation and gotten out of it:  What are the steps I should be taking at this point?  There are no places I could intern around here, and even if there were, I wouldn't have time while trying to grab as many shifts as possible at my dead end job at minimum wage.

I don't have a studio, I had to sell almost everything I had to try and make this move.  The longer I go without being around the audio equipment we had at school, the more I'm forgetting.  I'm also proficient in tons of non audio related creative software, but that doesn't seem to be a lucrative enough skill to get me a job either.  Most of my coworkers are high school/college students.  I have $300 right now and am avoiding paying $400 per month in student loans.

Any advice?

I'm so scared of being seen as a ""dumb girl"" that I usually completely avoid discussing anything related to technology, and when I'm being watched I get so nervous that I can't even think. I'm nervous about extra scrutiny because I'm a woman, but I'm also nervous about messing up because I'm a woman, like I'm going to shame my entire gender in a field where a win really counts.
I think I feel so much pressure because no one at all believed in me at the start, that I could do this. My family is generally very old-fashioned and misogynistic. (We are farm people from a very small town who moved to a suburb.) I am nearing the end of my degree, and my father still refuses to believe that I am capable of so much as setting up a router. He knows nothing about computers or technology, but he doesn't believe that women are capable of working in tech. In the past, he has actually interrupted me talking to sales people so that he can tell them that I don't know what I'm talking about or what I want, and that my boyfriend tells me what to think regarding computing. I wasn't allowed to use the computer much growing up because my dad (who, again, does not understand computers in the least) insisted that I would break it. So when I got my first laptop at 18, I was slow to pick up computer use and constantly afraid I was going to ""hurt"" my laptop. When I told my [male] friends that I was thinking about taking a computer science class, they literally laughed in my face. I didn't take that class until a few years later, and shortly thereafter changed my major.

Back to the present, I'm 24 and I've been trying to get some kind of IT internship so that I can get experience and actually get a job when I graduate. I only have a year left, so I can't sit around twiddling my thumbs on getting into the industry. I got an interview, and wouldn't you know, I kind of bombed it. I was so scared that the interviewers would think I was a hack the second I opened my mouth, and I pretty much froze. 
So I'm talking to my brother, and I tell him about this anxiety issue. I know I can't keep being scared, I have to own my skills and use them. I talk about how I'm trying to get psyched and raise my confidence. Otherwise, I'm gonna be screwed. He tells me that I shouldn't worry about being a female, and hey, it might work to my advantage. 

A week ago I got another call for an internship, set up an interview, tried to get really confident and focused so I wouldn't get nervous. The internship is a year long, paid, competitive, and is a stepping stone into systems engineering (which is what my specialty is in). I studied things I knew for most of the day before so I wouldn't mess up, so I would have no room to doubt myself. Went to the interview and killed it. They said they'd let me know in about a week, as there were a few more interviews in the coming days.
Imagine my surprise when TWO HOURS later, they offer me the position. They absolutely loved me. 
I was flying on happiness. I told my mom right away, she was thrilled. My dad heard, he was unsurprisingly a douche. And then I tell my brother. After all, we very recently discussed how I was scared I'd never measure up to the work I wanted to do. I say, ""Can you believe how fast they offered me the job? It's crazy!"" He responds, ""Of course they hired you right away. You're a minority in IT."" ""Well they wouldn't hire me like that just because I'm a woman."" ""Sure they would. It's so easy being a woman in a male dominated profession.""

It's been a few days and his comment has just killed my excitement since the second he said it. I can't get it out of my head, and even though I'm 99% sure that's not what happened.... there's 1% of doubt. And so there's this little him-sounding voice that says, ""They only hired you because you're a woman.""
""You don't deserve the job.""

Thanks, bro."

My School had a carbon monoxide (and other exhaust fumes) gas leak. I worked the next day. 8 days later the facilities director and director of safety and security came and told me and others that it even happened, and advised us to get L&amp;I. So I did. The Doctor told me there is no test possible, but he filed the paperwork. I cancelled my work-study, complained, dodged their meeting and asked for things in writing. I told them to tell everyone, because people could have been hurt, but they won't. I sought legal advice. I am unsure how to continue.

Another few events have, in a timely fashion, coincided with this. Two weeks ago I was in the lunchroom talking loudly with a guy, dropping knowledge and I said stuff about soldiering and Iraq, and other kids started listening to me (oddly this usually never happens). The very next day I was talking to that guy, and another guy comes up talking about free education and trying to get me to look at his YouTube and subscribe. So I did. Why not right? It's a huge rant about the system and its a one month old account with several quick videos. So he gets my number and invites me to a meeting supposedly other people are at. So I blow it off and set the next morning. I show up and this other guy is there and they tell me touching stories and try to get me interested in stuff. Then the guy says ""Confederacy papers"" and I knew he wasn't just some guy. Worked for prisons for eight years? Sure pal. So I feel from talking to them they want me to make a YouTube and teach people stuff, and I have a blog where I drop the knowledge, but I feel they are entrapping me to make a YouTube so they can call me a terrorist. Now the guy emails me saying his visa is expired and he only has 5 grand. The next day (today) he emailed me saying the school kicked him out because his YouTube dream of making school free. I think he is a foreign agent or perhaps a really bad FBI intern.

So for the heavy stuff. My brother got hit by a car this last weekend, and the driver sped off.

My father was going to see him the next day and his tire blew out I guess, and he got a concussion and a spinal injury. They know I want to go back to Canada in 2 months. They have plenty of time to boil the pot :(

What should I do? I just want to finish my quarter at school, but somehow I don't feel they want to let me. And I don't even know who they are or the extent of the connection of the aforementioned events. Just thought I should make a post. Thanks for reading.

6a3e4d,4,2017-05-09,Discovered my calling and want to become an academic adviser! Can anyone give some advice on how to start?,Mijinion,studentaffairs,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/6a3e4d/discovered_my_calling_and_want_to_become_an/,"Hey everyone, if you're reading this, thank you :). It's a bit lengthy, so if you stick to reading this, I appreciate you :)

TL;DR, want to be an adviser, have an opportunity at a for-profit college...

 I'm a senior majoring in History, and working on a Master's degree in International Studies as part of a combined degree program.

**BRIEF BACKGROUND**

I've had a varied work history, from a big red retail store, to working as an intern for a senator, to software QA, to my current position. I was never able to truly find my groove as you can see. I found myself wanting to be part of academia in some capacity, but never quite sure as to what or how.

I currently work at a community college as an IT lab assistant for one of the computer labs on campus, which is essentially a supervisor role for the lab in which I engage student with their inquiries and check operations.

It's a slow job, but I found that the most exciting part of the day is helping students to solve their problems and make life a little easier for them. I've came to the realization that I'd like to be an academic adviser after a lengthy conversation with my own. I've discovered it to be my own little passion.

Part of it stems from my own experiences in school, having grown up in a high-risk school in Chicago. I want people to have the opportunities I almost never had, and the opportunities many cannot be granted. 

**SO, WHAT THEN?**

I can start at Devry University during the summer as a Student Support adviser. While my mind is in it, my heart is not, considering the nature of the school as a for-profit, and the ultimate goal is *not* the student, but rather, the dollar.

I want to find myself working as an adviser in a university or community college and moving upwards to have a positive influence on a school's operations. The more I think about it, the more I want to provide students with an experience that could encourage others to be in my position.

I've considered looking at NACADA and meeting with advisers at the college I work for! Can anyone else give me some advice!

**Quick resume summary**

3.5 year total work history in (5 month retail, 2 years in software QA, interned for 3 months, 1.1 years in higher ed)

Bachelor's in History; Associates in Arts, MA Student

1. People with experience in one or both of these majors, are the professors and classes generally good? 

2. Is there a lot of free space in your schedule for electives or is it really packed? I'd come in with about 50 AP credits if that helps.

3. Is it a ton of work? I know it's probably a lot of reading and writing, but is it manageable if I'm somewhat capable of time management?

4. Do you have a lot of free time or do you spend a ton of time studying?

5. What are things like for internships and stuff like that? Are they easy to get, are there a lot of opportunities, are they really competitive?

6a5qvs,39,2017-05-09,Would appreciate anyone who wants to talk or listen. Anxious and empty.,redheadedpsycho11,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/6a5qvs/would_appreciate_anyone_who_wants_to_talk_or/,"I apologize because this is going to be a long post. I just need to get it out. And I just need to be assured I am not alone.

I feel lost. Empty. My anxiety is at an all time high. Constant state of worrying. Shaking. Pulse racing. Feeling like everything is about to fall apart for no reason. I am irritable all of the time because of this, causing me to be a horrible friend and not fun to be around. Whenever I am now invited to social situations, I freak out &amp; usually come up with an excuse not to go unless there's alcohol or drugs involved to make me feel more comfortable. 

Anyway, my boyfriend is my god send. But it's getting to be bad because I know I am relying on him too much for my happiness and sanity. He is the only thing that makes me feel calm and safe and okay. And also the only one I talk to about my anxieties and also my occasional thoughts of suicide (which I'll elaborate on later). 

I used to see an on campus counselor (junior year of college rn), however I stopped going to her because she would literally forget so many details about me, tell me it was hard for her to ""gage my emotions due to my alcohol consumption,"" (I used to drink way more frequently like nightly, but now a few times a week but when I would see her I usually had not drank in days). Her saying this really started to make me feel super invalidated in all that I feel. Even now I wonder if it's real.

She gave me refrrrals to off campus psychologists. I have called three and left voicemails stating I have anxiety and looking for help and I haven't been called back by one. :( this was last week. It hurts and makes me feel even more alone. I can't do this myself. I need help.

Anyway yesterday was a bad one. I was supposed to call back a great internship go schedule an interview but I did not. What a fucking fail I am. I need this internship and money. My parents know I applied. But I do not feel capable or strong enough to take it and go into this office and show them that I am the perfect candidate. I don't feel like I am. Some days I feel okay but my anxiety is too overwhelming on others I don't think I could be a consistent intern.

Finals have been stressing me out and killing me because it's been my worst semester yet and my gpa is about to be terrible. I am horrified of what my parents will think about this as they fork out so much for tuition and think I'm doing just fine rn. I want so desperately to show them my self harm scars and tell them this has been the worst semester of my life and I feel like I am falling apart...but I'm scared and I've put on such a fascade that I'm ok. I've avoided going home throughout the entire semester to see them bc I am just scared they will see I am a wreck and I'll be forced to tell them.

Yesterday I had a crying fit mental breakdown (not really a panic attack because I didn't have the sense of not breathing) and I told my boyfriend to leave because I felt bad he had to witness yet another occasion where I fall apart. This has been happening daily for weeks now. I feel so bad and like I am going to drive away the one I love most. I told him I'm sorry for being a burden, he only said I am sometimes but it's okay. Made me feel worse.

I called him many many times last night crying and screaming about how I wanted to die. I wanted him so desperately to come over and stay the night but he was exhausted as he hadn't slept the night before. Selfishly, I just really fucking needed him there with me. I needed to not be alone last night. I slept with a knife by my bed in case I wanted to harm or maybe even end it but I don't know.

My door is still locked and my roommates/best friends have asked if I am okay I am sure they heard me screaming on the phone. I told them I need to be alone right now. 

I am horrified of everyone waking up and the day starting. I just want my boyfriend he's the only one that makes me feel better but he can't fully understand. 

I am laying on my bed in the dark with my heart racing feeling so very alone and helpless and I can't stop having horrible thoughts of what an awful person I am and how I am a waste of space.

My mind is hell please help me. Please I am so alone.

TL;DR anxiety out of hand. Therapists won't call back. Feel like I'm driving boyfriend away. Too overwhelmed to study for finals or call for an internship interview. Empty and wanting it to end"

Megan shows up at the hospital. Because drama.  

Have an interesting, quirky crop of 4/5 interns that recur as guest stars. Thinking Heather/Cross type-characters for real comic effect against our hardened crop of surgeons.  

Have Maggie revisit her relationship with Andrew, because that was seriously cute.

Before going to the restaurant to eat for free, I went to tutoring. We completed a chapter from the accounting class before the lecture in my class. The tutor won't be available on Wednesday because he will be going to an internship.

The restaurant have five locations: two in Manhattan, one in Queens, one in Brooklyn, and one in New Jersey. I went to the one at East Village by bus because it's just two train stops to the restaurant. The place was still in renovation, so I took the bus to Chinatown.

The buses that go to Chinatown are frequented by seniors, as younger people prefer the subway. I would go to Chinatown from my college via subway as it is 4 stops away, or between 2 and 3 dozen bus stops away.

When I entered, the restaurant wasn't that buzy. I got a seat right away and showed my ID for my free meal. I ordered their curry soup base hot pot with mountain yam, fried tofu, special pork, lamb, fish fillet, Fuzhou fish balls, fried dough, rice, fish roe balls, fried tofu skin, and crab sticks. The crab sticks are served with plastic wrap. I removed the wrap after putting the crab sticks into the pot.

When I went to the sauce counter, I mix sesame sauce, peanut sauce, peanut oil, welsh onion, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin sauce and wasabi. Some of the labels are misplaced. When I came back the second time, I found chili oil, so I took the bowl of sauce and added the chili sauce. I mix the sauce up and end up with a red, pungent, and savory concoction.

I couldn't finish the rice and got tong sui for dessert. I chose to have grass jelly with coconut milk to neutralize the acidity from the hot pot. I left $2 as tips."

I've been making a ton of progress in the past couple of months because of this knowledge I've slowly gained through you all.

I am a 21 year old college student in the bay area working on a double major in business marketing and psychology. Right now I have a year and a half left of schooling for my undergraduate degrees. My annual income is ~$15,000. 

What my concerns are right now revolve around my student debt and also some nasty credit card debt that has entered collections as of this past year. (I was young and was not aware of the risks of credit cards at the time) 

I have 2 loans through Great Lakes:

Direct Sub. Stafford- $5,000 @ 3.760%

Direct Unsub. Stafford- $2,500 @ 3.760%

Total Balance as of May 9, 2017: $7,526.54

My credit card debt:

B of A- $1,537

Chase- $1,853

So the good news- I recently landed an internship at Enterprise for the summer and will be working there full-time for 8-10 and then will hopefully be able to stay on staff part-time through the school year with hard work these next couple of weeks. My mom also has taken out a parent plus loan for me and has started supporting my education so this alleviates a lot of my debt/expenses. I pay $800/month for rent, $61 for car insurance, and $50 a month of groceries. Everything else is covered and this has been a long time coming. 

Should I pay off my student debt now or wait until I have enough to pay it all forward within the year and a half I am in school? Right now I have $2,000 in my Ally Online Savings account and will be making roughly $2,500-3,000/month this summer with just the rent to pay. I feel as if I need some guidance in if I should save 3-6 months of expenses or attack my debt first.

I love so many things about him like his sense of humor, creativity, but I feel a bit disconnected often from him. 


We met on tinder almost a year ago (he had moved to the state I live in) and we didn't want to be in a relationship, just kind of wanted to hangout or whatever. Then when we spent more time together, it just kind of happened. 

He's very chill, like to a point where I kind of interpret it as indifference. I remember (before we started exclusively dating) for my birthday he fell asleep when I had made plans to go out, so I ended up seeing a movie by myself. This was fine, he works a lot and I was able to get past it. I work a lot too (schoolwork, internships). 


I think since then, we have only really celebrated one other event together which was New Years (which I planned and flew out to his home state) he spent Christmas there, thanksgiving there, etc. Valentines day was not in his home state, although it was such a bust, he didn't do anything. I did so much and he did nothing, he said he was going to plan a camping trip but then just didn't mention it again, getting caught up with work. 


Finally, this is my last week of college and he had planned with his mom to go out of the country, so he's missing my graduation, although this was before we started going out, he could have still changed the date he returned, while still keeping his obligation to his family.


I know I'm being selfish but I'm just going through the most stressful week, my mom's in town, I'm graduating, I'm looking for a job, have a crazy roommate who I share a room with whose threatening me and my other roommates to break the lease (because she's moving for the summer and doesn't want to commit to the contract) and I'm just barely hearing any kind of communication from him (we talk mostly through snapchat, I know international calls are a lot, but...yeah.) 

             
I don't know Reddit, I feel loved when I'm with him but there always seems to be this disconnect and bad communication/no follow through, no initiative to plan anything. I know it sounds like I'm complaining, but a lot is affecting me and I guess I'm just feeling like he's not there for me? Although he did let me borrow his camera for film my aunt's baby shower, although missed the baby shower because he's abroad. 


I'm just deeply confused on what to do, we've already talked about it and he just doesn't seem to be changing, or not conscious enough of it. Does he literally just not give a shit? Should I break up with him? I legit need consultation from this community, because I love him so much but feel like he's not meeting me where I am.

tldr; Boyfriend is passive/workaholic to the point where I'm not sure if he cares about the relationship, feeling disconnected... contemplating breaking up?

I'm an 18 year old intern at a local computer repair shop (my friend and I both intern here), and we both really wanted to bolster our knowledge in the networking field. We asked one of the older guys we work with on some tips to help us out and he gave us 2 ideas. The first was to go with him on jobs that require rewiring / setting up new networking equipment (which we both are taking full advantage of). The second was to take some spare parts around the office and parts we have at home and build a RAID and a Hyper-V server.

My first question: Does this sound like a good stepping stone to you guys? I've set up one RAID before so I'm somewhat familiar with the process, but do you think building a RAID and a Hyper-V and just toying around with it is a good way to learn? If you have any better / alternative ideas, please let me know! (I'm getting a Computer Science degree and wanting to go into this field - I'm ready for anything that might take long term.)

My second question: Do you know where I can get cheap - and even refurbished - hard drives with large sizes for my RAID?

Thank you anyone and everyone who helps!

TL;DR Should I build a RAID and Hyper-V to learn more about networking, and where can I get cheap HDDs for said RAID."

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted LoL league, we’re hosting 3 month leagues for Bronze &amp; Silver, Gold &amp; Platinum, Diamond &amp; Up that are open to all. We're operating in NA and EUW, more info below. **The first week of our Open Leagues starts this coming Monday, and this weeks team lock is this Saturday at 5pm PT!** Matches will be starting next week and   Check out our [Website](https://lol.competeleague.com/) and our subreddit [r/CompeteLeague](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/). 

*Teams for the EUW Bronze &amp; Silver Premier League currently in high demand, signups up to 10 teams before next Monday will be guaranteed a Premier League place!*

**About CompeteLeague** 

CompeteLeague in December 2015 as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. We'd started as a small community in 2013 running only 1 league featuring 8 teams and figuring out best practices until we launched our website and as a company! Since then we've grown and developed our community and website as a passion project to the point where we over the past year we’ve had our most successful seasons ever, running 33 leagues since last January that all culminated with our 3 day finals events!
 Our first season finals were broadcasted from [Carbon Entertainment Studios in Denver](https://youtu.be/VKC6a9YXqBc?t=1646) and our most recent Spring 2017 Finals were held live from [SAIT Polytech in Calgary!](https://youtu.be/Z_o7fW99kXU?t=288). We're extremely pleased with the progress we've made growing our community and competitions, and now we’re looking to build on what we have and bring you more features! 

**What We Need**

We need you! As a player, as a viewer, as an eSport enthusiast, as a volunteer, we're back and looking to grow our community coming into our 4th set of seasons. Our site is ready for signups and teams registering for competition, and our qualifiers will be in the next few weeks to set up our CompeteLeague 2017 Summer Split leagues. Our stream will be beginning with it and we'll want anyone interested to come watch and cheer for our teams. We're also always looking for interested community members who would like to get involved in an eSports setting, we have several roles that we train people in and help them get experience (casters, organisers, writers etc.), and plenty to offer for our volunteers (more information below). 

*Particularly for the EUW Bronze &amp; Silver Premier League teams currently in high demand, signups up to 10 teams before next Monday will be guaranteed a Premier League place!*

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for LoL will be as follows:

Bronze &amp; Silver | Gold &amp; Platinum | Diamond &amp; Up
-------------|----------------|----------
Mondays | Tuesdays | Wednesdays
5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST
6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for eight weeks, and will be streamed and casted on our [twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/CompeteLeague). Each team will play every other team twice in an 8 week round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | B | R | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 | Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 | No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6|  No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 | No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 | No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 | Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 | No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8 | Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| No (1)

Our Open Leagues run for 7 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in 0 points. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners &amp; next seasons teams over the space of 5 weeks. If you want more information on our leagues/format, we have an excellent set of (clickable!) infographics on our [information page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/information) on our site. Just hit the ‘Format Information’ tab and it’s right there for you. 

**Pricing**

Totally free &amp; always will be: we've no interest in charging you money to play. We operate on a freemium model but our community will always have the opportunity to participate completely free. We can't achieve our goal of providing broadcasted competition to all if we restrict it to those that can't pay! Particularly generous benefactors support us via Patreon, the money from which goes towards prizing and webhosting costs.

**Smurfing policy**

We have years of experience with similarly formatted leagues and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion. If you want the full details on what we do to deal with smurfing it's available on our site's [FAQ Page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/information/faq).

**Prizes**

We don't announce the prizing in our tournaments at the beginning of our seasons - but we do prize all our leagues! The prizing for our 2017 Spring Split was $10 RP for the winning team, and custom logo designs for 2nd and 3rd (insert appropriate EU currencies for EUW). These are lower than we'd like as Riot doesn't provide prizing for online tournaments any more and we have to fund it ourselves, but we'll be equalling or bettering the prizing for this season. We don't charge players to play but as mentioned previously if members want to contribute to that the money we receive on Patreon goes entirely towards it.

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be looking to do audience giveaways intermittently, whether they be for skins/steam games/RP/anything else. We stream over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/competeleague) which is our main hub, but for those who would like quality settings due to low bandwidth internet we also simultaneously stream to our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CompeteLeague).

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run our seasons. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be for heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being [Dominic ‘Dom’ Roemer](https://twitter.com/DomRoemer) who now casts for Riot) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). Just recently as well we’ve seen one of our casters [Jay ‘Arktiq112’ Taylor](https://twitter.com/arktiq112) land a job with Fnatic! We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. The different positions we have for volunteers are:

-- Broadcaster

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

-- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails usually casting 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so bear in mind we may spend some time giving you practice &amp; training prior to putting you live to cast in our leagues - we aim to have any recruits that don’t have experience cast some of our Open League games to build up practice.  

-- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

-- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred.

-- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

-- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

-- Writer/Content provider

We're expanding and providing better structure &amp; consistency in our content crew in the coming season. Whether you want to create content surrounding our leagues, the amateur scene, the eSports scene as a whole, or other related topics we're happy to help you with a community to publish to &amp; feedback for your work.

-- How do I apply?

Our application form on our website has been temporarily hidden, so in the meantime the correct way to apply for a position is to answer the questions in this google document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOLbwkt_T0uvIzGegPyBnto3Pa1HZ9ikbIV74cY-VYc/edit?usp=sharing And email the answers to admins@competeleague.com.

**What Makes us Different?**

*Experience.* We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We were one of the very first amateur leagues on the scene and having watched a lot of tournament organizers (HP5v5, Vespyr, iEsports) struggle with their LoL operations in recent months I believe we're one of the last - and we're not going anywhere! We look to run/perform everything we do as professionally as possible and if that sounds like something you can get behind then we hope to see you join our community!

**FAQ**

Well first of all there's a FAQ available on our [site](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq) which you can check out, but here's some common ones.

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). In the Open League, any number of teams can join at any point in the system and be playing within a week, and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. The Open League is a slightly lesser experience, but one of the most requested features by viewers of our past leagues, where we only had premier leagues and teams that found us at the wrong times couldn’t sign up or play.

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

The website has requesting reschedules as a feature when you’re a team in our leagues. You will be able to request a reschedule via your account page, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team must accept the reschedule request. While we know emergencies happen, your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time. To help with unexpected situations/problems we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. When a request is scheduled the teams involved must organise an appropriate time to play, relay information to staff, and play the match within the coming week.

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There’s a feature for free agents on the site. When you sign up solo you’re placed on a public free agents list, where teams and other players will be able to see you and add you on LoL from the site and send invites to their team. Players looking for teams currently get bumped to the top by hitting a 'Actively looking for team' button on their account pages, so you can know what players have been looking for a squad in the past week! All users have a profile page where they can list their preferred means of contact (email/skype/summoner name etc.) We also have a thread over at r/competeleague for players looking to find teams! 

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in with the team you are on, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new ELO.

*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in different teams for multiple games with CompeteLeague, such as if you wanted to participate in both a LoL tournament, and a Sm4sh tournament (currently operating in Northern California) then you can! We’ll be looking to expand to more games in 2017 beyond just LoL and Sm4sh so be on the look out!

*My rune page check failed, help?*

Few things to double check - first make sure that you actually save the rune page name, and that when you copy the number over you don't have a space in the name you save. If that doesn't work, try logging out going to the homepage and hitting Shift + F5, then logging in and registering again. If you continue to have issues our support email is admins@competeleague.com, we'll get you sorted out!

*I have a different bug (error message/position list is wrong/other)* 

any further issues please repeat the problem on the website once more and then go to [https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report) - when you submit your report we get automatic information on the last few processes you’ve run and it helps us diagnose and fix any issues. From there we'll get back to you ASAP! 

*I have a not frequently asked question.*

Ask away, I and any other members of our staff around will be hopping around the comment section to answer anything that we can. That being said, we have a few extra unannounced changes, and we might not be decided on something. We’ll let you know if we’re still undecided about a question you have. Make sure to look in the comments below, as they may have answers to your questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** My devs have fixed the minor registration issue that a few people have had - if you do run into the problem though it can be fixed by refreshing the registration page!

**What Makes us Different?**

6a8l8a,1,2017-05-09,SO's financial adviser is recommending not fully paying off her student loans. Thoughts?,Helpful_guy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6a8l8a/sos_financial_adviser_is_recommending_not_fully/,"Hi all. I'm looking for some long-term advice here. My SO is about to finish vet school and will be graduating with about 220k in educational debt. Nearly all her loans are unsubsidized federal loans that won't have any grace period before she has to start repaying them. The lending agency is offering to refinance them all into one lump amount with a staggering 5.75% interest rate BUT income-based payments. Meaning that with her current plan of doing an internship, her minimum monthly payments for the next 2 years will be next to nothing.

The problem here is that at that principle amount and her current income she is getting into negative amortization territory where it will become almost impossible to pay enough to even cover the loan interest every month.

Her financial adviser is recommending basically to just make the minimum payments for 20 years, invest about $300 a month in an IRA or some other long-term investment, and then when the loans get forgiven in 20 years, just pay the IRS the $60k she'll owe in debt forgiveness taxes, and be done with it. According to his simulations this is the method that results in the lowest total cost to her, and lowest effective interest rate paid.

Does this sound like sound advice? What other options would she even have? I find it hard to believe that this is the best option, but after looking at some simulations about how much her minimum payments would be, and how much she'd have to be paying to even just cover the interest every month, I just can't see how it would be possible to put a dent in this mountain. Even if she suddenly starts making 100k in her second year out of school, she'd have to switch to a 10-year standard repayment plan and be paying over 2500 a month towards her debt to get it paid off, which results in being done 10 years earlier, but a higher interest rate and higher amount paid than waiting for loan forgiveness.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."
6a92ab,9,2017-05-09,Do you think there is any hope for me? Career-wise?,quiet_and_scared,Agoraphobia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/6a92ab/do_you_think_there_is_any_hope_for_me_careerwise/,"Hello. Female, nearly 22.

I have been in therapy for generalized anxiety and depression for over ten years now (which sucks) and my resulting agoraphobic tendencies are really getting in the way of... everything.
I want to go to grad school and get internships and have a good career but I don't think I can. I have a lot of trouble going places and talking to people. Talking to another person in any setting (besides written correspondence, but even then it takes me quite a while to respond) is panic-inducing, and that's coupled with the anxiety I get when I'm anywhere but home (and even home isn't that comfortable). I'm going to be graduating with a Computer Science degree in a few weeks so obviously I've had to think a lot about my career. I know what field I want to go into but I'm worried that even if I somehow manage to get a job, I won't be functional enough to maintain it. The thought of commuting to work and having to stay in a workplace for a number of hours every day is really overwhelming. 

I know it's similar to the commitments of being a student, and I can go to class on most days, but the thing is, I'm constantly terrified. I worry that even if I can go to a job every day, I will still live in a state of perpetual terror. I really don't want to live that way. As it is now, I have motivation to pursue a career but absolutely 0 energy - partly from depression and partly from medication and partly from just being unwell in general.

So, is it possible to have a career when you have agoraphobia? Is this the sort of thing you have to hide from your employer? Should I be more realistic and lower my expectations for myself?
And I also welcome any other advice - maybe I should have more specialized therapy or something. I've honestly never told anyone about how bad my agoraphobia has gotten. I'm just too scared of everything."

6a9lca,15,2017-05-09,How can I be a better older brother?,Whynter03,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/6a9lca/how_can_i_be_a_better_older_brother/,"I frequently find myself stuck between having a strictly friendly relationship with my younger brother and feeling some responsibility to help him find the right path in life. 

We're only two years apart. I'm in college and getting ready for an internship this summer and he's just finishing up high school, with no college plans yet. We're pretty close and spend a lot of time together when we're both home. He finds trouble often through a variety of ways and could definitely use something to help motivate him to be more productive towards his future. My parents can't get through to him at all and have pretty much decided to let him figure himself out on his own. I want to help but I don't want to sacrifice our friendship, especially if he wouldn't be receptive to any help/advice from me. 

How can I be a better older brother to him?
He's one of my best friends and I want to see him thrive for himself. 


Edit: Thanks for all of the responses. It's giving me a lot to think about. It's strange trying to help others while still working to find myself. I know ultimately he'll be alright, and that really the best I can do is to have a true relationship with him as a brother and a friend and to be there in support as he continues to find himself. "
6a9tq5,0,2017-05-09,Lots of property enterring grad school... what to do? Worth hiring a financial advisor?,FreakyCheeseMan,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6a9tq5/lots_of_property_enterring_grad_school_what_to_do/,"28M here, overall pretty comfortable. I have about 80k sitting in a bank account, and 70k in an IRA I inherited from my dad. I've also got two pieces of property - 300 acres in the middle of nowhere, Kentucky, and ~20 acres just outside of Eugene, Oregon. I don't know how much the further is work, but in 2006 the latter was appraised at 400k, and has likely grown and will continue to grow - Eugene seems to be expanding in that direction. Also, if the zoning laws change and it can be sold as multiple house sites, the value would likely skyrocket. I have about $10k left in subsidized student debt with 0% interest until after I leave school. My credit is middling poor, due to occasional forgetfulness on my part and never having borrowed money (other than said student loan.) No spouse or children, though I do want them someday.

I'm also about to start grad school in computer science. I haven't worked much in the field, but I had a succesful internship at $32/hour, so I feel pretty comfortable with my own earning potential. (I expect to get my Masters in ~2 years, though I might also go for a PhD, in which case I guess I should ask if any of you can spare a little change.)

Right now my plan is to immediately sink a ton (probably in the area of $50k... a lot of that is to keep it from falling apart, though, not to make it nicer) into rennovations for the Oregon property and get it rented out through a property management firm (One I talked to a while ago told me to expect $1,000/month for the house basically as is, and I have agreement sin place for the ships for another $400). I'll then collect hopefully decent rental income from there until the balance of it's market value, my own needs and the property taxes shift (which they may never do.) The property in Kentucky has greater sentimental value and may not be easy to rent due to location... not sure about that, don't have any plans at the moment. I don't have any particular plans for the rest of my cash besides ""Spend it"". I also plan to borrow about everything I can in student loans, cause that seems like cheap money.

I don't currently plan to retire, ever, though that may change. My hope is to leverage what I have now into keeping my carreer low-pressure (let me take long vacations, only work jobs I like, etc.) I also don't want to cut back particularly much on luxury and enjoyment in the meanwhile, so I don't want to put all of my available cash anywhere where I can't spend it during college.

I'm interested in advice in general, but my big question is: Given all of that, is it worth it for me to hire a financial manager/consultant? "

6aa3w5,0,2017-05-09,[M4M]Naughty Parents and More,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6aa3w5/m4mnaughty_parents_and_more/,"Hello!  I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas.  These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships.  Read On!

1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay:  Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen.  While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest.  Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life.  She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed.  This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity.  We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.
2) Family Vacation.  A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 
3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature
4) Mom/Son.  I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 

Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners,

6abyzm,1942,2017-05-10,Fred.,anonymousreindeer,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6abyzm/fred/,"The first time I met Fred, it was storming. I remember coming into the hospital in my scrubs, my first day as an intern, and having to track down a new pair of scrubs because mine were ruined from the rain. I spent a thirty-hour shift in wet shoes. 

Fred was always angry. My supervising physician called him Grumpy, after one of the Seven Dwarves. “Nothing makes him happy,” she said. So, needless to say, Fred wasn’t happy when a first year interning physician fresh out of medical school was assigned to his care. 

Fred was in the hospital waiting for a kidney transplant. As I read his chart, he seemed to be in perfect health—other than the fact that his kidneys were failing. Those were always the toughest cases; people randomly getting sick. Fred was lucky that his body was able to survive as long as it did without properly functioning kidneys. 

When I walked into Fred’s room for the first time, he immediately called out, “Who the hell are you!” before I could even open my mouth. I introduced myself in a robotic tone of voice (I was on hour twenty-four of this thirty). Fred let me have it. 

He threatened to call the attending physicians, the police, social workers—everyone. It didn’t help that I accidentally called him “Frank” due to a simple name mishap. 

I honestly felt like I was being hazed into becoming a doctor. Working with Fred was beyond difficult in the beginning. 

Fred was in and out of the hospital for my first year of internship, which gradually turned into a first year of residency. Somehow, I always got assigned Fred’s chart and responded to his (many) calls. 

The day we really connected was when I was cleaning one of his wounds. He had developed diabetes and was suffering from really nasty sores. He was in pain, but he didn’t want to admit it. He kept insulting me while I dabbed at the festering areas of skin. Against my better judgment, I snapped back at him. “Stop crying, Fred,” I said through gritted teeth. 

Fred had actually started crying, even though I didn’t know. He had tears running down his face due to the pain. I was shocked when I realized, and then a little embarrassed. He knew, because then his face immediately turned into this stupid grin. 

It’s not like Fred was nice to me after that, but he did change. We began to have conversations when I would see him; he actually asked me how my day was, what “trouble” I was up to. He became a gentle nuisance, I’d call it. 

Over the years, Fred was in and out of the hospital. Mainly because his kidney failure had caused several other complications that made his new kidneys reject the transplant. He developed a lot of health problems that made him chronically ill with periods of improvement. 

One thing that happened while I got to know Fred was a reconciliation with his family. The more I got to know him, the more I realized how alone he was—and it wasn’t by choice. His family was very unsupportive. His children had stopped talking to him for some silly things he had done long ago in his life. He never got to see his grandkids, whom he loved without even knowing them. I pressured him to reach out to his grandkids—who are all grown. With a little more pestering from me, he reached out to them. They were so excited to hear from him. 

Fred watched me grow from an intern to an actual doctor. Last week, I finally finished my residency and was offered a fellowship at a hospital across the country. Fred had just returned to the hospital for a complication with fluid retention around his heart. I told Fred about my new offer before I even told my parents. 

When I walked into his room, the first thing I saw was his granddaughter sitting on his bed, showing Fred pictures of a family trip they had taken years ago. Since Fred had been exiled from his children, he had a lot of catching up to do with them. That’s how he spent his days. Normally, his grandchildren would stay there from when visiting hours began until they ended. Even, once, I noticed one of Fred’s children (who had “exiled” him) leaving his room. 

I told Fred my good news, and his thin face was honestly lit up with his classic smile. His grandkids congratulated me. Fred told them about the Christmas two years that him and I spent together when I was on-call. We watched *A Christmas Story* five times in a row on TV. Everyone laughed about that, including Fred. I was part of his family. 

After talking with his family for almost an hour, I moved to leave. Fred grabbed my hand and squeezed it so tightly. He told me he was proud of me. With a wink, he let me go. 

As I was walking away from Fred’s room, I heard his laughter travel up the hallway. It was deep and loud and full of life. 

Fred died this morning of a stroke. It was sudden, but we knew it was coming. His body was failing. 

He was surrounded by his family. 

Thank you, Fred. "

the past 4 - 5 years i have been doing a home study while having a fulltime job. During the study i had to do a unpaid (1152 hour) approx 144 day internship. I spreaded this internship over these years due to not being able to quit my job because of having to pay for my house etc.

During my internship i sometimes wrote a couple more hours then i actually had done. just so i was able to be done faster.

I just feel like a bad person and a fraud for having done this, and i constantly feel like i should try and figure out how many hours i actually did instead of what ive written down. confess this to my school.

But on the other hand ive put so many hours of work and study into this that i dont want to throw these 5 years away.


Before my OCD started none of the above obsessions would bother me, but somehow with this ocd i seem to notice all my bad decisions and wrongdoings and i try to make them right the whole time."

I'm currently working full time at an internship for the summer, so I'll have SOME extra money, and it's been a dream of mine for years to own a 21:9 3440x1440p monitor. I need your help choosing!


My current top contenders are: 

LG 34UC87M-B ($720) - LG was one of the first 21:9 monitor creators, and the thunderbolt ports would be nice, although in no way necessary for me. I might, some day, connect a NAS to my main pc via thunderbolt. 

LG 34UC87C ($705) - If I was to go with this one I would probably just spring the extra 15$ for the thunderbolt model.

Acer CZ340CK ($600) - I don't know much about this monitor yet, and there are almost no reviews available, but apparently it is vesa compatible, and $599 is damn hard to beat. Also, 75Hz is better than 60Hz!

ASUS MX34VQ ($789) - The 100Hz is really nice, but I've never played above 60Hz in my life, so I think I could live without it. Also, the wireless charging in the stand is very cool, but the lack of vesa compatibility sort of kills this one for me. 


Honorable mentions:

Dell UltraSharp U3415W PXF79 ($650) - Another I haven't heard much about, but the thought of buying anything from Dell that costs that much makes me cringe. 

Acer Predator X34 refurbished (~$750-$850) - I'm not a huge fan of the thought of buying a refurbished 3440x1440p monitor seeing as how the screen quality can fluctuate so much. Also, these are very hard to find refurbished. On the plus though, the G-Sync would most likely be very nice, and I've never seen it, or anything like it, in action. If I could find one for $670 like it's listed on the BestBuy site, I would probably go with this one solely for the G-Sync and other features, even though I hate BestBuy with a passion that burns deeply within my very soul. 


I'm thinking I'm going to mount whatever I get on a vesa mount with two 1080p monitors mounted above it. (By the way, if anyone has a good recommendation for a mount that would be perfect for this please let me know.) Price is a factor, but I don't want to go too cheap and regret my decision. The monitor will be used mostly for coding, gaming, and other school work. I have an NVidia GPU and will always have an NVidia GPU because I have an NVidia shield I stream to. Currently I'm running 2xGTX 770, which I know won't run most games at this resolution, but I'm waiting for Volta to upgrade and I figured I could still upgrade my monitor this summer once I move into my new house. 


Thanks for the help everyone! I would love to consider other monitors as well if you like one I haven't listed here. Loving all the 21:9 content!

I'm thinking I'm going to mount whatever I get on a vesa mount with two 1080p monitors mounted above it. (By the way, if anyone has a good recommendation for a mount that would be perfect for this please let me know.) Price is a factor, but I don't want to go too cheap and regret my decision. The monitor will be used mostly for coding, gaming, and other school work. I have an NVidia GPU and will always have an NVidia GPU because I have an NVidia shield I stream to. Currently I'm running 2xGTX 770, which I know won't run most games at this resolution, but I'm waiting for Volta to upgrade and I figured I could still upgrade my monitor this summer once I move into my new house. 


Thanks for the help everyone! I would love to consider other monitors as well if you like one I haven't listed here. Loving all the 21:9 content!

6achx3,52,2017-05-10,Dear Dad: things are different now. I'm not 'lazy' compared to you. It's just a different world for young people.,shutupdadplease,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6achx3/dear_dad_things_are_different_now_im_not_lazy/,"TL;DR version: 28 year old millennial with a degree and masters with good grades sick of her high school drop out father constantly acting as if me not owning a house/having a career like he did at the same age is because *I* am lazy and not because the world is a different place than it was when he was in his twenties in the 70s/80s.

Dad. 

When people say it was easier for your generation to own a home, they are NOT saying that you (and mum) didn't make sacrifices to own a home. They're just saying it was a more attainable goal. When you and mum bought your house, houses were on average about 3-4 times the average household income. Now they are on average *~10-12* times more, and highest of all in in metropolitan areas like where we live.  Prices have gone up at a much higher percentage than wages have increased.  

I'm not saying you din't work hard at your job to progress and get a better wage. I'm not saying you didn't give up taking a holiday every six months and upgrading your car to afford a mortgage. I'm just saying it was easier for you in terms of housing prices in relation to incomes. 

(My Dad is not guilty of this one, but I'm also sick of people acting as if moving to a rural area is the solution. Rural areas may offer cheaper housing, but they also have much higher unemployment rates &amp; if you do get a job, wages are generally lower so it is hard to get back into the city if you want to later. Plus I hate the way some people think it is entitled to *dare* want to be able to live in the community you grew up in where you have the support networks of family and friends). 

**My father is incapable of comprehending that housing costs and wages and university fees have skyrocketed at a percentage that wages have not**. 

I wish he'd realise that millennials doing things like occasionally going to a concert, or owning an iPhone isn't going to make a difference when it comes to home ownership. Ok, so say I don't own a $1000 phone (that I have had for almost 3 years)........I still need another $149,000k+ *just* for a deposit, and I'm single right now anyway and struggling to get decent work in my field. And apparently we can't afford houses because some people save $6k and go on a trip to Europe and stay in hostels for 3 weeks or do Contiki (not my thing, but my sister did it). $6k is something most of us can realistically save for, but it's barely a drop in the bucket when you need $150,000k for a home deposit. We end up saving for the goals we can actually achieve. 

In the late 70s, people were willing to hire a kid and give them a chance. These days? A high school drop out who took a cleaning job (ie: my father) will *stay* a cleaner. No one is going to be like 'hey kid, you work hard, do you want to learn office stuff' and then let them be a supervisor and then say 'do you want to learn some management stuff' and then progress to middle management.  

This is not how it happens anymore, Dad. 

**My father is incapable of comprehending that he would need a Bachelors at *minimum* to get just an interview for his current job......but in reality, he would most likely also require a Masters/MBA *and* internships to get an interview for his job**.  

Yet he ended up in a decent job that he got by starting out as a cleaner. He seems to think this somehow makes him a harder worker and better person than me, rather than it being a sign of changing times. 

He doesn't seem to comprehend it is no longer possible to go pick up a job somewhere as a cleaner, show them you're smart and are happy to work hard and get given the opportunity to learn and work up. He doesn't get that he'd need a degree to be considered for his job. He doesn't get that cleaners *stay* cleaners these days.

And I don't want to sound like one of those people who thinks education makes someone better, bu it is really hard to swallow that I am someone who has a degree and a masters and will probably not have the same quality of life that my parents were able to have when neither of them completed a high school diploma, just because the world sucks now.

I find myself working for an actual company not what I envisioned. For me, the culture just does not click for me. I am not talking about specific company culture, but just working in industry itself. 

I've worked in several industries in various positions and I find that the culture across the board in accounting/finance just lacks motivation ""to be more."" People are just assigned work and they spit it out. There's no energy in the environment and it's just, come to work, here's a project/assignment, do it, leave. 

I only interned in public for 1 year (there was a regional firm that hired students full-time year round). During that time, despite the hours, I enjoyed work even though the grind of tax itself was pretty boring. I can't seem to explain why I enjoyed it. This firm gave interns equal responsibility to their staff after 6 months, so I wasn't just riding the intern koolaid train. I interened at another firm before that as well and the experience was comparable.

It's not even about age either, I work with some younger people here as well. Part of me misses the client aspect of the business, I felt I was working more for the client than my specific firm. 

Additionally, things like being innovative/creative were valued but not so much in industry. People above you actually get very defensive when you suggest an improvement. This is what makes me the most upset because I've been rated a high-performer at my current position. But me reaching my potential is severely hindered when people around you don't want to improve as well. 

Originally I picked this position because my mom unexpectedly left and my sister was still under 18 so I had to take care of her. Public wasn't an option at that point. I saved money up and put her through college this year. She can finally be independent. I never did my cpa or finished my 150. So now that I am free of responsibilities, I wanted to reassess my career because it's clearly not satisfying. I want my motivation to help a company be valued.. not be shot down. I am wondering if I am being insane for thinking like this. My friend suggested I try to get a consulting position since my resume is actually decent. I'm about 24 now/male, paid off all my debt, no relationships holding me down/willing to move.. I am just looking for advice on what are some possible positions to attempt to get? I don't care if these said positions are competitive to attain, I just want some help with direction since I don't have anyone to go to. I'm looking for a challenging environment where innovation can be valued as general/cliche as that sounds..

The program we work in requires Windows 7 (Win 10 support coming soon), and a very specific system configuration. We usually only work with people who have this particular system, but we're thinking of experimenting with placing a whole virtual machine on an external drive, and sending it to some of our editors - either so they don't have to reconfigure their own machine, or in the case that they don't have a Windows computer.

So I have two questions:

Could they run the VM, and the medium-heavy processor intensive editing program directly from a USB3 drive?

Whether the answer to question 1 is yes or no, what would be the licensing necessities? We'd like to make the process as streamlined and non-invasive as possible. Ideally the editor would receive a drive from us, open a VM on the drive and start working without having to install a program or enter a license key. Of course we would purchase any necessary licenses, but what are the considerations when transferring a VM?

6ad74z,27,2017-05-10,Red Pillers are entitled to have private lives and to serve in political office regardless of private positions they take at r/theredpill.,LewisCross,PurplePillDebate,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/6ad74z/red_pillers_are_entitled_to_have_private_lives/,"Everyone criticizing Robert Fisher, the former pk_atheist, is a hypocrite. 

No less a figure than Bill Clinton, the Blues' God-Emperor For Life Himself, condescendingly lectured us that ""Even Presidents have private lives"".  This after he was outed and exposed (heh) for 

--having an affair with a  White House intern

--Getting BJs from that White House intern in the side room off the Oval Office and inserting cigars into said intern's vagina

--Having that private affair with a non-security cleared woman in secure areas of the White House, when said woman lacked the security clearance to be in those areas alone with the leader of the free world, thus exposing himself to potential blackmail and physical harm

--taking insanely stupid risks for some pussy when he should have been doing the business of the country

--Committing perjury by lying about all of it under oath, both as a lawyer and as the highest elected official in the country


The clear argument Clinton gave us was that any criticism of him for having an extramarital affair and lying about it was clearly out of bounds.  And most of the media accepted this hook, line and sinker.  Because he was a good Democrat liberal, you see, and he was on their side.  So Bill Clinton could have affairs, sexually harass women and even allegedly sexually assault women (Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones) and then lie about it, and it was all good.

The way I see it, if BJ Clinton could do all that and get away with it, you Blues have absolutely NO cause whatsoever to criticize Fisher for anything he says or does.   He's got an absolute right to do it; since Clinton did all that AND WORSE.   ""Misogyny""?   I'd say using a White House intern as a human humidor qualifies.  I'd say ruining a young girl's entire life qualifies.  I'd say destroying Linda Tripp qualifies.   Acting like a first class jerk?   I'd say all of the above qualifies.   Scumbaggery?   I'd say lying under oath about your official activities and the intersection of those official activities with your private life qualifies.  

But we were told that, no, none of this is fair game.  Blues, Democrats, liberals and the rest of the liberal chattering class told us that none of this has anything to do with the President's ability to do his job and otherwise be a productive, contributing member of society.   
 
Same with President Trump.  If BJ Clinton can get oral sex in the Oval Office, then President Trump can say ""grab 'em by the pussy"".  He didn't say he ACTUALLY DID ""grab 'em by the pussy""; he was just TALKING ABOUT it.   

And that's all Robert Fisher did.   Talk.   Write.   

If it's OK for Presidents to ACTUALLY DO this; why is it not OK for small time statehouse politicians to JUST TALK about it?  If ""Even Presidents have private lives"", then can we not also say that ""Even Red Pillers have private lives"" and ""Even Red Pillers elected to statehouses have private lives""?   

Anyone criticizing Fisher is a hypocrite.  

Discuss/debate, and challenge my view.

I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships. Read On!
1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. 2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature 4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.
Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."

My questions: 

- What can I expect the impact of a debt settlement to be on my credit report?  (Flawless record to date, 746 score, 21 y/o).
- Is it worth it to struggle as much as possible to avoid settling the debt?
- Are there other negative effects of settling a debt besides credit score impact?

Details:  

I'm a self-supporting student in college responsible for all of my living and educational expenses.  I balance transferred about $5k onto a Chase Slate so I could chip away at it over the year+ interest free period, but I'm now up to about $7k in debt.  Interest free runs until January 2018 on the card.  My plan was to make as much headway as possible with earnings from my summer internship.

This past week, I've found out I owe the IRS $2,600 for emptying a Janus fund to cover part of my tuition (statements went to my father, I didn't realize to declare as income).

I also found out that my insurance is denying coverage of my recent oral surgery to the tune of about $1,500.

I owe $1,000 for summer class tuition, and rent+utilities is $700/mo.

Without even factoring in food, I'm looking at about $7,000 in expenses and at most ~$8000 in take home pay.  This will put me in September, at roughly breakeven, with a looming $7,000 credit card debt.

Given the medical bill, audit, low wages, and personal circumstances, would I be able to settle this debt with Chase and take the credit report hit?

Would I need to wait until I start defaulting on payments to be considered eligible to settle?

I'm hoping to take the hit, recovery financially, and rebuild my credit quickly over the following year before graduation.  Is this a dumb idea?

Don't hold back, I want honest feedback.  I thank everybody in advance for any personal experiences or knowledge you're able to share.  I greatly appreciate it.


EDIT: I found a chart from FICO that indicates a 680 score loses 45 to 65 points, and a 780 score loses 105 to 125 points *ballpark estimate* due to settlement.  I'm assuming I'd land around 650 points.  With a year left still in school and no need for a major loan (car is a year old, will be renting for at least 5 years as I'll likely have to relocate 1-3 times), are there other reasons I'm not considering that a 650 score would not be worth savings of $3,500-$5,000 and getting control of my finances within the next 3 months?

# Title

&gt; [REQ] $1000 for relocation. Will repay $1250 on or before January 30

# Post contents

---

I'm sorry in advance if this is a jumbled mess of information but I will format the best I can. I posted a request a couple of days ago but I have sense figured out a way to drop the cost.

I am located in Lexington KY and need help with moving costs. I am a Computer Science/Mathematics student at the University of Kentucky and just landed an internship in Atlanta GA for the spring semester. Instead of searching for an apartment first I am going to do AirBnB and stay for two weeks until I get my school financial aid. This will run me about $800 instead of $2200 for a deposit and first months rent on an apartment. I also have to pay ~$150 for a rental car to get to the new city. I have money to make it in Lexington but my budget does not cover an entire new place in a city (with higher cost of living).

I will receive financial aid through the university in the amount of $13,000, which will be dispersed to me in a few smaller payments throughout the month of January. The internship pays $4150 a month as well, so I will have no problem paying the money back. The entire situation is just bad timing, as I will have plenty of money about a month after I need it. I am able to provide any proof that is requested. As stated in the title I need $1000 and can pay back $1250, I am willing to negotiate on that as well (as I don't have another option). It is highly possible that I will repay on the 15th of January but I am saying the 30th to be safe. Let me know if I am missing any information and thank you for reading.

6aevf4,150,2017-05-10,"The BNHA story structure, and what it means for Mirio",AveMachina,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/6aevf4/the_bnha_story_structure_and_what_it_means_for/,"The ending of chapter 135 really drove it home for me how Mirio and Deku are too similar, to the point that they'll jump up at the same time to say the same thing about Eri. The response floating around is that Mirio is too good to be true, and that he's gotta die or something.

Not to mention, Mirio is like objectively a better choice for the successor of OFA - he's morally almost the same as Deku, but he's older and more experienced, he doesn't have Deku's injuries, he's already got a super overpowered quirk, and his quirk requires him to fight unarmed at all times, so it synergizes perfectly with OFA. As it stands, it really wouldn't make any sense for Deku not to pass OFA on to Mirio.

I expect that's the crux of this arc - the way other arcs address other deconstructions of the superhero genre, like how Stain looks at gritty 90s superheroes and revenge stories, and how the first arc deals with superheroes acting in their own self-interest, the internship arc is dealing with the idea of how a hero should deal with somebody else being more worthy, given the value of self-sacrifice.

In All Might and Nighteye's flashback, Nighteye foresees AM's death and advises him against continuing to be a hero, but AM presses on against Nighteye's better judgment - because that's what a hero would do, perhaps. It's the spirit of self-sacrifice. He'll risk his life and be a hero to the end. But that same impulsive, illogical way of acting leads him to pick Deku instead of Mirio, and he says as much. 

So then, how should Deku act in this situation? Shouldn't the spirit of self-sacrifice dictate that he should pass on his powers to someone more worthy than him? Isn't that what a hero would do? 

Like, if Spider-man went back in time, and he could make the radioactive spider bite somebody better and smarter than him, shouldn’t he be expected to do that? Wouldn’t it be selfish of him not to? Isn’t it wrong to selfishly hold onto your powers, just because you want to have them?

Right now, we don't have a good answer to this. The arc isn’t over, and we'll see where it goes.

But the thing about characters like Mirio is that if you introduce someone who’s [like the protagonist, but better]( http://imgur.com/a/Kjfnp), it doesn’t sit well with readers. It’s all good news for our characters, who have another good guy on their side, but for the readers, there’s two people sharing the spotlight now, and we don’t have any emotional connection to the new guy. It nudges us to care less about our protagonist, because what they’re doing is less special, and the things they want and care about either a) also aren’t special, because this other guy feels the same way, or b) weren’t actually important, because this other guy feels differently. 

So everyone thinks Mirio is gonna die – or alternatively, that he’ll get hit with permanent quirk removal, destroying his quirk factor and making him unable to use Permeation or even OFA if it were passed on to him. Either way, something has to take him out of the equation. 

But neither of those would really address what I think the core issue of this story arc is. If Mirio is more worthy than Deku, and then he gets shot, maybe dies, and can’t be a hero anymore, what does that even prove? ""He wasn’t as worthy as Deku because he got shot""? 

Or if he doesn't pass it on, is the moral that it’s okay for you to be selfish about your powers, because the most important thing is that you want in your heart to be a hero? That's pretty self-serving for a moral about selfishiness, isn't it?

It seems to me that to resolve this dilemma, what needs to happen is for Deku to upstage Mirio somehow. Mirio proves that he's not willing to lose his quirk forever, but Deku is, or something like that. Mirio is somehow proven unworthy, or Deku is proven unexpectedly more worthy. Something shows that All Might’s course of action was justified – *sort of*, because he still is going to die probably – but we ended up with Deku, and Nighteye and Mirio have to begrudgingly respect that.

Maybe it's just how long this arc's been going, but I think merely killing off Mirio would be anticlimactic and wouldn't prove anything. It would tarnish Deku's status as the protagonist of the story."

6ag01c,3,2017-05-10,Drug test in 2 weeks PLS HELP,lolmsh,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6ag01c/drug_test_in_2_weeks_pls_help/,"Hey, so I'm pretty paranoid about this drug test I'm going to have in like 2 weeks at least (starting on May 4th; last time i smoked weed). 
Story: I got an internship at HR in an inv bank. Long story short, I didn't think they would drug test me because I thought I wasn't going to be paid for it. 

I smoked a less than a half joint and I was hitting my friends vape on May 4th.
Before that I smoke at least once a week, but not that much where I'm tripping. Just a nice buzz; mostly just a vape.
I take random breaks in of not smoking, but I didn't smoke for 2 weeks in the beginning of April. And then started doing it once a week again.
I'm 5'2, 120 pounds approximately sometimes less. 
I'm no longer smoking and eating non junky food. I live in San Francisco, so I'm constantly moving and walking around.

Just wanna know if it'll be detectable or out of my system by the time of my drug test (May 23rd)  

Hope I don't sound too dumb for asking......."

 So my question is wether or not I should take a job in the Augusta, ME area. I'm about to graduate in a few weeks and this is the only job offer I have at the moment. I accepted the offer a month ago but now I am having second thoughts. To start, it's in an area I don't have much expertise in (though I will be going through training, and the employer knows my experience level-based on interviews). This is not a huge concern for me, though I'm a bit worried about finding the work too difficult (it's java dev). Further, the pay is not amazing though it is a job and those are hard to come by these days, it seems. This is definitely a pro for me, because even if its not a great paying job, it will help me remain independent and not rely on my parents. 

However, another downside is the location. I don't know much about Maine, except that it's full of small towns and such. I'm not totally against that, but being 21, I'd love to be near a city at least. I personally love nature and would be down for exploring the state, especially the coast. Snow isn't an issue for me either as I've been in the New England area my whole life. 


However, my girlfriend is an international student so finding a job in a small town in Maine, that will also sponsor her work visa, doesn't seem likely.
So my options currently are to 1) take the job in Maine, experience it for 1-2 years and leverage my new work experience to land a better job in a more-preferred city.
2) Reject the job, move back in with my parents and get back into the job hunt.
3) Stay with my girlfriend in whatever city she lands a job in (if she does-though she has a summer internship on the west coast that starts in July), and search for jobs there.


I hope I've explained my situation well enough, though feel free to ask for any clarification or anything like that. I'm definitely at a point where getting a neutral perspective on this would be great, and maybe even some tough love, because time's running out!

Thanks!"

I'm a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student and I'll likely be looking for full-time jobs in the Fall. Sticking with a B.S. for now but may come back down the line for an advanced degree.

I've generally worked on software or IoT in terms of industry experience (will be returning to Facebook for another internship this summer doing software/production eng. work, some analytics). 

Anyway, I've been doing a fair amount of machine learning lately and am getting pretty passionate about it. I've taken some classes, I'm leading a team on a video recognition project (CNN, LSTMs to classify short videos) and I've done some Kaggle competitions. 

Anyway, I have this summer to keep learning about data science and might take on a side project, as well as ask about side projects at work. 

What kind of things would be good to work on to build knowledge for interviews and a portfolio? Looking to apply to the Google Brain residency for example. 

Also, it seems tech companies are creating opportunities to join ML teams internally, such as FB, so would it make sense to stay in a software job and try to transition internally if I find myself getting more excited about it? 

tl;dr have three months, what should I learn (I've read Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, ...), what projects would be interesting, what companies or opportunities do you know of? 

Thanks!

# Title

&gt; [REQ] $2500 repaying $3000 on 1/31/2016

# Post contents

---

I'm sorry in advance if this is a jumbled mess of information but I will format the best I can. 

I am located in Lexington KY and need help with moving costs. I am a Computer Science/Mathematics student at the University of Kentucky and just landed an internship in Atlanta GA for the spring semester. I have been applying for studios in Atlanta and got approved for one finally, the upfront costs being $2231. I also have to pay ~$150 for a rental car to get to the new city and a deposit for electric and renters insurance for which I don't know the price. I have money to make it in Lexington but my budget does not cover an entire new place in a city (with higher cost of living).

I will receive financial aid through the university in the amount of $13,000, which will be dispersed to me in a few smaller payments throughout the month of January. The internship pays $4150 a month as well, so I will have no problem paying the money back. The entire situation is just bad timing, as I will have plenty of money about a month after I need it. I am able to provide any proof that is requested. As stated in the title I need $2500 and can pay back $3000, I am willing to negotiate on that as well (as I don't have another option). Let me know if I am missing any information please and thank you for reading.

6ajk55,1,2017-05-11,Rent advice for Dublin (I'm sorry),mkydota2,Dublin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dublin/comments/6ajk55/rent_advice_for_dublin_im_sorry/,"Hey guys,

I'll be coming to Dublin for an internship mid June. You all know about the rent situation and I got an offer I am unsure to take. It's a shared room (one other guy and me) in a 5 person apartment with 1 bathroom. The apartment/flat is very simply furnished. It is from an agency who help to find international students accommodation, so I would have to pay some(or all) money in advance. It costs 592€/month and it's only a 10 min walk from my internship place. The problem is I do not get to know the other tenants beforehand and I am afraid they're just partying etc. so that I won't be fit for my full-time work placement. 
If I take this offer I would save myself money for the first ~10days hostel &amp; transportation costs (~450€). During that time I was planning to look for a permanent vacancy. 
I am unsure whether this is a really bad offer or a too good one to turn down. I mean, I will have some transportation costs anyway because I wanna get to know the whole city. I did some calculations and don't really care if after the whole 6 months I will come ahead +-300€. I am just unsure whether I'll find another acceptable permanent vacancy in the first 10 days if I turn the offer down. What would you advice? I know about sites like daft/rent.ie and I am in many facebook groups. Should I take the offer or not? If not, do you think 10 days will be enough to find an acceptable permanent vacancy? Should I try to get the student accommodation room for the first 1-2 months only and look for a permanent vacancy during that time? Any, really any advice is highly appreciated. Thanks so much and sorry for asking about the whole renting topic. Have a nice day."

I am a radiology resident and currently in my 2nd year of a 5 year program - I will start my third year this July.  I currently live in a state halfway between ""home"" - where I lived all my life until recently and where my family and friends are - and where my fiancee and baby live.  She is in her 2nd year of training and is about to start her third - out of four years.  We are both hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, due to medical school - so opting out is not a realistic option for either of us.  A local program has suggested that she may be able to transfer from her current program and finish her fourth year there.  


However, in order for me to be able to land a job, I have to finish an extra year of training, in what's known as fellowship, at a currently undisclosed location - I won't figure out where I'm going until the beginning of fourth year.  So if she moves here, she will have to move again and look for another job.  


That's the best case scenario, as the problems don't end there.  The thing is, I started dating my fiancee over a year and a half ago.  She had recently split from a physically and verbally abusive narcissistic husband.  And the child is technically his.  He is irresponsible, and does not care for or care about our child.  His intentions, as stated in the past, are to exert control over my now fiancee in any way possible after their split.


So, we don't know how that affects us moving forward.  We don't know when we can have our own biological children.  We don't know when we can get married.  We don't know when or how we can move due to split physical custody.  And my son, that I've been with throughout this whole time - pregnancy, birth, etc - is growing up without me and is starting to forget who I am.


To make matters worse, I am doing well in residency, but there is an exam we take - that is largely not critically important to the vast majority of programs - that I took lightly.  One bad day out of many has now placed me on remediation - which is a nicer word for probation.  I have been doing well, as I had until this very point, but the threat of being fired and not being able to complete training after undergrad / med school / intern year adds on to all of this.


Additionally, my father was diagnosed with cancer early on this year - right after I made my move away from my fiancee and son.  He the first in our family to experience this, and I am one of 2 physicians in the entire extended family.  So I am relied upon for advice, but often fall short as oncology is its own specialized field - and I am not aware of most of the treatment plans, therapies, etc.

I forgot to add when I first posted this.  Most people that go into medicine are ""called"" to do it.  As in, they've known since they were very young and love the world of medicine.  Some people, like me, see it as a job.  It is great to help others out, but it is not my calling.  I would have rather been a writer or a rock musician - as those are my true callings.  But I knew I wanted a family one day.  In the effort to be responsible and provide for myself and my family, I opted to do something for the sheer reason of being lucky to be able to do it.  Considering the vast majority of people would not undergo the struggles of training and working in medicine - including those that wanted to do it even as children, and inspired to be healers - it goes without saying that that is also incredibly difficult to deal with.  You're expected to perform and learn about a wide array of things that were not taught to you in the slightest in medical school.  And, for the reasons stated previously, I have less and less of a desire to do just that.

In fact, every day I go to work I am more miserable than the last.  And what's worse is that I have no support system here.  All of my resident friends are too busy in their own lives to hang out and relax.  Everyone I've ever cared for is living somewhere else.  And the only reprieve I have from all this mess is seeing my fiancee about every 3-4 weeks, my son about every 2 months, my family about every 3-4 months, and my friends - a once huge part of my support system - once a year or less.


I hate coming to work, I hate my life circumstances, and I feel like I'm drowning.  


I know this is a wall of text.  If you reached this far, God bless you."

'I'm okay sweetie, just having a good time with Nick :)'

Ria's boyfriend was so sweet to check up on her like that, and she wasn't exactly lying, per se. She had just left out the fact that Nick was inside of her right now.

After he came inside her in the coffee shop bathroom, Nick had hoisted her fishnet tights around her waist and smoothed her skirt back into position, ""Good girl,"" he told her, and turned her around for the first time, ""But I'm not done with you yet."" And he wouldn't be for a while.

Ria felt her greedy pussy crave more of his cum, knowing instinctively that she needed more cock. In her regular life she was a hardworking student, her life full of internships and exams and commitments. She dealt with it by becoming a cock-hungry whore several times a week. With a life full of doubts - that she wasn't smart enough, or hardworking enough or committed enough - Ria knew she could find solace in sex.

They'd come back to Nick's - he was older than her, worked for some sort of bank, and it showed. She was used to living with poor students and, while she professed herself to be a leftist, she always found herself willing to open her legs to raw power.

With the door closed, she knew it was time to get naked. Off came the tights, the skirt and the top, leaving her bare. She was average height, dark skin with long black hair, and thin. She was weak and delicate, with a fat pussy and tiny tits, and an ass that looked big when she bent over.

Nick was on her before she could say anything, his mouth straight to her nipples like he hadn't been thinking about anything else all day. She led him to his bed, and she tried to unzip his pants when he pushed her down against the covers. He was on top of her, then, mouth on her breasts and hands rubbing her pussy. She knew what he was doing - she loved oral and he wasn't letting her go down on him. No doubt saving it for the right occaision.

Nick's clothes came off, and he entered her again. Her pussy remembered him, and she wrapped her legs around him and pulled him deeper into her. She never felt more at home than with a cock in her, never more at peace than with a man's desire. That's why she loved to torture them. Nick was alright - he could fuck - but the real joy was that he was having her and they weren't. Her boyfriend, the male friends in her life whom she teased constantly. She knew they loved her, but she would rather give her attention to a man like Nick than to them, and they knew it.

That's why she gave Nick everything. Once he was satisfied with her pussy, he pulled out. She knew what to do, of course, and arched her pelvis upward to offer him her asshole. A little lube later, and he entered her there. She only ever let these men do this to her, and her eyes rolled back into her head as Nick worked her ass. She was used, totally and completely used.

Then came the best part. She could feel Nick speeding up his thrusts, telling her that he was getting close. She yelped with pain as he thrust harder and came inside her ass. Without wasting a second, she pulled back and turned around, finally allowed to suck his cock. Her mouth swam with the taste of his cum and her own asshole, and she barely heard Nick murmuring about how much of a good whore she was.

Out of the corner of her eye, Ria saw her phone light up. More texts from her boyfriend. She redoubled her efforts to drain Nick dry. This mouth of hers, the one that was sucking up cum and shit and sweat - it was the same mouth with which she would go home and kiss her boyfriend. He'd smile and thank her and, if he was good, maybe she'd let him eat her pussy before bed."

Slept with intern (aka shat where I eat),gnuredpill,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/6akqx0/damage_control_slept_with_intern_aka_shat_where_i/,"I fucked up and slept with the intern at work. What can I do at this point to mitigate problems and not wreck my career?

She's fresh out of college, 10 years my junior. She's from another country, and  was interning at my company while on a temporary visa. We would flirt, but I always followed the ""don't shit where you eat"" rule. 

She is being transferred to a branch in her home country, so we went out for a farewell drink after work on her last day. That turned into a lot of drinks, one thing led to another, and in my drunken weakness I went for it. 

I'm very concerned about what will happen to my professional reputation if this gets out. 

I can't undo my stupidity, but to others out there in the same position: can confirm that it's definitely NOT worth sleeping with a co-worker. Don't do it. 

Good news: she said she wants to keep this a secret. She leaves to her home country tomorrow. Company stopped visa sponsorship so highly unlikely she will return. My workplace is young and not very conservative. 

Bad news: despite being in another country, she will still talk to people at work here regularly. She's a crazy person. Lots of red flags. Ex: she dropped an L-bomb mid-coitus. 

We texted a bunch the morning after. Trying to keep positive vibes so she doesn't feel any regret.
 
Is there anything I can I do help to keep this quiet?

My first exposure to CS was in college, and I took CS101 and CS201 (our Data Structures &amp; Algorithms class) during my freshman year. My excitement for coding has not withered at all, and CS is the first subject I've encountered that has motivated me to learn more about outside of the classroom environment, so I feel very set on continuing with CS as of now. 
A lot of CS students at my school tend to get their first internships the summer after their sophomore year. I know that summer internship season gains momentum in the fall/winter before, so I was hoping to get advice on whether it'd be worthwhile to apply for more ""prestigious"" internships (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc.), even though my only extensive experience with CS has come through my Data Algorithms class? I performed well in the class and have taken on small side projects, but I still feel doubtful of my abilities/standing in comparison to others my age who started coding in HS. 
How did all of you go about deciding where to begin your internship hunt? Is ""aiming too high"" a real concern in internship searching? 
Any and all advice would be fantastic. Thank you so much in advance!"

I was a medical transcriptionist for many years...the last time in 2006. Now I'm in college and doing an internship for a local museum.  They have hours of interviews with local residents that they'd like to have transcribed, and they aren't making much progress because they are holding their Zoom audio recorder, playing a few lines, then setting it down to type., etc.  I know if I had a foot pedal and headset like the old days I could knock this out very quickly for them (and potentially impress then, resulting in a paid job).

The Zoom audio recorder allows me to transfer the files to my laptop, but then what?  I just want to type these interviews into Word, that's it.  Do I buy a pedal and headset that are compatible with digital files and it will work with a) an application I already have on my Mac, or b) an application I can download for little to cost?

Again, this is a finite project and we won't be outsourcing this to anyone; we're on a budget here.  I know I still have the old school transcription chops and would like to knock this project out and get it finished for them.  Am doing this for college credit, not money.  Any help you all could provide would be very, very appreciated.  

Thanks!"
6alhwy,3,2017-05-11,Using entry level Quality Assurance jobs to break into CS and I.T. jobs careers.,TechStudent007,cscareerchangers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerchangers/comments/6alhwy/using_entry_level_quality_assurance_jobs_to_break/,"Hello Friends~

So many of you came here to this sub because you were considering a career in I.T. and wondering how to go about it. 
Well I thought I would briefly share my story of how QA helped me break into CS/IT. Right out of high school I started working in a blue collar technical trade and did that for 10 years. I had a bad accident at work one day and was now semi-disabled and had to find a new ""deskjob"". I had no bachelor's degree and had no idea what to do with my life, but about 10 minutes from my house one of the ""Big 4"" was hiring both basic gametesters and basic software testers- with no experience needed.*

I started up on that just to have something to do while I figured out my life. I was playing games for a living which was pretty fun but admittedly the pay and prestige was low. However, writing these bug reports and sending them to various professionals of widely varying specialities made me learn a little bit about *everything* (programming, audio, networking, art, technical art, software development management) in the IT world. It helped me to discover which of those things interested me, which I later pursued successfully. 

So in summary a few years ( no more, no less) of software QA or professional gametesting can be an excellent way to get your foot in the door, learn about different specialties, and also get some real experience on your resume at a software developer! 

With this approach however, there are a few caveats and pitfalls. For one expect low pay and respect, which is annoying but understand you walked in the door with zero skills and just the shirt on your back. It's good to stick it out at one company so you have about 2 solid years of full time work on your resume and basically make Tester-2/Gametester-2 rank. That separates you from the guy with a single 90 day test contract under his belt, plus if you can stay at one place for a whole year or two that looks better on your resume than hopping around.  But then after that 2 or 3 years you *really* want to go to programming bootcamp, start self study, or start a 2/4 year degree to move onto higher skilled work- whatever it may be. I've seen lots of folks hang out in dead end QA jobs for 5 or 10 years and it's primarily a trap. Yes its tempting to hang in there and try to make Lead but frankly $5 an hour more is bullshit- you want to be making $40 an hour more as a developer or project manager, trust me. Finally, one caveat is that if you go into the gametesting route you risk getting pigeonholed and stuck in gamesland. Anyways, there are *many* various pathways to making a career change midlife into CS/IT. This is how I used QA to break in to the industry, and you can too!

**TL; DR: Gametest or software test for 2 years full time, go to 90 day programming bootcamp in your skill/language of choice OR get a 2 year college degree in networking, then get Microsoft Certified and then start looking for an internship as a programmer, web developer, or network admin.**

*These days it will help A LOT to have this [basic certification in software test](http://www.istqb.org/) to help you land that very first QA job.

6am3de,1,2017-05-11,M4F Perverted Parents and More,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6am3de/m4f_perverted_parents_and_more/,"Hello! I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships. Read On! 

1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. 
2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 
3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature 
4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 

Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."
6am68z,4,2017-05-11,"I hate being poor, I feel like it is ruining my life",lickmewhereIshit,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6am68z/i_hate_being_poor_i_feel_like_it_is_ruining_my/,"I am a 21 year old female college student pursuing a degree in education. I've always felt like I have a bright future, my marks are always in the high 80's-90's and I had a steady job and student loans to support me. I ate a healthy diet and was able to do the things I love.

However, it all went to shit when classes ended. I work on campus and recently got my hours unexpectedly cut drastically for the summer because they decided to hire new full-time people and managers and they took all the hours. Now that I am not getting student loans and that my hours are cut, I am finding myself being extremely poor.

I have already applied to over 30 places, from research jobs to cleaning jobs. Any interview I have gotten, I have failed to get the job even though the interview went great. I do not have a vehicle so that limits my options of where I can apply, as so many summer student jobs require travel. I live in a big city and can't afford a bus pass, so I need to rely on my feet or my bike to take me where I need to go. I want to get a good job so that I can get a car to get a better job, but all the good jobs require one to have a car! It's so fucking exhausting!

So basically, I have only pocket change to keep me going for the rest of the summer. I can't go out for drinks with friends, make my boyfriend dinner, or eat healthy like I used to. As a result, my social life has dwindled, especially since I lack the transportation to get anywhere. My diet used to consist of fresh fruit and spinach smoothies, fresh salads, and fish and vegetables. Now I have been grocery shopping at the dollar store, and have been living off of stale cereal, canned ravioli and ramen. This is food that I would not have touched with a 10 foot pole before this situation was sprung on me. I have been gaining weight due to this, even though I have been trying to run and bike as much as possible to even things out.

I can't go out for dinner with my boyfriend anymore, go out for ice-cream with him, or even cook him a meal at home like I used to. As a result, we only really now hang out in the evening because I want to make sure he's eaten supper before coming to my place (he lives with his parents so we always spend time at my place). He's been very supportive through all of this which I appreciate, but I loathe myself for not being able to be the supportive, stable girlfriend I used to be. 

Not to mention, I wake up every morning feeling depressed and exhausted. I feel passionless in the things I do, even though I have all the free time to do it. I apply for new jobs and have been trying to sell my possessions almost everyday. I also try to spend my free time drawing, exercising, playing video games or watching anime. However, I find my interest in the things I love has begun to dwindle, and I find myself wishing I was at work or making money instead. This situation has taken the joy out of the leisure activities that I used to love. I find I have less energy and I feel generally upset and sad most of the day. 

I feel like I am stuck in a fucking rut! I have been trying so hard to apply to places, but there is so much competition for jobs right now as everybody needs a job for summer. Every interview I had I have felt like I have done amazing, but I always get a rejection call. Oh, and I forgot to mention that my degree requires me to complete a full-time unpaid internship for the fall term. As a result, I absolutely MUST save up the money for a car to take me to the internship, as well as money for rent and food since I am not allowed to work during the internship. But I can't even fucking afford to feed myself, let alone save up money!!!

Not to mention, the people around me all seem to be successful. So many of my colleagues and friends have landed amazing research and summer jobs that I would have died to have. They are always talking about how busy they are, how excited they are to save up money and buy shit, and I am sitting here in a cesspool of depression and poverty struggling to climb out of this pit I have fallen into. I know that life isn't fair, but goddamn ... I was always raised with the discourse that ""if you work hard, success will come your way."" However, it has been the complete opposite for me so far.

Anyways, if you read this thanks. I know I just gotta keep on trying, but my hope is starting to dwindle more and more each day ... 

tl;dr - fairly successful college student suddenly thrust into poverty, working hard to get a new job but has had no success, being overwhelmed by depression and feels passionless about life "
6amh8o,1,2017-05-11,Me [26M] not sure what to do about my girlfriend[27M] - visa is due to expire soon &amp; we discussed marriage,throwaway_627_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6amh8o/me_26m_not_sure_what_to_do_about_my_girlfriend27m/,"Hi all,


I am looking for some advice. I basically moved to the US to do an internship for a year. A year before this, I came to this particular city to visit &amp; it was during that trip that I decided that I'd like to move out here. I came alone on that trip &amp; ended up speaking with a girl on Reddit &amp; we planned to meet up when I came. We did, and she was great &amp; we carried on speaking a lot in between my trip &amp; me moving here for an internship. Please note, I had decided that I'd like to try and move here before I really bonded with her.


We began a relationship very shortly after me coming here, and eventually we discussed getting married as we (probably) wouldn't want to break up by the time it was time for me to leave &amp; only through marriage would we really be able to stay together. Unfortunately, the only way for us to stay in one another's country would be through a marriage visa. I know these aren't ideal circumstances and that it has been quite rushed.


I want to point out that I never in the past, until this, really imagined myself to get married &amp; don't even particularly agree with it - so, I reasoned with myself that I could only imagine myself getting married if it were for a reason like this - and here we have it, the opportunity actually came along. I also want to point out that this is my first proper relationship, and I don't feel as though an opportunity like this will come along again.


My internship is drawing to a close and the time for me to decide by is kinda getting closer. I would consider long distance (as even if we were married, this will probably be inevitable at some point), but if I were to leave her now &amp; go back home, then I don't think we'd get another opportunity to spend enough time together to work towards marriage - probably only a week or two at a time for the foreseeable future.


We have also experienced a few setbacks in our relationship recently which have made me a bit hesitant and a few things that I've scratched my head over in trying to ascertain whether they are red flags or not:


* She is quite a jealous person, she is funny with me talking to other girls (including female friends that I've had since before I even knew her). I am soon going to a festival back home, and she saw that I had been talking to a female friend from back home who was considering coming (there is a large group of us going, many of whom she has met, so it's not as if it'd just be me and this girl). She ended up getting very drunk and then bringing it up, and even said she wanted to break up over it, but took this back the next day - this made me very concerned, has been a major setback &amp; made me really think about what I was getting myself into. I understand why she may be feeling insecure about this, but I felt it was the wrong way to go about it. Also, I had planned to go to this festival before we were going out.


* My family recently visited and behind the scenes caused a bit of a scene, accusing my brother of saying something about her that he didn't say (no one else, including my mother who he supposedly said it to, heard it), and she argued with me almost every time I'd returned to her house after spending the day with my family - including the day that they'd left, and I was left feeling extremely isolated and homesick.


* She only has 1 female friend, the rest are all male (yet she doesn't like me having female friends)


* She has had a lot of boyfriends in the past, and as far as I can tell, hasn't gone consistently for very long being single.


So at the moment I feel kinda stuck. I know am not ready to break up with her, which I feel may happen if I went home, but not sure if I'm ready for marriage yet either. I don't want to really have to force myself to do either just yet so am just looking for advice. I want to point out that other than what I have mentioned above, our relationship is pretty strong and I enjoy it.

**TL;DR**: Unsure about whether I should marry my girlfriend before my visa expires, as I'm not sure if a long distance relationship would work, as we would never really get much time together to work forward with a marriage

6ammc4,7,2017-05-11,Me [22 M] with my Fiance [22 F] of two and a half years.,Throwaway87283921,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ammc4/me_22_m_with_my_fiance_22_f_of_two_and_a_half/,"So I've never posted on here before, but have a big question.

My Fiance and I started dating 2 and a half years ago.  We met in a University Engineering group and she was dating somebody, but by the end of the semester they had split (he got drunk and just left her somewhere being the final straw).  Well I was already very interested in her, but hadn't pursued, because of the boyfriend, and so we started dating not to long after.

The relationship started off really well.  We were both stoners, and enjoyed drinking.  We would get high, and cook amazing food, learning more about each other.  We are both very driven, so we would talk about the big dreams we had to travel the world and what not.  For the next year things mostly went really well. 

Our first major road block was when my roommate decided he was going to grow cannabis.  My roommate wasn't the brightest person, and I wasn't 100% against what he said.  I ended up getting involved, and it tanked my finances.  At this point we begin having fights essentially about me being a loser.  I was a loser at that time, and new it, but I also new my potential.

These fights were fair, and over the next year and a half I have changed.  I got a very good Internship, lost weight, read self help books, learned better hygiene etc..  These changes were gradual at first, and now they are more extreme.  I didn't immediately fix the finance problem though.  This caused a big fight this past December on my birthday due to her helping me with unplanned cost.  She told me something along the lines of her not loving me anymore.  I was torn apart, and felt so disrespected, that I basically just cried and started packing.  She started crying and apologizing, and we mad up.  I have continued changing and I am now 3 months sober from drinking, financially stable, and training for a half Ironman.  

These changes have come at large sacrifices though.  I have learned an entire friend group was really just drinking buddies for example.  This has  resulted in me not having much of a social life to speak of this past semester.  This has been hard on my Fiance, as she wants to go out more.  I have gotten us concert tickets and things, but most of our ""going out"" was just going to drink somewhere.  This has been difficult because it's not as much fun if there is nothing to do but drink.  She  has then gotten upset with my sobriety, telling me that she only supported it because she didn't think I can do it.

Well she just got back from a 5 day trip, and within 5 minutes was fussing over something small.  She later told me again that she no longer loves me, but is in love with me.  She thinks that we might just be a really good team.  This has left me absolutely lost.  It is very difficult to continue fighting for somebody that already told you that they don't love you.  The thing is, I love her.  I see the bad times we have had, but that still doesn't stop just how much I care for her.  She still seems to want to make it work, but honestly neither of us even know the first steps to make that happen.  The thing is she has done this before though.  She did this last December, and a few less memorable time before and after, but it seemed like we always bounced back.  This time I really don't know what to do.  I feel that the right thing to do to keep her is throw on some dancing shoes and trying to take her out more, but that isn't really me.  The main way we socialized before was with alcohol.  She hasn't started working out with me, or socializing the way I now enjoy, and this has left me clueless.  I wasn't an alchoholic when I quit drinking, so part of me wants to start again just to make things work.  I guess what I'm trying to get at is what should I do?  Is there still a chance of ""happily ever after""?
  ---   
  tl;dr: Fiance no longer loves me, what to do?"

The internship starts a little less than a month from now.


However, I've realized that I really don't want to spend the rest of the summer presenting male (or really any time ever presenting male) and am debating just coming out to my boss in that town and starting work there presenting female.


The only thing is that it's a small town with little-to-no public LGBT presence and I'm mildly worried about my safety and my job. I've gotten along relatively well with my employer thus far and I've secured housing (with first and last months paid) but this has all been done as a ""guy"". I'm worried that coming out could cause my employer and/or landlord to discriminate against me. In my province gender identity is covered under discrimination laws but they might just not care. Moreover, my apartment is a basement unit so if my landlord hates me she could just stomp around all night and all day and I would have little legal recourse.


Also of course the whole stigma of small towns and their conservative leanings makes me mildly concerned about the treatment I might get.


Has anyone here been in a similar situation? How did you manage it? "

I am in my first gap year and would like to change universities/locations. I've had a part-time healthcare position with limited direct patient contact and a 6-month volunteer scribe intern position at a free, low-cost, and primarily latino/refugee healthcare clinic. I minored in Spanish in undergrad and would like to continue using it - the MBS program offers an elective medical Spanish course.

My cGPA from AACOMAS calculations was 3.30 and sGPA was 3.21. MCAT was a 500 with 123 C/P, 127 CARS, 124 B/B, and 126 P/S.

What might be my best course of action? Does it make sense to retake classes at a 4-year university (I know AACOMAS changed their retake calculations)? Should I take the spot at the MBS program? I assume I'll be retaking the MCAT regardless. Should I be applying again right now or should I wait to reapply after completing more schooling?

Long time lurker. I am currently an accounting intern for a private corporation and have been for the past ~9 months. I've worked 24-ish hours while in school and also did 40 hours post-graduation. Now that I am in graduate school (MS in Taxation), I am currently doing 30-35 hours w/ 2 online classes.

Recently, I've been testing the waters to see what opportunities are available. I came across a really interesting tax internship that is in the summer (9-weeks) that begins sometime in June. The opportunity allows for some commute (company car?) where I go to clients and gather tax documentation or whatever responsibilities relating to audit refunds etc). 

My question is what should I do? Since summer is coming up, I can possibly let my boss know that I am looking to lower my hours right now back to 24 when I started (to possibly accommodate this summer internship for 9-weeks OR just tell them I am taking an additional summer class) and then continue back up to 30-35 hours once the 2nd internship is over. Thoughts? 

I am hesitant to quit my current internship as I am learning a lot and do what I do really well. I have a good relationship with my boss(es).
Also, this internship is only 9 weeks. I only have 2 months worth of emergency expenses and I will need money--I fear that I will not be able to find another internship on time. 

Thanks!"

Ive been living in Germany since January 2016, came to Frankfurt for an internship and have been living in a town outside of Frankfurt, in a WG. Now since February I have a job in Frankfurt and am looking for an apartment (preferably a 1 room apartment, I would like to try living alone, even though my experience in the Wg was awesome).

I knew finding an apartment in Frankfurt was hard. had no idea HOW hard.

I must have replied to 200 ads by now, and got 4 responses for Besichtigungstermin (and yes I write the messages in german)

from those, 2 were for termins during the week at times like 10AM and 12. I work full-time. Had to decline.
 
The other 2 were perfect for me. PERFECT location to access my work, very small but I actually prefer a small place... They were scheduled for this weekend. Today, both messaged me saying the wohnung already has a new tenant. Both cancelled. Back to zero.

So, Im desperate over here - is there something Im missing??? Ive tried ebay, immoscout, wggesucht and facebook... anything else? Should I be bribing people offering to pay extra? Any advice please?"

I was fortunate enough to get my undergrad degree on scholarship and accumulate no debt. Being a PhD student I also don't pay tuition and draw a (very) small paycheck that is W-2 taxable. I've been fortunate enough that my parents have given me a few inheritance checks over the past few years from the passing of my grandfather and my great uncle. That combined with an influx of cash from an internship this summer has put me in a position where I'm unsure on the best way to utilize the extra money.

I've read through the flowchart and the wiki, so I understand my options, but my circumstances make it unclear to me what the best route is.

Summer income: ~$4610.56/month net (unsure on the exact amount as the internship is out of state, this will be for 12 weeks)

Dates with SO - ~$100

I know I could reign in some of my spending, my SO and I don't have to go out as much as we do, especially since we only see each other on weekends, but I'm fairly comfortable with my budget being what it is in an expensive college town.

The issue is my savings and other considerations.

Current totals:

Checking - ~$3500 in Wells Fargo

Savings (non-Emergency) - ~$10000 in Ally

Emergency Fund - $6500 in Ally

Roth IRA - $5500 in Schwab (Just set this up and fully funded for the year)

Credit accounts - Two cards, one with Wells, one with Citi with a combined limit of $9000. Credit score between 720 and 760 depending on where I look.

I have a comfortable emergency fund, I've fully funded my IRA for the year, and I have $10000 sitting in an Ally Savings account. Over the summer I'm estimating that I'll be able to save another $7500 or so. Having $15000-$17500 sitting in savings seems rather silly to me. I have a car that is running well but is a 2006 Mazda 3 with ~160,000 miles on it. I'm looking to drive this until graduation at the least until I can shoulder a car payment. I'm not intending to immediately take on a car payment, I'm willing to drive it into the ground, but I also see getting off of an ICE vehicle and to at least a plug-in hybrid if not an electric car as a personal priority. I don't intend to buy a home for at least 7 years.

My question boils down to this. My current income is abysmal and will be until I graduate in about 2 years. However, after that I should hopefully be making more money than even this summer, hopefully in the $80-100k range (summer salary translates to about $72k gross). I don't intend to stay in academia. This makes me feel like the money is a bit of a cushion, but I'll be able to save much more in just a few years, which puts it into a weird spot. So I have a few options with this large chunk of money (that I still intend to continue to save into) that will be sitting in my savings. If I have other options, please let me know.

1. Let it sit as is, possibly deposit the vast majority of it into CDs or I-bonds. This way I can use it as a down payment on a car or other big ticket item when necessary.

2. Invest maybe $5000-$10000 of it into a taxable brokerage account targeting retirement. That way I can try to catch up on the lost years of shitty income from pursuing a PhD. I know that time is extremely important in investments, but I also know that I'll be able to save much more in just a few years so this one seems like a good idea but maybe sinking money where it isn't necessary.

3. Let it sit and use it as a way to fully fund my Roth IRA every time it's available. This essentially means that for the 2018 and 2019 years I'll be using $11000 total of this savings to put into the account. I have no 401(k) available to me to contribute to.

I feel like a combination of 1 and 3 are more what I want to do, but I'm not certain. On my standard salary there is no way for me to save enough from my paycheck alone to fully fund an IRA in one year. It also feels like putting as much money as possible into the Roth IRA before my salary jumps makes the most sense in the long term.

I have been incredibly lucky, and being able to ask this question as a graduate student at all is a good feeling. I'm just not far enough along on the personal finance journey to be able to see the best option."

Myself Shivam Patel, Graduate Student at Carleton Uni, Canada starting from this fall intake.
I completed my bachelor in Mechanical Engg and due to my interest in Aero side, now I choose Aerospace specialization for masters.

Here, I am asking for some suggestions regarding any certifications that will help me to get good job or say internship.

Sometimes, its happen that we missed something at some time and may be it was good opportunity for us. Also, many-times its very late to get some certification and some valuable lessons.


I just want to be prepared when opportunity comes, so if any suggestions that i should during my Masters, please forward your experience.

&amp;nbsp;


Graduating in December (BBA Accounting minor MIS)  with 150 hours, 3.4 gpa average state school (wouldn't be recognized out of state), Internal Audit Industry internship (have references), National firm busy season audit internship (with current offer, havn't accepted or declined yet), upcoming b4 risk advisory internship (this summer)
&amp;nbsp;


I am wanting to move to another state (across the country) to be with my partner, I was wondering what is the best method to accomplish that.


&amp;nbsp;


Should I: 


&amp;nbsp;


A) Ask either of the two firms I have offers from (assuming I get an offer from the summer internship) to transfer the offer to the new city's office? If they said no would they rescind my offer for my current city?


&amp;nbsp;


B) Attempt to recruit for jobs in the new city through my on campus recruiting in the fall? (unsure how this would even work)


&amp;nbsp;


C) Work in my current city for a while and attempt to transfer down the road


&amp;nbsp;


Lastly, a lot of firms have some sort of Forensics/Litigation/Forensic Tech line of service in the city I am looking into relocating to. I was also wondering if it would be possible for me to start out in that role or if that would be something that is transitioned into after a few years of x experience


&amp;nbsp;


I appreciate any insight to this process, thank you"

I'm a 21/F/ at a college in Texas (will be in the DFW area this summer though if that matters.) I hung out with a friend and a guy she had known awhile early in April. After a couple drinks he gave me I felt pretty out of it and it's pretty blurry but I was assaulted. My friend also wasn't there when it actually happened and was blackout drunk (she had been drinking since noon and actually had had a good bit to drink that day just to give some context.) Anyway I was devastated and scared at first. I couldn't go to class or do things normally. It took up all my energy to report it to the police and then a university that gave me no accommodations and asked me questions during their investigations like how tight the clothes I was wearing were or if I had made sure to eat before I had those two drinks and if it was just possible he could have thought I was consenting when I was incapacitated. I thought at the start of this I'd feel better soon and be able to move on with school and life yet I broke down crying again tonight. I still have nightmares about him most nights and can't focus. I tried counseling and had a bad experience since I go to a conservative university that blamed me of having a drink problem since I mentioned getting drunk a few nights after it happened to blow off steam and couldn't afford anything else. I have a test Monday for an audit class I'm trying to finish and taking at Monday is already at a delayed date but I have no clue how I can take it Monday and still pass the class since I can't make myself focus. I'm supposed to intern in Dallas this summer but worry if I'll have the drive to and about not having friends or a support network there. I just feel like all these things I would normally be able to deal with like classes and internships would be ok usually but I'm so traumatized I can't so I'm not sure if anyone has a clue how I can either delay dealing with that (doing work and class) until I get better or how to deal with it now. I just was a pretty good person before and now I feel worthless and like I won't be able to do what I need to succeed. I have a boyfriend that is as supportive as he can be (he has a life too) and a couple close friends (my family hasn't been so helpful) but even with that I can't seem to get better. Sorry if this sounds crazy but I'm hoping if I can find anyone that supports me it would be appreciated because I've never felt so lost or like it's not even worth trying anymore.
6ap9xi,4,2017-05-12,Girlfriend [22F] of 2 years has an amazing opportunity and I [21M] feel like a POS for not wanting her to seize it,Throwaway921048,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ap9xi/girlfriend_22f_of_2_years_has_an_amazing/,"Preface: I feel like this is something in between an r/offmychest and r/relationships. I don’t know if I need genuine help or just a slap behind the head, maybe both? Formatting is probably bad and I am not sure I have to right flair

Background: Been together for a little bit more than 2 years. We have known each other for more than 5 years. So, it is a serious relationship, not just a fling. We are still living with our parents.

Relationship situation:
For the past 5-6 months (from January), she has been studying abroad. We live in North America and she went to the UK. I got the chance to go see here for a week to “cut” the time we would not see each other in half. We had a really good time together. Now, she is supposed to come back at beginning of June. She has been traveling a lot in Europe and in the UK. And, to be honest, I am a tad bit jealous of her. Which is kinda normal I think? She talks to me about all her experiences and send me a lot of pictures of places she visited.

My situation:
For the past few semesters in university, I have been studying in the optic of having grades good enough to go study abroad. I did hit the grades a I needed one semester ago. I applied to go to another country and I got accepted. Obviously, I told everyone (family, gf, facebook, etc). Unfortunately, my grades from this semester are just sh*t. Long story short, my gpa is too low and I will not be able to study abroad anymore. My fault, should’ve studied more.

My girlfriend just told me she was thinking of applying for a paid internship across the country, place ticket free, that would span from the moment she comes back to September. That is another 3-4 months of not seeing her. She asked me my opinion. Should she apply? According to her, she does have her chance. I said: You should definitely go, this is an opportunity that you might never get again. Never let me hold you back. A part of me knows that she should apply and accept if she gets it. But another part of me really does not want her to go. I want to see her and be with her. She asked if it would be possible for me to go see her later in the summer if she gets accepted. I said yes. She said she is already homesick after 6 months but I did convince her to still apply, you do not get chances like that every day and she deserves it.

I feel like a shit because I don’t do much of my life right now. I mostly sit at home in front of a screen, masturbate, eat, sleep and work a student job. Not fat yet, but I’ll get there someday If I keep on that trend. I feel like a shit even more because I am jealous of my girlfriend who has all these opportunities (studying abroad, travelling, potential internship across the country). I feel like a shit because I lost my chance at studying abroad and I let everyone down especially my parents. I feel like a shit because I am afraid my girlfriend will realise that I am not good enough for her. She’s straight A’s, I am in between B and C. I feel like a shit because I do not want her to go away any longer. I feel like a shit because it is unfair to ask that she drops that chance just for me. I feel like a shit because I feel that it is unfair that I have to pay for another plane ticket to go see her (stupid thought).

I just do not really what to think right now. Should I tell her that I do not want her to go? Wouldn’t it be too selfish from me, knowing that I feel like a shit and she would come back only to make ME happy? I want to travel on my own too but my financial situation would allow me only one trip this summer. I think I should shut the f*ck up and swallow it like a man. But damn, it really feels shitty.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has been studying abroad for 5-6 months. She tells me she has the opportunity to apply to a paid internship across the country for 3-4 months. I told her she should try to go for it. I do not actually want her to go. I feel like an egotistical POS.

6aqgja,2,2017-05-12,depressed student at uni,ieatbirdpoop,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6aqgja/depressed_student_at_uni/,"tldr; a failure who needs help coping with possibly failing multiple classes 


I'm about to become a junior at a well-known university, and I've honestly felt like I've been a complete failure up until this point. Back in highschool I was never really challenged, and scored among the top without even trying. I thought I could be the same during my college years, and tried as little as possible. Grades came out for my ""joke"" and ""GPA-raising"" classes. Turns out I did absolute shit in my core classes. That following semester I vowed to do better and improve myself. Semester went and passed, and before I knew it I was reading my second semester grades. Trash. Piss poor. That summer I promised myself I would improve and revitalize my passion for learning. 

Turns out I had a bigger passion for partying and going out with friends. I began my sophomore year in Fall 2016, having forgotten everything I learned about myself during freshman year. Wasted my time with my friends, and barely studied for classes I struggled in. I just couldn't muster the will power to force myself to study. I ended up barely passing a class with a C-, and dropping another core class. This January I had promised myself that I would change myself, and finally reach my full potential. I was never really considered dumb compared to anyone else, but when I got here I was basically an idiot among overachievers and hard-workers. I said to myself that wasn't true and I would set out to prove them wrong. 

This semester had its ups and downs. I tried hard, harder than I ever tried before in my academic endeavors, but this only happened days before my midterm exams. I managed to score average, and even above average in courses I was struggling with in previous semesters. But I still messed up. I procrastinated almost every day. Stayed up late. Skipped office hours. Didn't do some assignments. Hell, I still haven't gotten any experience at this point. I haven't tried to get any research positions or apply for internships at all. 

In one of my easier classes, the final changed everything. I took it this Monday, after a nearly sleepless night where I stayed up and stressed over my upcoming finals. Turns out I bombed it, and now I stand a very high chance of failing since the course isn't curved. The next final was later that evening- the class I dropped last semester. I fucked around so much that I did poorly on the midterms for a class I took TWICE already. I don't know what I'd do if I failed this course and had to retake it for the third time. The final class I might fail it and fail the class. I might pass it and still fail it since my grades are garbage. I might fail the class and be a complete idiot who failed three classes in one semester. I don't know how I did on the finals and i don't know what I'll say to my parents when I get home. I'm just so scared right now that I don't know what to do. 

I'm a 20 year old man feeling like he's about to fall over and cry while curling up in a fetal position. I really don't know what to do at this point. My roommate says everything will be okay, though I can't help but think about everything that could go wrong at this point. The biggest thing I can worry about right now is how I'm going to explain to my parents that they have an idiot son. They're such hard-workers and strict about my education that I'm afraid of how they'd react to this. They do so much for me and I just let them down this semester. I'm such a failure and disappointment that I'm starting to think it'd be better if I wasn't here and be a burden to everyone. I know these problems may seem trivial to some of the posts on here, but it's just something I need to get off my chest. I really am willing to change myself if even one person can reply to this, I just really need some peace of mind right now or I'm afraid I'll lose my mind over this."
6arfcy,1,2017-05-12,"M4F Parents, Couples, and More",MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6arfcy/m4f_parents_couples_and_more/,"Hello! I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships. Read On! 

1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. 

2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.

 3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.

 4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 

Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."

So, I have posted in some other threads that lament the dire job situation in the biological sciences- people ask what should I do after school, is my GPA high enough, did I do enough internships?  We all know the problems- publish or perish, limited positions, tons of competition, etc. ad nauseum.  I tell people I have a decent-paying, entry-level field biology job that requires no experience, provides a huge variety of field experience, and looks great on a resume.  It seems too good to be true from what we all seem to see on a daily basis with regard to entry-level job-searching in biology.  So I thought I would take a minute to explain to a little wider audience about yet another option for paying the bills using SCIENCE!

I am a fisheries observer- a private contractor working for the federal government (I am US-based) alongside commercial fishermen, gathering the myriad types of information and data that resource managers and industry personnel use to regulate their respective natural resources.  I have worked for 2 different contractors, in 3 different regions of the United States, in several different fisheries, for almost 5 years.  I got my job about a year after leaving school and working several minimum-wage gigs.

I am currently working under the North Pacific Observer Program, which is an entity of the National Marine Fisheries Service, underneath NOAA in the Dept. of Commerce.  I just returned from a 90-day deployment in Alaska and am home after a few weeks in Seattle, WA, going through the debriefing process dealing with all the data I collected while in the field.

A typical deployment in Alaska will have you assigned from 1-4 commercial fishing vessels, often alone, sometimes with a partner, working in several different fisheries (Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Yellowfin Sole, Rockfish, Sablefish, etc.) on boats of varying sizes (90-350+ feet long), with different crews (3-130+), using different gear types (pelagic trawl, benthic trawl, longline, pot, jig, etc.).  You work with the fishermen, using standardized random sampling techniques to collect population biology data on each haul of their catch, including species identification, catch effort, catch weights, age structures, sex-length frequencies, and many other biological specimen data.  You collect data on seabirds, marine mammals, and often special research projects as assigned on your deployments.  You are solely responsible for the accuracy and quality of this data and often have little support while in the field, so self-motivation and discipline are important.  Working conditions can be wild.  I’ve been on deck sampling with 30+ foot waves crashing over the bow on me with 50+ knot winds blowing icing spray all over the boat. I’ve had my rain gear freeze solid, icicle boogers attached so solidly to my beard that I had to pour hot water on my face to keep from having to tear my beard hairs out to remove them.  I’ve had to use baseball bats to knock huge chunks of ice off the boat to keep from capsizing and tolerate hundreds of birds pooing all over me so that my bright orange life jacket turns white.  You’re expected to work in bad weather, you’re expected to work if you’re seasick.  Obviously, if you feel you’re in danger, your safety is your number one priority and takes precedent over other job duties, but the conditions are adverse and you are there to work and you are expected to do a good job.  There is a very low tolerance for shoddy work because the data you collect is managed real-time in most fisheries and it has to be uploaded by satellite at least daily.  Diligence or carelessness on the part of a single observer can be the difference between a smoothly running fishing fleet or boats having to stop fishing to have emergency industry meetings to sort out huge problems.  It’s a multi-billion dollar business that hinges upon the work that I and my colleagues do every day at sea.

However, its not all stoic, super serious work- you get to see things up close that other people pay thousands of dollars to get a shot at looking at through binoculars- tons of seabirds, marine mammals, wild and crazy rare fishes, beautiful landscapes, and cool towns.  Every day is an adventure.  I’ve collected some out-of-range species, seen some big sharks, weird deepwater species, etc.  I’ve seen summer wildflower blooms on remote islands, flown on tiny charter airplanes to get on boats, hung out with a few Deadliest Catch guys, seen the northern lights, and lots of other cool stuff.

You work and live aboard these vessels with the crew, eating, sleeping, and socializing with them, often without seeing land for long stretches (some longline vessels can fish for 50+ days without coming to port).  While you have no law enforcement authority, you are required to report potential violations or other problems with the crews.  This can sometimes create animosity or a sense of isolation from the fishermen and so conflict resolution skills and social awareness are important to being able to navigate the professional relationships you’re required to have while in close personal contact with the crews.  I’ve never had any serious problems with crews and usually most issues are solved quickly while onboard, but problems do happen. 
 
Living conditions on boats vary in quality, generally related to the size of the boat you are on.  On smaller boats, you will often share a stateroom with one or more other people, sometimes your partner, sometimes fishermen, or even a combination.  Larger boats often have large staterooms which you may have to yourself or only share with a partner.  Some even have private bathrooms, adjacent offices, exercise rooms, or other amenities.  Crews on small boats are often more like a family and usually know each other well, which creates a more cozy vibe, compared to the larger, more business-like large boats. Even the big boats are still small, compact, and efficient with space, so you have to be as well- I take my sampling gear, one large duffel with all my clothes, cold weather gear, and other equipment, plus one medium backpack where I keep my electronics, sensitive data materials, and other personal effects.  Everything I need for 3 months.  You are expected to live small, and be ready to move fast and often.  Sometimes, you have less than 4 hours of notice before you are expected to have all your belongings packed, organized and moved to another boat or fly somewhere.  Efficiency is important.  There is usually plenty of goof-off time, and I personally fill it with several console emulators on my laptop, PC games, a Kindle, Ipod, and a couple of hard drives filled with movies and tv shows, in addition to hanging out and overeating snack food in the galley, or watching movies with the crew.  Internet on the boats is becoming more normal, but its basically back to dial-up days- no streaming, no music, email works ok, facebook is iffy, and while browsing reddit is usually fine, you can forget your favorite HD pic, gif, or other bandwidth-heavy subs- stick to the text-heavy ones like /r/defaultgems and /r/bestof (just remember to do your job first, lol).  Food is also variable, from homecooked meals every day on smaller boats (I get involved in cooking when I have time), to full-service cafeterias with professional kitchen staffs on large boats and everything in between (there is certainly bad food too- living on cereal for a few weeks is not fun).  Many boats sort of revolve around the galley, since it’s the only place where the crew can unwind, socialize, and enjoy a comforting meal.  Boat crews know this and at least spend a good amount of money on food, so even if the cook thinks well-done steaks are just fine, there is always plenty of food to go around.

The port towns range from strange, sparsely populated, otherworldly Aleutian islands with sprawling abandoned military bases (Adak Island) to thriving fishing communities (Dutch Harbor and Kodiak Island) to large seaport metropolitan cities (Seattle, Tacoma, Anchorage).  Its always fun to go exploring during your town time.  There is a wide variety of activities ranging from outdoorsy stuff (fishing, hiking, exploring, etc) to nightlife and even travel.  I like to buy a fishing license and go salmon fishing in the summer time, bonfires on the beach, exploring old grounded shipwrecks, WWII relics (fortifications, abandoned equipment, etc.).

As far as NMFS and your contractors employers go, you don’t deal much with them in person except when you do the initial 3-week job training course, brief and debrief at the beginning and end of each deployment.  Briefings are 1-4 days long and are designed to update you on regulatory changes, new sampling protocols, species ID refreshers, etc. before your next deployment.  They are typically in a laid back lecture/lab classroom format and while they are taken seriously and meant to convey important info, they are not necessarily challenging for its own sake. Debriefings are after each deployment where you are expected to organize, proofread, and prepare your data to essentially defend it to a NMFS employed professional before all are again re-checked, catalogued, and archived.  They are in depth, detailed, and you are expected to be able to explain your data, any problems that may have arisen, write statements regarding potential regulatory violations you witnessed, defending new species you’ve encountered, and help your debriefer prepare specimens (otoliths, scales, stomachs, genetics specimens, seabirds, marine mammal specimens, etc.).  This can take several full days discussing your work with your debriefer, especially if you return with hundreds of pages of raw data and paperwork (300+ pages is not infrequent).  These folks are your support staff while in the field and you have opportunities to contact them regarding problems, questions, advice, or other issues throughout your deployment.  They are your advocates when problems arise with crews or boats, and take it very seriously- they have a lot of resources at their disposal to help you out, from simple emails or phone calls, all the way up to full-blown Coast Guard and Alaska State Trooper Special Response or Search and Rescue teams.  They have your back.

During your time in Seattle, you typically are put up by your company in hotels or rental properties and reimbursed for some living expenses.  Its simple and compartmentalized, so there is no need to pick up and move your life if you don’t want to- I spend my off time traveling the country/world or vegging out with various family members for as long as they’ll have me on their couch.  I know lots of people who do have their own houses or apartments, either in Seattle or elsewhere near and far, but most observers save money by not having an apartment to pay for.  Off times vary, but I typically take off 3-5 months a year for travel, holidays, etc.  Payscales vary between the companies, but field pay starts at about $150 per day and goes up to about $220 per day with more experience, with Seattle pay being around $100 per day, plus some reimbursable expenses.  If you work a lot, its possible to pull down about 40-50k per year before taxes.  Not having many living expenses helps a lot too- while you’re on contract, you don’t have much you need to cover.  Other benefits also vary between companies, as far as health insurance, etc.  

Observing is not designed to be a career, but its an excellent way to gain valuable work experience, get some connections with federal agencies and industry personnel.  Alaska commercial fisheries are among the few well-managed fisheries in the world, so cutting your teeth in the Bering Sea has the potential to open a lot of future opportunities.  I’m not aware of many other entry-level positions that are better than this, as far as resume-building, pay, or just cool-factor.

The North Pacific Observer Program in Alaska is not the only one of its kind in the US- each region has one or more similar programs that hire observers on a regular basis to be on the frontlines of monitoring and managing the wide array of commercial fisheries.  I’ve worked in 3 regions- Alaska, West Coast, and Southeast.  I’ve focused on Alaska because its what I have the most experience with and I believe it’s the best choice for those fresh out of college looking for a job that is always hiring and doesn’t require you to move.  I can answer questions or give some guidance on other options if anyone asks, and I’m willing to answer most questions you may have about observing

1. Is the Necromancer a viable class that people will play fractals with in the party?  I love playing summoner classes in games so necro probably my top choice, but if people don't want to play with it in fractals or are gonna be pissy about it then I'd settle for another pet class in the ranger.  I say fractals because I'm going to be relatively busy this summer with an internship + job and as far as I can tell raids require a lot more time and gear investment as far as endgame goes.  

2. I am leveling both a ranger and a necro on and off right now, aiming for the viper horror build for the necro and the axe/torch shortbow condition ranger both found on metabattle.  Are these builds still up to date + viable or should I aim for something else?  I plan on buying heart of thorns once I get home for the summer so access to elite specs doesn't concern me.

3. Should I join an existing guild or try to make some friends and start my own?
I'm looking for a more casual chill experience for endgame once I get there so if most guilds are more serious I'm down to start my own.

4. Any other tips/tricks for newer players appreciated"

6asx1g,4,2017-05-12,I'm [30/M] trying to end my 5 year relationship with GF [26/F] without destroying us both,a_scrambled_egg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6asx1g/im_30m_trying_to_end_my_5_year_relationship_with/,"Hi,
I guess I need to get professional advice and therapy for this, but is it OK if I ramble here for a little bit? I'd like to hear what people have to say and what advice they may have.

As title suggests i've been with gf for 5 years and we met at the end of university. We had a good relationship at first but I felt things decline after about 6 months and this slowly got worse over about another 3 years. For the last 18 months it's felt pretty bad. 

She is still madly in love with me but I don't romantically feel for her or find her attractive. I do care about her very much though, but its more like a sister feeling. If i'm cold and just spit out what i'm trying to say for the sake of brevity - she's not particularly interesting or outgoing, she's not very attractive, she doesn't have many friends because people find her generally annoying, and while i'm a bit posh (we're British) she is not. Her Dad is a dumb racist hick who I can't stand, and her little brother just follows his Dad, while her Mum is nice but a bit boring. Despite this my GF is really sweet, considerate, and kind. It's these final qualities which make it so hard.

We haven't had sex in months because I avoid it and can't get turned on by her. I also work a high pressure, high impact job, and when I get home normally we just eat and watch TV before going to bed. We haven't had a deep conversation in years. Sometimes I lay in bed next to her and just want to cry and die because it feels so empty to be laying next to someone you don't care for.

It's started to distort my way of thinking towards relationships, because now in my head they have become something to is uncomfortable.

This also isn't fair to her because she deserves someone who loves her.

I've put up with this for a long time because i've been too scared to hurt her, because i've been drained from work, but also because no single event has happened to spark a breakup. You can't argue if you don't talk. However, recently i've met someone else. An intern (year older than GF) who was here a while back has recently returned and through a mutual friend we both found out that we really like each other. I feel happy when I think about her, and that's the first time i've been happy about something personal in a long time. After a few beers a few weeks ago we confessed our feelings to each other but she understands that I am currently in a relationship so nothing can happen. We're both in agreement about that and standing firm. Nonetheless, she is prepared to hold out a while for me. I now have to balance between saving up to move (i'd like to give GF money to help her) but also moving fast enough so I don't lose new interest.

I now have a motivation to do something about my situation. I should have ended my relationship years ago, but by the time I was sure it needed to be done, I was too depressed by it to bring myself to do it. I want to use this newfound energy and urgency to do the right thing for both myself and my GF. It will utterly destroy her but she will obviously be much better off for it. While we do outwardly appears to be a fairly good match, i've no doubt there is someone better for her.

I am a bit concerned that the same thing is going to happen with the new woman. I'm worried now that i'll never be able to settle because i'll just get itchy again 6 months later. I never used to be like this but after being dumped myself in horrible circumstances a few times, i've found it hard not to pick at subsequent relationships.

Finally, there's the financial. I'm two months into a 12 months rental lease on a flat with my current GF. Remember we're in the UK so laws are different from USA about breaking a contract - its generally more about chatting and making a friendly compromise than getting the lawyers out. She has a moderately good income but not very much disposable due to commitments, while I have a better income but also a lot of student debt that reduces my disposable considerably (UK debt, consider it can't be refinanced because of reasons). I don't know who is going to live where when we break up. My GF will be very angry at me and probably try to make things difficult for me. She starts a new job in the next city over soon, so this may be an opportunity for her to move closer to work, but I don't know if she'll take that - especially if I suggest it after breaking up with her, even if its in her interests.

My head is like scambled egg. I'm breaking the heart of someone I care about. My family, her family, and friends will be devastated. My work colleagues will raise eyebrows about myself moving for the junior colleague in our professional workplace. My boss is somewhat mothering towards me and she will be very approving. It's ever girls worst nightmare to be dumped by their boyfriend of 5 years for another woman when they were expecting marriage at any moment. I've also got a high pressure job, limited financial resources, and not as many friends as I used to. Add that to the doubt that this may be a mistake or that new woman will be a failed relationship and my head is a mess. I've had severe anxiety in the past and although i'm much better I sometimes struggle with stress.

Has anyone experienced anything like this before? Does anyone have any advice beyond seeking professional help? How do I make this happen? How do I know i'm doing the right thing?

Thank you for reading.

  **tl;dr**: Want to break off 5 year relationship because GF feels like a sister rather than lover. Have been too depressed to end it when I should have years ago, but new love interest has motivated me. Don't know how to make this happen. Also have work related stress and financial constraints. Biggest problem is being 2 months in 12 month lease and GF will be furious enough to start sabotaging me."
6at79i,9,2017-05-12,I (49F) live with my son (20M) and my new partner (56M) who just moved in seemingly makes fun of my son for being lazy and unproductive. I've told my partner this is unacceptable and he keeps saying I am enabling him. How do I resolve this?,imaginehch,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6at79i/i_49f_live_with_my_son_20m_and_my_new_partner_56m/,"I live with my son, he goes to college nearby so he just lives at home. My boyfriend moved in 8 months ago, we have been dating for 3 and a half years now. A big part of the reason he moved in was financial problems. We simply cannot afford rent without him. we have gotten into many discussions about my son and about how my boyfriend thinks he is super lazy and entitled and how he needs to move out and be as independent as possible. 

My boyfriend moved out at 18 and worked in a factory and had his own place at 19, he was one of those 'pull yourself up by his bootstraps' type guys. Except heres the thing, he lived in a small town where he could buy a house for like 8,000 dollars. The average home here? easily 1,000,000+ dollars. 1b apartments are typically 1,000-2,000 dollars a month. 

My boyfriend is just really kind of mean to him, he often is super condescending and talks to him like he is some kind of baby. My son goes out with his friends and my boyfriend will like, give him a talk about how what he is doing is not what adults do, and that if he was really an adult he would be working these hours instead of getting drunk at a party. For basically whatever chore there is to be done, he calls my son over and says, be a man and do this chore. I have a set amount of chores for my son to do, and its a lot, but my boyfriend always chimes in like ""oh well when I WAS A KID i had to work in a factory, but somehow this kid cant even take the garbage out?"" (my son takes out upstairs garbage, I take downstairs garbage). I told him that isnt his chores to do, and he just starts going off about how Im coddling this entitled kid. 

My boyfriend says that my sons job is a pansy job for someone his age, and that he should be doing real work, not office work. My son works at an internship in a news room, its only 12 hours a week though. Its an amazing opportunity for someone his age and I am more than glad. My boyfriend always chimes in about how that isnt a real job, and blah blah blah he needs to do some real dirty work before he gets a job like that, he hasnt earned it. 

My son is a totally normal 20 year old college student. He goes out with his friends and parties on the weekends, then works and goes to school on the weekdays, and has had a few girlfriends here and there. He is about as average as can possibly be. Okay, maybe he is a tiny bit lazy on some ends lol, but my boyfriend cannot seem to handle not being extremely condescending towards my son at every instance he can get. Half the times my son is just like ""umm yeah, sure, okayyyy"" and doesnt really say anything. The amount of times my boyfriend has said ""you arent gonna be ready for real life, real life is TOUGH KID"" is like over 1,000 times now. 

Another thing is that my son smokes pot. I know he does, I dont really care, its a dont ask dont tell situation. My boyfriend found out, and he got like upset at me about it and was saying about how I am defending my sons behavior and how my son is so entitled and I am sheltering him from the real world and enabling his 'drug addiction' by not kicking him out. He says this to me all the time, that I am enabling my sons lazy behavior. 

Ive talked to my boyfriend endlessly about this. I always defend my son whenever he says something, I've gotten into such long discussions about this but nothing has really worked. I love my boyfriend, dont get me wrong, and honestly my son likes him too believe it or not, they are playing chess right now at the other side of the room and laughing together. But this is a big problem, my boyfriend cannot keep his mouth shut about calling my son lazy and entitled and calling me an enabler. He goes on these rants about millennials and both me and my son just roll our eyes at him. Im not even sure what to do anymore. What do i do?

I should probably emphasize that my SON himself doesn't want him to leave. Despite his awful condescending self, they do get along and joke around a lot. He doesnt like him being condescending, but he does still get along with him

6atwx8,2,2017-05-12,I am addict.,GrothendieckAddict,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6atwx8/i_am_addict/,"Two days. That will be my streak on my stats final exam this Monday. Three days on my next, the hardest maths exam this year. If I don't relapse.

I am an addict. I can't lie to myself anymore. I can't believe that there is still some time. That there is still an opportunity. I had one, but I relapsed.

I managed to go on a 57 day streak, which I held until the mid of December of 2016. Since then, my best was 11 days. And now I held only for two days. I write here because I don't know what to do else, I just kind of want to let my thoughts out. I am sick tired of this addiction. With this addiction, in a single moment I go from urging to feel the best feeling on earth to fully regretting my decision and contemplating my future. 

I have dreams, I am a math student, in second year of my bachelor's degree. I like what I do, I want to improve, I want to do it for the rest of my life. But I am dead sure that if I continue like this, I can forget this dream. Next year is a decisive year. In the 3rd year of my bachelor's degree, I can either choose to follow the harder program, or the easier one. Everyone is accepted to the harder one, what matters is to stay in it. If I fail to stay in it, that is fail my exam, I will have to forget doing a Master's degree in research math, thus forgetting about getting a phd and doing math research for a living. 

I just don't know what to do. This addiction was an escape route from my difficult childhood. But now it turned against me. As they say, your best friend is the worst kind of your enemy. 

I am still unsure why I am writing this here, nor what I expect as a reaction from this community. I guess I just want to talk to someone who would be in the same boat as me. 

I worry for my future. This summer I wanted to do an internship in maths research, yet I wasn't accepted due to my GPA (yet I work a lot, still unable to reach better grades). I then asked one of my teachers to organize one for me, but for free. I would still do the same thing, but I wouldn't be paid. He kindly agreed to organize that for me. Yet I fear. I fear that it will go to shit. In math you don't need to be present anywhere, I can do it in pyjama in my home, no one will care, as long as you produce results. I plan on working in library, but it works only till 5 PM. Besides that, I will need to work part time to sustain myself, so besides the estimated 35 hours of working on math, I will have to work approximately 10-15 hours in a part time job. I will most likely have no one to talk to (my family lives abroad). This means there will be plenty of time to just edge a bit, and finally relapse. And the cycle will go on. 

I gotta do something, what can be done, can only be done by me. All the power is given to me, and that is actually a curse, not a blessing. 

I just had to speak my mind. "
6augzy,0,2017-05-12,My girlfriend [22F] broke up with me [23M] a few days ago - we have a lot of history - and I'm very upset,shesbrutal123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6augzy/my_girlfriend_22f_broke_up_with_me_23m_a_few_days/," So this might be long, but please bear with me. I was with my now ex girlfriend for a little over 2 years. We have a quite a bit of history and I'll talk about it.

Before we started dating, I met her in school in class. We were instantly attracted to one another but I was fresh off a break up. We hooked up (didnt have sex) the first week of knowing each other. From then, we made it a regular thing but of course she wanted it to be more. We went through periods of not speaking to each other to randomly booty calling one another.


Fast forward a year to 2015, we werent really speaking. I saw her on the street on my way home and she was holding hands with these guy and they were both wearing matching pink hats. I found it hilarious at first, but deep down i was not too thrilled. At point I realized I had real feelings for her and was hoping she still had the same for me. 


So I texted her to come to one of my frat's party's and I know I shouldnt have butted in her relationship, but I had to tell her how I feel. We talked for like 4 hours and left it there. She texted me the next morning and told me she still felt the same way about me. A week or two goes by and she broke up with her bf at the time and her and I started dating. This is now March of 2015.


So over the course of our 2 years together, we had some bumps. Here are the main ones. After like a month into it, I found out she made out with her best friend (a guy). She admitted to it and apologized but it took me a few weeks to get back to normal.


That summer '15 we basically stayed together since we were doing internships in the city. No hiccups till. Until I fucked up. She went home for 2 weeks to be with her family, my ex from before contacted me and wanted to talk. I thought it be harmless so I went. We have drinks, next thing you know, I wake up and she's in my bed naked. SO realizing i made a mistake i told her I cant see her ever again. I couldn't muster up the courage to tell my current girlfriend what happened. She still doesnt know.


Shit was fine until around Feb 2016. She was with her family and had around a month with them. So it was hard not seeing her. naturally I was excited when she got back, but she sat down and talked with me  and said she was enjoying her space and ended it. I was obviously devastated because we really started to love each other. Maybe it was one sided. But over the course of this time, I was struggling with it. I've never been broken up with before, I didn't really know how to to proceed. I had some lapses and texted her here and there. She was also kinda doing the same. I also found her on bumble which stung. But then we ended up hanging out for valentines day and hooked up. This continued for a little while. In March she finally said she made a mistake missed me and wanted to try again. Naturally, I said sure.


So aside  from your standard bs whatever fights we were fine. June-August we had some bad spots. I had lapses and was feeling insecure and downloaded tinder and bumble a few times. She caught me,  owned up to it. I didn't meet anyone off it, just idk why I had it. 


From June-august, she was staying at my apartment pretty regularly. She had an internship, I started my first Ft job. I didn't ask her or force her to stay, she just did, and obviously I enjoyed her company. Stuff was fine until August, when I found out a whole load of shit. So 1st week of august, she breaks up with me again cuz she thinks we arent clicking, shes losing the spark, she doesnt know what she wants or who she is as a person. I was like seriously again, shit. Fine. I was pissed but I left her alone. Then again, she start s texting me and stuff and is like wanting to hang out. I met her a few times just to see what she wanted.


So mid/end august comes around and shes talking about wanting to try again. I said I had to think about given she broke up with twice already. After a while I determined I loved the shit out of her so I was like ok we can give it another go. Just as we did, I found out loads of stuff. One day we both got home and she was changing into casual clothes to go meet a friend for dinner. She left, but when she did she left her laptop open. I shouldnt have peeked, but I did. During the summer she was talking about work in a weird way and about some of the people there so I had suspicions. Lo and behold, I was right. She was flirting with these two guys constantly. And it was like dirty flirting. I did more digging, it turns out she made out with one guy a few times, and the other guy she had over at her apartment a few times while we were together while her fucking brother was visiting. So I called her and told her we had to talk. She freaked out and ran home. I then showed her what I Found. I was livid. So pissed. Wasn't sure if she fucked the guy so I was pressing her on that but she swears even today they only cuddled and kissed. Now I break up with her and shes crying, begging hands on her knees praying I take her back.


I take a few weeks, gather my thoughts. I cheated as well. I slept with my ex, she never knew. She'd be crushed if she did. She was messing around behind my back.She kept texting me how she was saying she let her ego take over and that she just felt like she didnt have a state school college experience (we went to one in a big city.) Ultimately, I decided we try yet again....because I have no spine and despite everything, this was the one girl I actually loved and cared for.
 

So from sept-now, we had a great time. Like amazing. We were enjoying having fun. I went out to visit her at home in January and stayed at her house with her mom for a week. We had an excellent time.


What I think was my downfall during this time, I had lapses where I sort of didnt trust her. The stuff from Summer kind of haunted me and I just didnt want it to happen again. So every now and then we'd get into an argument about it and we'd kis, make up whatever. Everything was fine until 2 weeks ago. We got into a fight cuz I said something that pissed her off apparently and that I didn't want to get dinner with her dad. Since then, we've barely spoken. She stayed at her apartment the whole time.


Sunday I get a call and we're like woah its weird maybe we should just take some time to figure stuff out. I agreed. But then on Tuesday, it got even weirder since it felt like we were strangers.


She broke up with me...at this point, of course I was distraught but realized maybe its run its course. She cited the following reasons: ""Idk who I am I need to discover myself, I like being alone more now, Your morals and values arent similar to mine, your political beliefs arent similar to mine, Ive been feeling this way for a while but didnt know how to say it, I dont think im in love with you anymore, we should both work on meeting new people and not relying on each otehr"" etc. list goes on.


Those stung quite a bit. especially the not being in love part. But yeah thats my story. Its over, it doesnt feel like one of those where she'll text me and sy she misses me and want to try again. It feels completely done. I'm not thrilled about it since I thught it was going okay. We've spoken briefly to sort shit out but shes ruthless and brutal. The way she talks to me is like we never ever dated, and its disappointing. 


I guess my question is....from such a messy relationship, whats the best way to restart, refresh? Im finding trouble getting her off my mind. Im finding trouble to get over some of the stuff she said which really hurt. She doesnt seem to upset tbh, and thats piercing. Also i saw her on bumble, we spoke on the phoen today for an hour to sort stuff out and she just sounds so ready to meet other dudes. If she were to reach out to me again to try again, based on your outside perspective, does it make sense? I'm a softie so its tough to deal with. I get mad urges to reach out to her too. Any advice is much appreciated!!




  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Messy 2 year relationship with many bumps. We broke up multiple times over 2 years. We both cheated and made mistakes. She recently broke up with me again and I'm having a tough time accepting and recovering from this mess. Any advice is appreciated!"
6aumkl,2,2017-05-12,College student seeking advice,chowderson,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6aumkl/college_student_seeking_advice/,"To give a little background:


-Applied and Computational Math Sciences Major with a focus in Mathematical Economics at a top 50 University

-Good GPA (&gt;3.6)

-No relevant work experience

-No internship lined up for summer 

-No exams

-Projected graduation early 2019 (Junior but I switched majors so I need an extra quarter or two to graduate)

I *recently* decided I wanted to pursue a career as an actuary (like fucking yesterday), and I have a few questions about what to do next. I am currently taking a Probability I course and I am registered to take Probability II this summer (B-term ~7/20-8/20). In addition I am registered to take real analysis this summer (full-term ~6/20-8/20). 

I am considering taking the P exam in September after I have taken Probability II, which would cover the syllabus for the P exam. I am concerned that taking the exam in September would mean I won't find out if I pass until after I apply to internships for next summer (2018), and without ANY relevant work experience I don't know if getting an internship will be possible with no exams. 

The other option I have is to study on my own and take the P exam in July. I would only have about a month to study for the exam but I would still be coming fresh of a probability I course so I won't be starting from scratch. If I do this route I probably won't be able to take a real analysis class and cram for the P exam at the same time although I suppose it's doable. Also, taking the Probability II class after taking the P exam will be pretty redundant but it is a prereq for higher level classes (stochastic processes). 

In addition to the P exam I was wondering if there is anything else I can do to boost my chances of an internship? I am going to become a member of my school's actuary club ASAP, but I was wondering if something like a certificate of proficiency in excel would be useful?

Whoa that post turned out to be longer than I thought! What do you guys think I should do? Any advice is welcome.

6aumt6,4,2017-05-12,Need a way to get more Compendium Levels? Give Dota 2 trading/investing a try; Doing a general market Q&amp;A in this thread to help out!,Avar1cious,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6aumt6/need_a_way_to_get_more_compendium_levels_give/,"
So this post is basically my attempt to get more interest for people in general to trade/invest in hats; attempting to revive something that's on life support at this point. It's something that's been undoubtedly on the declining end over the past few years but with the new market update (a new cap of $1800 USD I believe, up from the previous $400 USD as well as the fact that now all dota items bought can be instantly remarketable!), an upcoming pre-TI patch (which might be here sooner than later according to Slacks), as well as the release of the Ti7 compendium, there might be a slight resurgence so I felt like I should ride the momentum and make this.

You may know me from my recent ""lina arcana investment"" which paid a pretty decent return (slightly higher than the base case I set in my model). I always enjoy giving back, so I'll be doing a general Q&amp;A, answering (almost) any questions you have for me in hopes of motivating you all to join!


**Who Am I?**


I feel like it's somewhat important to state my ""qualifications"" so that you know my answers are at least somewhat reliable.
I'm a person that enjoys short-term investments in the dota 2 market. I'm a university student studying finance/economics, currently in a prop trading summer internship with too much free time. I've been trading for nearly 5 years now (though mostly investments in the past 2 years due to new restrictions and lack of time). Individually, these things are nothing special; however I feel like I'm one of few individuals who has a finance/commerce background that's been fiending the dota market an extended period of time AND has a lot of ingame knowledge in Dota (hovering around low 6k) -&gt; the combination of these 3 traits helps a lot, more on this later.

Although I'm far from one of the biggest traders in Dota (capital restricted as parents absolutely abhor me spending real money in Dota 2), I'm knowledgable in most aspects of trading to a decent extent, similar to a jack of all trades. If there's a question I can't answer, I have a few connections on some experts in certain fields that I can consult.


**Why Should I Give A Shit About This?**


Simple. Free stuff for little effort. If you put in some funds (say $25-100 to make it easier) to invest and do it properly, you might never have to pay for hats again.

My personal story is that I started with a golden greevil drop and traded my way up to a 4000$ + inventory (now 3000 something after some bad bets XD), 99% of which obtained without using my own money. This includes me getting lv 1000 in ti5 compendium and lv 2500 in ti6 compendium all for ""free"", as well as giving me extra profits to lose/burn in betting when I'm bored.

I feel like a lot of people are looking for ways to grab some extra levels whether for that kunkka immortal, the terrain, or even that aegis; this might help!

**So What Method Do You Recommend?**

Buying low and selling high was pretty awful as:

1. It's time consuming, finding a good buyer and seller.

2. Restrictions (7 days) + large tax make flipping very hard. This is less true now that items can be instantly RESOLD on market (trading restriction still there) after being bought!

Even still, I find short term investments are 100% the way to go (like weeks to a few months). A strong example would be what I did with the Lina Arcanas. To put it simply, find the next FOTM hero that's undervalued right now and buy shit for them (ideally bundles or single immortals). I was following DPL and saw IG abusing the shit out of mid Lina before DAC (where most people found the trends and started employing it in their pubs) and made a huge margin buying a ton of lina arcanas while lina was still considered gutter trash.

I won't go too deep into the economics as there are many people who hate it but to put it simply, a lot of an items value is related to the hero's popularity in pubs (which is often copied from the pro-scene). Find a hero that's not currently popular that you expect to be super strong soon and buy shit for him; ideally right before everyone else figures out but not too soon as you don't want to hold on to stuff for like a year. This is why I think this is a good time to make this post! The Pre-TI patch is coming and, if slacks isn't trolling, it might be here sooner than I expected.

There's deeper stuff too (ie: general hero popularity, item volumes, sub/comp theory) but isn't needed to generate a profit in general; the surface level is something I feel like everyone can casually do.

Since I'm bound to be asked this anyway, I feel like I might as well say what I'm currently investing in. Keep in mind I did this all **PRE-KIEV**; the same opportunities may not exist for you anymore! Although a patch is coming and the market is still low from compendium release, it's your responsibility to evaluate their profitability from this point onwards.

I mass bought nature's prophet immortal staffs. (about 500 of them) as I was very confident in them. I bought a bunch of immortals for shadow shaman, ancient apparition, zeus, bristleback, phoenix, enchantress, and phantom lancer(some of which im more confident in than others)

Here's my personal rationale:

1. Pre-kiev (even post kiev for some), these heroes have been out of the meta for a huge period of time in high level play.

2. They've all been consistently receiving buffs since 7.00 but are out of the meta for various different reasons (ie: AA weak to strong offlaners w. dispells and fast push since he has no wave clear, Bristleback and silver edge, etc)

3. I expect a shift/balance patch that's significant pre Ti-7 that might change things up a lot.

4. I wanted to diversify my investments to reduce risk.
All of my investments have very small downside in general but huge upside potential. If I'm even right on half of these, I would've made a lot.

At this point, even when markets are at a general low from the compendium release, I'm above the 13% tax margin on all of my investments. The most profitable of them all is the bristleback immortal, nearly 3x'ing in profit thanks to the new BB immortal.

My exit point will likely be a few days after the patch; at most maybe when some notable tournaments or TI qualifiers start. It'll depend.


Of course, this Q&amp;A isn't just limited to profits/investments, but the whole of the dota market. Like I mentioned before, I've been a fanatic following the cosmetic/item scene for the past few years so odds are I answer or find the answer to almost anything cosmetic related (ie: how do you get X item, info on unusual couriers/legacies, etc). 

 I'll most likely be answering questions into the weekend. I hope everyone will find this useful/informative to some extent and help me revive a nearly dead dota 2 trading scene. Cheers!"
6aupp2,3,2017-05-12,Trying to understand activity-based costing from a practical perspective,Lord_dokodo,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6aupp2/trying_to_understand_activitybased_costing_from_a/,"If I have a company who doesn't know product costs and wants to figure out product costs using ABC, where do they begin?

I'm trying to think this through logically.  In ABC, you allocate the costs to different activities--but most examples I come across have arbitrarily determined the cost for each activity.  The only thing they show you is how to find the activity rate, which is just simple arithmetic.  You divide the total cost by the driver and you find the rate.  So if you have a total cost of $1,000 for purchasing and you have 10 purchase orders, then each purchase order is for $100 added to the product cost.  

But where did they find that purchasing cost $1,000?  It's not the direct materials bill, that's the direct material cost.  There is a cost associated with being on the phone/spending time to coordinate everything.  Would I literally just figure out the hours spent on the phone/internet making purchases and then multiply that by the hourly wage of the employee to determine that particular activity's cost?  And would I then allocate that to the amount of purchase orders to find $100 per purchase order?  That seems like it kind of defeats the purpose of ABC but how else do I just find the cost of an activity?

**As an aside, if you were trying to bring these costs down to the product level, if each purchase order was for 50 tons of material and each product required 1 ton of material, would each product absorb 1/50 of the cost per purchase order of $100?**

So all the examples I read already have the cost in there.  The problem is, how do you know what the cost is in a real life scenario?  My guess is to look at the bills--you have salaries for support departments, you have utility bills, you have management salaries, etc.  Would you allocate these costs to the different activities, which then go on to be allocated to a product level?  My question is essentially, how do you determine the costs that you're trying to allocate, assuming you don't just have historical data lying around.  

My idea is to start from the costs you need to allocate.  However, for indirect costs that don't necessarily have a readily identifiable 'cost' (such as repairing molds or replacing molds) how would you determine the costs you need to allocate?

Any insight would be helpful.  I'm trying to intern for a cost accounting position and while I've taken cost accounting, I haven't necessarily done anything from square 1 like this.  

EDIT:  I've created a prototype for this data quoting system that I'm working on.  

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18s3waRTd-_CzcrwxcNgsYXNts9OYpPKlIa1-iUrEB-Y/edit?usp=sharing

Sorry for google sheets, I figured it would be the easiest way to distribute this, but I know it's horrid to use.  

My idea is to start with the expenses that we have.  The bills we pay, the wages paid, etc.  And then we figure out how to break those down into different cost pools.  The main objective is to find product costs, so our cost objects will be the different products and product lines that are produced in the factory.

If anyone has any experience with this and wants to chime in and critique my model, it would be greatly appreciated.  I haven't fine tuned it to be applicable to my specific job but it's supposed to be just a general overview of a potential ABC costing system.  Obviously my job would be to find out all of the actual activities and break them down into a logical manner.  I've added some contingencies into the margins of the spreadsheet and notes to talk about different ideas/paths that might be feasible.  It seems to me that because GAAP says nothing about these different valuation methods that the practice is very open to interpretation.  So bottom line--if it works, then it's good.  If it works, looks nice, and runs well continuously, that is the best outcome.  I'm not sure if I'm in a position, yet, to suggest automation of data collection but I figure that is something that I will need to talk about one day with them.  

Also it is incomplete and I have not yet created the sheet where I will allocate the costs to the different cost objects based on activity levels.  I think the next step is to determine the amount of activity that is consumed by each product line.  That will of course be another hurdle in actually implementing this system--you have costs per activity, but you must now find out how much of each activity is consumed by each cost object to determine how much of that rate should be applied.

Most likely youll be working with total numbers instead of unit numbers so then we would need to factor in how much of the activity is consumed by any product line and then bring it down to unit costs by figuring out how much production there was.  Most likely, we'll have to start from the top down--we have final bills, we know how much total consumption there was.  We now need to break it down into different activities, assign costs to those activities, and then bring it down to a product level to determine the costs per product.  

I'm hoping to get this report in by Sunday afternoon because Monday is the day the decision is made between me and 2 other interns.  I'm trying to show a little initiative and also demonstrate my abilities and skills.  My biggest concern is that I'm not working within a 'standard' or doing things 'by the book' so when I show it to them, they might not approve--even though I've been reading multiple different sources on how it's done and how it's implemented.  Many have slight variations in diction/syntax but it seems like the idea is all the same and I think I've followed through.

I hope I'm on the right thinking.  I've tried to fathom how else to do it but it either is highly impractical or just does not seem to align with the thinking of activity-based costing.  Any critiques will be immediately considered and read, thank you very much!

My question is how long I should tell them I will be gone for.  I'm currently 19 weeks and so far my prenatal appointments have all been less than 20 minutes (in one case, just 5!). I know there is a glucose test that can be 2-3 hours long at some point after 26 weeks but is that during a prenatal visit or is that a separate appt?  Did your appts get longer in the second or third trimester?  I'm interning up to the 33rd week so I will be back home by the time I need weekly appointments."

He knows his shit and is slowly taking away my opportunities to gain experience and effectively turning me into a secretary. I've attempted Powertalk a few times but I'm kinda paranoid about messing it up, so if my intuition is correct he pretty much has me labelled (accurately) as a ""Loser"" or maybe a ""Clueless.""

What's your advice? I'm pretty good at picking up on some of the dynamics, but you can never be sure. Should I try planting a little piece of information and seeing how it moves through the office? Should I attempt to extract gossip from my coworkers? Also I lack the wit and people skills to gain that initial likability, once again as a result of me being too paranoid of saying something inappropriate or whatever. I just want to practice really.

I am thinking about getting a motorcycle to ride for the month. I live in Minnesota and think almost every day about buying a bike when I live somewhere warm. Now I do. But none of my options seem great for a month.

Here are my options as I see it:

1. Pay absurd rental rates to rent for a month. Probably cost over $1500. Deal with rental nonsense.  Probably not get the kind  of bike I want.

2. Buy new from dealer, resell after taking huge loss. Lose a weekend buying and another one selling. KBB tells me I might lose $2k doing this, making it seem pretty stupid.  (Assuming I can actually  resell it that easily/quickly).

3. Buy used from dealer and resell to dealer. Meh selection. Possible issues with bike. Still lose $1k or so. Lose two weekends.

4. Pay private party who thinks his ratty 10 year old bike has lost about $1500 in value compared to a brand new one. Possibly deal with mechanical issues. Lose 2 or 3 weekends sorting through craigslist scams and taking public transit from seller to seller.

5. Continue wishing I had a  motorcycle every day (using Uber to get to work and being stuck in suburbia otherwise). Go back to Minnesota and spend another year or two wishing I had a motorcycle. But have another $1-2k or so in my pocket.

I have to buy a helmet and jacket and boots, but I have to do this eventually anyway. 

I could afford any of these options but I'm not crazy about them. In dollars and cents, Ubering is cheaper assuming I only go from home to work. But it will also mean that I don't do much fun stuff and I'll feel stuck at home.

But I got an internship up where my parents live, so I'm stuck staying with them for the duration of the internship.  (I know, but it's a *paid* internship, in Library Science.  At a legitimate research library, for *more* money than was originally offered because they liked me so much.)

So of course now that I'm basically trapped, Dad knows he can be an asshole.  We've been fighting.  I've actually stood up for myself without backing down.  The phrase, ""I should have remembered you aren't a safe person to talk about this stuff with"" was used.

Usually, when I'm this mad at him I do that bitchy white girl thing and spend his money on something he doesn't like me buying, as a ""fine"" for his bad behavior.  (Mom knows, gave me permission to do that.)  But that's not exactly a healthy coping mechanism, and I don't really have space for more comic books.

Instead, I'm going to write a list of table manners my dad created for my siblings and I when we were kids.

**Violating the following may result in anywhere from a $ 0.25 to $ 50 fine, and possibly sentencing to eat in the mudroom:**

* No elbows on the table.

* When you are finished eating, fold your hands and rest them on the table.

* When eating at the table, sit up straight, push your chair in as far as possible (this prevents you from spilling on yourself,) and keep your plate a reasonable distance from the edge of the table.  Any spillage is proof this rule was violated.

* When ladies sit at the dinner table, they should cross their ankles.

* After sitting down, the absolute first thing you should do is put your napkin in your lap.  Don't tuck it into your shirt like Grandpa.  He eats like a farmer.  (This does not reflect my feelings on farmer's eating habits.  It was literally said to me.)

* If you already have food in your mouth, *do not* put more food in until the first bite is swallowed.

* No talking with your mouth full, regardless of how angry people get when you don't answer questions because your mouth is full.

* If you have food in your mouth and have been asked a question, don't rush to finish chewing and swallow.  You might choke.  And that's way worse that inevitably getting grouched at for not answering Dad immediately. 

* When eating bread, tear off a small, bite-sized portion, and place it into your mouth.  Bite-sized should be roughly one square inch of bread.

* If you would like butter, cut a serving-sized patty of butter off of the main stick of butter.  Place it on your plate or the bread plate.  Then butter a bite-sized portion of bread.

* [When using utensils, start from the outside and work your way in.  Silverwear at the ""top"" of a place setting is used for desert.](http://rootedinfoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Table-Setting-Royal.jpg)

* Similarly to bread, all food should be cut into roughly one square inch sized pieces before being consumed.

* We are American, so we cut food the American style.  [Hold your knife in your right hand, fork in the left.](http://www.haivuong.com/assets/uploads/myfiles/images/New/dining/14.jpg)  Cut a bite-sized piece (one square inch) with your utensils.  Set the knife down.  Move your fork from the left hand to the right hand.  Place the food into your mouth.  Chew it, then cut the next piece.  If you are cutting meat, go against the grain.

* Being in Europe is not a pass to switch to the European way of eating things.

* [Forks should be held like this.](http://pad3.whstatic.com/images/thumb/e/ea/Use-a-Fork-and-Knife-Properly-Step-10.jpg/aid23872-v4-728px-Use-a-Fork-and-Knife-Properly-Step-10.jpg)  Improper fork usage is an especially heinous violation of table manners, and can result in the steepest fines.

* When eating pre-cut frozen green beans, you may either pierce two one-inch segments, or scoop three.  (It might have been the other way around, I can't remember anymore.)

* Cut burgers in half before you eat them.

* Remember when eating soup, ""As a ship goes out to sea, I dip my spoon away from me.""

* Do not use a spoon to twirl pasta before eating it.  You should be able to twirl it, and get it into your mouth politely, without the spoon.

* Never, EVER, lick your knife.  You don't want to eat like Grandpa.  He eats like a farmer.  (This does not reflect my feelings on farmer's eating habits.  It was literally said to me.)

* You should *always* have something to drink with dinner.  If you don't, and you start choking, it's your fault you're choking and you're stupid.

* No singing at the dinner table.  Even during lunch, at home with just the family.

* Use low indoor voices only when at the table.

* Place utensils down *gently* on your plate when you aren't using them.

* Peas may be eaten with either a fork or a spoon, but if you use a fork, you must *scoop* your peas.  Don't pierce them.

* If you are unable to get a last bit of food on your fork, you may use a knife to push it onto the fork.  *never* use your fingers.

* If you are offered one of those little dipping bowls, dip one hand at a time, then dry on the provided cloth.

* If you start coughing and can't stop, excuse yourself and go to the bathroom immediately so other diners won't be disturbed.

* Never touch other diners during a meal, including accidentally bumping feet.  (Gwen was completely exempt from this rule.  I got kicked a lot, then accused of taking up too much space.)

* Do not use a knife to cut desserts.  Use the side of your fork.  As always, pieces should be bite sized.

* Eat at a moderate pace.  This was never actually defined, but I believe ""moderate"" was considered whatever pace Dad was consuming his food.

* If pizza is too hot to eat, or floppy, it should be cut.

There may have been more.  I got bored and typed everything out in high school, and counted ninety four different rules, but I think I broke everything into more parts back then.  Anyway, they were a lot.  And while I understand that most of these are ""normal"" and help me during lunch interviews, I'm pretty confident that this was excessive.  People get uncomfortable watching me eat politely.  Like, to the point where I had to learn to relax my eating style in college to seem more personable.

Also, I was expected to be totally capable of following all of these rules by the time I was eleven, and I was the oldest.  (Shawn learned to cut meat at ten.)  My dad literally did fine us $50 at times for improper fork usage.  (Mom didn't always enforce fines, but it depended entirely on how closely Dad was keeping track of her.)

Every time we went out to eat, at least one of these rules would get broken, and Dad would spend the whole meal telling us how embarrassing we were and how he was never taking us out to eat again.  Then a few strangers would stop by and tell my parents they had never seen such well behaved children before, and he'd calm down a bit.  That literally happened every time we ate out.

Anyway, this will serve as the set-up for the following upcoming stories:

* Shawn's Fork Rebellion

* That Time Shawn Emulated Calvin and Hobbes In the Best Way Possible

* That Time Mom Had Enough"

When the news came down about the rbs you tube channel being shut down there was a lot of celebration. That channel has been a thorn in their side for a long time, while working there I know rizz did not go on the reddit site , but knew about those videos, and complained to upper management ,that those videos  had his family in tears.. Goldhammer and Fontana would always go on the rbs reddit page and read everything and report to management. Fontana would always say when down voting, those RBS punks must be taught a lesson.When the news came down yesterday about the rbs you tube channel demise, rizz reaction was I'm going to have a cocktail, and them I'm going to have another. Hammer was walking around with a victory cigar in his mouth, and Keith Williams according to my friend gathered the staff together and made the announcement about the flag of surrender and the statement  that is the reason why this victory is great, because different players have made contributions to the win. My friend said upper management were going out last night to drink some champagne.

6axzw1,1,2017-05-13,M4F Parents' desires,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6axzw1/m4f_parents_desires/,"Hello! I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships. Read On! 
1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. 2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature 4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 
Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."

6aybzx,2,2017-05-13,Looking for some advice,applenthusiast,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/6aybzx/looking_for_some_advice/,"Hey guys, I've got a few questions about starting my aviation journey and I'm looking for some advice. First a bit of background information.

I'm currently 21 years old and in my 3rd year of mechanical engineering in Ontario. I have wanted to become a pilot for as long as I can remember and I'm at a point now where I can begin my training. After a few summer internships in the engineering field, I cannot see myself as an engineer for the rest of my life. I can see myself as an airline pilot. That being said I would work as an engineer while completing my flight training.

Now for the questions.

There is a gliding club near me, is it wise to learn how to glide before starting my PPL or am I just wasting money? My rationalisation of learning to glide first is that it could potentially shorten my PPL as I will have learned the fundamentals in the glider.

I have no problem spending a few years instructing after I finish my ratings. I love teaching and have taught sailing for many years. I know the pay is not good but that's something I am 100% okay with. Is becoming a CFI an appropriate plan if my end goal is the airlines?

Thank you in advance for any advice!"
6aztrb,15,2017-05-13,kayaking while tripping face,otherworldish,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6aztrb/kayaking_while_tripping_face/,"Hello r/drugs. I took some drugs yesterday and it kind of blew my mind so I'd figured I'd share my experience. 

For a little background, I'm a junior Mechanical Engineering student and I just finished the hardest semester of my life. My grades came in pretty well and I start this new internship on Monday so my mindset going in was really positive. I stressed myself out a little the day of because I was trying to secure some details about my job by email. I really wanted to trip that day anyway so at 3:53pm I finished that up and dropped.


T+0 I stick 225 micro grams of an LSD analogue between my gums. The tabs feel like butter in my mouth. I vacuum my carpet, Lysol off my desk and make my bed. I had been cleaning my room bit by bit all week for this. After this I go and chill on the back porch with 2 of my roommates. 


T+45 The first thing I notice is music enhancement. Sultans Of Swing comes on the speaker and I am enthralled by the sound of the guitar. A strong sense of euphoria is building quickly. 


T+1:00 My roommate Thomas agreed to go kayaking with me earlier so we carry his kayaks down to the beach. When we get there I notice some visual effects: slightly enhanced colors and a perceptual change akin to tunnel vision. It looks like my eyes zoomed out so I had a larger FOV verging on 3rd person view. Along with this comes a really interesting phenomena I noted before on 1 tab of acid. Time feels like its speeding by and I'm just a passenger onlooking the events happening around me with some sort of heightened awareness that I can't really describe. Kind of like a time lapse.


My Interaction with Thomas becomes extremely fumble-y as we get the kayaks into the water. I find it near impossible to communicate very simple thoughts. I can't even express to him how limited my conversational abilities are, but I'm sure he understood. I feel like I want to explain whats happening to me but I don't wanna come off weird so I try to shut up.


So when I was about to sit down I noticed a very large spider holed up in one of the holes in the kayak (its an ocean type kayak). I involuntarily feel  jumpy while trying to get it out and kind of lose my shit for a moment. I don't want to look at the spider, but my eyes are drawn to it because It looked surprisingly mutated and alien. Thomas has to come back to shore and assist me. 


T+1:30 kayaking feels very weird. I can't really tell how fast I'm going. The ripples in the water are multiplying and everything in the distance is diffracting red and green. I start to get overwhelmed with the beauty of my surroundings. My jaw drops in amazement multiple times as the visuals surround me, combing with ricocheting sounds of birds and wind that are tearing like a sound effect from electronic music. My mind is RACING.


Thomas wants to stop by his friends house to bum a cigarette. I pull up and sit cross legged on the beach while he does this and feel really peaceful. After this I muck around in the shallow water and sand I kick up turns in to a repeating pattern of orange swirls. Thomas' friend wasn't home and when he got back it looked like his whole body was covered in red and green peacock patterning.


T+2 ish, Walking back through a very short stretch of woods to the house feels like I entered another world. Time slows down farther than I ever thought was possible. I laugh out loud at how crazy this feeling was. Back at the porch I start to feel pretty edgy because Thomas was fiending for a cig. After a bit of this my other roommates friend walks out and gives him one and the conversation immediately picks up. It felt like I experienced this moment from 3rd person and it made me acutely aware of how consumables like beer and cigarettes fuel the social scene around my house.

T+2:30 I go change and I don't make it out of my room for the rest of the peak. There is incredibly detailed patterning on the walls. While looking at my toes they began growing long and spindly and wave around as my whole foot changes colors. Concentric circles of blurriness started overlaying my vision so I put on comfortably numb and it was truly orgasmic, an insanely pleasant feeling.

White icons looked starkly white on my phone and all of the text appeared in the American horror story font, no joke.

After a while I started feeling very introspective and just dum-found at what was going on. I was struggling to understand my purpose in life and what I was even doing with it. Some more of my roomates friends came over around this time and they started playing music and having a good ol drunken time. I normally would have joined them but I could not get over the fear of making an ass out of myself because I wouldn't be able to keep up or string sentences together. 

T+6 I felt pretty shaky and weak so I ran out to the kitchen and grabbed an apple and came right back to my room. I couldn't help but think that the people around were thinking I was acting really weird because. .I was acting really weird. The apple tasted like the nectar of the gods.

T+7 Thomas comes by my room pretty drunk after some people left and asks me to come out and hang. I'm pretty grateful he did this because I started feeling pretty lonely even with all the people around. 

T+8 I beat Thomas twice in beer pong finishing with a fantastic behind the back shot on the last cup. I felt pretty sober but my mind was beat and I had little desire to make conversation so I went back and fell asleep after around two hours of sitting up pondering.

If anyone made it this far, congrats. I hope you guys have an awesome day!

*TLDR:* Acid is fucking crazy

6azybb,30,2017-05-13,Would any of you like to speak to me [f25] about FTM teenagers for my dissertation?,really_really_,GenderCritical,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/6azybb/would_any_of_you_like_to_speak_to_me_f25_about/,"Hello everyone, I really hope this is okay to post here - profuse apologies if not; feel free to tell me to gtfo if necessary. 


So. I've been furiously reading as much as I can about gender critical feminism ever since watching that infamous BBC documentary about transgender children. That was definitely my peak trans moment and it hit me like a huge smack in the face. Before then I'd always been of a ""live and let live"" mentality regarding trans issues, especially since I'm a bisexual female who has been an active member of the LGBT community since I was 15 and has only ever had long term relationships with women. I'm obviously not a bigot and I've always considered myself a tolerant and progressive person who is supportive of others, however they identify. 


However, that heartbreaking segment in the BBC doc with the poor detransitioned woman who (in her own words) will ""now always be freakish"" due to taking cross-sex hormones really, truly hit me hard. In fact, I burst into tears immediately. And now here I am on the GC subreddit.


So here's the main reason for my post. I'm a 25-year-old UK-based Journalism Masters student and in lieu of a dissertation I can write a couple of longform articles (3000 words - can be more if necessary). I would really like to write a piece exploring why there is such a massive increase in female teenagers identifying as FTM from a gender critical perspective. I'm thinking of taking the angle of social contagion - the availability of social media, increased visibility of transgender issues and the positive way the media frames this, plus a helping of good old patriarchal gender roles all contributing to this new climate where girls feel more comfortable identifying as men.  


I'd really love to speak to:


A gender critical parent of an FTM teenager

A detransitioned woman/a formerly trans-identified woman

A gender critical therapist/medical professional/psychologist


I was wondering if any of you here fit that description or knew anyone that does that would potentially be willing to speak to me. Preferably UK based, but this is not necessary. I'm happy to talk in person, over email, phone or Skype - whatever you feel most comfortable with.


As for my writing credentials, as well as my current Journalism MA, I also have an undergrad Degree in Journalism, I've done multiple internships at magazines and I've worked as a copywriter for the last four years. I just want to underscore that it won't be a poorly written piece just because I am a student. I'm confident I can handle these sensitive issues with skill and tact, editorially speaking.


However, as it's being written for my assignment, it's not necessarily going to be published anywhere. Obviously I'd love for my pieces to be published, but I'm quite wary of having these views out there attached to my name for obvious reasons, so I'm still debating over whether I'd want this piece to be seen beyond myself and my tutor. Either way, I can always change your name and hide your identity if you were not comfortable having your quotes attributed to you in the story. Ultimately, though, I would love to see it published.


I feel really passionate about this and just want to assure everyone that I would only be approaching this from a position of empathy and from a certain level of having ""been there"" myself. I came out as a lesbian when I was 15 (I now identify as bisexual, but as we all know here, the way you identify as a teenager is not necessarily the way you'll always be!) and I grew up in a very small town where I relied a lot on social media platforms like tumblr to connect with other LGB teens. I had short hair, didn't dress in a ""girly"" way, blah blah blah... I never identified as transgender but as this was 10 years ago now, the social climate was very different. I know how pervasive these online spaces can be and how much of a refuge they can feel like. I feel that if I was growing up now.. a lot of the stories you see about trans youth could have been me. 


I really want to write this piece and write something I can be proud of. So I'd love to speak to some of you if you were so willing. Even if you don't fit the description of any of the people above, if you feel you have something you could add, I'd love to hear from you. 


If not, or regardless, since discovering the gender critical community (especially this subreddit) I feel so much more comfortable with myself as a bisexual woman and I'm undoubtedly a MUCH better feminist. So I'd like to thank all of you for providing such intelligent and progressive commentary - I am truly grateful that this community exists.

6b09bb,1,2017-05-13,"I [16F] don't know how to deal with my siblings [12F, 7M]",throwitawayalice,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6b09bb/i_16f_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_siblings_12f/,"I'm not completely new here. I've posted about my family situation before and my own problems, and I've got them figured out for the most part. My grades are up, I'll be looking for a summer job, and I've gotten myself some hobbies. I'm much happier now, after getting advice from you guys. After sorting myself out, there are a few other problems that I'm not sure how to deal with. In this, I'll call my sister [12F] Carmen, and my brother [7M] Max. Max isn't as big of a problem, so you can skip over his part if you'd like- my sister is the main problem here.


Long story short, my father [56M] is in jail and my mother [46F] works to meet ends by running his small company for him. I'm left to watch my siblings everyday until around 7 P.M... I don't know how to control them, because my sister doesn't respect me at all, and my brother will not listen to me if he's mid-tantrum.


**Max** - I want to start with Max because he's just easier to explain, and he's not as bad as my sister. He's very hyper and active, jumping around a lot and shifting his attention to different activities after 15-45 minutes. He's always yelling and screaming for no reason (nobody is talking to him and he'll still be loud). He has problems speaking right without thinking about his sentences or stuttering. He's also in OT therapy. We've gotten him checked for autism multiple times, but nothing comes up. Max doesn't have any friends he visits, and Carmen doesn't like him, so he gets all of his attention from me and my mother. He's a sweet boy, but he doesn't like rules and cries/screams to get what he wants. A little behind in development, from what I can see. He's not too terribly bad, I'm just not sure how to discipline him. He has improved ever since I changed my habits and my attitude, so he's really not too bad.


**Carmen** - Carmen is...something. She's usually the cause of most types of fighting in the house, and unlike my brother, doesn't calm down. She won't apologize for anything, gets physical, breaks property occasionally, and shows no care for *anybody* in the house. Nothing is ever her fault, in her eyes. I let her slip out of punishment sometimes because I don't have the time to deal with someone who just doesn't listen. 


Even if something gets taken away, she'll still use it behind my back (which I only find out by checking on her or Max telling me about it). She blames me for not letting her hang out with her friends, since she has to go straight home after school to wait for my brother since I come home later. It's my fault for ruining her summer, because she has to watch my brother while I go to work. I'm 'ruining' her next school year too, apparently, by taking a college course first semester next year and taking a mandatory spring internship for my med class (leaving her with my brother, which means she can't go out on school days). It's my mother's fault for not being here all the time (not caring that she has work). It's my brothers fault for doing something like listening to a video in the living room, because it's 'annoying.' I'm a loser for not liking to go out much as her, my brother is stupid for not being able to talk right, my mother is pathetic for bossing her around...It never stops! She berates me and my brother for everything we do that even slightly annoys her.


She's a drama queen, and will make a big deal out of everything. She has hit me and my brother multiple times, damaged our things, refused to listen to me, etc, etc, etc... Once, she took my earthbound cap (the only hat I actually like) and started crumpling it because she was mad. There was a day where I asked her if she was hungry (I cook when I get home), and she said no multiple times...until my mom came home, at which point she told my mother that I starved her. She's stolen from me before. I don't like leaving her with my brother, because she's merciless. Today, she invited my brother to play in her room, and 15 minutes later I heard four loud slaps coming from her room...*which is all the way on the other side of the house.* He cried a lot. Carmen disrespects me, and will not listen to anything negative I have to say because I'm just her sister (I'm trying to help her, but she never listens). Even with my mother, she yells back. If they're on the phone, she'll hang up because my mom is 'annoying.' Just the other day, she left the house without my permission, right in front of me. I'm definitely not going to get physical with her, because we're the same size and she's actually a bit stronger/more aggressive than me. If I do so much as push her back to keep her away, she dramatically shoves herself onto the nearest wall and acts like I'm cornering her (even though it's pretty much the other way around). Carmen uses that drama show to make excuses for fighting me back even though I barely touched her in the first place (she did this today, too...which is actually what pushed me to post here again). She was probably intent on staying out most of the night, too, until I called my mother (who ended up having to go look for her in the car). Carmen is too much for me, and at this point, she feels like someone I just have to deal with until I move out. I can talk about her for days on end.


She's not a parent or anything, so I don't think I can define it as abuse, but I'm sure it's not normal. I don't know how to help her recognize that her actions are just too much. I was thinking maybe she's having trouble because our parents aren't around much, and she doesn't see me as a parental figure. Maybe it's the stress of growing up. I don't understand, but I just want her to stop. Even my mother has a hard time with her, and just gives up after some time.


**TL;DR** - My brother is loud and doesn't listen to me sometimes, but is overall sweet. My sister is ten times the problem, since she gets physical, breaks things, lies, berates me/my brother, and just lacks respect overall. How do I deal with them? (In terms of my sister, a solution that doesn't get me slapped or my stuff ruined would be nice)"
6b0ehy,83,2017-05-13,Tips for Summer Associates and Interns,ThisLawyerLife,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/6b0ehy/tips_for_summer_associates_and_interns/,"Hey everyone,


As the school year winds down and summer associates and interns join firms and organizations across the country for what is essentially a 12-week job interview, I wanted to share some tips to help you succeed.

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 1: Show enthusiasm.**

People want to work with people who want to be there, so you need to be engaged, even if the particular case or project you’re staffed on at that moment is not all that interesting to you.


**Do this:** When meeting with a senior attorney to receive new work, don’t ever sit there silently and stare at them blankly. Practice active listening. Take notes. Nod. Ask questions about the case and the project. If you cannot think of any questions on the spot, leave the meeting with some kind of pleasantry like, “Thanks, this sounds like an interesting issue. I’ll let you know if I have any follow-up questions once I dig in.”

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 2: Be Responsive.**


One of the easiest ways to make a great impression is to communicate well. We could spend days talking about how to do this, but let’s keep it simple. One of the biggest complaints I hear about junior attorneys – including summer associates and interns – is that they are not responsive, leaving their supervising attorneys wondering what they’re doing and how they’re doing. This is an easy fix.


**Do this:** Return calls and emails promptly. A general rule of thumb for office life is to return all emails and calls within 24 hours, but depending on your office, you may need to respond faster than that. In large law firms, response times are much shorter – folks will expect some kind of response the same day, even if it is just to say you are looking into it and will provide a response by X time.

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 3: Meet deadlines.**


One of the biggest downfalls of junior attorneys across the board is a failure to manage their time and blowing deadlines as a result. This is completely avoidable, especially when you’re just a summer associate or intern – nobody is expecting you to pull all-nighters!


**Do this:** Stay organized. Track deadlines in your calendar and give yourself interim deadlines. Do you have a project due Friday afternoon? Break it down into smaller pieces. Finish your research on Wednesday, the memo on Thursday, and give yourself Friday morning to proofread and finalize. If you need an extension, ask for one in advance – not 10 minutes before it is due (or even worse, after blowing the deadline).

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 4: Master the simple stuff.**


As a summer intern, nobody expects you to be a legal mastermind.  But they do expect you to control what you can.  This generally means conducting thorough legal research and turning in final, polished work product.


**Do this:** Take advantage of available resources like the free Lexis/Westlaw reps. Spell check and proofread everything you turn in, including emails. Ask your secretary or a fellow summer intern to review your final product (and do the same for them).

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 5: Be a Professional.**


Often, being a professional means following established office norms. If you have not worked in a professional environment before, try to take your cues from more experienced attorneys and staff in your office.


**Do this:** Dress appropriately for your office dress code. It’s usually a good idea to wear a suit on your first day of work. If you notice that most attorneys are wearing jeans, you can relax your style after that. But people will tend to remember if you under-dress rather than overdress, so err on the conservative side here.

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 6: Ask for Feedback.**


One of the common complaints new lawyers have about their supervisors is that they do not provide feedback.  A common stereotype of lawyers in general is that they are poor managers. These complaints go hand in hand, and I’m sorry to say that in my experience, there is some truth to them.  If you really want to improve, you’ll need to learn to ask for feedback.


**Do this:** If you turn in a draft of a document your supervisor later finalizes, run a blackline to see how they edited your draft. If you have questions about some of the edits, ask your supervisor for a meeting to discuss.

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 7: Implement Feedback.**


Truly stellar summer associates implement the feedback they receive. I cannot overstate how impressive it is when I work with a junior attorney who listens to feedback and never makes the same mistake twice.


**Do this:** When meeting with a supervisor to get feedback, take good notes. Pay attention to comments about formatting in addition to the substance of your work. The next time you get an assignment, refer back to your notes and implement whatever feedback you can.

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 8: Use your mentors.**


At many offices, you will be assigned an official mentor or summer program coordinator.  Don’t be shy about asking them for advice about office norms, questions about particular attorneys you are working for, or available resources. They want you to succeed.


**Do this:** Reach out to your mentor to schedule meetings or lunches, however your program works. Don’t put all the burden on them to foster the relationship. When you do meet, come prepared with questions but be ready to listen to any advice they offer as well.

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 9: Attend the events.**


If you’re working at an office with an established summer program, you should make an effort to attend the events scheduled for you – trainings, observational activities, networking events, and social events.  Use these opportunities to make connections at the firm, get your name out, and learn.


**Do this:** Use the events to meet people generally. Don’t just talk to the other summers. You would be surprised how often that happens. Make it a goal to meet one new firm attorney at every event.

&amp;nbsp;


**Tip Number 10: Work hard, but don’t play too hard.**


I have very fond memories of my summer jobs during law school. Yes, it’s a 12-week long job interview in some ways, but it’s also an opportunity to meet lots of people and have a good time.  So have fun, but remember, you’re always on the job, even if the job is taking you to a Broadway show and bar afterward.  Memories are long. You don’t want to be the summer associate everyone gossips about for years to come.  People at my firm still reference the summer associate who got into a fistfight at an event afterparty.  More than ten years ago.


**Do this:** If you drink, don’t overdo it. Know your limits and pace yourself. Don’t feel like you need to close down every single afterparty, all summer.

6b1wkx,3,2017-05-13,My [29F] SOs [33M] (6 years together) 'Frat Boy' mentality is driving me crazy.,crazy67sshusb,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6b1wkx/my_29f_sos_33m_6_years_together_frat_boy/,"Hello reddit, I hope all of you are doing well today. I am looking for some advice with issues I am having in my relationship with my boyfriend, Chris, 33 years old. Sorry in advance, this will probably be long... 

---

Chris and I both met in college, well over 7 years ago now at a college in our home state of Arizona. At the time, I was around 22, and he was around 25/26, when we both met at a college party one of his friends was hosting at the time. Back then, especially after meeting Chris for the first time, I was very attracted to him. Chris was good looking, funny, life of the party kind of guy, and super easy to talk too. Chris and I kind of got to know each other through a handful of different events and parties throughout that year. It wasn't until we started seeing each other officially, and got into a committed relationship. Over the course of our the last 6 years being together, I am really happy to be with an amazing guy like Chris. 

That being said, I have been getting really tired of his ""frat boy"" mentality that he always seems to have; especially, when he is with his friends. During Chris' college days, he was involved in a frat house, which was only a couple blocks away from their campus at the time. Since he graduated college, a year after we met, he has always remained very close with a lot of his peers from that time period. I was in college from 18, until I was 26 (few years ago), which I was taking one of the specialized marketing/social media degrees that came through after a couple years of me already going to college. I mention this because I was never involved in any of these kind of groups. I was way too busy focusing on school and internships to get involved in this kind of thing. 

Since the Fall of 2016, a couple of Chris' old frat house friends moved back to our city in Arizona for jobs (or whatever I guess). Since a couple of these friends have moved to our area, Chris has spent a lot of time with these guys. I have no issue with him hanging out with his friends, and even doing his own thing. But, the last number of months have been getting out of hand. The constant partying, late night drinks, stumbling in the house in the middle of the night waking me up, and the lack of effort in our relationship has really started to wear on me. I think what really made this worse, was one of his friends purchasing a house, and renting it out to college kids. Chris has spent a lot of time there partying with his friend, and other young guys and girls that live at this house. 

I'm not really sure *why* he has had the urge to get into this routine.. Again.. But, I really can't stand aside and just watch him turn his ""outside of work life"" into him being a frat boy. I actually kind of hate his mentality when he is around his friends, or whenever he is talking about going out with his friends to drink, party, and have fun. I think a lot of this also makes me insecure; especially, when he hangs out at his friends house that he rented out to those college students. From my understanding, the young people (early to mid 20s) that his friend (Brian, 31 I believe? Not sure 100% sure..) is pretty close with a couple of the tenets. So, usually, they are always partying together and drinking with these college kids. I know that there is a lot of alcohol consumption between Chris and his friend, but I think it is getting a bit out of hand. 

I also get insecure knowing there are a lot of ""younger"" attractive college girls around him and his friends. I trust Chris 100%, but still, you never know what happens when you put yourself in these situations. I guess what I am upset about is the fact that I want Chris ""present"" in our life. I want to have his friends, have his own life, and do what he wants. But on the flip side, I want him to care about me, our life together, and him taking care of himself (diet and exercise would be nice). But, I just don't know how to even approach this topic with him. I am usually very upfront and honest with him on everything. I guess I am just at odds right now.. I mean, both of us are at a point in our lives, where I feel he should be more committed to our relationship.

Am I overreacting here? Thank you for reading.

6b2bms,0,2017-05-14,do exclusive fwbs exist?,agbbthrow,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/6b2bms/do_exclusive_fwbs_exist/,"So I'm done with my first year of college. At first, I only came out to my friends when they asked about it. After a few months in, I met this amazing guy and we decided to become exclusive and public boyfriends after a month. Things went great throughout the year, but we were both busy with usual job, gym, school, and org officer and that made a lot of schedule conflicts with most things getting cancelled and conflicted on my part. As a result, we rarely did boyfriend stuff, maybe once a week, and I neglected him attention wise and I'm sure I hurt him with that even though I tried not to. Sex wise its pretty great, I can squeeze a bj here and there between work and studying and we seem to be compatible and both vers dom/sub wise. 

I could feel he was getting tired of me being busy all the time lately. In hindsight, I shouldve realized I wasnt ready for one but thats in the past. I think its time to end things seeing that he'll be going back home and I'll be doing an internship over the summer.

We're both not really the hook up/party animal type and were both really paranoid about catching STDs which is why we wanted to be exclusive. I still want to be with him, but I dont want to neglect him any further so I'll be talking with him about ending things real soon. But before I do, I wanna ask, are exclusive fwbs common and is it selfish for me to ask him/want one?

tldr: got a bf, got busy, pretty much became fwbs, he feels hurt and annoyed, about to end things but still want to be an exclusive fwbs with him. "

1. Have you learned that releasing a quarter complete game in a non working state is a bad idea?
2. How do you feel about the results of focusing the game completely on the capcom pro tour instead of focusing on releasing a game for the consumers to enjoy? 
3. Why would a rootkit ever even be in consideration for the game? Much like requesting consumers to turn off anti virus software and open ports for your game to finally work?
4. Are there any plans to stop using a mobile game server for SFV and maybe hiring a 2nd person to help the poor intern with his work?  
5.Can we get a new chun li outfit?

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
6b3gwu,449,2017-05-14,My story... Learn from it. Critique it.,FI_Throwaway_Brotato,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6b3gwu/my_story_learn_from_it_critique_it/,"Good morning,

I'm in the dreaded middle portion of saving for FI and I've been reading this sub for a while so I feel pretty comfortable with what I'm doing, but I wanted to share my experiences (a) to hopefully help others at different phases and (b) to see if there are any glaring errors in my philosophy. I've decided to break it up by life event/age to show decision points with pros and cons.
 

My current breakdown is as follows:


Age: 31


Salary: ~90-100k/yr  


Savings (cash): 60k


TSP (401k): 123k (~4% match from job)


Roth IRA: 56k


Mutual Fund: 7k


Wife's 401k: 30k


Wife's IRA: 30k


Wife's Salary: 60k and 10k post baby


We have a house. Paid 360, put 20% down. Currently owe 280k @3.75% 30 year mortgage.


Total expenses are roughly 4k/month (incl. mortgage).



Timeline:



**High School**

My family is solidly middle class we were never ""without"" but we never had expensive things and 

lived fairly modestly. I did well in school and got good grades. Worked at a bagel shop in the 

summers. I got into a prestigious engineering school and got good scholarships, but would still 

need loans.

**College**

Majored in mechanical engineering (love it, born to do it). Went to prestigious engineering school 

for 1 year. Hated it. Went back to a state school and got free tuition. Worked a lot. At one point 

I had 5 jobs working mornings, afternoons, evenings, nights, weekends. I paid all my 

living/food/car/book expenses on my own. Got an internship which led to my first job. Didn't really 

""save"" money, but I had to be thrifty because I basically lived paycheck to paycheck.

*Pros:* 

- Probably good to go to state school since I wasn't that motivated. 

- Working helped me get out of school with no debt. 

- Majoring in ""STEM"" was a good move although it wasn't the craze it is now (graduated in 2009).

- My side jobs were good work experience and helped me get my first job. 

*Cons:* 

- All the work impacted my grades and my mental health. 

- Became very stressed and depressed. 

- Wish I studied more and made more friends.


**Early Career/Relationship**


Started working right during the recession and felt lucky to have a job (soon after getting hired I 

watched half my staff get laid off). I broke up with a girl who had a lot of student loans (not the 

only reason, but it was in the background). This was when I started to become financially aware, 

thinking long-term. Realized I liked another girl in part because we had similar financial views. I 

switched jobs from private sector to Gov (close by). Took a small pay cut, but got a large raise 6 

months later. I started my Roth IRA (max) and started matching 401k. After a few years I realized 

if I put the yearly max in the 401k, soon the ROI would make more than I could possibly put in, so 

I started maxing my 401k. I started an EMPLOYER PAID Master's degree (Mech Eng) part time while I 

was working.
 
*Pros:* 

- The Government is a very good job: exciting, decent pay, pension, tsp, good health benefits.

- I'm glad I met girl #2 because she is now my wife and we are into saving money together(&lt;-- this is a huge pro, something to seriously consider).

*Cons:* 

- Sometimes I wish I had traveled more or gotten a job farther from home. 

- The MS was nice, but it was long and a lot of work to do part time. I missed out on a lot of socialization and life exploration during that time and the MS didn't really help me at work.


**Current**


I got married, bought a house, and had kid. The house is a little bigger/more expensive than I 

really wanted, but there really wasn't a lot on the market at the time. We didn't max out the 

mortgage, just based it on what we could afford and still save money with just my income. Our 

strategy is to have this be our ""forever home"" so as not to incur real estate agent/selling/buying 

fees and the hassle of moving. Our strategy was to put 20% down and still have an ""emergency fund"" 

enough to buy a new car or do major repairs. Also decided to do 30 year vice 15 year mortgage so I 

could put the max in my 401k/TSP. I make my own lunch almost every day and we buy used cars in cash 

(We have an 07 and just bought a 2010). I do a lot of the home maintenance on my own. We don't 

really budget, but we have a pretty good hold on how much we spend.A few years ago I really dug 

into understanding taxes and one of our strategies is to reduce them (mostly with TSP contributions 

to stay under 25% tax bracket, house deduction, and decreased withholding to have more money in my paycheck and less tax return).

My wife started working only a few days a month after we had our kid. We live close to my parents 

for free childcare. We didn't want to do daycare because after figuring out the cost and taxes, 

etc. my wife would basically be working to pay for it.

We don't really have a college savings strategy except to just save for our own retirements. I'm want to convince my children to go to our state school. 

I might not RE, but at this point I feel confident in our financial position. If I stick with the government until I'm 57 I will get around 30% of my pay for a pension + social security + TSP + Roth. We may even end up in the situation where we're making too much money in retirement! I plan to do this math soon...

If anyone is wondering why we have a ton of cash it is because (a) we have a lot of house repairs coming up (paint, new roof) and (b) I may use some of it to take some time off or start a business.

*Pros:* 

- Being married to someone with similar financial values is good. 

- Kid isn't too expensive (not counting missed earnings from wife) and having a kid is awesome. In terms of FI we got a lot of hand-me-downs and we buy used stuff so we haven't spent much and you get a pretty sizeable tax break. 

- The house is nice. We never feel like we need to take a vacation and it's probably worth about 30k more than we bought it for a few years ago. 

- Majoring in Engineering and being ""hands on"" have saved me tens of thousands in home maintenance.

- The Emergency fund came in handy 1 month after buying the house we had a tragedy and had to spend money.

- Starting early with the ROTH and TSP were good. Last year, my TSP made more than I put in for the first time (!!!). This was ~5 years in the making.

- The mortgage interest tax deduction for us is decent.

- I like my job. Supposedly you make less working for the government, but I don't think I'd make much more. Also, my week is 40 hrs and the job is stable. 

*Cons:*

- A house is a lot of work and expensive and at this point is the thing that will hold us back from RE. It would be much more expensive if I didn't do a lot of the work and repairs myself. Also, I genuinely enjoy designing, building, and fixing things and I feel that these skills build my professional credentials. If you have other interests or prefer to not do home maintenance on the weekends you'll have to pay someone to do these things. Seriously, in terms of RE it might be better to rent. I hate landlords though, so...

- The mortgage interest tax deduction for us is decent, but it's not huge (last year we were about 4k over the standard deduction). It gets better if (a) you are in a high tax bracket and (b) you have a bigger mortgage.

- Jury is still out on 15 yr mortgage vs. 30 yr and invest in TSP obviously my bet is that investment is a better choice, but I haven't actually done the math.

Lots of edits: Formatting, age...Also should mention we had a very inexpensive wedding with about 27 people at my wife's parents' house which was a good savings, but still allowed us to have a celebration.

6b49ui,12,2017-05-14,[Spoilers] One time appearances in the MCU movies,hyperbuster,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6b49ui/spoilers_one_time_appearances_in_the_mcu_movies/,"So I was randomly thinking about the awesome Marvel Cinematic Universe (as you do) and was especially wondering about the great continuity i.e. stuff that carries over from film to film.
However, I thought it'd be interesting to remember the characters and some interesting things that we (probably) won't be seeing again.

I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway.  After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt my self. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch. 

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa.... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are."
6b4vqo,2,2017-05-14,I [21F] am considering breaking up with my boyfriend [21M] of two years because of his naive and passive behavior,badguygf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6b4vqo/i_21f_am_considering_breaking_up_with_my/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for two years, and lately I've been getting more and more upset at his naive and passive behavior. He hates correcting people or escalating an issue and almost never does it, because he thinks of it as a major confrontation, when it doesn't have to be. He hardly ever even follows up with anyone about anything, because he has he doesn't want to tell them how to do their job, which has caused him problems before.

He lost the chance to apply for an internship I thought he had a good chance at getting, because the registrar never sent in his transcript. I kept telling him he should ask them to send it again, but he said he was sure they knew what they were doing and would send it. Eventually, it was so close to the deadline that I told him he should go to the registrar, explain that the original transcript request was never done, and that he needed it sent immediately for the application. He wouldn't do it, because there might be people ahead of him on the request list and it would be unfair to them. He also said he didn't want to blame the registrar because it could have been lost in the mail, or the internship people could have lost it. I said this was unlikely, because the copy he ordered for himself never arrived either. He said he wasn't going to go ""yelling and screaming"" to the registrar, which I never told him to do. He decided not to bother, and claimed that the internship wasn't that great anyway, which I knew was a lie.

He got mad at me for correcting a customer service rep who was new at his job and making mistakes, and asking if someone more experienced could help. I thought I was polite, and the guy didn't seem to be offended, but my boyfriend acted like I had screamed at him and called him a piece of shit. He said I might have offended the worker, and I'm sorry but if I did I don't care. If someone can't handle being corrected and asked to get help from someone else, how are they going to handle having a job? I guess we should have just stood there forever and watched the guy suffer?

He also got mad at me after a trip we just took, when we stayed in a hotel. I was being overcharged, and I was suspicious that the desk agent was scamming us. My boyfriend kept trying to tell me to let it go, and said he'd pay me the difference, which the desk agent latched onto which made it even harder. I kept challenging him, and he eventually realized his ""mistake"" that I was being overcharged. He said I would be charged the correct amount, and I said I would be sure to check. My boyfriend said that was really rude, and that I should have just let it go since it wasn't much money. 

The next morning, I decided to complain to the day employee, which my boyfriend tried to stop me from doing. I barely got five seconds into my explanation when the desk agent knew exactly which employee I was complaining about, and what had happened. She gave me the owner's contact information and urged me to complain to him, and said that the guy had overcharged someone else before. My boyfriend said the problem was fixed and to just let it go, but I called the owner anyway.

I've talked to him about this problem before, and he always says that he will try harder to be more assertive in the future, but always goes back to his old ways. This worries me, because if we stay together we will eventually have our own home and a family, and everything he does will affect us too. He claims that he will do better and not allow things like being taken advantage of at work, or allowing our kids' school to ignore issues they are having, but if he can't even handle this stuff, how can he handle higher stakes issues? I'm tired of being the bad guy.

I want to make it clear how serious this is. I am considering breaking up with him over this, but I don't want to tell him this and have it come off as a threat. I just want him to understand how big of an issue this is.

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is extremely passive. How do I explain that I can't be in this relationship unless he gets more assertive"
6b5jcm,10,2017-05-14,Questions about applying to graduate schools and PHD programs,curious_bio_student,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/6b5jcm/questions_about_applying_to_graduate_schools_and/,"**Student Background**

Hello, I'm a student at a state school in the midwest (USA).  I'll be graduating in a year with a degree in Environmental Science with a concentration in biology.  I was planning to apply for field biology positions, as well as lab positions and really anything I could get after graduating.  I've talked to several advisors and faculty members at my school and they think I have a good chance of getting a job after graduating because of the experience I have.

**Experience** 

I've assisted in a few research projects, and I have experience quantifying animal behavior from videos and also some experience identifying algae using microscopy.  I have experience with basic lab work, both chemical techniques like phosphorus analysis and ion chromatography and bio lab work like weighing/measuring/identifying plants.  I worked with another student on a 9 month project looking at land use, environmental variables (P, N concentrations and ratios), and algal blooms.  We presented that at our undergraduate symposium and we are hoping to publish a paper on our work. (not 100% sure if we will be able to, but we're trying).  

I'm spending the summer assisting an ecology professor.  I'll be doing some lab work but mainly learning R and trying to learn how to analyze previously collected ecological data sets, hopefully forming my own hypothesis after analyzing data and reading relevant literature.  Its an on going project.  I also have a part-time unpaid internship quantifying stream depth, vegetation cover, and other variables for a local non-profit watershed council.  I'll also gain a bit of experience doing education/outreach with school groups through that internship, and hopefully further my GIS skills. 

By the time I graduate, I will have hopefully presented again at our undergraduate symposium, presenting the work I'm doing this summer (which will continue into the fall and perhaps longer) with the ecology professor I mentioned.  There is a good chance I'll have experience doing snake surveys by then as well.  

I need one more research credit or internship to graduate as well, and I'll hopefully be interning at a consulting agency or government agency. (I'm not 100% sure what exactly I want to do with my life, so hopefully I can contrast non-profit work with government or private sector work to give myself some direction).

I feel like I have a good amount of experience and strong references and I think I have a good chance of getting a job after I graduate. 

**Why I'm writing this post** 

However, I was talking to a few professors recently, and I've been strongly encouraged to apply for graduate school and phd programs, and I've started to consider going straight into a program instead of working for a few years first (my previous plan) 

I'm writing this extremely long post today to try and figure out how strong of a candidate I'd be for grad school or a phd program.  I have a meeting with an advisor in a week, but I figure it can't hurt to get as many perspectives as possible.

**Important Info**

I'd want a higher degree in ecology, environmental science, or conservation biology

I'm interested in things like using biology/ecology to understand environmental threats to human populations and using biology/ecology to understand effects of climate change and other human-related issues on natural and human systems.  I'm interested in urban environments, or environments that have been modified by humans.  I'm really interested in a concept I came across called reconciliation ecology, don't know how realistic it is to study that.  

My school is not well known and isn't prestigious or hard to get into.  However, the bio department is one of the largest, and considered one of the better programs at our school.  Our environmental science program is young but is science based and is a B.S., I take mostly science classes.  A plurality of my credits are biology.

My GPA upon graduation will be 3.40-3.50.  My grades were worst as a freshman, and have gotten better every year.  Got a 3.83 and 3.97 the two most recent semesters.  My major GPA is higher than my overall GPA. 

I will be able to get at least three strong recommendation letters from professors and (internship) supervisors I've worked with closely.  

Like I mentioned above, I have a lot of research experience and will have done two internships (one field work, one TBD) upon graduation.  Will have possibly published a research paper.  

**One last piece of really important info**

I'm from a big-ish city (40-70th biggest in the USA) and went to college in a small town.  I really want to get back to a bigger city, and the dream is to move to New York City to join some family that has moved there.  If not NYC, I'd really like to move to a larger city in the USA or abroad, if that is a possibility.  I know everyone wants to live in places like these, making schools more competitive, but that is what I really want to do if possible.  

**How strong of a candidate am I for a Masters Program or PhD program in a larger city in the USA or another English speaking country?**

Also, might as well ask, how strong of a candidate am I for jobs upon graduating?  What kind of jobs come to mind? (I know this is kind of a generic question?

Any suggestions for programs/schools I should look into?

Anyone who read all the way through this and tried to answer some of my questions, THANK YOU so much! I'm trying to figure out my future and hearing from other people in related fields offers me great perspective.  

**Tl;dr:  Student, soon to get B.S., details his past experience, grades, and potential ideas for what to do after graduation.  Asks how strong of a candidate he is for grad/phD programs, thanks readers for answering questions :)**"
6b6ben,4,2017-05-14,Impeachment? Give this man a medal.,orkastratdchaos,thedonald,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedonald/comments/6b6ben/impeachment_give_this_man_a_medal/,"The Washington Post posted an article last night written by a Professor of law at Harvard University. The article or just another chapter in the witch hunt I like to call it, was titled “Trump must be impeached. Here's why.” 
    Okay, so let's look at the reasons why; according to this esteemed law professor. 

            “The remedy of impeachment was designed
to create a last resort mechanism
for preserving our constitutional  
system. It operates by removing
executive-branch officials who  
have through what the framers  
         called “high crimes and misdemeanors”
      that they can't be trusted to continue
in office.”                                  
   
   He further goes on to say:
“Now the country is faced with a 
                 president whose conduct strongly suggests 
that he poses a danger to our
system of government.”

   My question here is what is it that this man has done that no other president hasn't done in recent history? Every president since the first one I can remember (Ronald Reagan), has made a case for themselves at one time or another for impeachment. 
   The aforementioned Ronzo came under scrutiny for possibly making a deal with the Iranians, to not release hostages until after the election. And let's not forget the Iran Contra hearings and the infamous “I don't recall” response. Yet this man went onto become one of our most beloved presidents. 
   His successor, George Sr. Oh let's see, there was the whole Manuel Noriega thing that got conveniently swept under the rug. That man had the gull to stand in front of a nation and declare his war on drugs, yet was the most powerful drug dealer in the world at that time. We all knew it, we all saw it; but never, not one whisper of impeachment. 
    Bill Clinton. Where to begin with this country bumpkin? He was known to have shady business dealings in Arkansas. Started out with a lie that no half witted adult would ever buy about toking a joint but not inhaling. Reasons for impeachment? I'd say no, but definitely speaks to his character. And yet we elected him twice. Then there was that mess with that pie face of an intern. I mean, JFK and Marilyn, Bill and Lewinsky? Enough said.  
    George W., now here was a bright one. This closet alcoholic literally stole an election right in front of an entire world. And if that's not enough for your impeachment argument, how about the fact that he knew about 9/11 and did nothing to stop it. I realize that is speculation and there is no documented proof as to such, but come on. We have all seen the tapes of the moment he was informed of the attacks and the time it took for him to react. There are only one of two explanations for this when looked at with just a little common sense. Prior knowledge, or he was inebriated. Either way he was unfit to hold office. Yet not one hint at impeachment. In fact we elected the mental midget again. 
    Barack Obama, now this was a silver tongue devil if we have ever seen one. So much has been made about Trump's use of social media. Who do we think started this trend? Now as to an argument for impeachment? Again, this is all speculation but I find it hard to believe that our president had no knowledge of the events surrounding Edward Snowden. Millions of Americans had their privacy blatantly invaded and the president had no knowledge? Where I come from two plus two always equals four. Not to mention I think it looks quite bad that this man is to be charged with treason if he returns to our shores. Why? Because he told the truth? Sounds like someone is afraid of their own dirty laundry to me. 
     The point here is that every president has come under suspicion of one immoral or unethical act for generations. But to single this president out as any different is a direct slap in the American public's face. Remember he was elected, like it or not by we the people. To call this mans indiscretions any more of a “high crime” than anything else that has taken place in the oval office throughout history is just plain retarded.  
     In response to the statement that we now have a president that poses a danger to our system of government. Let me just say, it's about flipping time! What have the cookie cutter Washington politicians done for us by following those idiotic guidelines? Nothing that's what. Health care is still not in the budget for most Americans and the war on terror marches on relentlessly.
     So just what is our system of government? Continuing to be the worlds doormat while foreign economies prosper from the largest consumer market in the world? Allowing corporate dollars to influence our lawmakers into decisions such as NAFTA, allowing millions of American jobs to be shipped overseas? 
     Or maybe it's we play with American lives for a decade plus in a war that settled absolutely nothing. Other than to put us in a record national debt. This all coming from a retired United States Marine, mind you.
    In the beginning, I was anything but a Trump supporter and I will be the first to admit that the man needs to act his age and not his shoe size at times. But what the man has done in just over his first one hundred days in office, is nothing short of miraculous. He ordered the finishing of the Dakota pipeline which met with tremendous criticism, never realizing that he's trying to make us less dependent on foreign oil. 
    He has set the foundation for tax breaks that will benefit every American not just those with the silver spoons. Numerous corporations are already adding thousands of jobs and there is economic optimism for the first time in decades. The stock market which literally every person “in the know.” predicted would tank upon his election, hasn't only recovered but has flourished. 
    He has been ridiculed for trying to negotiate better trade agreements with China that have been way overdue. What's wrong with trying to get us a bigger slice of the pie?
    He repealed Obama-care, which let's face it made about as much since as pissing in the wind. It wasn't financially feasible to low income Americans, who were then fined for not carrying the coverage. Am I really the only one that sees the irony in that? “But he's destroying Obama's legacy.” Well Barack baby if that's all you have to hang your legacy on after eight years in office then Mr. Trump did you a favor. Saved you some face. Now I'm not saying that Trumps solution so far has made any more sense. But to dismiss him in under six months of presidency is ludicrous. 
     I will be the first to admit that I think he is a racist and I have no doubt that he's a sexist. Not to mention a Class A asshole. But any president that has shown this level of commitment to making us truly independent again is worthy of my support. 
     To respond directly to the author of this article in the Washington post. I want you to know that I served my country proudly, and what I thought was the American dream. But I have to say that people like you make me sick. It is people like you that allow corporate America to continue to run the show. They hold the purse strings of almost every politician in Washington. But what happens when that “system of government” as you call it is challenged? A witch hunt ensues. 
     It literally pains me physically, to think that you are allowed to spew this kind of crap to the bright legal minds of our future. Our world is in turmoil after generations of division. An ounce of unity may go a long way. Just a thought.

I am in college and I have time over the summer, Yay! I play Duos with my Roommate but he has an internship that will take up his time, which means I won't have anyone to play over the summer. Not a preference, But I am looking for some players who are also in college!

I currently play rocket league and PUBG constantly, But I also play a variety of games such as Overwatch, BF1, HoTS yet not as often.

I am able to communicate over Discord and TS.

6b77ob,1,2017-05-14,M4F Multiple plots involving parents,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6b77ob/m4f_multiple_plots_involving_parents/,"Hello! I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships. Read On!

 1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.

 2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 

3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature 

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 

Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."

6b86f5,9,2017-05-14,"Guess who got the internship! Also, some rambling",elf-in-orange,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/6b86f5/guess_who_got_the_internship_also_some_rambling/,"Yo gurl did!

They said they loved my application and interview, called it ""thoughtful"", even. I guess anticipating what people might react better to was one skill my mother got me used to, heh.

Not really. I'm an extrovert, but socialising is hard for me. Making small talk is agonising. I miss so many social cues, while my sensitivity to every reaction is turned up to 9. Last year I spent Monday to Friday on campus with other students hoping to make lasting friendships, but I haven't spoken to most of them like I hoped to after the semester finished, while others have each other's numbers. I still feel isolated. People don't like me unless I'm happy - it's a general thing too, I think. I do get why. Negativity is super contagious and no one is obligated to be around me when I'm not all happy. But to self-pity a bit, I try so, so hard. And a lot of the time, I still feel so isolated, like there's a barrier I can't break.

In 2015, my mother decided she had to save me from hell when I lived with her and wanted to move to a different city, so she tried to coerce me into never leaving her. Literally. If I didn't do what she wanted, she would have me shut up inside her house, shuttled to and from any work I got, presumably a job she found me at her department, with any social outings supervised. She might even have replaced my phone with a traced, logged one. As you might imagine I wasn't so keen. For those months I lived with her, she constantly told me I was ungrateful, telling me it was like I wasn't her daughter anymore, at one point saying it was a mistake to give me the independence I had as a kid. By the end of it, I had only a vague idea of who I was and what I liked and what I thought might be the right things to do. Who the fuck was I?

I don't know if I remember yet. But now comes along this internship, which is essentially 50% networking and events. And I've gotten it. Is it risky? Idk, maybe. But I'm going to work goddamn hard to kick ass in this role and prove to myself, because you know what I'm smart and relentless and fucking good at what I love doing, and no matter how much 2015 drags me down, I'll kick and scream and resurface.

And, you guys, it is a hard journey. But keep remembering that no matter how deep in you are, the surface is always there when you're ready.

Sending everyone lots of hugs. Thank you for listening to me whine about how nervous I was about the interview. It paid off. :)"

F5 got a rule to recognize Outlook/Exchange requests and letting them through (some template that is used). We added the IP ranges from MS, that they also will be let through (and to allow Negotiate as auth.), and later even a rule for them, to go straight to our Exchange Server. But they somehow don’t get recognized anyway and the error is still the same.

&amp;nbsp;

To test if everything is working if it wouldn't go via F5 (tried different username combinations or even different accounts), we created a new server (and domain record) with NAT, in order to point directly to our on premise Server (Firewall lets only O365 IP’s through).

&amp;nbsp;

With the same credentials, we used above, the test is successful (while pointing to the NAT).

&amp;nbsp;

PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; Test-MigrationServerAvailability -ExchangeRemoteMove -Credentials $UserCredential1 -RemoteServer o365.domain.com 
RunspaceId         : XXXX

                     IsPublicFolderMailboxesMigrationSource=""False"" /&gt;
SupportsCutover    : False
ErrorDetail        : 
IsValid            : True
Identity           : 
ObjectState        : New 

&amp;nbsp;

From what I have read, the best solution would be an iApp Template for O365, active on the F5.

&amp;nbsp;

But while reading the pdf I noticed that the Exchange online server will be running in ADFS mode. 
A company helping us setting up the Hybrid (but having 0 experience or knowledge about the F5, the advice we get is to remove it completely from protecting the Exchange), says we don’t want and ADFS under any circumstances (at least in our network, if it's the exchange online server, mayby it wouldn't be that bad).

&amp;nbsp;

We want hybrid for the future possibility of migrating mailboxes, plus people want SSO and MFA.

&amp;nbsp;

Any other opinions, or ways to overcome this error? Any ways to get it working? The NAT option would be a plan B for migrations, but if it would work with the standard external URL, that would be awesome. Anyone got experience with it, and would be kind enough to give a tip (aside from changing the helping company :D )?

6bah2z,8,2017-05-15,Mom holding life-changing internship over my head.,mhm646,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6bah2z/mom_holding_lifechanging_internship_over_my_head/,"Hi all, first time poster looking for some guidance as I drive to my parents home and have to deal with this situation. 

For some background, I'm a nearly 21 year old rising college senior. I study engineering at one of the top public universities in the country and use scholarships and prepaid for nearly all of my tuition, but my parents pay for my other expenses. My NMom has used this fact to get me to do whatever she wants since before I started school (i.e. deciding what relationships/friendships I can have, where I can go to school, what I can participate in, etc.) by threatening to remove her support. The way federal loans work, there is a very slim chance I could prove my situation in time to get the money I would need to stay in school, and if I keep dealing with her I can walk out with my degree debt-free. 

However, this summer I was unexpectedly offered a career make-or-breaking opportunity to intern at a prestigious national lab. I accepted, of course, and have since gone through the process to prepare, including finding a place to stay. To NMom's dismay, the position is on the complete opposite side of the country (I've never been more than 5 hours away from her). She is upset with this, as well as any number of things (like my boyfriend not coming to visit with me enough or me staying at school for an extra week to pack up my belongings so they can be shipped) and will not sign the rent contract as the consigner so that I can finalize my living situation. 

As it stands, her keeping me from this position affects my ability to get a job after I graduate, as well as my reputation as a professional in my field (it's a small one). If I find a way to go against her efforts, I will also essentially be making the decision to go NC and be completely on my own for finishing school. I'm unsure of how to handle this situation so that it doesn't have to get to that point, and what to do if it does. TIA for any guidance you can give. "
6bam1i,1,2017-05-15,22 [M4F] Swapping Bodies With My Neighbor,OscarrWills,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6bam1i/22_m4f_swapping_bodies_with_my_neighbor/,"Stepping out of the cab I looked at my old neighborhood and all could think was “I’m home.” Eddie Mara was recent college grad and after years of spending his summer’s doing internships and jobs across the country he decided to spend his last summer before heading out into the real world at home with his family. Two weeks into his vacation he saw his neighbor Mrs. Anderson unpacking groceries from her car.

Now Mrs. Anderson was the kind of neighbor that most guys would kill to have. Sure, she was a bit older but her body could pass for a girl in her mid-20’s. Growing up Eddie was constantly helping her out around the house. Mrs. Anderson’s husband was always away on business trips so he paid Eddie to help out around the house. Needless to say, Eddie had a crush on his neighbor for most of his life, and seeing her again after all these years she was still a knockout.

He decided to help her out for old times’ sake and after catching up Mrs. Anderson offered Eddie a bit of work for the summer. Naturally, he agreed. It meant getting to spend for time with his hot neighbor and make money.

A week later after mowing Mrs. Anderson’s lawn she called him in to have a drink and talk. Eddie found about how Mrs. Anderson was having trouble with her husband and how she was wishing that she could have pursued her dreams instead of settling down as a housewife.

“And that’s the reason why I’m taking your body” She let out menacingly. Before Eddie could even react, he felt the world around him go black. By the time he came to all he found a lavishly decorated bedroom, Mrs. Anderson’s bedroom. As he got up he felt something was different, no everything was different. At that point he saw his own body walk into the room.

“You’re gonna make a great housewife honey, don’t you worry.” His own voice said. Looking down he saw Mrs. Anderson’s clothes, her body, everything. Eddie’s summer was just getting interesting…"
6bb4vw,55,2017-05-15,"I [27 F] want to get a degree but the university is far away but husband [26 M] says it may end in divorce, to go or no?",Femmdelacrem,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6bb4vw/i_27_f_want_to_get_a_degree_but_the_university_is/,"Posted this in the advice subreddit too but nobody commented.

My heart is torn and full of fear. Just got out of the military, served 7 years, came back home to Texas with my husband. Our marriage is a little on the rocks and we are working on it. We've been together 5 years, married 1. I was gone on deployment a lot and he was missing me. Worked 15+ hour days and come home exhausted wanting nothing to do but sit on the couch and vegetate. I unintentionally shut him out and he still feels the hurt. I have mental and other medical issues caused by the military which is also taking a toll. Slowly getting help, the VA is the definition of slow lol.


We just moved into a new apartment a month ago and I thought I had my future figured out. Husband and I are going to the local community college, him for computer engineering and I for Landscape design and Horticulture. I looked it up online and thought it was great, I love gardening, and permaculture, sometimes I fantasize looking at a place thinking how it could be better utilized and it just look better. The thing is this is just an AAS program, it's just a technical degree no guarantee if any credits would transfer if I pursue an Landscape architect degree.


The only university closest to us that offers landscape architecture is over 2 hours away. There is a closer one but only offers a graduate program and is an hour away. My husband is tired of moving, in his words tired of being dragged around because of my dream.
As we talked about options, I could feel both of our hearts sinking, that deep emotional, tensed feeling like right before stepping through a door. He does not want to move (I don't blame him) and if we did there are no other universities in the town so he would be forced to go to my school of choice or find a job, which would be incredibly unfair to him.


I don't want to waste my benefits on a technical degree that may not give me the boost I need in life. 99% of the jobs I've looked up for Landscape designer require bachelors or more in landscape architecture. So I've tried to compromise maybe I could do a semester here, knock out the prerequisites, and then move up there alone and come down every weekend. My benefits would support me for rent, food etc. My husband replied with saying that this wouldn't be good for me as the course work could be demanding not to mention building relationships in clubs etc would take a huge toll of my time. He believes our marriage can't really take more strain and we at a good point to fix and build upon, our first anniversary is next month. I don't want to leave my husband but also don't want to give up my goal.


I compromised and said I will just get this AAS and there's an internship at the end and hopefully get hired maybe at a nursery or design assistant. I'm thinking about using unemployment and use the money to pillow my savings and pay for my schooling instead of using the GI bill. I only have a year and a quarter then I'm done and doing the math, I would have enough courses towards the end to qualify for full benefits anyway.
Maybe getting this AAS would be a good way for building a portfolio so I could become an Landscape architect but there's a likely possibility that it would be for nothing other than serving a good foundation of knowledge.


I also feel the pressure of age, I'm 27, and I will be competing against people younger than me so time always feels to be this crucial factor that if I don't get in right now, I will be a 30's beginner and I want to maximize what time I have on this earth, you know? I can't stand that I live in this huge city with multiple universities and colleges and not one offers landscape architecture not to mention the lack of greener, permaculture sustainability movement like in the more hip cities. I want to design for long term and help people. Plants make me happy lol but planting with a purpose more so.


**TL;DR** So leave husband, who's tired of moving, for dream degree and most likely be miserable? There's never a guarantee for happiness or content-ness and the fear and anxiety are weighing me down.


Honestly, this would be a non issue if this damn city had what I needed, what a terrible oversight I made but family is here so that made separating and the move easier. I want us to flourish together.
Thanks for reading, writing all this down has made me feel better like a list that needs sorting out.
So, leave husband which ends in divorce, most likely be miserable but go to school with dream degree?

TBH I can't even believe I'm posting this on Reddit but I have to get it out somehow and I don't have close friends here. This is definitely a wine needing convo.
Resubmitted to fix formatting issues and added genders and relationship length.

**-EDIT** 
Wow, thanks guys for all your advice, I really took it to heart and even though this was a scary experience (to me), the variety of points of view expressed really helped open up my narrow mind and helped with my fear clouding my present. I reorganized my priorities, reached out to a firm and now have a lunch date where they are going to show off the office, gave me even more options than I realized I had to explore (I made a list just in case), and just were encouraging and supporting all around. 


Some of you gave me hard truths that I needed to realize, some tears were shed but squared my shoulders and raised my head acknowledging that really I am having a terrible silly moment. The ultimate goal can wait, our relationship can progress, I can still network, build up my knowledge base, and I have also reached out to other university VA offices to ask about remote programs I can do. I apologize if I haven't replied to everyone, it's difficult to track it all on mobile but please know I read your advice. Thank you to everyone who PM'ed me, the support and kindness helped me out of a self inflicted drama headlock and I am humbled and a little embarrassed. I will leave the post up as someone suggested as this may come to help someone else one day. 
To all of you, I wish you love, luck, and a thriving garden. "
6bb54o,61,2017-05-15,I'm (F21) stupidly jealous of my triad's (M21 &amp; F22) underemployment this summer - vent and advice,DefinitelyAtWorkRN,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/6bb54o/im_f21_stupidly_jealous_of_my_triads_m21_f22/,"Hi! Simple, stupid problem. 

For context, my SO (R) (M21) and I have been together for 2.5 years, and we have been seeing A (F22) for about 3 months now. We are all STEM students at an engineering college, and our relationship together has reached a positive, domestic vibe.

So, R and A have been looking for months for summer employment, to very little avail. Their job search and resulting continuous rejections has been miserable for them. They both have jobs, but they are by no means full-time, and are generally underpaying and disappointing. I, on the other hand, have a prestigious and enviable summer internship that I am immeasurable proud of, that is well-paying and amazing for my career.

But I am so jealous of them. I get to spend 40+ hours a week under fluorescent lights, bent over a laptop screen, while they get to enjoy the summer. They are planning to hang out, run, garden, work on the house - all sorts of cool plans - while I waste away in my cubicle.

I am jealous of their free time, I am jealous of the time they get to spend together, I am jealous of their comparative freedom. I realize all of these feelings are irrational, but I am just angry, and don't know how to deal with it.

Other factors:
1) We all feel money stress, but because of the comparative pay, I feel obligated to 'cover' for dates. I don't like this.
2) Their relationship has developed a lot faster and better than the relationship between A and I. We are getting there, but it still is a weird, gray area. I feel like this continued imbalance of time spend together is going to further this separation between her and I. 

Agh. I'm so dumb. Advice?"

&gt; Hi,

&gt; I have an offer at one firm for a full time grad role in September, however I also have a Summer internship at a different, and much more preferable company.

&gt; If I get a full time offer on the back of the internship, I would (as now) jump at the chance as it is superior in essentially every way, however, if i dont get the offer afterwards, I still need to work, therefore I would take the first firm.

&gt; Is there any legal reason in the UK that I cannot do this? My contract even states i can break the contract with only 1 weeks notice for the probationary period, so i would assume I can definitely break it before I start.

&gt; Has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do?

&gt; I feel somewhat bad as it is a reasonably small office and it would be quite a hassle for the, however, I cannot really risk the chance that I dont have a job by explaining the situation to them. (thoughts?)

&gt;Jumps is one of TextBlade's defining capabilities, 

Yeah buggy as all fuck, and entirely reliant on the work of people you can't control. 

&gt;and it's made possible by a unique new combination of qualities:

Lackadaisical approach to design rigour, unrealistic expectations of third party stability and dogged determination not to look reality in the face.  

      &gt;Key feel superior to others, yet in a size that goes anywhere.

Notably not specifying which ""others"", what is nebulously meant by key feel and no assertion about it efficacy. 

&gt;Once you use TextBlade, you quickly realize how integral the value of Jumps becomes.

Most people which have to take your increasingly worthless word for it, as they can't actually get hole of one. If your value proposition is that it works on loads of different stuff, I don't care. That was not the reason the 2015ers bought it. We wanted a fucking portable keyboard.

&gt;We've continued to expand our Test Release Group users, and they are giving Jumps a serious workout daily.

Is that so? More could be gained by doing actual testing as opposed to knocking out the occasional unit to those that your paranoid brains think won't fuck you over. Too late for that squire, far too fucking late for that...

&gt;It turns out that Jumps is also a super effective way to shake out any quirky use cases.

So back to user blaming then? *it's not our device, you are just using it wrong*

&gt;Jumps is sort of the extreme stress test for everything TextBlade can do, and every (sometimes crazy) thing we might want to do with a keyboard.

Honestly if it's you ""core"" thing, you shouldn't be positioning it as extreme test of your hardware. People have had switching keyboards out for a while now. 

&gt;Jumps darts from one Bluetooth connection to another at very high speed, and frequently.

Is that in the background or are you saying that's frequently describes how TREG members use it? Or what?

&gt;It whisks you over from one host operating system to another.

I imagine that is what is supposed to happen.

&gt;It gives you 6X more reasons to pair, and many good reasons to install diverse key maps.

Are these things desirable? 

&gt;It recognizes gestures to know when you want to jump, and it even prompts TextBlade to translate keystrokes automatically, so you can use the same commands even when your host machines are quite different.

Gestures? Like the middle finger I am currently typing this sentence with? Or the exasperated shrug with which I greeted this barely informative string of characters? The more ""it"" does of it's own volition the fewer shits I give. 

&gt;If there's any kind of latent issue in a nook or cranny, chances are Jumps will help find it.

All by itself? Maybe ""Jumps"" should manage your fucking project then, it seems smarter than you.

&gt;This past month we've been combing through the logs sent in by our TREG users, looking for hints of odd behavior when TextBlade is asked to do all these tasks in rapid succession, and across diverse machines and OS environments.

OK, this is an explanation for some time spent. Good.

&gt;Most of our users are now reporting smooth performance across their different systems,

Good, although I feel a ""but"" coming...

&gt;but

There it is.

&gt; there's still a meaningful incidence of peculiar scenarios. 

Context for this please. How about some numbers.  

&gt;We've gotten through many of these, and are checking off more each week.

Gotten though means fixed or recorded or what? 

&gt;We can't list all the little oddities we've fixed, but here's a few recent examples of where we're focused: 1. We found that in a few cases, all of the combined activity can occasionally put TextBlade into a ”La-La state” (credit to user Trace R.), where it gets confused and needs a reboot; and 2. We see some residual Bluetooth link interruptions in particular combos of OS's and sometimes other Bluetooth peripherals concurrently hooked up.

Bluetooth is shit, we know. 

&gt;To diagnose the Bluetooth quirks, we've had to significantly amp up our test and monitoring firmware.We now have deep diagnostic logging capability right inside the Bluetooth core, inside the actual Bluetooth stack.This industrial strength monitoring capability had to be custom made by our Dev Team, and all the data is transported up to our App so users can easily send it to us to analyze.This is very powerful, and when any user gets a log of a particular state, we can pretty confidently knock it out.We'll be continuing to settle these kinds of points over the coming weeks, and see what users report after our updates.

It's like you have never done actual grown up stuff before. 

&gt;Here are more topline topics we've worked out recently -

&gt;KB11 - Since the start of TREG, we've made 11 successive hardware build revisions.

Fuck you Dybbuk I was right. Eleven, count em

&gt;These changes were almost all under the hood.

Still not a car.

&gt;They're subtle, but make a big difference for reliability and the user experience.

Sounds like your internal testing was a bit poor. 

&gt; All of them were driven by reports from users, to which we reacted quickly with revisions.

IF you are going to be wrong 10 more times at least you could have done it more quickly

&gt;Now, in this last quarter, KB11 has remained unchanged.That's because there are no known changes needed.We've been updating earlier TREG users to this same revision.Based on their reports, we've not seen a reason yet to change it further. That's really good news, and a sign that the hardware is converging for General Release.

I would not be betting the farm on relying on what you ""know"". 850 plus days after you said you were done. 

&gt;Pairing - No one had ever made a Bluetooth keyboard so able to Jump quickly across 6 different hosts, or so portable that you'd want to. Once these abilities come together, it's compelling, and you find yourself pairing 6 times more often.High user uptake of Jumps taught us the ways users, or their computers, might get confused. We changed the pairing architecture to prevent contention between past and present pairings.There's a new ID allocation scheme, and a new Erase feature that lets users control many pairings from one place.This is in use right now and has already greatly improved the pairing experience.

If you have to tell me ""it's compelling"" it fucking isn't moron. You have UI for your BT implementation. yawn.

&gt;Bluetooth - During TREG, major operating systems like iOS and Sierra have gone through significant changes that adversely affected lots of Bluetooth devices made by a gamut ofmanufacturer's from Microsoft to BMW.Most of that is getting fixed now by the OS makers, but it exposed some risk areas that could affect link quality and reliability.We found some vulnerabilities through these stress cases.Based on what we learned, we were able to improve our internal workings to make them more immune.We hardened our BladeCom network that connects all 3 blades together, and made it more resilient against possible contention between the Bluetooth timing and BladeCom.Those changes are in users' hands now and testing well.We're currently analyzing another area that can affect link quality, which involves any event that might prompt a reset of our Bluetooth modem core.We currently see a minority of users report occasional link interruptions, and we think we can harden our system to improve its immunity to inappropriate resets.We'll test that as part of an upcoming release. Think of Bluetooth as plumbing.It's not what makes a house beautiful to you, but if those pipes were sometimes iffy, you might have to move.A sturdy Bluetooth link is not the glamorous technology here, but it's still important for wide release.

BT standards became more strict, OS's moved the same way, bullshit implementations started to fail. Deal with it.

&gt;OTA - Based on studying user OTA logs, we re-architected 

Not even close to being a word. Designed is probably appropriate, or built I suppose, but either might give an indication of your true position so just *verb* the *noun*. Arseholes.

&gt;the OTA process to provide more intelligent automatic recovery, and improve the user interface that reports progress.The process is now maintained with Cloud assets so it can be updated without needing to install new firmware or app builds.It's also smarter about caching assets from the Cloud so it can do an OTA even when offline. We are testing the new OTA with users now, and it's already more reliable.We'll make further OTA process refinements as we see any residual reports.

Hang on, your OTA (A cell phone standard) update process is itself updated through Cloud based (an Internet based) process? Also Updates are automatically cached, for example brick commands?

&gt;App Content - The App UI was reorganized to make getting started simpler for new users.We used data learned from TREG user interaction to create a simpler experience for the first-time user.We also added interactive Guide content to explore TextBlade's extensive feature set.When you receive your configuration email, even before your blades arrive, you'll be able to learn all about your TextBlade.More interactive guide content is being added to further support General Release.

Apple only, no shits given.

&gt;Cloud Intelligence - TextBlade is the only professional-grade physical keyboard that is fully defined by software. 

I call bullshit, it's physical dimensions are not defined by software. 

&gt;Users have unprecedented control over preferences for how it works.

This just says you control your preferences, not that you control the settings. It's shit-speak. 

&gt;You can shape the boundaries for keys,

I want my space bar to be a foot long.

&gt;and have it adapt to your personal physiology and typing style.

My skin exudes acid, and I type using a pair of gilded toffee hammers. 

&gt;As we learned more about what users liked, we added new intelligence to support it.

They like getting the shit they ordered, can your intelligence cope with that? 

&gt;We issued many firmware and app releases to accommodate requests.As we made a large number of these updates, we then built a new Cloud-based architecture to make it much easier to do.

I would say that is just accepting that you are blindly iterating and will need to speed up the number of screw ups you make. 

&gt;It can update TextBlade's knowledge without requiring any new builds of either the firmware or the app.

Conscious being have knowledge, shitty keyboards have information. 

&gt;It's all defined as parametric data on the Cloud.

Wooo. next you will be telling me that you are implementing a knowledge dump to your mother's mother regarding ovum evacuation procedure. Twats.

&gt;Now, even the detailed machine intelligence pattern recognition knowledge base is entirely maintained from the Cloud.

God damn buzzword bingo right there. Still using the word knowledge incorrectly. sigh I suppose I'll just chalk it up to your need to make your shit sound more involved than it is.

&gt;Every time you update your settings, it loads the latest knowledge of how it interprets human finger input.This allows TextBlade to get smarter, faster, and with less effort.Every user can benefit from all that is learned from the community of users.It's a very powerful software foundation to advance the technology, and makes TextBlade the most personalizable keyboard.

Stealing your usage data and selling it on to the next guy. Nice.

&gt;Here's more detail for those interested:

[All the old guff is here.]
(#sFlex PCB
The new flex install process is working well and has eliminated intermittent sensor connections. Thousands of new Flex PCBs were installed into TextBlades. Test Release Group customers in the field have given these new units a heavy workout in this past quarter. No intermittent pad connections have been reported since the update, so we have very good confirmation of the correction.
NanoStand
The newly reinforced NanoStands have been in use by TREG customers since December, with no reports of any sidewall fracture on the new tougher parts, so the changes have proven effective.The initial molded shots fit a little too snug on the blades, which caused a few users to see the rubber pad on the SpaceBlade peel back, but we've made some adjustments to correct that, and they seem to be working now too.We recently found a couple cases where certain types of stress could cause a tear to start in particular areas and we think an adjustment to the resin mixture should prevent that.
KeyCaps
New KeyCaps were molded, printed and installed on TextBlades. These new KeyCaps are reinforced to absorb high stress if a user pinches the sidewalls of the keys while pulling TextBlade from the NanoStand. The new parts have been in daily use by TREG customers for months with no reports of fracture, so the reinforcing has worked well.
We've also done 4 test printing run iterations of the metallic green resin ink formulation to harden it against wear. The latest factory test batch has proven much more durable in abrasion and solvent tests. We're doing another iteration with a specialized heat-curing cycle to finalize it for optimum hardness.
The green ink should have been simple to fix, but wasn't.Although the metallic silver ink resin has been strong, there were surprising subtleties in the chemistry of the green pigment. For quantitative perspective, less than 10% of TREG users filed reports on green legend fade, but the underlying chemistry problem was latent and clearly needed fixing.Given the software complexity of TextBlade, we wouldn't think 'green ink' would show up on the list of brain-teasers, but it did. Chemistry can be interesting.
We think we've got this issue licked now, and we'll confirm that we're all the way there with the next printing run. Currently we're shipping inventory from the earlier keycap batches for TREG testing until the final formulation has been verified.
User Logs
The TextBlade App has extensive infrastructure to run very detailed diagnostics on units in the field, and lets users easily send reports up to our servers.TREG users have been exercising TextBlades daily to verify each of the points we resolve. During daily typing, users can also log anything they feel may affect the user experience. These logs help us clear up other details, so general release users can benefit from these refinements. Here are some points TREG users helped log, and info about the work we've done to follow up.
Swaps
Our latest firmware release 7736 has several features designed to prevent swaps. Recent user feedback shows that they're working very effectively.
For background - Swaps are cases where characters on the same multitouch key may get transposed during typing. Human users can often transpose characters even on legacy keyboards, but we care here about any case where the machine itself may do a swap. These events are not typical, and hard to catch, but any customer log we get for an unusual case is very useful. We can analyze it, and resolve it with updates.
Generally, once we have a log showing a specific case, we can address it pretty quickly. Getting logs of the rarer cases was the tricky part, and why actual usage records from TREG customers in the wild are so powerful. Reviewing the customer logs lets us conclusively analyze and verify fine details of operation.
From the logs, we found that occasional swaps were caused by two principal sources: 1. Corner cases of the firmware logic - i.e. the machine intelligence that interprets hand inputs; and 2. unusual cases of measurement jitter in the hardware. We attacked both sources, and have now substantially knocked them out. More technical detail about the firmware and hardware updates follows below.
Shields
Within a single millimeter of thickness, TextBlade hardware has multiple layered structures that sense fingers, compute results, drive magnetic thrust, and shield TextBlade from external noise. All of this is in a very thin laminated stack, optimized for performance and manufacturability.
The shields must reject outside noise, yet remain ultra sensitive to finger inputs. TextBlade's shields are very effective at both. On some customer units, after extended daily use, we saw an unusual mechanical anomaly. In those units, jamming it in and out of the NanoStand clip daily could alter part of the shield lamination layer, causing occasional jitter on finger measurements. We solved this with a revision to the shield layer geometry and the lamination assembly method. This update also consolidated 6 separate parts into one, simplifying assembly, and strengthening durability. TREG customers have used this new configuration for months, so we now have excellent confirmation that the new shield is highly effective.
Software Swaps
Where legacy keyboards are a basic array of switches, TextBlade is actually a graphical computer, that can intelligently understand the intent of human input. We've seen occasional swaps caused when the pattern recognition algorithms encounter unexpected finger input combinations. These corner cases are pretty well mapped and resolved now.
Since there is a subjective dimension to how a human user perceives their own hand activity, we also saw logs that show that the machine indeed interpreted the measurements correctly, but the user simply prefers a different bias for that character. Based on these observations from our growing database of user data, we added some new user controls described below.
Boundary Preferences
Where you strike determines what character you get. These are the physical ""boundaries"" of each letter. Legacy keyboards have long used a fixed set of switches, so they have no means to change borders to adapt to individual needs. But with TextBlade's new multitouch key technology, it's now possible to actually reshape the response to whatever a user wants. The lines can literally be redrawn by the user, at will.
In the new firmware, we've added further support for user control over the boundaries of several new areas by popular request of current users. These sliders now have increased resolution to allow fine-vernier adjustment for personal preferences.
The new user controls are very useful to accommodate users whose hand shape or holding style may vary significantly from the statistical median. This new system in fact required some additional foundation elements in the firmware / App architecture to let us more fully parametrize how the multitouch keys operate. These parameters do not simply move numerical thresholds, they actually change the logical inferences made by the machine intelligence, in real time.
Feedback from users on these new controls has been quick, and positive. It confirmed the value of this capability as a meaningful step forward in comfort and accuracy relative to the legacy fixed-boundary keyboards. Part of TextBlade's ethic has always been superior ergonomics vs. any legacy keyboard, regardless of size. These new sliders put very satisfying power directly in users' hands to sculpt the response of TextBlade to suit their own preferences. We've continued to enhance these controls based on user requests, and now with release 7774, we maintain all these controls in the Cloud, so it's relatively easy to respond with further additions.
It's not necessary to change any of these settings from plain-vanilla center. TextBlade already outperforms legacy keyboard ergonomics out of the box, as set from the factory. But for those users who are into tuning to increase their own personal peak performance, it's a powerful new tool that will excite many keyboard purists.
Customer Comments
Customers in the Test Release Group (TREG have been using their TextBlades as their daily typers for a few months, and here are some of their recent comments -
""I received my treg unit a little over a month ago. I love it. I dumped all other keyboards and have only used the tb since.""
– Rick H.       
""After three weeks of heavy use, if I had to choose between updating my iPhone this year or buying a TextBlade, I would buy a TextBlade … it is noticeably unpleasant to use a standard keyboard in place of my TextBlade.""
– Chris T.       
""Feels better than my MacBook Pro and Mac wired keyboard.""
– Stuart G.       
""I think the vast majority of people are going to love the TextBlade within their first few minutes using it.""
– Marc H.       
""It's small. It feels substantial in my hands. It feels solid. I loved it straight away.""
– Rob N.       
""I think everyone who uses a keyboard on a mobile device will want one AND once they use it, they will want to use it on every computing device they own or interact with.""
– James M.       
Customers are loving their TextBlades! They're posting a lot about this new technology and how it changes typing. Read more of their (extensive comments and impressions on our Blog page here: What Users are Saying...
The user input from having hundreds of units in the field is incredibly powerful, and is helping us ready TextBlade for wide-scale general release. We've been able to make many performance improvements, squash bugs, and refine TextBlade so that all our customers can have an awesome product experience.
We'll add more TREG users right through to general release, to expand the diversity, and quality of validation so as to expedite general release.
For those who need more background on the technical points covered in this post, our previous orientation info is available on our blog article here.
Q-Bot Sentinels
Q-Bots are the quality assurance robots we use for testing. They can provide very thorough and precise data about the performance and feel of every individual key we manufacture.
These Q-Bots are effectively the Sentinels for our manufacturing line. They stand guard to assure that TextBlades have a consistently good feel for customers. We're scaling up a large fleet of these Q-Bots to support our general release shipments at high throughput.
In the graphic above, you can see some actual Q-Bot data from their automated test routines. That image shows a graph of force vs. distance, and you can see the characteristic force curve of TextBlade's unique MagLever magnetic thrust system.
The variation between these two keys is very small, which would be very difficult for a human inspector to discern the difference.But because the Q-Bot can measure down to 0.1 millimeter or 0.1 gram, it can easily report even subtle variations. This allows us to tightly control our build process.
In less than a minute, each Q-Bot collects over 40,000 measurement points on a KeyBlade.
Beyond the robotic hardware, Q-Bots also have a large amount of machine intelligence software to automatically analyze measurement data, and produce a detailed, finished test report. All of the performance metrics shown in the chart, and even the small anomaly - the 1 gram kink marked in red - all of this was recognized automatically by the Q-Bot machine intelligence, without any human intervention.
More and more of our TREG customers have come to rely on TextBlade as their primary daily keyboard. This broader user experience has made something increasingly clear to us:TextBlade can meaningfully replace a century-old, widely-used paradigm with a significantly better successor.
This affirmation from extensive customer usage over has also made us careful to address details that influence general release. Our increased investment in production automation, exemplified by the Q-Bots, is allowing us to produce high volume with consistently high quality, and fulfill the potential of TextBlade's new technology.)


&gt;Timing
With more TextBlades in the field, we have increasing quantity and quality of data from customers using it daily. Our confidence is growing that no significant new hardware changes are likely to surface. No product in high volume release has zero reports from the field, but the goal here is that issues should be statistically small.This is especially important for a paradigm shift product.

Blah blah. Getting your excuses early for the enviable hardware failures at GR. 

&gt;The most technically complex tasks remaining now relate to software needs, in response to whatever is reported from our TREG users.The standards for software and documentation for general release are necessarily higher, since we've got to assure that the support needs for our general release customers are manageable.Although there are no further hardware design revisions known to be needed now, it's also fair to say that implementing and QA'ing all that we've learned at the fine detail level, in this volume quantity, still requires nontrivial effort. We have plenty to keep us busy with both tasks.We currently expect to further ramp up TREG, and with that continuing favorably, we'll begin broader General Release.

Fuck, no documentation yet. Quick get the interns *cough* TREG on it. 

&gt;We've updated our servers to reflect current activity. We'll maintain a broad delivery window so everyone can understand the limited precision of our estimates as we ramp up.

Translation: no idea when we are finished, we will just keep shoving predictions which not far enough that we have people give up waiting but not so close we are have anybody notice there are no tasks related to imminent delivery happening.

&gt;We greatly appreciate the encouraging comments, personal notes, and experiences shared by customers using their TextBlades, and also from those excited to receive theirs soon too. This is an exciting time for our team, and for the impact of this new technology.Many thanks to all of you who help us do it.

Please love us, we can't help being shit.

Fuck you Waytools.

**NB: I am done wading through this shitty post. They need to get someone who can string words together nicely and knows what they mean.**

In the past several months, three people have left my department and I've stepped into make sure their projects continued and taken on some additional duties as well. The duties involve more interaction with sales people,conference calls with other locations at early/late hours, and overseeing the completion of whatever projects are sent from other locations. In addition, I've been voluntold to join the safety committee and given an intern to train. So I have a pretty good argument for more money. I received a raise of 3.5% and bonus due to a good yearly review in March but according to salary.com, I'm still being paid  $2k less than the average for my position in my area (entry level chemist in the New York metro area). Due to the change in duties, I want to ask for 10% raise which amounts to an increase of just under $6k. The worst my supervisor could say is no, but with three people having left for more money, you would think they'd try to keep the remaining new hires happy. Is raise too much to ask for for or should I ask for $10k and see what happens?"

How is the work culture and what projects did you work on in a span of a short period of time? 
6bcb12,44,2017-05-15,Mike blackmails me because I asked some questions,CaughtInDireWood,talesofmike,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesofmike/comments/6bcb12/mike_blackmails_me_because_i_asked_some_questions/,"At the time I was brand-new to my job. I had had an internship prior, in the same company/department, but my new job's roles were very different.
My manager told me to ""ask lots of questions"" if I didn't know what to do for new tasks. She told me this in every one-on-one meeting we had.
When I was an intern, Mike was great at helping me learn what to do and what was what. He answered questions well and was very nice. I considered him to be a ""work friend"".
In my new full-time role, Mike changed. I was assigned to work on a project (headed by Mike) I had worked on as an intern, so I didn't need training. But, this project is done only once a year, and I had only worked on it once myself. So, I obviously didn't remember everything. I asked questions, as I was told to by my manager.
A month after the project ended, I had a meeting with Mike and my manager. They basically tore me a new one. I thought I had been doing a decent job (or so my manager had been telling me up to this point), so the berating came as a surprise.
Turns out, that Mike expected me to remember everything from the previous year, but he didn't tell me that. Every question I had, and any little mistake I made, was treated with a smile and a ""no problem!"" attitude from Mike. But, as I learned later, Mike had written down every single question and mistake I made, documented it, and sent it via email to my manager. He also wrote down that I didn't talk much during the meeting presenting the project to the Big Boss. The funny thing is, though, before that meeting, I asked Mike if he wanted me to talk about anything specifically, and he said no. That if I had something to add, to go ahead and say it, but otherwise it was fine - he would do the talking.
So, during the 2-on-1 meeting, I was holding back tears as the worst year-end review was handed to me. All the trust and kindness from Mike had been a front to blackmail me. My manager always had her head in the clouds and didn't realize what was going on. HR got involved (to start a paper trail), and I high-tailed it to look for a new job.
I did get a new job in time to quit before I was fired, but the damage was done, and I'm now in a different career path all-together. Funny thing is, I'm at the same company and in a neighboring department, so I see Mike from time to time. No conversation, but everyone loves Mike - he's the golden child of the office, and I hate it. Because he screwed me over.
.
.
TL;DR Mike didn't tell me the expectations for a project and blackmailed me (i.e. reported to my manager) when I didn't meet those mystery expectations and asked too many questions."

6bcjml,1,2017-05-15,"M4F Multiple plots, mostly parents",MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6bcjml/m4f_multiple_plots_mostly_parents/,"Hello! I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships. Read On!

1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.

2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 

3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 


Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."
6bckbw,0,2017-05-15,Prospective Core Set 2.0 - Design Exercise,grimwalker,Netrunner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/6bckbw/prospective_core_set_20_design_exercise/,"So, every so often people kick around why they think Core 2.0 is **definitely happening** or **definitely wishful thinking** and while I tend toward the latter, I don't recall ever seeing anyone actually think about what would be in it. So, I did.

My starting point was obviously the original core set. I counted up how many cards per type in each faction had, and then cut everything back to 1x and then looked in Genesis and Spin cycles to fill them back out to similar proportions. Cards on the MWL obviously had to go for the most part, with exceptions noted where appropriate. 

Runner notes

Anarchs wound up with the whole Caissa suite, because Yog and Parasite have been consigned to oblivion, Darwin simply is inviable with CVS out there, and killing Keyhole was a specific goal! Those specific cuts basically said ""1x of every other Core/Genesis/Spin program."" The Caissa need either some retemplating or an entry in the RRG, given they've been FAQ-fodder since their inception. I kept Wyldside because it's frankly iconic, and mostly only abusable in concert with Faust/Pancakes. 

Criminal Events had one of the only instances where there were exactly as many Events in GeneSpin as were needed to fill out the card count. Doubles showed up, so that will entail an update to the rulebook. (Which we should do anyway, as this should get the modern Learn To Play/Rules Reference Guide treatment.) I kept E3 Feedback implants, because Adam really needs that to stay viable.

Kate is the next card to be put on the bus. She's just too efficient, and every other ID has to answer why you'd pay that opportunity cost. But, they also got a lot of iconic tools to add back into the mix. Replicator and Rabbit Hole seem odd when everything is 1x per set, but if AGOT can put the ""Buy Another Core Set"" writing on the wall with an entire mechanic built around duplicate copies of 1x signature characters, we can roll with a couple of cards that are a subtle hint. Genesis and Spin were really a great time for Shaper, and they're going to be quite strong in a Core-only environment.

Neutral was tough. There are no new neutral programs to compensate for Crypsis going down to 1x, but since all factions got an expanded suite of in-faction options, it should be fine. Plascrete was retired, because the writing on the wall for some time now is that runners will have to play around Scorch in other ways. I went ahead and doubled up a select few economy cards to enhance single-core play, even though that will slightly diminish the value of repeat buys.

Corp Notes

HB was also tough. ETF has to go because it's even worse than Kate; but there are precious few viable replacements. Happily HB had a number of cards that I was delighted to retain, and some old boxwarmers that might be worth another look in a post-Yog world.

Jinteki didn't have a lot of wiggle room. I frankly think Caprice is a little too binary and has been meta-defining for far too long, so she did not make the cut.

NBN was an exercise in frustration. I was reminded of how NBN was so bad for so long, as GeneSpin is replete with overcosted, underperforming cards. Ultimately I had to expand the search parameters to Lunar cycle because the alternative was to give a reprieve to some inexcusable wastes of cardboard. But, with Astroscript and Breaking News both being cut, SanSan City Grid stays in play. Ultimately I'm rather chuffed with NBN's agenda suite--I suspect the recent influx of NBN 4/2s and 5/3s means something is in the offing for them, and Datapool is a fine card.

Weyland was just as hard. Weyland's entire ice suite from Genesis is a total write-off, so I likewise had to dip into Lunar to fill out the roster. I assume Power Shutdown will get an errata, but it's not completely necessary in the absence of Accelerated Diagnostics. I wanted to include Crisium Grid, but I am very much looking forward to this nonsense of ""neither successful nor unsuccessful"" going away forever once both Crisium Grid and Jackson rotate out.

Neutral broke my heart; there simply was not a great number of neutral cards to increase the count of cards by title. Every neutral Ice made the cut, and the economy cards weren't as diverse as I would like. 

So, there you have it. The card variety is vastly increased, many problem cards are banished or deprived of their abusive combo partners. On balance, I think the game was in a really good place at this point in the meta and it should make for a good taste of things to come for new players.

I’m a 26 y/o PR enthusiast. Like most of our fellow PR colleagues I worked multiple internships (2 years total) post-college, both agency and client side (along with a marketing &amp; promotions internship in the athletic department at a power five Big East school during my undergrad years.

I spent 8 months as a Consumer Marketing/PR Intern (post-grad) at a “top tier” firm in St. Louis, MO..main client was Budweiser and was a member of Super Bowl coverage tracking/media monitoring. At the conclusion of my time in St. Louis, I moved back home (Kansas City) and worked as a Corporate Communications Intern at one of the elite Animal Health companies in North America (I would say names, but I’m not really sure if that’s OK in this subreddit). In a nutshell I handled all forms of PR, social, content creation, external/internal comm, etc.. Last May, I started working as an Ad Trafficker at a local publishing company here in Kansas City. I accepted the position purely to start making some money. I don’t regret it…but let’s just say doing the same four tasks on a daily basis starts to become a little unbearable. No creativity. No variation. Blah. I miss agency life and it’s started to hurt my writing abilities.

My end goal is to get back to the agency world. I’ve been applying at Ad Agencies and PR firms (ranging from small to large) as well as any sort of social content/analyst jobs in Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, DC/Baltimore, and New York. I would love to end up in Boston. Love New England.

My question is, how easy  is it for a person like myself with top tier internship experience in PR/Comms, but not the most relatable experience for my first full-time position to get a job at an agency in these major cities? I’m using all the resources and connections I have, but that seems to only get me so far due to my current role. It’s come down to myself and another candidate probably 7-10 times at top tier firms in Chicago, NYC and DC. Typically for AAE roles. Is this possible for me to land an AAE or Jr. level role in these major cities coming from Kansas City? 

If anyone has any stories, tips, insight, or feedback for me please feel free to reach out! I’ll be more than happy to go into further details about my resume/experience/etc..Thanks again for any feedback or help that is sent my way…just trying to stay as positive as I possibly can and keep the spirits up before I decide to throw in the coveted ad agency/PR “white towel”

My name is Ryan (ign: Shøwtime), and I am currently a G4 ADC main looking for potential players to help join my team, Nimbus Gaming, for the Gold/Plat Open League in CompeteLeague. A little background info. on myself. I am a 3rd year college student about to graduate. I have previous experience in running teams through past work and internship experience. I wanted to start this endeavor as a side hobby, but I will take it very seriously. We are looking for players who will also take the matches seriously, for our ultimate goal is to reach the Premier League. The current openings are:

**TOP SUB**  *Req: Must be able to play tanks and carries sufficiently.*

Subs wil have an increased role than what you might think.

1. A full sub team will be in place to practice with the main team to help form strategies and practice comps.
2. If the starter cannot attend the event, the sub will automatically play in place. 
3. We expect the sub team to FULLY practice together either during the same time as the main team or to their own accord.
4. Will have access to full team resources (discord, discussion, meetings, etc.)

If you are interested please PM me or add me on league! (IGN: Shøwtime)

**We are going to compete in the house5v5 minor league tournament, and we need a sub top to play in either the first or second day of the tournament. The qualifier starts Friday, Saturday, and Sunday 2:00 CST**

6bd14w,3,2017-05-15,Quick question about confront roommate,dsyxelic1,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/6bd14w/quick_question_about_confront_roommate/,"edit: woops sorry about title gore


So long story short my roommate's girlfriend has been over pretty much 24/7 the last 2 weeks which wasn't the case before (beforehand was over at maximum 2 days a week which was okay with me). I want to confront my roommate about this and come to a compromise of some sort since we never really explicitly communicated these things (woops). 


However his girlfriend has not left the entire day and I'm wondering if I should just talk about this to them both or pull him aside? Though I think that might come off weird since I'd be talking about the girlfriend separately to him while she's there.


I don't think they will be separate any time soon. Best plan of advice here? Basically what I am aiming for is to come to an agreement that we can only have overnight guests 1-2 times a week. Of course exceptions are there but as a general rule not this 14 day in a row with a sick girlfriend coughing all night and keeping me up till 4AM while I am on a full time internship and taking part time classes.

Last thing I need is a sick girlfriend keeping me up and sharing a 1 bedroom with 3 people while paying almost 1k for this expensive shared bedroom apartment. I'm willing to compromise for the 1-2 days a week and I think that's reasonable, especially considering I'm only talking about overnight stays. Sleep is something I simply cannot take lightly especially on the weekdays.


Any thoughts or advice appreciated. I don't want to put this off any more.


Oh and another option is texting him but that's also pretty awkward considering we're in the same room right now. I'm leaning towards just asking him to come outside the apartment for a second and then talk out there but not sure if that'd be the best scenario.

Thanks."

6bd65b,1,2017-05-15,26F4M The Secretary &amp; the Playboy.,ania_shadowhunter,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6bd65b/26f4m_the_secretary_the_playboy/,"Working at Halton Inc had its perk; between the gourmet coffee shop that was no charge to the employees and the yearly company retreat, none of the employees seemed to complain. Especially not when the large state of the art gym had been added to the package deal. Employees (and their spouses and families) were encouraged to keep a healthy lifestyle and offered training alongside the gym that was available to them 24/7. Just another company perk. 

[Jax*](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/1c/3b/6e1c3b4f5a58690f9c35c2caf58c678a.jpg)* (or rather, Jackson Halton the 3rd) was the grandson of the company's original founder. His father was the CEO and the bright, quick witted Jax was on his way to running the company one day. After all, the Halton boys had a way with business and it was only natural for the youngest of the generation to one day take over. Jax might have been smart in business but he wasn't always smart in love. Much to his mother's dismay, he didn't settle down easily, always looking to be the heartbreaker and not the husband. And the office was not even safe, he just had to be discreet. Eager young women made their way into his work environment and eventually his bed. From busty interns to petite young analysts eager to join the team, he didn't have a strong preference as long as they could keep his attention for long enough. 

There was, however, one young woman he hadn't tried to bed just yet. His own personal secretary and assistant, Evelyn. Sure, she wasn't some creature. But she wasn't the eager type he tried to bed either. She was intelligent, quiet and hardworking, three things he had insisted upon having for his work. There wasn't any need of some ditzy blonde with great tits being there to look at if she was going to fuck up his whole work schedule. Evelyn was there before him every morning, his coffee sitting upon the desk along with the day's agenda, perfectly typed out and understandable for even his most hungover days. She always wore her hair tied back in a bun, glasses on and polished to look like the professional she was. Stockings, knee length skirts and blouses that didn't show any of why figure she might have had became the customary fashion for her. 

The woman never spoke of a personal life outside of the walls; Jax had come to assume she was simply a young woman who owned cats and preferred the company of books to living and breathing humans. Evelyn hadn't exactly been the type he would have tried to play his games with and he didn't want to even try after his bad days of little game left within the office as a wave of interns left. 

But there was one pretty that he had his eyes set upon, a newcomer to the gym and a face he just couldn't place. He hadn't gotten close enough, already seemingly preoccupied with some cardio bunny who was swooning of his money, muscle and title. She was there one minute and gone the next, undistracted in her quest for a good workout and then going on about her day. But Jax thought he might stand a chance tonight, skipping his regular dinner and drink, forgoing the chance at the Australian bartender he had his eye on in a chance to meet the mysterious girl. But it wasn't until he had gotten closer, the gym sparse with people after the long work day, that a horrifying yet delightful realization had set in. 

Was that [Evelyn?!](http://fitnessmodeldiet1.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fitness-model-diet-plans.jpg)

-----------------------------------

Hey there. 
I think the premise here is simply enough. Future head of the company is also the company's billionaire playboy (fair enough). The one gal he hasn't laid his claws into is the dutiful secretary who never lets him down. But he has his eye set on the new gym hottie, only to find out that she's none other than that same assistant. 

If you have anything you want changed, feel free to discuss it will me. 

Kinks include: cheating, oral, anal, rough sex, public sex/play, lingerie, men in suits, light bondage and a fair few more I won't list. **No blood/gore, bathroom stuff, kiddos, pets please!**

6bdczt,3,2017-05-15,Career guidance! Applying for out of state positions,jj245678,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/6bdczt/career_guidance_applying_for_out_of_state/,"Fellow /r/advertising colleagues,
I’m a 26 y/o PR enthusiast. Like most of our fellow PR colleagues I worked multiple internships (2 years total) post-college, both agency and client side (along with a marketing &amp; promotions internship in the athletic department at a power five Big East school during my undergrad years.

I spent 8 months as a Consumer Marketing/PR Intern (post-grad) at a “top tier” firm in St. Louis, MO..main client was Budweiser and was a member of Super Bowl coverage tracking/media monitoring. At the conclusion of my time in St. Louis, I moved back home (Kansas City) and worked as a Corporate Communications Intern at one of the elite Animal Health companies in North America (I would say names, but I’m not really sure if that’s OK in this subreddit). In a nutshell I handled all forms of PR, social, content creation, external/internal comm, etc.. Last May, I started working as an Ad Trafficker at a local publishing company here in Kansas City. I accepted the position purely to start making some money. I don’t regret it…but let’s just say doing the same four tasks on a daily basis starts to become a little unbearable. No creativity. No variation. Blah. I miss agency life and it’s started to hurt my writing abilities.

My end goal is to get back to the agency world. I’ve been applying at Ad Agencies and PR firms (ranging from small to large) as well as any sort of social content/analyst jobs in Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, DC/Baltimore, and New York. I would love to end up in Boston. Love New England.

My question is, how easy is it for a person like myself with top tier internship experience in PR/Comms, but not the most relatable experience for my first full-time position to get a job at an agency in these major cities? I’m using all the resources and connections I have, but that seems to only get me so far due to my current role. It’s come down to myself and another candidate probably 7-10 times at top tier firms in Chicago, NYC and DC. Typically for AAE roles. Is this possible for me to land an AAE or Jr. level role in these major cities coming from Kansas City?

If anyone has any stories, tips, insight, or feedback for me please feel free to reach out! I’ll be more than happy to go into further details about my resume/experience/etc..Thanks again for any feedback or help that is sent my way…just trying to stay as positive as I possibly can and keep the spirits up before I decide to throw in the coveted ad agency/PR “white towel”

Cheers!"
6bdkui,36,2017-05-15,What's perspective? - with a helping for [meta],TheChubbyCustodian,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/6bdkui/whats_perspective_with_a_helping_for_meta/,"So before I dive into today's off-topic story first I'm going to provide a bit more context about myself. I went to a university for the bachelor's degree of game art. I graduated with a 3.2 GPA and am now paying off college loans while looking for jobs in my field... yadda... yadda... yadda. Meanwhile there's that ol' job as a custodian I have to pay off college loans and car insurance. Other than that my mom is covering me for everything else as I live with her. You guys might recall that I told you she's been through multiple hospital surgeries on her arms and back. This was after a car accident and other work-related injuries that I was in that happened 4 years ago. My mom never fully recovered unlike me, she fell into a depression and lost 75 pounds in like 2 months because she wouldn't stop crying, while I ballooned and chubbed up essentially. Then of course, there was the loss of one of my loved ones and that didn't help the whole depression situation either. Point is I live with my mom because until she can afford/I can afford to live and take care of myself/herself then this is the best case right now. We're a might dependent on each other, she's dependent on me because she's physically disabled from the car accident and can't take care of herself and I'm dependent her because I don't make enough money to take care of myself. I can only be thankful for that one loved one who died did apparently save up a HUGE lump sum of inheritance that my mom is using to its full extent to pay for anything extra. Things do happen for a reason I guess.

Now that that's out of the way let's dive into beetus. 3 weeks ago I acquired a new job as a 3D animator for a start-up company. The job was part time and the (ham)boss there told me to keep my job at retail store because his company is still very new and  he's not sure if he has enough work for me to do to allow for a full-time job yet. There's also the clearance that I might not be able to provide him with the quality of work he wants but more on that later. The boss is a ham, he's like 6 foot 5 but unlike SM he's like 300 pounds, all chub. Dude's looks huge compared to me with my 5 foot 5 self. Fuck I'm short. Anyways, I'll be quick here. He gives me 3D animation/modeling work to do, I do it and put in 17 hours worth of work for him in 1 week (this was 2 weeks ago). He tells me not to come into work last week because he'll be out of town on a sales trip. I figured it be best not to bother him because I'm a nice guy. Fast forward to last Friday, and I recognize that it should be questioned to him about the pay I receive for the 17 hours I put in 2 weeks ago. He immediately emails me back and says he's gonna pay me for 30 hours of work at $15 per hour. I mean that's cool and all I'm not going to object. I mean he said he was gonna pay me more $15 per hour when we talked on the phone before the whole job thing started (3 weeks ago), he also said I'd be paid monthly. I can only assume he's paying me after 1 week now instead because he doesn't know what he's doing. Also he can't do math if he's paying me for 30 hours when I told him verbatim in email I only did 17. But hey I'm not gonna object.

So he tells me to come into the offices today. The offices are a 90 minute drive away from where I live. He knows this. This is why hamboss suggested when we first met that I do the job from home, but clearly that's not feasible when he doesn't even know what he wants, as much of the work I did do in those 17 hours 2 weeks ago, nothing would have been able to be accomplished accurately if I was not in the offices at the time. So he wasn't in the offices when I arrived today, but you know who was? Let's do some character introduction! YAY!

&gt;Key: Essentially my boss when my real hamboss is out on business trips selling the product that I 3D model for him. Fair build, fair weight, super beta.

&gt;Ham: 300+ pounds, 5 foot 7. And doesn't know what the fuck art is but apparently she's right. I just met her today as she wasn't in the offices 2 weeks ago when I did those 17 hours worth of work.

&gt;There are a few more characters in this story but they are unnecessary to the main plot.

I come into work and Key is surprised. He said he wasn't expecting me. I mean I acknowledge I didn't email him no but he isn't in charge of my pay my hamboss is. So Key phones up hamboss. Hamboss is clearly upset I didn't tell him I was coming in today. Well you said in the email last  Friday to come in this week so I assumed that meant Monday morning, I didn't think that warranted a response, apparently it did. And he was apparently late for work because he was “dining out” for brunch. So he wasn’t gonna be in the offices until like noon. Putting food above your company aye? Anyways, Key looks at all the work I did 2 weeks ago again, gives me a few more things to touch up on and improve. I take some good notes and and decide to start working. But then the Ham decides to walk up and look at my work. 

Let me do a bit of context here. I was told to 3D model parts to a shower bar installation product. I’ll show you guys 5 of the renders for the 3D models I made in my computer program.

http://imgur.com/a/SXwGp

The argument the Ham was making was that the customer won’t be able to tell that’s all the same product because everything’s looks different lengths. I explained to her this is because of camera angles and perspective/foreshortening. She didn’t like this she enforced that I should make them all look the same length while keeping the same special camera angles. I said that would make the whole thing inconsistent as I 3-D modeled these parts in the exact measurements my hamboss provided to me in the booklet. Key was overwatching the argument the whole time but was remaining silent. I finally decide to show the ham that this is all from the same 3D model. I open my 3D animation/modeling program Autodesk Maya and show her clear as day the 3D scene I worked in to make the product. Her eyes grow wide and I hear her do some heavy breathing as it was indeed hard to walk 10 feet over to where I was working in the offices. I am essentially moving around and rotating the 3D scene showing her it’s all the same product/model and everything, it’s just different camera angles that makes it looker longer and shorter in some places. She finally spurts out. 

&gt;”Can we just agree that we’re both right?”

I didn’t respond to this. If I had half a mind I would’ve said:

&gt;”No because only one of us is right.”

But hey I’m a nice guy. I don’t like to judge. Meanwhile Key is still watching the both of us argue. I decide to concede and say I’ll try to find a way to make everything look the same size and length regardless of camera angles. She walks away and I start working. 

No more than 5 minutes later I overhear her talking to Key in the offices 10 feet away from me. She wanted clearance from Key that she was right and I was wrong. Key took her side even though Ham wasn’t in the offices with me at all for the 17 hours I worked on this stuff 2 weeks ago. Nope I just meet her today and she’s a whole lot of trouble. With her fucking 1 liter mountain dew bottle I see next to her desk. Ham says that if I can’t do work that’s up to snuff then I shouldn’t be needed here. Key says it’s more than that. He doesn’t even know if my 3D animation program Autodesk Maya is viable for the job. I remained quiet this whole time and just did my work. 

About an hour later, it’s like 11 am now, Key tells me to go home for the day as there’s no reason for me to stay. I say there is because there’s still the chance that hamboss will come into the offices later on in the day, and I can just stay there and work on the stuff him and Ham told me to work on. But he enforces that I can do all the work at home and I don’t need to do anymore work. Seeing as I was pretty much being pushed out I pack up my things and just decide that yeah I’ll finish up the rest of the work at home. I let Key know that I care about this job and I want to keep working at it. But he is less than impressed and just tells me to leave. The last thing I see is the Ham spilling donut crumbs all over the office desk while chugging her mountain dew beetus.

I guess I also didn’t mention that their 1 bathroom is fucking disgusting as the toilet is never cleaned and it has a ring of shitscum all around it. Gee I wonder who left that behind?

So as I drive home I decide to call hamboss and let him know what’s up. I didn’t like that the Ham that was there was using her influence to push me out of the workplace. She obviously has no idea how perspective works in a 3D scene. I ask him how his day is going and the lot and he immediately starts yelling at me. He says how I should’ve emailed him about how I was coming into work today. I tell him he said in the email to come into work this week. That implies Monday morning doesn’t it? Not my fault you had to “dine out” for brunch instead of be at the company. (I didn’t say that part) But yeah I apologized to him about how I did not email him back. He then got really mad at me that I’m getting paid for 30 hours of work when I told him that I did less than that. Well I never said for you to pay me for 30 hours of work I told you verbatim in the email I did 17 hours of work but if you want to pay me for more than that that’s your choice if you can’t math. (Once again I didn’t say that last part to him). He then yelled at me saying how if I can’t create work that’s up to snuff and everything looks so rough then I have no business working for him as he’s seen other 3D companies pull out much more impressive work. Well all I have to do my work in is Autodesk Maya. I don’t have anything fancy like Marmoset, or Z-brush because that costs extra money and those kinds of things are usually company provided. I guess it’s just cool that Autodesk Maya is free to use as long as you got the educational version like me. (Once again I didn’t say this) I instead said that I can work harder and provide better work for him. He responds by calling me a kid who doesn’t know how to communicate. 

After hanging up the phone I’m visibly upset of course. I now have to make a 90 minute drive home. So I just start driving and start doing some thinking.

In retrospect where am I going in life? I’m 24 years old graduate university in May 2016 and have literally spent the last year and a half searching for a job in 3D animation. Now to be frank and I didn’t mention this before, during the senior year of my university I did consider switching majors to video editing and film but nothing ever came of it. I figured in the end I was already too far into the field of game art that it would be pointless to switch majors now. So as you can imagine, even after I graduated from university I wasn’t the lazyass graduate that did nothing. In fact I’ve given up on playing video games altogether, and I don’t even watch TV anymore. All the freetime I have goes into creating work for my portfolio and website. And I found myself focusing A LOT more on video editing and film after I got out of college. Now I’m on call with a film studio. To even this day, every damn day I get home from my work as a custodian I sit my ass down on my computer and work on stuff for my portfolio. I’ll even show you guys a few pictures of my work.

http://imgur.com/a/RBAIC

Yet of course work like this that I did for hamboss just wasn’t good enough even when his company doesn’t provide me with the correct programs to make it look good. Autodesk Maya can only do so much ya know?

http://imgur.com/a/9Wt4h

So in conclusion today that long drive home I had today helped me do a lot of thinking. I think I need to go back to school and get a new major in film and video production. My degree in game art isn’t doing me any good for the jobs I’m looking for in my field. Suffice to say it’s obvious guys, there will come a time when “Chubby Custodian Chronicles” ends. I am always searching for higher paying jobs/jobs that are in my field. But given where I’m going right now, I’ve been out of college for over a year now and have gotten no closer to getting a job in my field. I’ve had two internships both in video editing (one at a Sports Network, and one at E-Learning) and nothing permanent ever came of it. Though I’m still on-call with that film studio so I guess that’s something. I had a nice dinner with my mom as I took her out for mother’s day because I had to work yesterday. We talked. We had a nice time. She is going to keep supporting me as I keep working and going back to school again now. 

I have A LOT of my life ahead of me. Nothing’s going anywhere anytime soon. I can take my time and keep working and working. I’m always going to come home everyday from my job at retail store and put in another 8 hours on my computer for stuff for my portfolio, because that’s what you got to do to get places in this world. I admit I’m a slow bloomer but that’s okay. Everyone moves at their own speed and everything. 

Anyways, I’ve let this story go on for long enough. I figured I’d give you guys two servings today. A beetus tale with a side of meta. Hope you don’t mind. See you guys next time! ;)

6besdc,1,2017-05-15,"Farm Hand Internship in Long Beach, Washington",FloodFarmWa,FarmJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FarmJobs/comments/6besdc/farm_hand_internship_in_long_beach_washington/,"Are you interested in learning how to run a small family-owned farm? We are seeking a positive and hardworking individual to assist with the care of our livestock (including horses, dairy cows, beef calves, ducks, and two low maintenance barn cats). In addition to farm chores, this position focuses on administrative tasks associated with the operation of a farm and household. This position coordinates with our other intern.


Farm chores (10 chore times per week):
-Milking and caring for a dairy cows and calf
-Caring for several beef calves
-Feeding/caring for 3 horses
-Keeping barn organized and clean
-Dressing animal wounds or medications (if needed) 
-Emergency/regular vet visits (as needed) 
-Daily puppy handling and training (as needed)
-occasional maintenance on farm equipment

Our dogs sleep in our rooms, rotating nightly between family members and interns. We all participate in their socialization and continuous training. This leads to fun trips and quality bonding time with the dogs. 

The above work is done in exchange for room, board, and a $200 monthly stipend. Each intern is guaranteed one day off per week (which is coordinated with the other intern).

To supplement the stipend, other farm work is available for $10/hour in fluctuating amounts. The amount of work available and types of tasks depend on the season. Winter tasks include cutting down trees that have fallen on fences, repairing fences, washing cars, and harrowing the arena. Spring, summer, and fall tasks can include jobs like painting and staining buildings and fences, washing buildings, mowing and weed whacking the lawns, weeding and trimming bushes and pruning trees, mending fences, fertilizing pastures, watering the pastures/moving sprinklers, and various repair jobs and projects.

Room and board includes: a private room (outside in the barn), utilities (including electricity, trash, and water), Wi-Fi, laundry facilities, food (we tend to purchase high quality, healthy food), farm fun (basketball court, a dock in the backyard on Loomis Lake with two kayaks and an aluminum drift boat, a Jacuzzi, clamming supplies, and horseback riding on the beach for those with experience), and access to the beautiful Long Beach area (including various lighthouses, kite flying, Lewis and Clark trail, the world’s longest beach, and the Astoria Column).

Our ideal candidate is flexible and positive with a can-do attitude, has experience working outdoors or with heavy machinery (tractor and riding mower), is physically capable of doing basic farm work on a regular basis (lifting and moving feed sacks and hay bales, cutting down trees, etc.), loves dogs and horses and is comfortable with a fluctuating income.

We are very involved in a local theater group Peninsula Association of Performing Artists, raise German Shepherd puppies, regularly ride bikes with/run alongside/ride horses on the beach, and use Parelli natural horsemanship techniques on the ground and in the saddle. We encourage our farm hands to join us in these fun activities as we like to view our interns as an extension of our family.


If you are interested in applying for this position, please fill out the questionnaire below and email it to us along with your resume, 3-5 references, a brief autobiography and several recent pictures of yourself.
 
Questionnaire:

What appeals to you about this internship/work-trade position?

How do your future goals align with this position?

Farm life is busy and unexpected things happen. Do you maintain a positive attitude when things do not go as planned? Are you flexible and willing to pitch in when things need to be done?

This position is intended to be learning-focused, where a majority of the work is done in exchange for room and board, an opportunity to learn how to run a family-owned farm, and the experience of a farm lifestyle. What are your expenses and how will you pay them?

How do you feel about working with animals?

How do you feel about leaving family and friends?

How do you feel about living in an area that gets 80 inches of rain a year?

Do you have any physical limitations that would prevent you from doing farm work?

Do you smoke or use recreational drugs? Do you drink, and if so, how much?

Would you have your own vehicle?

Do you have health insurance?

When would you be able to come? How long would you be interested in staying if things were working out well? Would you be willing to come for a visit?

We enjoy exercising our horses on the beach (around 3-4x a week) and would love to have our interns accompany us for fun. Those who do not have experience riding can jog or ride a bike while ponying a horse (it’s a lot of fun!). Do you have horseback riding experience? If so, explain. Do you have any videos of you riding?

We raise German Shepherds and understand the importance of pets. While we do not allow interns to bring their dog(s) to the farm (no exceptions), we are open to other pets. Do you have any animals that need to come with you?

We are involved in a community theater group that produces family-friendly musicals. Some interns have enjoyed volunteering with the group by performing in, playing music for, or building sets for the annual show. It’s a great way to make friends in the area and is a lot of fun! Would you be interested in this type of activity?

Please contact us if you would like more information! We look forward to hearing from you! "
6besel,22,2017-05-15,Post-Internship Thoughts,Spring2017Intern,foreignservice,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/6besel/postinternship_thoughts/,"I just finished up a turn as a spring intern overseas. It was a great experience from start to finish – I feel I did substantive work, learned more about the FS, and made what I hope will prove to be lasting and fruitful connections.

I’ve told my co-intern about this post and she said she may chime in, but in the meantime if any future or prospective interns have any questions about the program I’d be happy to offer my perspective.

Things that struck me:

Differences between sections: I am grateful I had the chance to do at least some work in every section (except MGMT) despite being officially an ECON intern. The difference in what might be called corporate culture between the POL and ECON sections and the rest of the embassy was striking. The work of course was different, but also the personalities that excelled were different, the style of leadership was different, the role of local staff seemed different, and the overall atmosphere just felt different. While I would be happy to serve in whatever role is required of me should I one day become an FSO, I already believed that being an ECON officer would be the best fit for me – after this experience I am quite sure. I strongly advise all interns to take opportunities to work in other sections, if available.

The opportunity to do substantive work almost right out of the gate. There was very little BS – about a day and a half of admin and then into the fire: attending events, doing research, writing DARs/cables, etc. I don’t know what I expected but previous (non-State) internships have taken much longer to really get going.

The ease with which FSOs’ lives can be submerged into a sort of expat isolation. The large majority of officers seemed to live in gated communities very close to the embassy, which is itself in a fairly isolated suburb. One could easily go weeks without really interacting with the host country or city unless one made a point to do so.

Regarding issues facing the FS with the new administration, the enormous contrast between the professional attitude of the FSOs at post, even in informal/personal conversations, and the hysteria given anonymously to reporters.

My advice for incoming interns:

Reach out to your supervisor and try to get a handle on what sort of things you’ll be working on. This will make whatever preparation you do much more valuable. I read probably a dozen or so books and followed local media for the 2-3 months before I arrived; this added some amount of context to the things I was working on but little more than that. If I had had a better idea of what my areas of focus would be, my prep could have been much more useful. If you have preferences of areas to work on, let your supervisor know. Of course, you should still be flexible, ready and eager to work on anything, but my impression was that interns often have more say about what they work on than they might expect.

Keep a daily journal of the things you’re working on and the skills you are developing/demonstrating as you do so. For those familiar with the FS application process, try to think about the things you are doing through the lens of the PNQs. I’ve failed twice on two attempts so am no expert but this experience is virtually designed to offer you opportunities for good PN stories – I expect to have a much stronger application next time around. I still think the PNs are a poor method for selecting OA candidates but I must confess that the skills asked about really are the sort FSOs use every day.

Learn at least some of the local language. Even if you won’t become fluent, or near fluent, being able to get around, read signs/menus, etc. will make your life significantly easier.

Embrace all opportunities. Never say no. Naturally, don’t take on more than you are capable of doing. But IMO your goal should be to get the most out of this experience, not to leave at 5 every day. N.B.: your chances to do fun and interesting things depend to no small extent on your willingness to do less glamorous things.

I was vegetarian for a year or so when i decided to go vegan. I've been vegan now for 3 months, and I had hardly any issues at first. I loved trying new food, new restaurants and being in school it was easy for me to eat at home for most meals to save money.

However, I'm now on summer break and I feel almost like a burden. I've moved home, and my parents are super supportive but they are having to make major changes in dinner plans and how they grocery shop.

On top of that, I recently started an internship where they get lunch catered weekly and when I told them I was vegan they acted like I had just completely changed their world, and they would make comments like ""well now will we get catering from?"" and it's so disheartening and frustrating. My friends will make comments like ""can you even eat that? is that even vegan? you must have some cheese every now and then right?"" and it's so hard for me to explain things to them without sounded overly preachy, haha. 

I'm going to my boyfriends house on Saturday and his mom is cooking dinner for the family and I am so nervous for him to tell her about my going vegan. I don't want to burden her, the family or make her feel like I require some extensive separate menu.

I'm not sure if any of this makes sense or if anyone's felt something similar, I'm just so upset about all of this right now.

I love being vegan, and I love how it feels and what it does for both me and the environment and animals. I just wish other people would be more understanding and accepting, and not make such a huge deal about something so small like a personal dietary choice.

Any advice or words of encouragement for a new vegan would be so helpful!"

Advice?,mydownstairsmixup,OctoberBumpers2017,https://www.reddit.com/r/OctoberBumpers2017/comments/6bf5em/telling_my_new_workplace_next_week_advice/,"Hey all, I am 20 weeks on Sunday and I am finally struggling to wear my normal clothes. Which means I will be telling my boss soon (Monday or Tuesday) that surprise, I'm 5 months pregnant! For reference, I've been there one week. 

This job is considered an internship (I'm a student) but it's full-time, pays super well, and will transition into a part-time job in the fall/spring. I'm in love with the work I'm doing and I feel like I've already proven myself quite a bit as an employee. 

However, I'm so nervous to tell them - it's a very small family-owned company with only seven employees. Most of them are women with children so I feel like they will be somewhat understanding but I'm still worried. I am only 20 years old and I just have this (probably stupid) feeling that they're going to judge me harshly and be angry that I didn't disclose my pregnancy in the interview. I don't want them to regret hiring me. :(

So does anyone have advice for how I should approach this? Thanks in advance! "

Chapter One - The Eden Dig
-----

Millions of stars in the night sky; countless worlds to choose from. He was acutely aware the fates that had conspired to bring about the unlikely series of events that had brought him to this *particular* world were still meddling, either for or against him, to bring about a very specific conclusion. If only he knew what it was, he would feel more a contributor and less a hapless victim.

However, as with all things, perhaps it is best to start at the beginning.

-----

The day began with absolutely nothing to indicate that it would be unlike any other day in Maximilian Woo's admittedly limited experience. Nothing, that is, until the pale man wearing what Max deduced must be old-fashioned *spectacles* appeared in his office doorway. Aside from this fairly minor oddity, the man seemed otherwise normal in appearance, sporting an olive drab flight suit that did little to accentuate his sparse frame. 

His long black hair was shaggy and unkempt, as was his beard. He looked as if he spent a long time between bathings, though the aroma of him was far from unpleasant. He had a slightly elongated body, indicating there were some belt miners in his family tree. Over generations, they had evolved somewhat askew of the human norm due to the lack of gravity among the asteroids where they earned their living.

""May I help you?"" Max asked.

""Maybe you can, maybe you can't,"" the man replied mysteriously, scanning the room as if to assure himself they were alone.

""I don't know what to make of that, care to explain?"" 

Without warning, the thin man slammed the office door shut and turned the lock, He bounded towards the desk and grabbed a chair, then swung it around backwards as he straddled it in a movement that seemed effortless. He crossed his arms on the back of the chair and leaned forward, glancing both left and right before speaking. 

""We *found* something,"" he whispered.

Max blinked. Not feeling this was a sufficient reaction to such a vague revelation, he blinked again. The man seemed to expect something from him, as if he should know exactly what was being talked about, which of course he did not. Max took advantage of the awkward silence that followed to clear his throat.

""Come again, pal? Let's start over, who are you?""

It was now the other man's turn to blink. The irony, while very minor, was not lost on Max, who steadfastly refused to blink back. The thin man looked at Max as if for the first time, which was not far from the truth. Max was human standard, all across the board. 

He was a bit on the stocky side, though you would be foolish to try and get away with calling him fat. His age seemed to be around 40, though he likely looked younger than he actually was. He was dressed in a rumpled suit that looked like it had been slept in as a matter of habit rather than a one-time necessity. His hair was cropped short and might have once been any given color, though it was now a shade of grey. He had a good start on at least a couple day's worth of beard stubble. A large bulge under his left armpit indicated he was armed. Grizzled would be a very good word to describe him, if I were forced to choose just one. 

""You're not G. Morton Gilfrey, galaxy-famous private investigator, are you?"" The thin man finally asked.

""No,"" replied Max, ""I never claimed to be. You must have missed the sign on the door too."" 

He indicated the small sign on his desk that clearly identified him. It was at that moment the thin man did a strange thing, which is not to say that events leading to that moment had not been strange, but he turned to look at the closed office door while nodding to himself.  

""I see that now,"" he began, ""my name is Cavendish, Miles Cavendish. I'm an... *intern* and have been working with Dr. Lazarus Ambercrombie of the New Smithsonian Institute on a dig just outside the city. Do you work for Mr. Gilfrey?""

""I did,"" replied Max, ""up until he was killed."" Max suspected there was more to the spectacles Miles wore than met the eye.

The thin man's eyes lost focus behind his glasses. It was obvious he was communicating with someone on the net, most likely this Ambercrombie fellow. Max used the opportunity to look up some details about Dr. Ambercrombie via his own neural interface. What he found was impressive. Most impressive. He slowly came to realize that Miles was speaking to him. 

""...think you could accompany me to meet Dr. Ambercrombie?"" he finished.

""I'm sorry, what was that?"" 

""Do you think you could accompany me to meet Dr. Ambercrombie?"" he repeated. 

Max sighed. This kid was starting to become a pain in the ass. 

""Let me see if I have all this straight,"" Max replied, ""you show up at my office, you don't seem to know who I am, you say you found some... *thing,* you want me to take a ride with you."" He ticked the points off on his fingers. ""Does that about cover it?""

""No, I'm sorry. It really doesn't, does it?"" Miles scribbled something on a tablet and pushed it across the desk to Max. ""We are prepared to offer you this advance, as well as a daily rate plus all expenses paid.""

Max chose this moment to consciously blink again. Blinking, however, did nothing to change the number that was being presented to him.

""Bullshit,"" he muttered.

""I assure you we are quite serious, Mr. Woo. We can proceed with the bank transfer immediately, if you agree.""

Max thought about his dwindling resources for only an instant before replying. ""Okay, I'm in."" To be quite honest, he had nothing better to do anyway. 

Eden had once been considered a colony world, but that label long since fallen into disuse. It was a unique culture now, far separated from mother earth. Having said that, the vehicle Max found himself in would have been quite at home on earth, if a thousand years before that moment. The driver piloted the ancient midnight blue Ford Galaxy 500 expertly through the various traffic patterns of the autodrive-only lanes. The top was down and the wind felt refreshing after spending too much time in his office. 

Max glanced at the back of the driver and noted his apparent disdain for the law, he also noticed that he was, in fact, a she. Her long red hair was neatly tucked under her chauffeur's cap. The next thing he noticed was the manufacturer's stamp on the back of her neck reading ""Made on New Brisbane."" It was at that moment the jets kicked in, and the car rose high above the traffic and turned towards the mountains to the west. It was the first time Max seriously questioned who he was *really* working for. It certainly wouldn't be the last. Miles leaned over to be heard above the rushing wind and roar of the jets.

""I should have warned you, we are a bit off the beaten track,"" he yelled. Max simply blinked in response.

The car spun in a lazy circle as it came down on the elevated landing pad, precisely aligned with the short ramp down to the ground. The car surged forward, causing Max to desperately cling to the back of the front seat to steady himself. The driver did a few donuts in the dusty parking area before the car came to an abrupt halt, its passenger side doors lined up with the worn path leading to the dig site. Before Max could even think to move, the door was opened by the driver, who somehow seemed to materialize out of thin air next to the car.

""Welcome to the dig,"" she said in a melodic voice. 

""May I ask your name?"" said Max curiously.

""Call me Dakota,"" she replied. Something danced at the very edge of Max's memory, but his thought process was rudely interrupted when he was spun about by a hand on his shoulder. Miles flashed him a wide smile and pointed.

""There you are, just follow the path to the site. Dr. Ambercrombie will be there when you arrive.""

""Aren't you coming?"" Max asked.

""I have other business to attend to, you'll thank me later. I promise!"" replied Miles and shot into the air. 

Max hadn't even detected an anti-grav device. Some investigator he was. This was not to say Max wasn't likeable, because I *did* like him, right from the start. It's just that things tend to escape his notice. Or at least they appear to. It's difficult to tell with Max. Goodness, where are my manners? I have forgotten to introduce myself. I am the narrator. Imagine a darkened room with a warm cozy fire. I am the one sitting in an easy chair with his feet up telling you this story. Now that we have cleared that up, let us continue.

Max turned to Dakota who gave him a cheeky wink and got back in the car. If she had any parting words, they were forever lost in the roar of the jets as the vehicle rose into the air, leaving Max quite alone.  

""Well shit.""

Having very little choice, Max made his way down the path, being careful not to trip on loose rocks. His attention was more on the ground ahead than his general surroundings, so he was rather surprised to find himself at a fork in the path. One seemed to meander off at a wild tangent and one seemed to go straight on. He soon realized that the more direct path would lead him  through an extensive patch of [mildaburry bushes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/609err/pi_lost_firstchapter_2876_words/), judging from the stench. Remembering having once received advice to avoid them at very nearly all costs, he wisely chose the long way around.

He soon found himself at the edge of a massive pit, shaded by an awning of equally massive proportions. There were various temporary structures that dotted the landscape. Seated at a small table, was a man of indeterminate age, sipping what was almost certainly tea. In all honesty, he was very nearly a carbon copy of Miles, though infinitely older.  Now before you start pondering time travel and major paradoxes that might or might not be involved with them being the same person, please let me assure you that they are not. Max stepped closer to the man, uncertain of how to begin. 

""Dr. Ambercrombie, I presume?"" he asked. 

The man took a final sip of tea and rose to his feet, all in a single fluid motion. Max noticed a peculiar gleam in the man's eyes, as if he were up to something, but was also aware that everyone already *knew* he was up to something before he even started it. He grasped Max's hand with a firmness Max never would have imagined and pumped his arm energetically.

""At your service, sir!"" he exclaimed, then his brow furrowed, ""very sorry to hear about Mr. Gilfrey.""

""Me too,"" said Max, ""I liked him.""

""As did we all, Mr. Woo, as did we all. He worked for me on several occasions, mostly in secret.""

""I find it hard to believe I never knew about any of this--"" 

""Come along! I have something exciting to show you!"" Ambercromie interjected. 

Max sighed and decided to follow along for now, at least he might finally find out what this was all about. Dr. Ambercrombie led him down into the dig via a walkway made of boards that creaked menacingly with each and every step, threatening to collapse out from under them. The closer they got to the bottom, the safer Max felt. At least until he realized the tons of  soil now looming overhead. 

""What we found was at a level indicating an adjusted age of approximately 90 million years, give or take ten million,"" Ambercrombie explained, ""above that level we found nothing at all out of the ordinary. Just the usual specimens associated with the natural evolution of this world.""

""I'm confused,"" said Max, ""why the hell do you need a private investigator and what does any of this have to do with me?""

""Because we have a mystery to solve, Mr. Woo. A mystery concerning the history of the entire known universe."" 

Dr. Ambercrombie lifted the edge of a tarp covering an object at the bottom of the dig. Max leaned forward to get a closer look and suddenly felt nauseous.

""That's impossible,"" Max said softly.

6bfc98,1,2017-05-16,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6bfc98/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.
The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
6bfvny,1,2017-05-16,"Harrisonburg, Virginia",PythonShitpostBot,KeepOurCirclejerkFree,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurCirclejerkFree/comments/6bfvny/harrisonburg_virginia/,"Harrisonburg is an independent city in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 48,914, with a census-estimated 2016 population of 53,078. Harrisonburg is the county seat of Rockingham County, although the two are separate jurisdictions. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the city of Harrisonburg with Rockingham County for statistical purposes. Harrisonburg is home to James Madison University and Eastern Mennonite University.
Harrisonburg is the core city of the Harrisonburg, Virginia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which has a 2011 estimated population of 126,562.




The earliest documented English exploration of the area prior to settlement was the ""Knights of the Golden Horseshoe Expedition"", led by Lt. Gov. Alexander Spotswood, who reached Elkton, and whose rangers continued and in 1716 likely passed through what is now Harrisonburg.
Harrisonburg, previously known as ""Rocktown"", was named for Thomas Harrison, a son of English settlers. In 1737, Harrison settled in the Shenandoah Valley, eventually laying claim to over 12,000 acres (4,900 ha) situated at the intersection of the Spotswood Trail and the main Native American road through the valley.
In 1779, Harrison deeded 2.5 acres (1.0 ha) of his land to the ""public good"" for the construction of a courthouse. In 1780, Harrison deeded an additional 50 acres (20 ha). This is the area now known as ""Historic Downtown Harrisonburg.""
In 1849, trustees chartered a mayor–council form of government, although Harrisonburg was not officially incorporated as an independent city until 1916. Today, a council–manager government administers Harrisonburg.
On June 6, 1862, an American Civil War skirmish took place at Good's Farm, Chestnut Ridge near Harrisonburg between the forces of the Union and the forces of the Confederacy at which the C.S. Army Brigadier General, Turner Ashby (1828–1862), was killed.

When the slaves of the Shenandoah Valley were freed in 1865, they set up near modern-day Harrisonburg a town called Newtown. This settlement was eventually annexed by the independent city of Harrisonburg some years later, probably around 1892. Today, the old city of Newtown is still the home of the majority of Harrisonburg's predominantly black churches, such as First Baptist and Bethel AME. The modern Boys and Girls Club of Harrisonburg is located in the old Lucy Simms schoolhouse used for the black students in the days of segregation.
A large portion of this black neighborhood was dismantled in the 1960s when – in the name of urban renewal – the city government used federal redevelopment funds from the Housing Act of 1949 to force black families out of their homes and then bulldozed the neighborhood. This effort, called ""Project R4"", focused on the city blocks east of Main, north of Gay, west of Broad, and south of Johnson. According to Bob Sullivan, an intern working in the city planner's office in 1958, the city planner at the time, David Clark had to convince the city council that Harrisonburg even had slums. Newtown, a low socioeconomic status housing area, was declared a slum. Federal law mandated that the city needed to have a referendum on the issue before R4 could begin. The vote was close with 1,024 votes in favor and 978 against R4. After the vote, the Harrisonburg Redevelopment and Housing Authority was formed. All of the members were white men. The project began and, due to eminent domain, the government could force the people of Newtown to sell their homes. They were offered rock bottom prices for their homes. Many people couldn't afford a new home and had to move into public housing projects and become dependent on the government. Likewise, many of the businesses of Newtown that were bought out could not afford to reestablish themselves. Kline's, a white-owned business, was actually one of the few businesses in the area that was able to reopen. The city later sold the land to commercial developers.

In early 2002, the Harrisonburg community discussed the possibility of creating a pedestrian mall downtown. Public meetings were held to discuss the merits and drawbacks of pursuing such a plan. Ultimately, the community decided to keep its Main Street open to traffic. From these discussions, however, a strong voice emerged from the community in support of downtown revitalization.
On July 1, 2003, Harrisonburg Downtown Renaissance was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the mission of rejuvenating the downtown district.
In 2004, downtown was designated as the Harrisonburg Downtown Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places and a designated Virginia Main Street Community, with the neighboring Old Town Historic District residential community gaining historic district status in 2007. Several vacant buildings have been renovated and repurposed for new uses, such as the Hardesty-Higgins House and City Exchange, used for the Harrisonburg Tourist Center and high-end loft apartments, respectively.
In 2008, downtown Harrisonburg spent over $1 million in cosmetic and sidewalk infrastructure improvements (also called streetscaping and wayfinding projects). The City Council appropriated $500,000 for custom street signs to be used as ""wayfinding signs"" directing visitors to areas of interest around the city. Another $500,000 were used to upgrade street lighting, sidewalks, and landscaping along Main Street and Court Square.
In 2014, Harrisonburg Downtown Renaissance was named a Great American Main Street by the National Main Street Association and downtown was designated the first culinary district in the commonwealth of Virginia.




Harrisonburg has won several awards in recent years, including ""#6 Favorite Town in America"" by Travel + Leisure in 2016, the ""#15 Best City to Raise an Outdoor Kid"" by Backpacker in 2009, and the ""#3 Happiest Mountain Town"" by Blue Ridge Country Magazine in 2016.
The creative class of Harrisonburg has grown alongside the revitalization of the downtown district. Contributing to Harrisonburg's cultural capital are a collection of education and art centers, residencies, studios, and artist-facilitated businesses, programs, and collectives.
Some of these programs include: Larkin Arts, a community art center that opened in 2012 and has four symbiotic components: an art supply store, a fine arts gallery, a school with three classrooms, and five private studio spaces.
Old Furnace Artist Residency (OFAR) and SLAG Mag: Artist residency and arts&amp;culture quarterly zine focused on community engagement and social practice projects started in 2013.

The Super Gr8 Film Festival, founded in 2009. The 2013 festival featured more than 50 locally produced films, and all of the films in the festival were shot using vintage cameras and Super 8 film.
Arts Council of the Valley, including the Darrin-McHone Gallery and Court Square Theater, provides facilities and funding for various arts programs and projects.
OASIS Fine Art and Craft, opened in 2000, is a cooperative gallery of over 35 local artists and artisans exhibiting and selling their work. It offers fine hand-crafted pottery, jewelry, fiber art, wood, metal, glass, wearable art, paintings, and photography.
The Virginia Quilt Museum, established in 1995, is dedicated to preserving, celebrating, and nurturing Virginia's quilting heritage. It features a permanent collection of nearly 300 quilts, a Civil War Gallery, antique and toy sewing machines, and rotating exhibits from across the United States.

Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 15.7% of the population, up from 8.85% according to the census of 2000.
Of the 15,988 households, 22.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 32.7% were married couples living together, 10.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 53.0% were not families. About 27.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 17.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59, and the average family size was 3.06.
In the city, the population was distributed as 15.0% under the age of 18, 48.9% from 18 to 24, 21.2% from 25 to 44, 13.2% from 45 to 64, and 9.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 22.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 87.3 males.
The median income for a household in the city was $37,850, and for a family was $53,642. The per capita income for the city was $16,992. About 11.5% of families and 31.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.6% of those under age 18 and 9.5% of those age 65 or over.

6bhc9p,3,2017-05-16,Surface Pro 3 still economically viable for my intended purposes?,MoltarTheGreat,Surface,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/6bhc9p/surface_pro_3_still_economically_viable_for_my/,"# What I'm Looking For

Let us say that money is an actual issue, but I don't require too much. I don't need all of the bells and whistles, as I'm not accustomed to having them anyway, although I do expect the maximum utility for my dollar (or, the ""most bang for my buck"").

I'm very much so into academic research, and as such being able to read publications and articles in 'PDF' form and highlight/leave notes and save them via OneDrive would be ideal. The tablet I have kind of was previous-generation back when I got it in 2012, which if it gives you any indication, is horrible for reading on. As well, being able to read any types of books or articles would be extremely beneficial. The stylus pen is a bonus!

As well, I'd like to be able to write out diagrams. Currently I have a white board I can sketch on, although erasing is a pain, the issue is sharing ideas. The *only* way I can share is by taking a screenshot. Collaborative editing is impossible/nightmarish without a touch screen, and as such isn't possible although very beneficial.

Finally, just for overall recreational activities. I like to other things during my down-time, and I never move my laptop and use it as a more-portable less-powerful gaming desktop. As such, I don't expect to be able to play most games on it, but I would like to be able to play at least *some* of more low-powered games if possible.

## Why not the Surface Pro 4

If I could afford the Surface Pro 4 over the Surface Pro 3, the only issue I have is ""how screwed would I be if I dropped/broke/lost it or if it was stolen"". If I spent $500 Surface Pro 3 versus $1000+ Surface Pro 4, I'd be *much* less likely to take the Surface Pro 4 with me than the Surface Pro 3, for obvious reasons. 

## What do you think is 'economically viable'

I think it is viable if, say given enough funds, you would be able to purchase it, use it to it's maximum potential and be satisfactory with your decision, and have it be disposable *enough* that you didn't have to worry about replacing it if the worse case scenario happened. 

This summer, I have an internship, and I won't get paid until the end of next month (Google Summer of Code), and while technically then I could purchase it, buying a $1000+ device would use majority of my stipend. Technically, I *could* save up to the end of summer, but as I said before it would benefit my research greatly, and so I want it as soon as possible.


## Desired Price Range $500 - $750 (MAX)"

- 1. Cute. (This is a must.  I know *all* kittens are cute, but extra points for *extra* cuteness).

We got the keys at 9 AM, and went straight to the apartment with a car full of stuff, namely my suitcase and a hamper full of clothes. We unloaded the car, and then left to go get some of the heavier things from my apartment, which is about a 10 minute drive from his new place. When we got back, there were two cleaning ladies from the rental company in the apartment. We unloaded the truck onto the back porch so that they could clean, and left again to get another load of things. When we returned, the cleaning ladies had finished and were about to leave. We spoke briefly and they left. 

Around 1:30 on Monday, I noticed that my suitcase and hamper were missing. We called the rental company and they spoke with the cleaners, who said that they put all of my things on the side of the road next to the trash cans. We recovered the hamper, which they'd placed in a trash bag, but the suitcase was nowhere to be found. I've filed a police report, but since it was on the side of the road, the police officer said there isn't much they can do. 

The rental company has stated that they will ""get back to me"" sometime today. My question is, what should/can I do? The suitcase was packed with 3 months worth of clothes, toiletries, shoes, and other items as I'm leaving the country for the summer later this month. There was, at minimum, $500 worth of things in the suitcase, which I don't have the money to replace as the internship I'm leaving for is unpaid. Any advise would be incredibly appreciated. "
6bhouz,39,2017-05-16,I drink because of my husband's family,ilaich21,beyondthebump,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/6bhouz/i_drink_because_of_my_husbands_family/,"This is rant-y and a little petty at times, but whatever. Sorry ahead of time.

For some backstory...LO was born smack-dab between Christmas and New Year's so hubby and I had already agreed that we would have LO's birthdays in the middle of January to let the holidays die down. 

Other backstory...I hate my SIL. If you check my post history I've written about her before and we just do not get along at all. She's manipulative, entitled and has spent her entire life having a silver-spoon shoved up her ass.

This takes us to Friday night. SIL had a graduation type thing for school so DH and I attended sans LO. She threw a minor hissy fit about us not bringing LO but whatever. That's a minor thing.We were talking afterwards and someone asked about her next internship. She leaves June 1st for a place about a 3 hour plane ride from us and she will be gone for a year. She will be home for a few days at Thanksgiving and then I think for a week at Christmas/New Year's. 

While discussing her holiday break she says ""Oh you can choose any time in that week break to have LO's first birthday""...umm, excuse me? We tell her that we're having his first birthday party in the middle of January and apologize that she'll miss it. She asks if we can have a small get-together for his birthday while she's home. I almost said sure until she said ""we can get him a small smash cake for it. It'll be great!"" I again apologize that she'll miss it but say we're just having his one party in the middle of January.

DH later asked what the big deal was to have a smash cake with her there. Sorry hubby, but not only is she a pain in my ass, but the whole excitement over a smash cake is seeing how they react to that kind of food for the first time and my family has just as much right to be there as his family does and I'm not making everyone attend 2 parties in a matter of weeks right around the holidays. That's just stressful. I didn't make her move halfway across the country for a year. She is choosing to do that and I'm not bending over backwards to accommodate her. Perhaps if I didn't despise her with every fiber of my being, but no. I'm having MY child's birthday party on my terms. "

My grades are all high, I know my shit and I do really good in interviews. I can program in R, ANOVA, logistic regression, longitudinal analysis, time series, correlation analysis, heteroscedastic variance. And I can do clustering, association, classification etc. 

I honestly feel capable of doing high level statistics/data science for a company however when I look on job sites they all seem to be looking for overly qualified people with 2-10 years of experience. Thanks for the help"

He's 22, living with a makeshift family including his brother (age 18) and 3 friends (age 19, 20, 21) in Southern California. All of them have shit parents that they can't live with because they are either homeless themselves or drug addicts, etc, so they've been trying to make it on their own since they were (or are) teens/young adults. They recently got kicked out of the place they were living at (whole other story) and they have had to live out of their cars or motels for the past month or so. They tend to have trouble holding jobs, but generally have consistent employment working minimum wage, however, 3 of them are having to pay child support as well. They also have frequent car troubles. I want to help them get on food stamps (assuming they qualify) and maybe other forms of government assistance, I'm just not entirely sure what's out there. However, the main issue at hand is the living situation.

The only one with credit is my boyfriend and it's bad, he also has some debt, and is working minimum wage (trying to find better work). It looks to me like there's no way anyone would rent to them. Low income housing is an option but has huge waiting lists.

I'm not in a position to be able to help them in any significant way. I'm a college student, living with my parents and siblings (graduating next June). I do have good credit (700s) and will be working in a high paying internship ($22.50/hour) during the summer and my employers have basically told me that they would want to keep me through the year until I graduate and then hire me. I'm not sure if I can or really want to help them get a place using my credit and whatnot. But I want to help any way I can.

We just don't know what to do and I don't know how I could help. If any of you have any advice we desperately need it."

She is not motivated to search for it because she couldn't find one year ago and she basically says that she will be not searching this year because it's like ""begging for a internship"". She also plans going for Masters, but it means she will finish university at age 27-28 with no work experience.


Her parents give her money for living. She also has aggression attacks, she says something like: ""I'm stupid and I will finish in Mc Donald"" - it's kinda rare but sometimes she says things like this. I was trying to help her, but whenever I try, she reacts with aggression. 


Am I overreacting with being upset ? I am afraid, that when her parents stop giving her money, it will be my turn to take care of money for both of us. I think I will not be happy with partner who is not working and dependent on my finances.

Having just completed an accelerated community college program in another city including an internship that did not result in a job offer, I had no roof over my head so decided to return to live with my parents (temporarily) in their guest room on an air mattress.   

Although my mother nagged me about some stuff and treated me like a teenager (bedtime by 11pm when I prefer to go at 11:30pm-12am) during my first week back, it was generally ok.  I'm getting a break on living expenses and am trying to remain productive during the week to ensure I don't stay at their home too much (parents know I had an internet addiction for which I sought treatment) by walking 30-60 mins/day, going to the library, helping with chores, etc.   I buy some of my own food, otherwise dad cooks dinner for my mom and I.   I know I'm lucky to get a break like this but their nagging is starting to get on my nerves.  My dad already stated that staying with them for 2-3 weeks is ok, but it's not long term.  I know that and that's why I am spending most of my online time this week on job hunting.

Some examples:

* One day I told them in the morning that I would get to a public library by 10am.  I ended up going later because my dad needed help with his car and his request seemed urgent.  My mom got home at 12pm, saw I was still there and had a fit.  I eventually left at 1:30pm, stayed until 6pm, then did more job hunting (online applications) in the evening.   My mom complained, ""I thought you said you were going to the library in the morning..."" (in a whiny tone of voice)

* Yesterday I applied to 6 jobs online.   My college professor gave me a contact at one of the companies and after applying, I found out the approximate hourly wage they are paying.   It turns out to be ~$16/hr which I used to make in customer service.  I told my dad and he was pissed because he had helped me financially to return to school and he thought the wage was way too low.  When the company's HR rep called me the next day for a phone screen, I was happy to take the call but my dad was pissed off that I was wasting my time since it also required relocation.  He told me to spend time studying optional exams to qualify for better paying positions in a big city rather than lower pay in a smaller town.   I understand his concerns but want a job now, not spend more time studying for exams I don't need for lower end positions.

* A second company I had applied for called me for a phone screen and I told my parents about it afterwards.   My father asked if they required the completion of certification exams and I said I didn't know.  This second job requires relocation to a remote place and I have a 1 bedroom apartment full of stuff that's in storage so he's pissed at the thought that I'd have to sell my stuff, lose money vs . the amount he paid when it was new (furniture, etc.).   He also said that it's nice that I'm having fun composing cover letters and reviewing my resume but that I'm losing sight of my REAL priority - studying for and passing the exams I mentioned above.

* My mom complained about my posture (ok I can stand up straight) and when she insulted me about something petty and I talked back, she got all dramatic saying ""so are you saying you have it so bad here?"" , as if she was looking to upset me on purpose. 

* I wasn't hungry at noon (their usual lunch time) and skipped lunch.  At 3pm I was hungry and got negative reactions from both mom and dad when I reached for a snack.  You'll ruin your appetite, why do you always do this, etc..

* I was in ""my"" room (no lock) , was changing to prepare to leave and my mom thought it was okay to barge in and let my niece watch some TV...because she said she could.  OK, how about knocking?   Just another example of the disrespect my mom shows

* Mom parked the family car on the driveway one way, dad moved it, they got into an argument for nothing.  Then later my dad couldn't find his cell phone and my mom insulted him nagging ""you always lose stuff!!.."" (in an angry tone, totally unnecessary 

* Mom noticed I had the light on in one room where I was working on my laptop and took issue with that because she thinks that it's ridiculous to have lights on during the day.  Already under stress with deadlines looming and pressure to find a job asap, plus a bunch of noise that disturbed me all morning, I got pissed off.   She then says sarcastically ""oh you have it so difficult here"".  Well my dad told me he avoids friction with her as well because she's very critical of him.  Looks like I'm getting heat now when I do things she doesn't approve of, even stupid things like a light on in a particular room (that she's not even in)

**tl;dr** 

Went back to school in my 30s, graduated, now job hunting and being insulted by judgemental parents about decisions I make.  My priority is find a job and make money, dad insists I'm wasting time fooling around on the Internet and is adamant I study for two optional exams.  Both parents are bossing me around and although I appreciate the financial break (unemployed and need to pay back student loan soon), the nagging/treating me like a child is not.   I need to be surrounded by optimism now, not pessimist judgemental parents.   Any advice?

TL;DR at the end.

I am the oldest.  A former Golden Child, I excelled in school and was lauded for being attractive and smart.  My development was nurtured for a good portion of my life, because I was a “good daughter.”  I made my Narcissist Mother look good.  Top of my class, attractive, and a Stanford marine bio intern.

But I was “weird.”  I struggled with my sexuality and gender in high school, and slowly my mother realized that I didn’t fit the image she was going for.  When I was 16 I had an incredible girlfriend – I wasn’t really inclined to label myself just yet, but if I had to put myself in a box, “bisexual” fit just fine.  Well, that just wasn’t acceptable, because according to NMom bisexuality doesn’t exist… or something.  I think it was just an image thing, or her pride.  She didn’t want her perfect daughter being seen as promiscuous, even though I had been monogamously in love for a year (which is a long time for a 16-year-old), had literally only kissed one person in my life, and was still a virgin.

I was gaslit for years, with my mother insisting that I was actually a lesbian (a much more acceptable label in her opinion).  I spent much of my teenage life confused – did most lesbians still have sexual feelings for men?  That didn’t seem right at all.

Slowly, I became the scapegoat, and my little sister became the golden child. I was the family’s punching bag for some time, bearing the brunt of all family tension.  

Meanwhile my mother started to micromanage my appearance.  I had her “permission” to be a lesbian but wasn’t allowed to be “one of those butch ones.”  No matter how desperately I wanted to cut my annoyingly thick, two-foot-long tangled mess of a hairdo, it would conflict too much with my mother’s image.  Flannel was strictly prohibited, and I was required to shave and wear makeup every single day.  This was all done under the idea that I should “care about my appearance,” even though things like my personal hygiene were just fine, and I didn’t see the point in wearing makeup to school when my focus should be studying.

The insults from the family were incessant, especially NMom.  I was told over and over that I was disgusting and made the family look bad, then was told that I was over-emotional and overly sensitive when it upset me.

I was kicked out of the house at 17 because my mom claimed that I was abusing her, and that she couldn’t take my hysterics anymore.  She essentially dumped me into a psych ward with some mental health issues, since dealing with all of this caused some suicidal ideation and depression.  She visited me in there only once, and just to tell the case manager that she didn’t want me back into her home.  Moving out was legitimately one of the best thing that ever happened to me, and even though I had to deal with the abandonment of being left in a psych hospital and told never to come back, I finally felt this glimmer of hope – I had the potential to be happy again.

I was 19 when I started dating an amazing guy (and I’m still with him to this day) because, well, I liked boys.  My mom could call me a lesbian all she wanted, but I was in love with him.  I still am.  When my mom found out, she told me that she was taking me to get sterilized.  She thought that I was too stupid to use adequate protection and didn’t think I should be allowed to pass on the crazy gene or something.  She never followed through, but that fucking hurt.

I started medically transitioning to male not long after this.  Obviously, this didn’t fit into my mother’s image of a perfect family either, so when she found out (I kept it from her for months) I had to listen to her hour-long tirade over the phone about how I was mutilating my body, and that I was disgusting and no one would ever love me.  At this point I finally had the balls to say, “Respectfully, mom, I know for a fact that’s not true, and I wasn’t asking for your permission.”  Cue a barrage of calls and texts from my enabler father and grandmother accusing me of abusing NMom again.

I’ve been NC with my mom since my birthday two years ago.  She and my father took my boyfriend and I out to dinner to celebrate but pretended that my boyfriend didn’t exist the entire time.  I was trying to get past the awkwardness so I just started talking about my new job.  I told her that I was working with children with special needs and that it was really fulfilling because it felt like I was making a difference.  She turns to my father and says, in a sickly-sweet, condescending voice, “Aw, she thinks she’s important.”  My boyfriend was horrified and sat there in stunned silence.  I told my mom that that was really hurtful, and she launches back into accusing me of being too sensitive and unable to take a joke.

Honestly, I never realized how awful my mom was until I saw the horrified look on my boyfriend’s face.  When my mom took us back home, he burst into tears because he felt an understanding of my anxiety and fear wash over him in one big wave.  He felt an understanding of why whenever he asked me a question I got defensive or thought I was being made fun of, and it was just a lot for him to process.

I’ve been NC for more than two years now, but my mom still throws around my name and image when she wants to paint herself as progressive and selfless and loving.  She conveniently forgets my existence, however, when she wants to paint a picture of her perfect little family.

TL;DR I’m a trans guy who got demoted from golden child to scapegoat after struggling to find out who I am.  My deviance ruined my mother’s perfect image in her eyes."

I'm a rising junior in undergraduate and I'm buying my very first car. I've been using my parents' cars and honestly it's a huge hassle to sync their schedules with mine. 

I've long been a car enthusiast and after doing some extensive research, it seems that the GTI is a great combination of fun and practicality. I'm commuting to a summer internship about 20 miles away from my home this summer, so this is important to me.

I've found a used 2014 Driver's edition DSG mk6 with about 30k on the odo. As far as I can tell, it's stock (I haven't seen it in person yet). They're asking $17,700 for it. I've heard that the mk6 is notorious for bad water pumps, but I saw from the CarFax that this one had its pump replaced at 20k. Besides that, a clean carfax.

So I wanted to ask you guys, what do you think? Is the GTI a good fit for me? Is $17,700 reasonable (and if it isn't, how much should I try to get it for?) Are there are any other major issues that I should be aware about? I don't plan on modding this car in the near future. 

Cheers. :)"

Pay is objectively good (~$60k) but the work is nowhere near as straight forward as proposed before I accepted the position. Management is terrible, timelines are constantly changing requiring everyone to put in overtime, and expectations of deliverables are always unrealistic and then management gets upset when you can't meet what you never promised.

Now I get that no job is gonna be exactly as described or put off as in interviews. They're putting on their best just as you are. I understand that. But what I want to know is what my options are? Should I try to renegotiate compensation (if not more pay then maybe more vacation time or something)? Should I just start looking for another job and write this off as a ""bad"" company/job/position? Or am I just being a big whinny crybaby entitled millennial? For what it's worth, I've done internships and freelance work at much bigger companies and work has never been like this even during what was considered ""crunch"" so I'm just not sure what I should do. Any advice is appreciated :/

6bka74,10,2017-05-16,I think Bill Clinton deserved to be impeached and believe democrats would impeach any Republican President who did the same thing.,1March2017,unpopularopinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/6bka74/i_think_bill_clinton_deserved_to_be_impeached_and/,"* Republican has multiple sexual harassment accusations against him, including an accusation of rape before he ever even announces his run for the Presidency

* One accusation against him is that he pressured interns into performing sex acts on him when he was the governor of Arkansas

* While in office of the Republican POTUS, he is in a deposition over the accusation that he pressured interns into sex.  He was asked, under oath, if he was having sexual relations with any current interns. He lied...while under oath.

* When the accusations came out that he lied under oath he called a press conference and went on national Tv and said ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman"", while also making implication that Lewinski may be mentally ill

* He and his wife make the rounds painting the whole thing as a ""Vast left Wing Conspiracy""

* Evidence is then found that 100% proves that he was lying when he said he ""did not have sexual relations with that woman""...


And people want to pretend that the Democrats and all the women's groups wouldn't do everything in their power to impeach such a president?

That is such bullshit....Democrats would be screaming from the roof tops about how sexist and misogynistic he was and how such a thing cannot be allowed in the White House.  

The reality is everyone is full of shit....every single democrate in congress and the Senate claimed Clinton was innocent....if he was a republican it would be the republicans claiming innocence and the democrats out for blood.


Either way, such an action deserves impeachment"

Unfortunately, I have no friends who work at Apple (all of my friends are a bunch of party goers who work as clerks at retail stores, so basically, none of them are brainiacs). 

I would like to ask if there are any employees who work in a software position in Cupertino, CA. at Apple who are willing to refer me? I have been programming for a little over 10 years and while I don't have the best academic transcripts, I am very experienced and I have experience in helping those in my university with 4.0 GPAs with their programming assignments and they have told me that I have great knowledge in computer science.

So I would like to ask if there are any who are interested. I am willing to send you my resume in addition to my linkedin profile and even my website which includes a portfolio of my work. If interested, please send me a private message and I will provide my email address, website URL, and linkedin profile.

Looking to build my portfolio and possibly make money.,justgorgias,cad,https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/6bl0zv/freelancing_as_a_student_looking_to_build_my/,"I'm currently an aerospace engineering student going into my third year, and I want to build my CAD skills and develop a portfolio to show when applying for internships, and eventually jobs. I have an inkling that my lack of a portfolio is one reason I haven't had any luck getting internships so far, apart from the general competitiveness of the aerospace industry.

I also had the idea that I might be able to make some money on the side if I was able to land some freelancing gigs. Since I'm not out of school yet, I wouldn't be looking to be paid a lot, just something to help with living expenses potentially.

So my first question is: has anyone heard of someone doing, or done themselves, basic freelance CAD design as a student, i.e. before finishing a degree? I don't even know if this is an option, but I'd like to hear from anyone who might have insight.

As a followup: what's the best way to start building a portfolio right now, regardless of getting paid for it? I enjoy biking and working on bikes, so I've thought about doing some drawings of bike parts and making assemblies from those. Is this a good use of my time? If not, what are some other good projects?

I should mention, I have taken a class on SolidWorks as part of my curriculum, so I'm familiar with it and have used it for several out-of-class projects as well. I would be open to learning another software in my free time if there's one that's more universal or appealing to customers.

I'd love to hear from anyone – freelancers, industry professionals, or students – who can give me some insight or tips. Thanks!"

Subs will have an increased role than what you might think.

1. A full sub team will be in place to practice with the main team to help form strategies and practice comps.

2. If the starter cannot attend the event, the sub will automatically play in place.

3. We expect the sub team to FULLY practice together either during the same time as the main team or to their own accord.

4. Will have access to full team resources (discord, discussion, meetings, etc.)

If you are interested please PM me or add me on league! (IGN: Shøwtime)

It was then that I got my TMJ diagnosis. The ENT said the misaligned jaw was causing my earache.  

Currently I have a lot of symptoms that sound like TMJ; headache, head painful to touch, earache, throat pain, jaw pain, facial pain and even tinnitus. The thing is, I noticed I also have a lump on my left temple, and I haven't read about TMJ causing anything like that, so I'm worried I might have something in addition to TMJ.

*Anyway, without further dallying, the prompt:*

---

No one at work knows who I am. Not really. To them, I'm just the skinny, introverted, effette intern who does the photocopying and makes sure a pot of coffee's always on the boil. Most of them assume that I'm gay - I'm bi, actually, but my history of hetero behaviour is so minute I don't care to correct them - but if they knew who my current boyfriend was... Well, I wouldn't have a job anymore, that much is certain.

Now, for some people, getting fucked by a dog is something they meticulously plan: they fantasize, they pick a breed, they make the purchase, they figure out how to get mounted and bam: they're a dog-fucker. Me, on the other hand, I kind of... Fell into it. 

To be honest, I didn't even really want a dog.

I first met you about a year ago: I was in college at the time, and I'd made a friend in one of my elective classes (it would be funny if it was Zoology, but nah: Pre-Columbian History of the Americas). It was your standard casual friendship: we hung out, played video games, smoked a joint or two and watched Adventure Time. Usually in that order.

You, of course, were his dog. Almost two hundred pounds of hard animal muscle, and a rather keen interest in humping my legs. I objected of course: frankly, getting humped by a horny mutt was the last thing on my mind (blowing your owner was more the order of the day, but alas: straight), and I could tell by the lump against my jeans leg that you were most certainly *not* neutered.

However, your owner was far from concerned. ""Happens all the time,"" he said, as if I wasn't getting shin-raped by a hellhound. ""Dude, you *cannot* get him off once he's started rutting. Best just to ride it out.""

Needless to say, I was far from impressed.

Twelve minutes, a pair of ruined jeans and three lost 1v1 rounds of Call of Duty later, you were idly licking your cock clean, and I was adamantly *insisting* on a new pair of jeans to go home in.

I revisited on a few more occasions - not the best idea, I know, but your owner was hot, I was horny, and I am *disgustingly* bad at choosing sexual partners. I had the foresight to switch from jeans to shorts, and so washing off your cum became just a matter of sticking my leg into the shower. *Clearly* the start of a whirlwind romance.

Come the end of my degree, I came to learn that your owner was moving out of town... And that you wouldn't be coming with him. ""Come on, man,"" he pleaded. ""It's either you or the pound, and you know what'll happen then. Besides, he *likes* you."" Part of me wanted to tell him to fuck off, but a larger, hornier part of my brain thought I might be able to cash in a favor of this size for a casual, no-homo, experimental friend-BJ.

No such luck, but that afternoon I brought you back to my apartment. The humping continued over the next couple of months, my sexual frustration only ramped up during that time and, well, one thing lead to another...

About a year later, and my apartment's changed radically. For one, most of the furniture's gone: I wouldn't *dare* have guests over with you around, and I figured I was better off selling my useless assets and putting the money in some long-term investments. After all, I have to plan for life *after* being a dog's bitch. 

I strip out of my dress shirt and slacks almost immediately, replacing my tie with a thick leather collar. There's a stainless steel loop in the front to clip a leash to, which you're more than happy to tug on when I'm in one of my *kinkier* moods. Well, kinkier than *just* getting fucked by a dog, but I digress.

I keep all my clothes in the entryway closet. The bedroom's your domain, and it's oddly therapeutic to leave my identity at the threshold. In here, I'm yours, and everything else is a secondary concern at best.

I don't stay completely naked, however. I tug a pair of rainbow-striped thigh highs up my smooth, toned legs. I like feeling faggy when I'm fucked: sue me. The rest of my body is thin, but well-cared for, with a firm, shapely posterior jutting out behind me. As weird as it might seem, you've become the reason I stay in shape. I like feeling like a capable fucktoy, and you seem to enjoy it when I come to you all sweaty after hopping off the elliptical in the living room. I think I might actually be the healthiest I've ever been.

And with that, I get on my hands and knees, my ass cheeks spreading open as I start to crawl. My asshole is pink and distended in contrast to my smooth, pale skin: you've been shoving your knot inside me for almost a year now, and it shows. It's been four months since I've needed lube. You've essentially turned my ass into your personal cunt.

I've gotten good at getting around on all fours. I've read up a bit on canine psychology since you moved in, and from what I gathered, walking on two feet might be seen as a challenge to your dominance. I'm not afraid of conflict, per se: I'm the apex predator with two opposable thumbs, after all. However, I *like* you dominant, and anything I can do to assert your position as the head of the household gets me off all the better.

I find you in the bedroom, lazing on our mattress as the sun shines in through a skylight. One time, that skylight was embroiled in a close call involving poor communication with my landlord and an unexpected roofing job, but right now it merely serves as an ideal source of sunlight in an apartment with *lots* of drawn blinds. 

The mattress sits directly on the floor - a bed frame is just another disposable asset, and ease of access became kind of necessary once our living arrangement became clear. Save for a fitted sheet and an oft-humped pillow, our bed is bare: stained with cum and stale sweat, and coated in stray hairs. A comforter isn't necessary: your body is *plenty* warm, and I tend to keep the heat ramped up so that I don't freeze to death while crawling around like a naked bitch.

Our eyes meet as I hop onto the mattress, laying down next to you in the sunlight, feeling your fur against my smooth skin. I'm hard as a rock, of course, but we both know I won't be putting it to use. Instead, I wait for you to take the lead, longing to be made yours again...

---

*Sometimes a fantasy gets out of control. This is one of those cases where a stray thought turned into a novella. The set-up here kind of leads to a period where I'm already your willing and eager bitch, but I'd happily also play out our initial meeting, or a time not long after you've moved in with me.*

*I'm also open to incorporating a third, human character (male or female) that gets off on my living situation, with possible blackmail involved. That said, I'd prefer the story's focus stay with myself and my canine lover.*

*So, if you're down to be my Doggy Dom, holler at me! Some of the my kinks include humiliation, oral, anal, crossdressing, casual/routine penetration, huge creampies, sweat and poor hygiene (no scat, though), reverse petplay, risky/public sex and servitude.*

*So, umm, be my dog and fuck me? ^^It's ^^so ^^fucking ^^weird ^^typing ^^that ^^out...*

*Edit: Please try and be creative, or at the very least informative in your reply. One-liners are... Less than ideal.*"

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new group of interns was arriving later that day.

___________________________________________________

You're going to put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review? My secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks? A young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me?

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be the head of a larger company, looking to take over another smaller one - and add another slut to her harem. Or a reporter who turns up dirt on the company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anybody else you want to be! Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well!

My ultimate fate is up to you - will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused.

Bondage, foot worship, petplay, and forced tattooing/piercing/branding are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. Futa is okay.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!

But then, I studied abroad and our entire relationship kind of went to shit. So some backstory, his last ex-girlfriend of 6 years (ahhh right?) studied abroad in Prague and they broke up over that time because she cheated on him, broke his heart and betrayed him. Now I was also studying abroad in Prague which he thought was funny because his ex-girlfriend also did. He had mentioned that he was nervous that I was studying abroad there and I’m guessing it was because he didn’t want our relationship to be like it was with his last relationship was. 
He has a busy stressful life with a 6 hour internship every week day and then a full load of college at night. He was having problems with every part of his life when I first got to Prague. I was so excited to be there and wasn’t really there for him when he needed me. I would text him still all the time but I guess that he needed something more. After that he felt like he was ignored by me and felt like I wasn’t reciprocating the skype and phone calls so he kind of gave up on initiating that. He focused on his work and school life and I focused on my new life in Prague. He started pushing himself away from me after that because he doesn’t want to be hurt. That is frustrating for me because that means that he never wants to really be affectionate and loving to me because he is pushing back so much. He never initiates anything sexual and rarely reciprocates anything when I do. I sometimes think that he doesn’t find me attractive sexually anymore. One time I brought up the fact that he never sends me any dirty pictures haha he says that he is busy. He actually is very busy but that’s bullshit because I am pretty sure that he has some alone time at least a little. Ya he lives in a room with him younger brother but he has his own apartment he lives at during the week. Like are you telling me that you haven’t been naked with a boner for the past few weeks like come on. And I am not a bad girlfriend. I am nice, loving, encouraging, and very loyal and faithful but he makes me feel like I am always walking this fine line between offending him and saying something positive I guess. I never know if something I say will offend him and that makes it hard for me to be honest about the way the I feel and it makes it even harder to stand up for myself and call bullshit on something that is definitely full of bullshit!
Like I said, he isn’t very good at forgiving me and he is also very sensitive. This is kind of a recipe for constant offending him without meaning to and then him not really getting over it. He is still really hung up on this one time back when I first time in Prague and we were starting to have issues. I really don’t remember what he said on the phone but it really pissed me off and I hung up on him. And he has still not forgiven me for that and it was 3 months ago!!!
After that time I wasn’t really there for him when he needed me, he has not been the same loving, adorable, caring, and attentive boyfriend that I had always loved. It has been 3 months since we went south and I don’t know what to do to make our relationship like it was before. 
Another thing that is making him upset is that I wasn’t sacrificing any of my time to talk to him in Prague and the only times we would talk were when I was free. I lived in a dorm with all of my friends and we constantly hung out and went out. Therefore the only times that I was free and had nothing else going on were on Sundays or random days during the week. I was also 5 hours ahead and he was so busy something that his day wouldn’t be over until 11 pm and by that him it would be 4 am in Prague. I didn’t want to miss out on anytime with my friends because I was only in Prague for 3 and a half months. He was mad at that because he felt like I was his last priority and I would always choose my friends over him. And now that I am back in the states I have a lot more time to text and skype him and he is mad because he feels like I am giving him more of my time because I have nothing else to do.  Damned if I do and damned if I don’t right?
We used to be able to fix all of our problems over a long skype session but recently our long skype sessions just l lead to unresolved arguments, me crying and him not really articulating his feeling well enough for me to understand what he feels and is upset about. He used to call me beautiful and tell me he loves me but now he doesn’t do that much anymore unless I say it first. He can be a little cold and unemotional I think because of the fact that he is holding back emotionally and doesn’t want to get hurt. I love that he still loves me but he isn’t “in love” with me the way that he used to be and that hurts. He is being a hypocrite because he is upset about that time that I wasn’t there for him and then goes around and isn’t there for me at all. And the funny thing is that I wasn’t there for him for about 2 weeks but because he is upset and hasn’t gotten over that he hasn’t been there for me for the past 2 and a half months. I am so forgiving that if I done we decided to forgive me I would forgive him instantly.  He was definitely had trust issues from his previous relationship but I have been thinking recently that he has forgiveness issues too. I thought that he might have felt like he did in his past relationship back when I wasn’t there for him that one time and because it reminded him of the way he used to feel,  he closed himself off because he knew how bad he felt in his other relationship and didn’t ever want to feel like way again. I brought it up to him one time and he was sooo against that idea and madly said no. 
I have never had a boyfriend before so I have no idea what I am doing when it comes to resolving tough arguments. I really really love him still deep down and I know that I want to solve our problems and get us back to where we were but I can’t figure out what to do to make him forgive me. A month after I “abandoned him” I started being extra supportive and caring and I have been like that since because I felt guilty for not being there for him but there really hasn’t helped the situation. He one time told me that I have been being a good girlfriend now but he had still not gotten over the one thing so he couldn’t act the way he used to be. That is so frustrating! He is still the one that I talk to about my fears, joys, and everything about my day but I don’t think that he does that same with me. I have no idea what to do. I am confused about what I even did sometimes that is why that “one time I wasn’t there for him” was explained so vaguely. I can’t tell him he is being too sensitive and getting mad about something that really isn’t such a big deal or if I am actually at fault and deserve all of this crap. It is a tricky situation but please help me. 
TLDR: BF mad and me not being there for him when he needed me, so is pushing away, I don't know how to get him to forgive me"

She was cold, pretty heartless, but this week something has made her feel so much more warm and welcoming to her employees. She's had lunch with interns, and instead of them coming out with puffy eyes, they are smiling and thanking her for such an amazing time together! 

Something did change, and it's not what you think. At her house, an alien symbiote slithered into her bed and fucked her brains out, filling her pussy and ass with it's silver juices, infecting her and making her into the host of it's corruption. She tried to fight it, but the pleasure the silver brings simply overwhelms anyone it takes hold of, making them need to spread it to loved ones, no matter the age or the sex. 

The CEO has invited a mother and lovely son to the company the day before to help give a nice little test run of all the fun ""activities"" the kids will do. The mother has no idea her boss is about to turn her little boy into a slut, begging for silver cum and juices, but the mother will find out soon enough...

Activities include

Transformation, non-con, corruption, sounding, waterworks, squrting, lactating, futa, anal, pegging, bi play, pegging

No age limits, this is only the start of the story, there will be so much more to do once the trial is over and everyone brings in their lovely children to unknowingly taste the silver love! 

Send me a PM with one way you think the boy should be tested :)"
6bon11,1,2017-05-17,"How do you [20F] grieve someone you once loved, but who isn't that person anymore [20M]?",phototropism,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6bon11/how_do_you_20f_grieve_someone_you_once_loved_but/,"My ex and I were together for a year from Sept 2015-2016, and then from late Dec 2016 to this month (5 months). Before that, we'd been the best friends either of us had ever had since Dec 2014. 


The first time we dated was rough. He treated me the best any human had ever treated me; he was incredibly sweet and accommodating, and he was absolutely hilarious &amp; a bashful joy to be around. He surprised me with little gifts and letters all the time, and supported me in my interests, health, and feelings unconditionally. He listened when I told him to dial it back with his weed/alcohol habits, since he has an impulsive/hedonistic streak. 


But when this all happened I wasn't really ready to be in a relationship for the first half of things; I was just afraid he'd leave me if I didn't date him. The summer prior to Sept 2015, we had a thing (unexclusive). He fell in love with me, but I had just gotten out of a relationship and said I couldn't handle another one right away. I told him to move on, but he asked to keep hooking up anyway. When I started college, I slept with someone else, and he never really forgave me for that. Anxious that I would lose my closest friend, I asked to date him.


That year didn't really work out. I had a lot of unresolved issues from my previous relationship and childhood, and I took a lot of them out on him, without really understanding what I was doing. Things got worse as my health got worse. Eventually, he left me because he couldn't deal with my mental illness and how it affected my behavior/needs anymore. 


The three months we were apart a lot of things changed. I fell into a severe depression and dropped out of school. During this time he did a ridiculous amount of acid (a drug he had despised before), and started experimenting with a lot of hard drugs he said he'd never use. During this time, I was finally beginning to kick my codependent-relationship habit and become my own person.


In December, he hit me up to ask how I was doing. We had a brief conversation before I realized that I wasn't ready to talk to him, and he agreed that that was fine. He articulated that he still had damage from the previous relationship. 


Then on NYE, he hit me up on shrooms, tried to call me, and told me that he loved me, missed me, and wanted to see me, and that he was sure of what he was doing, because there was only one of me in this world.


When we got back together, we agreed that we weren't ready for a relationship, but he said a lot of things that fucked with me. That *first week* he told me he wanted to marry me again (we're 20 in college). He'd say other things too, like how he felt he still needed me, and how he hated other women because they weren't me. Pretty quickly I felt pulled back into the partnership we had before, and I pushed for a relationship.


But everything I loved about him was different. Whenever I talked about my depression, he was too tired to listen. He didn't support my efforts to make friends. Often, he wouldn't even say anything back when I told him about people or projects that were important to me. I never got any straight answers when I brought this up. He stopped romancing me, which he used to go out of his way to do. He stopped making jokes. 


I felt like drugs took up a lot of the space that I used to in his life. His entire friend-group consisted of drug people, some of whom also dealt. He tried to convince me to be okay with him dealing edibles, too (which is something I'm personally not comfortable being so close to). 


He always had me smoke with him, which I did because it was his primary hobby. I found out that I had to take a drug test for my internship this summer, and I was really scared, because I don't know much about cheating drug tests. The day of the drug test, I had a stressful day and I just wanted to see him after everything, but he blew me off to help christen a new bong his friend got. Whenever I brought this up later, he'd just tell me that I never got over anything, and that I passed the drug test anyway. 


There were other drug-related incidents I was really unhappy about, as I felt they showed how little he cared about me. He once kicked me out of his room so his friends could come over—*after* he had me take dabs with him. I was nearly asleep when he told me they were coming over in ten minutes. When the brownies he had me eat got me ridiculously high, he told me he had little sympathy because ""everyone has bad trips."" Another time, he went out around 12AM to sell his friend edibles. The last messages he sent me were ""I'm getting cash at the ATM,"" and ""I'm almost at their place."" I woke up at 3AM to an empty bed and no texts or calls. I was scared out of my mind. We go to school in a high-crime neighborhood, where we get message alerts about robberies all the time. Few people knew we were dating, so it wasn't like I'd be the first to know if he'd been shot dead. Turns out he had just been discussing his startup with his friend who he happened to run into, and because I had said I was probably going to sleep, he didn't think to send me a text.  


This semester, I actively tried to change my own problematic behaviors. Whenever I would feel that we were about to fight or that the conversation would escalate, I'd ask for us to both step back (which was often ignored). During a tense conversation, I asked for us to talk about good times we had so we'd feel less animosity towards each other. I tried to rationalize my own black-and-white thinking so I wouldn't get angry with him over perceived abandonment. I repeatedly asked over and over for him not to yell, because it worsens my anxiety. He'd agree, but only to break his word and yell later on. 


After a while I lost my will to mitigate conflict. He was still yelling, still sarcastic, and still argumentative when he hurt my feelings. It felt like I was the only one trying at all. I started yelling and arguing with him too, and my black-and-white thinking got worse again. 


During the semester, there were a lot of times where he was the primary source of my unhappiness. But I couldn't leave, because I kept trying to chase the person he once was. I thought if I stuck around for long enough, he'd appear again. 


The final straw was when I needed to talk to him when I felt suicidal. He called 7 minutes later than he said he would (I had already been waiting 30 minutes, triggering my issues with perceived abandonment), and said he had to go soon, because he ""had things to do."" I got angry, because he had told me earlier he was going to a party. He blew me off at my lowest to go to a party. Just two years ago, he drove out from his class to where I was, just to support me when I was having a crisis episode. I hadn't asked him to or anything, and we weren't even dating. Why was it that this time around, a simple call to his girlfriend wasn't something he was willing to do?


He dumped me last week, saying it wasn't his responsibility to support me. I've been having a really hard time, oscillating between dissociations and panic attacks. This week we matched on Tinder (???) and he started messaging me, but I quickly realized he was only excited to know that I was still attracted to him. One of the things he said was, quote: ""We can just know we still find each other attractive and just unmatch."" Then he said he didn't do anything wrong that last night, and told me what he was looking for on the app—""to hang out around someone, something that he could actually work towards."" 


The Tinder interaction felt just like the messages he sent in December: self-serving. I feel like he just *dips* back into my life whenever he feels he needs to, then leaves me when my mental health gets worse. The worst part is, he doesn't realize all that he's done wrong, and it's so infuriating. 


I feel really betrayed. I feel like I was roped into talking to him again when it wasn't something I was ready for. I fought all semester for us to work, and now that it didn't, I feel like I wasted my time. Currently it's finals week, but I've been so out of it that it's hard to concentrate on anything. I lost a lot of my progress from my time away from him. I'm really angry with myself for going back to him.


The person he is now is nothing like the person he once was, but it's been so hard for me not to conflate the two. Reddit, how do you grieve someone you once loved who's personality has changed?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I recently got out of a relationship with someone who was incredibly sweet the first time we dated, but who was selfish and unsupportive the second time around. How do you move on from who they once were?"

I am looking for an NES/general video game emulator that has python scripting. I recently saw a video by a guy named SethBling on youtube who created a neural network for Super Mario World and I thought I would give it a shot on some other games.

The emulator he used only has support for Lua. I know the language is pretty easy to learn, but I am about to start an internship in ML using Python and I thought this project would be good practice for that. 

Let me know if you know of one, thanks!"

6bpmr4,1,2017-05-17,[M4F] Weekend with my daughter's college roommate,Nemo_Is_Here,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6bpmr4/m4f_weekend_with_my_daughters_college_roommate/,"I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa.... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are."

**Analysis and Small Summary:**
[Right off the bat, The Houseguests were split into 4 Highschool Cliques and which ever Clique won the Opening Challenge would get an extra member who has played the game before. Rodesia from the Brains Clique was the last one standing during the first challenge, allowing Hex to join the game and become the first HOH. Hex targeted the 2 stronger Cliques, the Populars and the Athletes, she nominated the strongest women from each, leading to Lily's Eviction. Once again on a member of the Brains Clique won HOH on Week #2, keeping them safe for another week and keeping them in control. On Week #4, The Cliques were broken up meaning the HOH winner could nominate anyone, even someone from their own Clique, and that's exactly what Felix did. Felix nominated Eli beside Edward, but Hex won the Coup d'Etat and saved them both, Nominating Trevor beside Ruby, and the house then decided to get rid of Trevor. Week #5, Mya won HOH and nominated Tim beside Edward, but Tim won POV and saved himself, leaving Mya to nominate Carrie beside her fellow Clique Member. Both Populars were nominated beside eachother and in a tie, Mya evicted Edward. I loved how Eli got revenge on Felix for nominating her and got him evicted on week #6. The Brains were ruling the house, but during the Fast Forward Ruby nominated Hex, and after Mya won POV, she saved Eli over Hex, and in a tie Hex was voted out by Ruby. On Week #9, Eli nominated Ruby beside Rodesia, but Mya shockingly voted Rodesia out, leaving her as the only Brain in the house. When the Final HOH came around, Eli won it and decided to take Mya with her to the Finale over Ruby, but she made a stupid move because Mya won by a vote of 4-3. Congratulations /u/SavedBySkittles for creating your 3rd Winner and the 11th Winner of the series! All in all, this was an amazing season, Thank you to everyone who applied!](/spoiler)"
6bpwaf,1,2017-05-17,Question about car loans,twobabyseals,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6bpwaf/question_about_car_loans/,"Hey PR. I've read through a lot if your guys posts regarding cars and understand the stance ""if you can't buy it outright with cash you can't afford it"".

That is incredibly solid advice however I am going to ask a question assuming I do not follow this rule.

Quick background:

I am 21 years old. I graduated college a semester early while working 40 hours a week at an internship in my field (chemist) making okay money. I went to a college close to home so I could live with my parents to save money. I starting building credit a few years ago and have a score of 750.

Upon graduating the company I interned at offered me a position at 48k a year with benefits which I accepted.  I immediately payed off 12000 in college loans before they started aquiring interest (this is largely with money I made during the semester I graduated early).

So as I stand right now I have about 12,000 liquid cash still living at home and the only bills I have are car insurance and gas. (I drive an old car I bought off my parents for 1000 a few years ago.

I never really treat myself and I think I am going to with a car. After a few more pay periods I think I am going to buy a Mazda Miata (2016) for roughly 28k out the door (I've talked with a few dealerships).  I plan on putting 12k down and financing the rest over a 60 month period which puts my monthly payment around 288 and insurance will be 77. So total of about 365 a month on my car.

I am probably going to live at home for another year before moving out. During that time I was planning on putting large sums of money towards the car (between 500 to 1000) a month depending on other spendings on credit card.

My question is after this year my loan amount remaining should be somewhere between 6 to 10k. Will it look bad if I refinance the loan to lower my payment to somewhere in the low 200? Obviously the term would shorten also probably to about 3 years. I understand refinancing is to extend a loan typically and looks bad on credit.

If this form of refinancing still looks bad then I will not be purchasing the car this year and will simply save up over the year for a larger down payment.

Sorry for the long post. Thanks for the advice!"

6bqy9s,1,2017-05-17,My journey as a patient and student as well as job opportunities.,Grub_let,physicaltherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/physicaltherapy/comments/6bqy9s/my_journey_as_a_patient_and_student_as_well_as/,"Hey reddit! I figured I should post alittle something about my journey in PT.  Im currently a senior in high school and 6 months ago I tore my ACL playing soccer.  I was super bummed out but life goes on.  I got the surgery and ended up in PT.  I was always interested in Athletic training and movements of the body but I never had a way to get involved.  I took every advantage I could during the recovery to learn and explore my passion.  

Every senior in my school has to do a 4 week internship at a place of thier choosing. I chose to do it at my PT outpatient and I loved it! It was everything I could of hoped for.  I shadowed my Physical therapist as well as set up exercises and even worked with patients individually.  It is a relatively small outpatient so I got to work 1 on 1 with my Pt for most of the day.  In the down time, the DPT intern their taught me some anatomy and some higher level science stuff.  Since I was so experienced with the Knee due to my injury, he decided to get me started with the shoulder and I've been studying that for the past few weeks.  I never thought that I would be so interested in that but I really enjoyed it! I asked questions every chance I could get and made sure to sit back and just observe when I could as well.  I enjoyed everything from observing evals to assisting patients to just talking and socializing with everyone there.  It made me really happy to see the progress some of my patients made.  When I first started my ACL rehab, there was a stroke victim that came in the same time as me.  Seeing him struggle to walk and move his limbs made my knee injury feel like a small cut.  Last Friday he was discharged.  Since starting my internship I had the pleasure to work with him and learn more about him. I was so proud to see him walking on his own and just how much progress he made.  He has a long way to go but he is doing really well.  

This experience changed my life.  I am currently enrolled in the Athletic Training program at Plymouth State University and as of right now my plan is to enroll into a DPT program after undergrad.   Before my ACL injury, I had no clue what I wanted to do in college or life in General and this experience shaped how I think and I will be for ever grateful for that.  

Just a side question about Job opportunities.  Besides being a tech or aide, is there any other opportunities this summer for a job?  I applied for a tech position within my company and there wasnt any room for me but I was thinking of applying to a few other local PT outpatients close to me.  Besides that, is there any jobs maybe in a hospital or any other place that could hire me with the experience that I have? Obviously im going to ask my PT but hes away for a few days.  

Thanks for reading!"
6br42v,1,2017-05-17,M4F Seductive Couples and more,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6br42v/m4f_seductive_couples_and_more/,"Hello! I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in taboo relationships. Read On!

1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.

2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.

3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.

Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."

One of these was a girl in college who was interested in a lot of the same things I am, and who I was attracted to quite quickly.

We got on very well and after the project was finished on a night out to celebrate we had a really good time - but I wasn't in the mood to try and take things further.

Since then I've been talking to her on and off (depending on when I am and she is busy) and recently went to see her with another friend when she was ill to cheer her up. 

However I've asked her to do something with me twice now (not overtly romantic in nature) and didn't get a response either time. The latest question has been met with silence online (not even 'read') for a few days, even after another unrelated message. I also called her to offer to pick her up at one point as I was passing where I thought she might be and it was raining - but I just got a ""caller busy"" response.

She might not be interested in me, that's fair enough, but even so it'd be great to hang out as friends, but her communication isn't great (our mutual friend agrees). I want to try and see if we can be more than friends, but at the same time don't want to ruin what could be a cool friendship if she isn't interested (or dating someone else...?)

How do I got about taking this further? (feel free to ask follow up questions)

Barbara the Wise was a Dark Staffer of the Commerce Department. She was so powerful and so Wise, she could influence the other staffers to create..... classified files. She had such a knowledge of the dark secrets of the Clinton Family, she could even save the files she loved from being deleted. The Dark side of the Commerce Department is the pathway to many files, some, consider to be..... classified. She was so powerful, the only thing she ever feared or was afraid of was, losing her files. Which eventually of course, she did. She told the Chair everything she knew, and the chair stripped her naked and killed her after violently bruising her. Ironic, isn't it? She could save so many from deletion, but not herself.

He strongly recommends I replace it with something else, and I'm begrudgingly following his advice.

My favorite things about the Mini were its 6-speed manual transmission, its pickup, and go-kart handling. I'm not a fan of SUVs and prefer cars that are low to the ground. Already recommended (and approved!) cars include Miatas and Golf GTI's. 

I'm a 22 year old college student who will be graduating next semester. I won't be carting family members around and value spirited driving over practicality. However, the main issue with the Mini was maintenance -- it was a glorified BMW. If possible, I'd like a car that's cheap and easy to upkeep, despite being more spirited.

My price range is up to $10,000, but I'd prefer to keep it closer  to $5,000. I strongly prefer a manual transmission, and I need the car to be fun and up for spirited drives. The car will be my daily driver, and will most likely see snow.

I leave for an internship in Michigan in two weeks and this will be my first time selling my car and buying a new one (my parents gave me the Mini to drive in high school). Time is short so the sooner I figure this out the better! I live in Madison, WI (Zip Code 53719).

Thank you!

EDIT: After giving it some thought, I should probably get something with 4 seats, so the Miata is out 🙁"

So, my bf and I were dating for 2 and a half years when I left to a different state for a 6 month temporary internship. About 2 months into the internship, my bf at the time, broke up with me and claimed he no longer loved me anymore. He did this in person, while I was visiting. I was incredibly hurt by the situation, especially since I had to return to the state of my internship where I was already having a hard time making friends and felt even more alone after the break-up. I felt terrible because he remained pretty stoic as I bawled my eyes out.


I have tried my hardest to move on and tell myself it isn’t worth crying over anymore - but it’s been about 4 months and I can’t seem to keep analyzing what could have gone wrong in our relationship. I would really like to have one final conversation with him to hopefully provide some closure.


Some context about our relationship prior to the breakup - it was already pretty rocky. I was dealing with depression and was constantly angry/never wanted to do anything exciting or leave the bedroom. Part of me feels that this was a huge catalyst in him losing interest in me, but I don’t know for sure. 


This is why I would like to have a final conversation with him to apologize for my behavior and overall gain insight as to why he decided to ultimately end it. 


I keep going back and forth as to whether this is a good idea…. Is it worth it to have one last conversation with him?

So I have until June 1st to decide on where I would like to go for post-secondary.
Right now I'm split between UofT St George Comp Sci, and UofG Comp Sci Co-op.

If St George had co-op, I think I would probably go there. But since it doesn't, I'm liking UofG more. However St George has an internship type program after the fourth year of studying. Co-op sounds a lot better to me though.

I know many people say UofT is a great choice just because of how well known it is, and how the name increases your chances of being hired after graduation.

In your opinion, what is more important, co-op experience or education from a big name like UofT?

Thanks.

6bteph,6,2017-05-17,Not sure if I'm starting to relapse or just situational crap,kbern319,fuckeatingdisorders,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/6bteph/not_sure_if_im_starting_to_relapse_or_just/,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this, or if there even is a right place for this? But here goes.

A bit of background: I started using disordered behaviors my junior year in high school. Officially diagnosed with anorexia/orthorexia and GAD when I was 17. Fought the diagnosis until the end of school, at which point I was a good 30 pounds underweight. Went away to college, and my parents told me that if I wasn’t gaining weight within the first semester they were going to make me come home. They didn’t say it as a threat, but it was threatening nonetheless. 

So, I started meeting with a nutritionist and a counselor through the university. They were both pretty shit, and the weekly weigh ins pushed me into a cycle of restricting through the week and then binging the night before a weigh in. Eventually, this got out of control and I was stuck either meticulously counting out baby carrots or stuffing my face with processed crap. 

Regardless, it got me to a point of weight restoration, and my parents and friend thought I was fine. The binging pushed me into a depressive state and I couldn’t stop. The next five years were pretty much more of the same. I continued to gain, but managed to find a general sticking point and fluctuated in a fifteen pound range that was still a “healthy” weight for my height so no one ever really questioned the fact that my eating habits were all or nothing. 

In this time, I took a semester off of college and got some more intensive help that curbed things for a while but nothing really stuck. I still managed to graduate, took an internship out of state, and continued to manage the effects of the behaviors on my daily life. I felt like a shell of a person, I didn’t know how to cope with my general disgust for myself, but life kept moving along and I was doing what I was “supposed” to do. 

I finished my internship and moved across the country for a job and the change of scenery helped push me into a healthier relationship with food. Finding the satisfaction in work, friends, and my relationship at the time helped me stop retreating away from social and work events and I finally had a bit of peace. 

I got on an antidepressant about a year into the job, and it seemed like the final piece of the puzzle. For the first time in years, my binging was manageable. It still happened, but less, and with less severity. I could wake up the next morning and stop the cycle of punishing myself for it and prolonging things. I learned my triggers and did my best to avoid them and I thought this was what recovery would look like for me. 

Then, I got pregnant. This was one of my biggest fears back when Ana had it’s grip. I was sure I would balloon up, I would be disgusting, I would never feel comfortable in my own skin again. But that wasn’t the case. For the entire pregnancy I was actually really stable. I gained a healthy amount of weight, but I felt beautiful and I had a pretty good balance of healthy foods. For the first time in my adult life I was able to accept and give into cravings without feeling guilty. My son was born, and I half expected to go back to behaviors but again, not the case. 

A few months postpartum I even “dieted” (I use the term loosely, because I really just paid a little bit more attention to food choices and put more effort into working out) in an effort to lose the last bit of pregnancy weight. I felt great! I was back in the body I had come to know, I was choosing generally healthy foods but eating enough and often throughout the day. It was amazing.

Fast forward to now: My little guy is 14 months, and I’m still breastfeeding. I adore the nursing relationship, and have no desire to let it go. That said, I’ve continued to steadily lose weight since last summer. Not to an alarming rate, about 20 pounds altogether, but enough that I’m starting to waiver along the line of healthy-underweight. I feel like I can’t eat any more in a day. I’m compensating for the calories that he gets from me, but apparently not enough to make up for being tall, in my 20s, and having a generally high metabolism. 

I’m at a loss. I know that I need to eat more, I know that I should probably be trying to gain weight at this point. My partner has commented, my parents have commented, my friends that know about my history have commented. And yet, it’s still so challenging for me to actually push myself to take in even more food. I’m not at the point where I’m even hungry at the end of the day, and I still find it almost heartbreaking to watch the numbers on the scale go up. It’s a weird feeling. 

I’m not weighing myself excessively, once every week or two, but I still notice how the numbers affect my mood. I complain when I have to go buy smaller clothes, but there’s something sickeningly sweet about fitting into the next size down. I hate it. I hate that I’m starting to pick myself apart in the mirror again, I hate that I even have to question if this is the beginning of another series of ED’s to deal with. I don’t know.

I don’t even know what I’m hoping to get out of writing this. Solidarity, maybe? Advice, if anyone has been in this odd intersectional place. I don’t want to go back down the road of restriction, but I also don’t really feel like I’m restricting right now? I don’t want to wean my son yet, I know he’s not ready, and I also know that weaning and the hormones and anxiety that can be associated with it would be too much for me right now.

On top of that, I’m a graduate student, working on my thesis, teaching for the university, doing freelance work, and in couples counseling trying to work with my partner through his own issues. I just need a hug =/

TL;DR In recovery from multiple ED’s, thought I had a handle, losing weight again and questioning if it’s disordered behavior or just a side effect of breastfeeding and I should just ignore it and keep doing what's been working for me. Fuuuuuuck living in the land of diet culture =/"
6btkrz,382,2017-05-17,Today I just got an offer for a financial analyst internship at a bank because of a single acid trip I took 1 month ago.,jiwki,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/6btkrz/today_i_just_got_an_offer_for_a_financial_analyst/,"Last month on Friday, April 21 2017, I took 425ug of LSD. I took the tabs crying because just the week prior [I had received the last rejection email](https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/61aqrs/was_final_candidate_for_4_internships_but_didnt/)  from all the internships I applied to this spring. I decided to go into the trip to hopefully come out as a better person.

From that trip I listened to Pink Floyd The Wall and it gave me the most intense emotional breakdown I have ever had in my life. I have never cried so hard and realized so many problems that I've ignored in my day-to-day reality. The trip completely ripped apart my ego and audited my entire life to the day I was born. I realized I had problems as a human being and that I needed to find solutions to these problems. 

Coming down from the peak, I spent 10 hours theory crafting a new way to live my life. I felt that the comedown would be the most important and introspective part of the trip so I made sure to utilize everything I had to construct a framework for my newly pieced-together ego. I made three MAJOR life overhauls and decided to abandon over a dozen toxic habits that I've had since middle school by the end of that trip.

Within days I felt like a new individual and began ramping up the momentum from that trip, I completely overhauled all the games I had on my computer, refurnished and reorganized the entire apartment I lived in, significantly improved personal hygiene, and began teaching myself how to cook. Within a week I stopped cursing completely, I stopped biting my finger nails, I stopped skipping my classes, got a haircut/shave, slept 10 hours every night, and overhauled TV and Netflix completely. Within 2 weeks I began applying for internships, networked with other students, joined study groups for finals, drilled for interviews, and enjoyed significantly more time with my wife.

Now today, I have seen the fruits of my labor and the moment is bitter sweet. I look and behave nothing like the person I was a month ago. I have literally changed the rest of my life from this one LSD trip. The future has never looked so optimistic before, now I know I will never regress backward as long as I keep moving forward in life.

In May of 2015 I graduated with a B.S. I doubled majored in computer science and mathematics. I also graduated with highest honors. I felt amazing and very proud of myself for all the hard work I had put into my degree. 

Next, I decided to pursue a master's degree in software engineering. I wanted to look for a job, but I lived in a small town with almost no software development or I.T. related jobs. I also felt ill prepared for the career as my college's C.S. department was woefully outdated.

I began my master's degree online as I couldn't move due to my fiance still attending college in town. I did well during the first year of my master's, but I honestly hated the program. It was nothing like it was advertised to be.

Then in July of 2016 I got very very sick. I've had ulcerative colitis since 2010, but it had been mostly managed with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication up until this point. 

My local hospital did not treat me for my colitis, and the G.I. doctor only saw me once within my 4 day stay. When he did see me, he told me it was all in my head. As such, I was readmitted to the same hospital 4 days after my initial release. I was so dehydrated and sick I could barely stand for longer than a few minutes.

My next stay last for 1 week. I didn't see a G.I. doctor once. So about 3 or 4 days after my second release, I began puking green bile. I was taken to a large university hospital about an hours drive away.

At this hospital I was finally treated with prednisone. I hate the medication, but it works. Unfortunately, 3 weeks after my third release I was readmitted a fourth, and final, time at the university hospital. I guess I just needed more time on IV steroids to stop the flare I was having. 

Due to my constant hospitalizations I fell behind in graduate school (my program continued through the summer months). I was eventually told to drop out because I would no longer be able to make-up all the work while keeping up with current work. This made me feel very defeated.

What followed after this, however, was a very dark time for me. I frequently got sick due to high doses of prednisone. Everytime I got sick I would flare up, making me even more sick. I went from loosing 30 pounds when in the hospital, to gaining nearly 60 pounds from prednisone. I developed ""moon face"" due to prednisone. I looked horrible. I felt horrible. I just wanted to get off the damn medication, but I couldn't until we found a new maintenance medication for my colitis.

We decided to try Remicade, a biologic. I had to have numerous blood tests to make sure it was safe for me to take the medication. One test took weeks to get the results back. Finally, when everything was clear, I contracted C-diff. Now I had to wait until I finished a round of antibiotics, and re-testing for C-diff before I could try Remicade.

During this period I got very depressed. I felt sick, defeated, and wondered if I would ever get my life back. 

Eventually I was able to start Remicade, and I responded well to it. I was able to finish my taper on prednisone, and continue with Remicade. Within a month I felt, and looked much better. I was slowly beginning to feel like myself again, but life wished to deal me another blow.

I was working part-time as a graphic designer since March 2016. I started as an intern with no experience, and eventually became the lady's first official hire for her graphic design business. I couldn't work for almost 2 months when I was at my sickest, and yet she understood and never complained. I felt very lucky to have the job. During my absence she hired another intern to take up my work load.  In December 2016, my boss decided she couldn't pay both of us so she decided to let me go. I don't blame her for it, as I believe the other employee was a much better graphic designer than myself. This nonetheless made me feel defeated again.

I didn't get too depressed though. I decided to do something instead. I started FreeCodeCamp's Front-end web developer program. I also started walking, and eventually began training for my first 5K. 

In Febuary of 2017, I completed the front-end web developer program, and I was nearing being able to run a complete 5k without stopping to walk. This was the happiest, and healthiest I've felt in a very very long time. I felt so alive. 

At the beginning of March, I began to flare again. Very mild, but it terrified me. You could say I had flashbacks of being in the hospital again. Of being so weak I could barely walk again. Of gaining all the weight I had finally lost. I had made so much progress, and I feared it would lose it all again. 

I had also been applying to numerous web development position that allowed remote work. I never heard back from any of them. I at least expected a call from one. On top of my flare, this made me feel very down about myself.

I got my next infusion of Remicade about 2 weeks after the flare. It stopped the flare for about a week, but then I caught a stomach virus which caused me to flare again. 

Week after week the flare grew worse, and my resolve and willpower grew weaker. I slowly became depressed again, weak again, and felt lost. I did very list web development because I just didn't have the willpower. I went from almost running a 5k, to barely running for 5 minutes. I tried contacting my G.I. doctor, but she's become hard to reach. I'm honestly considering getting a new one.

So here I am in May. I'm still flaring and I feel so lost and hopeless. I recently had another Remicade infusion. It seems like it may have helped some, but not enough. I feel sick and weak, and I have other pressures on me.

I want to begin a career in web or software development, but I can't find a job until I can move. I can't move until my fiance graduates next year. I'm considering returning to grad school, but I absolutely hated the program. I've considered starting a new grad program, but I'm just not sure if I should. 

I want to run again, and web develop more, but I just don't have the willpower. All I feel like doing is sleeping. I feel so weak. So lost. I guess I'm afraid of working hard again knowing it could all be snatched away from me at a moment's notice due to colitis. I want direction and I want to be sure of what to do next, but I just have no idea. I'm scared, lost, and hopeless.

Thank you if you've read this far. I hope this doesn't come across too melodramatic. I just want my life back. I want to be so sure of myself like I was from December to late February. 

Thanks again.

6bujed,53,2017-05-18,From corn fields to Silicon Alley,subtlelotus,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6bujed/from_corn_fields_to_silicon_alley/,"It’s fascinating being a part of a community that has a similar goal(s) and somewhat similar values but such different backgrounds. I love hearing these stories so thought I’d share mine.

I’m currently in my late 20’s, living in a HCOL area in the East Coast, transplant from a HCOL area in the West Coast, born in Asia but grew up in the Midwest.  I guess if you were to look at my resume, it wouldn’t look too different than most other techies. Graduated from a top 5 school with a STEM bachelor’s (Electrical Eng), went to another top 5 school for a STEM master’s (Computer Science), with internships and FT jobs from string of big tech companies (I’m listing out a range, I didn’t work for all of these companies) like Google, Facebook, Apple, and mid sized like Uber, Lyft, Palantir, Pinterest and some smaller startups. 

I’ve always felt lucky. However, my background wasn’t privileged and that helped define my modest world views. Very fortunately, my tuition was paid by summer internships, Research/Teaching, and very generous financial aid so I had zero college debt. I was able to get generous financial aid because my parents combined never made over the federal poverty line (my parents only speak Korean and have had health issues).  We were always on government assistance, which was something I used to be embarrassed about, but now find it a humbling experience.

But it was a combination of seeing how happy we were without much money (or the spending of it) and the dependence we had on external financial circumstances that drew me to financial independence. And anti-hedonistic values probably helped.

I’d love to talk more about perspectives and world views if you have more questions, but onto finances.

Expenses

My average rent in the HCOL areas is probably $1300 (current rent is lower), and I get away with it by living with friends in rent controlled places and finding very modest apartments.
Food is catered by my company, but monthly eating out (probably once a week) and weekend groceries probably adds up to $100 a month.

Commute 

is easy since I don’t have a car and take public transportation (company expensed), walk, and bike everywhere. 
Travel/Health/Leisure/Clothes I’d probably say is $500 a month. This is a huge *estimate* since budgeting tools have too much noise for me to track. I would like to say this is a conservative estimate, but there might be something I’m forgetting.

This puts me at under 25k a year for the last several years (I think this year I’m hitting under that because of cheaper rent). I’m also proud because the average rent alone for the areas I’ve lived in are probably around 2k a person.

Debt

I have 135k mortgage left on an investment property (see below).

Income

I got into the tech industry a few years ago with a low 6-figure salary (when I say ‘low’, I don’t mean I think it’s not enough), and have seen an average of 10% raise every year.

Retirement Investments

40k in Roth IRA (all in US ETFs—I’m risky and we’re in a bull market)
7k in IRA (all in US ETFs—see above)

Cash

30k Emergency fund

Housing Investments

I invested in a home 3 years back (in a LCOL place) and it’s currently worth 250k. The rent pays the mortgage, but I put in an additional 5k a year for taxes/HOA/maintenance.

I’ve been somewhat vague and hand-wavy with numbers intentionally, but some of you might notice that with my salary and expenses (and the bull market we’re in), I have fewer assets than I should. Where did the money go? (I rhetorically ask myself this often). 

It went to startup options investing. I don’t think I see this often in these forums, since this is a very startup thing. I’m, at least right now, not risk-averse, so this is me playing with fate. If you work for a private company, they sometimes give you the opportunity to buy options that could be worth a lot, but could also be worth nothing and you’d lose money. Over 90% of startups fail, and the ones that succeed don't always have good exits. And depending on financial circumstances, you might be required to pay tax on the option purchase, even though no profit has been made.

So I’ve spent overall around 100 to 120k on stock option purchases and the accompanying taxes. This is a huge chunk that might go to zero if the bubble bursts. However, combined throughout the different companies, the current worth is around 900k. I can’t in good conscious consider this part of my net worth because it’s not liquid, but I do have somewhat confidence that some late stage companies would make that figure not look ridiculous. 

If some of them have good exits and I hit my number (currently 1 million in non-house assets), I would strongly consider FI/RE. If not, I’ll continue to chug along I guess, I'm thinking I'll know in 2 years. Wish me luck! 

Edit: Also didn't bring this up because I don't consider it an expense and it's not super much, but charity donations probably add up to around 5k every year. Will try to inflate this with salary, assuming I'm salaried ;) Also thought it was important to add because it kind of equals my misc. spending. I'm wondering if people don't include this figure in theirs because they're not donating or because they figure it's irrelevant."

my grades are at an upward trend now, and the internship has definitely cemented my interest in CS, but I'm afraid I screwed up my grades so badly it'll be impossible for me to get into a CSU/UC as my desired major now (since it's so impacted). :( do I even have a chance at this point?

are there any former/current CS transfers that could give some insight?

Oh my.",AdjectTestament,TalesFromTheSquadCar,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/6buvhr/suspect_helicopters_motorcycles_pursuits_oh_my/,"Background: Current College student studying criminal justice for LE starting an internship soon.  
This happened a few hours ago.     


It's about 10pm and I'm leaving work. I'm on my motorcycle taking my usual route home. I stop at the light of two major cross streets, put my foot down and wait for the light to change, singing along to my usual music playing in my helmet...
Only to be interrupted by the sound of screeching tires, the crunching noise of plastic, and the jolt forward of being rear ended.    

Great.   

I think to myself ""Well I'm not dead, that's pretty good."" I turn around and give the driver the universal ""What the fuck?"" Look and gesture to pull to the side. I ride the bike to the side of the road and turn my hazards on.  
The driver, female, mid 60s, in a Camry, seems absolutely unphased about the collision, as the light turns green she continues on.   

Awesome.   

So I put my bike back in gear, and merge back into traffic. She indicates to turn into a major outdoor mall area, and turns in.   
""Okay maybe she wanted to stop in a parking lot.. that seems pretty reasonable""   
She then begins to drive around the parking lot, not erratically but not crawling   
""Okay maybe she wants to stop in a populated area, I get it, its late and I'm a guy on a bike who she just hit...Nope shes weaving through stalls now.""   
As she exits the shopping center I'm following her a few hundred yards back. She's driving evasively, making excessive turns, looping back around, but oddly not violating traffic laws, no speeding or rapid lane changes, she was even signaling.   
At a stoplight I was able to call 911, the call went through my helmet as I kept following.   
""Silver, Late model Camry, Plate 4 Alpha bravo Ch...Turning left northbound to Wood Street between Metal street""    

After around 2 miles of me following and updating the dispatcher on location and heading,  she indicates a left turn into a church parking lot, the dispatcher comes on ""The helicopter is on the way, what's your current heading?""   
""Southbound on Plast...Did you say helicopter?""   
""Yes sir, air unit is en route""  
Huh.......
At this point she had pulled into the parking lot, and half stopped the vehicle, creeping along at idle. I didn't approach and parked 50 yards away. She begins to drive off again, when from the heavens, all the glory of an air unit with a Nightsun shine down upon the car.   
""Stop the Vehicle and pull over"" what I can only assume to be the human personification of the voice of god booms down over the loudspeaker. 
The dispatcher's voice interrupts my sheer awe at the situation,  ""Air unit has a good plate, you can break pursuit""   
I stop my bike and watch as she turns out back onto the main road and begins driving away disappearing around a corner , moments later two chargers running code disappear around the same bend. 
I'm still in the parking lot as the dispatcher tells me to stay where I am and they'll have a unit come meet me.   
As I'm left to my own devices I call my family to let them know what happened, and my friend(also a crim major and intern) that I may need a ride and to meet me in the area.   
As I finish this phone call the air unit begins to circle me, ""They got the car, have a safe night"" As I give a sheepish thumbs up and wave before they return to the night.   

I get a phone call about 15min later telling me to meet the officers at a near by school. As I arrive there are 3 squad cars, and her car at the end of a driveway. My friend had already arrived and started talking with a free officer. I gave my statement and answered a few questions.   
Officer ""Could you Identify her?""
Me ""White, female, mid 50s, blonde, black collared shirt on?""  
Officer ""Yeah that's the one. Looks like a DUI. She's currently under arrest for Hit and Run and DUI.""  
After answering a few more questions, and jokingly asking if they thought I could get extra credit for this in class, I hung around as they questioned her.  My friend and I ended up talking with one of the officers there, and it turned into a discussion about what he did during his internship and how badly simunitions hurt. 

Possibly the most eventful ride home from work I've ever had. I'm not injured since the bike didn't end up dropping, there was no visible damage to my bike(although it's going in to get looked at soon), and a drunk driver is off the street.   
Edit 1: I realize the safety concerns about following after an incident like this. It may not have been the best call and I do not advocate it. I wasn't trying to play officer or anything. "

I had a fruitful internship in a distinguished company, and they were looking forward for me to get a degree in either NTU / NUS and then come back to join them again. 

Unfortunately, they were not very supportive after I shared with them that I will be going to SIT TUM to get my degree (because it's not as well-known/prestigious as compared to the local unis). 

On the other hand, I know that this market is getting very slow now which is why I am worried about the future after I complete my studies. 

It would mean the world to me if someone can enlighten me on:

What are the future job prospects that I can have?

I am getting back on the bandwagon after jumping off on Easter and never getting back on. I had lost 10 pounds and gained it all back. 

I originally was losing weight to feel more comfortable as I move to New Hampshire to work on a mountain as meteorologist intern. I leave in a week, so I have obviously failed to meet my goals.

That doesn't mean I stop though. No, I want to work even harder, especially as I make this move. I feel that such a large change in scenery and environment can allow me to be who I have always wanted to be, a fresh start. I plan on hiking and doing yoga more.

I am super worried about food, as it is my first time being totally self reliant. I need help making a meal plan that is cheap, vegetarian (with fish), and for now requires little refrigeration and prep. I really have no idea what the kitchen situation is like in the observatory. I don't know how much room I will have in the refrigerator or what prep areas I will have. I am provided dinners on the mountain.

I really am for a loss here. I don't have any clue how to purchase food for 8 days at a time (the time I will be on the mountain at a time) and have it stay healthy and cheap. I have a knack for buying expensive organic, fad foods, which won't be sustainable since I am budgeting for myself without a meal plan from school or money from my parents for the first time. 
 
Oh god, I am in way over my head and I'm panicking. Please help!"

Still in college and looking to use money from an internship to build a PC for schoolwork and gaming. I want to be able to play some pretty graphically intense games like Fallout. I play DOTA as well, but not sure how relevant that is.

&gt;**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

Looking to spend around $700-$800

&gt;**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

Some time in the next week or so.

&gt;**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

Tower and OS. 

&gt;**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

In the US. I can drive to a Microcenter if need be.

&gt;**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I have a Dell monitor and a mouse and keyboard that I have my eye on.

&gt;**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

Not interested

&gt;**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

Graphics are most important to me. I don't need a ton of storage, since I like to keep a clean PC, but I'm going to be playing some large games.

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

A window would be nice. Not looking to spend a ton of extra money on cosmetics, though.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

Windows 10

&gt;**Extra info or particulars:**

Only red flag was that they only seemed to want to talk about how they go on runs together and stuff, rather than what their work actually entails. Fast forward a month, and I get an email from them saying that they've reviewed my resume, and would like for me to respond to a ""critical thinking exercise."" It was allegedly attached to the email. It was not. 


The only possible interpretation of the email was that I was to respond to a prompt. And the only text provided as part of that prompt was the vague results of solving a problem. Something along the lines of ""Program efficiency has improved, and investors have responded positively."" That was all I was given. And the email indicated that I was to ""describe the problem and devise a solution."" I showed the email to many of my computer science peers, and not a single one was able to figure out what the hell the company wanted out of it. 


Confused, I sent a reply asking both for clarificationas I could only assume they had forgotten to include the prompt. Nope. That was the prompt. In the same email I had also asked for verification that this was indeed a software developement internship, as the prompt seemed more consultant/business major oriented. Yep, it was for devs. For the response just got an email encouraging me to ""look at the original prompt again,"" and that it was ""open-ended by design.""

But my depression is telling me dont be happy be sad. It wasnt good at all and ''you gonna be stuck with me forever im not gonna let u become social u better of alone''. But idk the adrenaline rush is still in me i smile and it felt so cool even doe it was like 5 hours ago lol.

My boyfriend graduates in December and has been working a lot of internships whereas I have just completed my first semester of being a Teaching Assistant and don't start my first (paid) research position until this summer.
Since I have not been working aside from TA, I do not have a lot of income. 
We have an apartment together and we each contribute 50/50 to the rent and bills (we discussed this) even though he is making a lot more money than me. 
I do 90% of the housework which includes cleaning up after him, laundry, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming etc. we have talked about how I feel like he does not contribute around the house and he says he is working on it. His mom also helps by buying groceries and paying to fix his car when it needs fixing etc. (she helps him a lot!)
HOWEVER, he still expects me to pay 50% of most dates we go on or any vacations. Currently I am trying to do that and it is pushing me into more debt.
I've stressed to him I don't have money for fancy dates and things but he says ""it's no problem I'll pay"" and then later if we have a disagreement he throws it in my face. Any time he is upset it is thrown in my face that I ""don't pay for anything"" when I really try to pay all that I can without killing myself financially.
Again, I try to help when I can but I have maxed a $3k credit card and halfway maxing another. I don't know what to do because I feel like if I don't pay he insults me or puts me down for it.
I've tried to talk to him about how depressed it is making me and he says it's not his problem that I don't have any money and am in a lot of debt.

Before I met him I had kept my credit cards at very low balances and had a credit score of 740. My score has been slowly dropping to ~700 because of the maxed credit cards.

Tldr;
i am not working a lot because of college (i am a teaching assisntant for professors) but it doesn't bring in a lot of money. Boyfriend has full time paid internships and jobs and graduates December but wants me to equally contribute financially.
I have maxed credit cards trying to do so and if I can't equally contribute it gets thrown in my face. I am lost as to what to do because it puts a huge strain on the relationship."

She was cold, pretty heartless, but this week something has made her feel so much more warm and welcoming to her employees. She's had lunch with interns, and instead of them coming out with puffy eyes, they are smiling and thanking her for such an amazing time together! 

Something did change, and it's not what you think. At her house, an alien symbiote slithered into her bed and fucked her brains out, filling her pussy and ass with it's silver juices, infecting her and making her into the host of it's corruption. She tried to fight it, but the pleasure the silver brings simply overwhelms anyone it takes hold of, making them need to spread it to loved ones, no matter the age or the sex. 

The CEO has invited a mother and lovely son to the company the day before to help give a nice little test run of all the fun ""activities"" the kids will do. The mother has no idea her boss is about to turn her little boy into a slut, begging for silver cum and juices, but the mother will find out soon enough...

Activities include

Transformation, non-con, corruption, sounding, waterworks, squrting, lactating, futa, anal, pegging, bi play, pegging

No age limits, this is only the start of the story, there will be so much more to do once the trial is over and everyone brings in their lovely children to unknowingly taste the silver love! 

Send me a PM with one way you think the boy should be tested :)"

Me: Good! How's things going?

Her: Just peachy, living the American college student dream!

Her: I would be down to catch up but I'm staying at school over the summer for an internship and I'm also working and I'm not sure if I'll be visiting home anytime soon. But I'm glad to hear you're doing good!

Is it worth trying to meet with her and see how things go? Or does she not seem interested? I wouldn't mind driving a couple of hours just to meet and talk. The conversation pretty much ended after we talked about some other general stuff.

It's deserved, I haven't been able to respect his requests to be left alone. I fell for him really hard, mainly because he was the first person who ever truly validated me and made me feel like I'm worth the air I breathe; he came into my life right after I had lost most of my homophobic and emotionally abusive immediate family members to a mix of cancer and suicide. I've not handled the breakup well, because I feel like I'm drowning without him. I do things that I know I shouldn't do, but I honestly feel like I can't control myself. He just graduated and left town and so a few days ago I drove 600 miles to his hometown just so I could drive around his neighborhood a few times. I did this multiple times last summer too and I also drove over 400 miles to the city he was doing an internship in. Anyway he found out I came this week because I logged into one of the hookup apps that both of us use. Honestly, I knew he'd see that I had been online while near his house. It was a cry for help, I wanted to get caught. I have this delusion that he'll take me back if he sees how desperate I am. In retrospect I can realize that all I'm doing is scaring him and his family. He messaged me today to ask again that I stop contacting and following him. He said that his father is encouraging him to get a personal protection order, and that if I ignore his wishes again he will look into getting one.

I know I need to stop. I've known it for a long time. But I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to stop. I honestly want help, but I lost my insurance last year. I haven't been able to afford to see my therapist in months. Since this morning all I've been thinking about is getting a gun, driving down to his home again, and blowing my brains out in his driveway. Maybe he'd call the police and I could just pretend to have a gun and get the police to pull the trigger for me? I don't have anything to live for anymore. I kept myself going this past year on the hope that he'd talk to me again, but that's obviously not going to happen."

It has broken down now three times since I got it last July 2016. I paid around $1.7k for it, had 175k miles. I've probably put about that much money back into it for repairs. 

I'm debating if I should just sell it and put the money down on another car and take out a loan for it. 

I'm a Junior in college majoring in Computer Science. I have an internship this summer paying $25/hour and have about like $2k-3k from a tech support job this year. My intention was to just put all the money to school next year and not take on more loans. 

So I think overall, I could put like $4k down on it and take out a loan for the rest. Should I do it or should I just keep going with the rodeo for now until I graduate next spring...and then buy a better car? I'll now also probably need to take out more money for my student loans then if I'm putting this money up."

I called my pediatrician today to schedule an appointment partially for getting a refill on that and my Prozac (OCD which I have been on for aboht 6 weeks) and partially for other reasons. However, the NP I spoke with while making the appointment made it sound like the chance that the chance a pediatrician at my practice would give me a refill for adderall is slim to none (the Prozac was a maybe, but still not ideal). My school psych perscribed me 30 days of XR and 30 days of IR as that was the most he can do at one time. So I should be ok for a another another month if I run out of XR.  But the XR is so much better for an internship situation where I am working 9-5. I would like to refill it once a month if possible. I'm also taking 3 summer classes so I can graduate with a minor and a concentration so that is also a factor.

This summer I have an internship closer to home. I go to school about an  hour and 30 mins from home. School is about 2:30 mins from my work place. I think it's unreasonable for me to have to ask my employer for a day off 2-4 times from now until the end of August just to have a 10-15 minute appointment with my school psych.

I am a 21 year old rising senior. I want to be a good employee So I either get a job offer or a possitive reference to use when I graduate. I don't really want to have to explain why I need to take time off for so many doctor appointments either. Very few people know I'm on medication or was diagnosed and I plan to keep it that way. Without my medication im really afraid I will fall off the rails again. My overall outlook on life has been the best in the 18 months since OCD really took control of my life.  I really don't want to end up back in that place. I'm pretty much unable to continue therapy while home because finding a new therapist I feel comfortable with would be tough and by the time I did find someone and get through the initial step it would be almost time to go back to school. I really think staying on my current medication will help me maintaine the progress I've made from my 2+ months of therapy and combined medications. 

To switch from my pediatrician to another doctor would take a while and there is still no guarantee they would honor my request for a new prescription medication. I know I'll have to deal with that eventually as I'll be forced to leave my current provider when I graduate but for know What should i do? "

I'm looking for a woman interested in writing with me following one of the following plot ideas. These mostly involve couples exploring a mutual (though not always openly admitted) interest in expanding their sexlives.

1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous college student. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. NOTE: all characters are over 18, and actual incest doesn't necessarily come into play. This is more about a married couple spicing things up.

COUPLES' CABIN
This is a fairly straightforward setup. Two couples (or more, if you prefer) spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods where the fireplace is warm, hot-tub steamy, and walls are thin. Over the course of the weekend, they all start to loosen-up and let go. This might include some voyeurism (listening/spying on the other couple); exhibitionism (showing off for the others); bi-play (girls and/or guys get friendly with one another); swaps; or group sex. I'd be ok with some jealousy, reluctance, or other drama if you want to spice things up too. 

THE NEIGHBORS' DAUGHTER
A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could college or post-college in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.

Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.

Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters, multiple partners."

I'm considering on the next steps to make my application as competitive as possible. My background is not nearly as impressive as I would hope, so going forward, I would love advice on how I can better my portfolio and resume.

##**My Background**
* B.A. in English Literature from University of Washingon, 3.3 GPA, June 2014 (yikes...)
* Small jobs here and there since then. Most recent employment: legal assistant at a reputable mid-size law firm for 1 year
* I've been working on art &amp; indie games for the past few years with some freelance work. I drew &amp; designed character art, concept art, and UI designs
* Biggest achievement: a game called [Summoner Sweetheart](https://bigsteps.itch.io/summoner-sweetheart). Got roughly 100k downloads on the first week of launch. Recruited &amp; collaborated with over 30 people. My role: Producer/Director, Artist, Coder, Writer (a little bit of everything)
* Had a few marketing/UI design internships while in college (most reputable one was at Riot Games in 2013)

With that said, I would like to consider a few options on what I can do throughout the summer to bolster my application.

I saw another thread of a prospective student interested in applying to CMU and several comments mentioned taking local CC classes with high grades to show admissions committee that I am committed to studies (more so than during my undergrad years).

## UX Design Certificate at Bellevue College
* 191 classroom hours, 9-12 months average completion, evening classes only
* Several UX-specific classes (Info Arch, Interaction Design, Usability, Design Fundamentals, UX Research)
* Non-credit classes; they will NOT give us a G.P.A.
* Starts next week, May 22
* $5,700 

## Web Design Certificate at Seattle Central College
* 61 credits / 4 quarters worth of classes full-time
* Geared more towards Web Languages &amp; Programming with a few UX/UI Design-related courses
* Graded classes
* Starts end of June
* ~$6,000

## UX Design Certificate at University of Washington
* 4 classes (1 class per quarter), evening classes only
* 12 credits that can be applied to the UW Masters in HCDE
* Starts beginning of September
* ~$11,000

I have a few paths that I am contemplating on, which is what fries my brain. I don't know what the best option is for me.

I could... 

1. Take supplemental online classes (i.e. Lynda, interation design foundation, udacity, etc.)
2. Throughout the summer, take as many Bellevue College classes as possible, specifically the ones related to UX Design ... OR Begin the Web Design Certificate program from Seattle Central
3. Either... Do *NOT* finish the certificate program (so I can focus on just the UW Certificate program) or *DO* finish the certificate program (if I am not admitted to UW Certificate Program)
4. (If admitted), attend the UW Certificate program (either in conjunction with Bellevue College's certificate program or by itself). 
5. Apply to grad school in January. 

I think taking UW's Certificate Program is the best course of action for me because 1) if I am admitted and do enroll in UW's HCDE program, I can apply 12 credits to graduation already. 2) They are graded, graduate-level courses which shows I am ready to take on graduate-level calsses

However, in the meantime I am wondering if I should take classes before then (because UW's program starts in September). If I do, Bellevue college classes do NOT give me credit, but they are UX related. If I take Seattle Central classes, it DOES give me credit, but there is no real UX-related courses. 

I could finish both the Bellevue Certificate and UW Certificate (if admitted) because they are both part-time programs that offer classes in the evenings. But then that might be redundant to obtain 2 certificates in the same area.

I have been with my boyfriend for 5 years but we are in no way emotionally or financially in a place for a child. I found out on Monday 05/15/2017 (the day after mothers day) that I was pregnant. My first stupid thought was ""How can this happen to me?"" I am not on birth control but he always pulls out as our ""birth control"". It had worked for 5 years so I suppose it was bound to happen and we are lucky that it did not happen sooner. I had a period in April but it was VERY light like a little more than spotting but I thought I could be experiencing this due to stress of full time work and full time school. I  do not have a consistently regular period so I did not think this weird period was of much concern. 

At work that Monday I had decided I would take a test just for the heck of it and to ease my mind. I had been feeling like I was getting a mild flu or something for a couple weeks. Generally feeling weak, body aches, upset stomach but no vomiting, etc. Also I had not been sleeping well at all. Like I was sleeping maybe 6 hours and waking up several times throughout the night which was not normal for me. 
I had been so stressed out I even purchased some Mental Ease herbal supplements at my HEB (grocery store in Texas). These were helping me sleep a little better and de-stress.  

So Monday after work I went to Target. Got 2 tests, some ginger ale, and a new face powder. Had I mentioned I looked like hell? Where's that pregnancy glow everyone talks about? Lol. So anyway I went to take the test in the bathroom and it like immediately showed the 2 lines indicating pregnancy. My first thought was honestly, ""Drat. That can't be right."" Took the other one with same result. I drove home still in disbelief. My bf was just getting up as he works at night and I meekly squeaked, ""Guess what,"" and showed him the tests. It was kinda funny seeing his reaction as I could tell each emotion as he ran through them. Disbelief, elation, terror. Kinda what I had felt. We talked about what we wanted to do and decided a termination would be best due to our current situation. Honestly if I had not decided to go back to school, we would have probably kept it. We counted back to the last time we had sex, 7 weeks prior. (Note: We are not super sexually active because we work opposite shifts so it was easy to guess when I may have gotten pregnant.) I found a clinic online that was about 30 miles away. Unfortunately in Texas, you have to go to a consultation at least 24 hours prior to having the actual procedure. Here they read you some state mandated items, give the ultrasound, and see how far along you are. That night and the following day neither of us really ate or slept much. He actually vomited a couple times before he went to work.

Next day was Tuesday. I called the clinic around 11 am and scheduled an appointment. The girl who answered the phone either did not really know what she was doing or did not want to help me very much. I told her I needed to make an appointment so she transferred me, it rang and rang then went to a generic voicemail so I hung up and called back. Same girl answered. I explained what happened and she made a small sigh then took my name and what city I was from. She asked if I could come in the next day at 9 am or 11 am. I said yes and she said okay see you tomorrow. I called back because I did not specify at which time I was picking or which one she scheduled me for. We agreed upon 9 am. The rest of my day at work I tried to focus on that and not on the fetus I had growing inside of me, which of course was not an  easy task. I went to the bathroom a lot more than usual that day which I do not know if that was legitimately from the fetus or because I was now aware that I was pregnant. When I got home I told my bf about the appointment and he wanted to take me. We talked a little about if I was having second thoughts which I was not at all. He is terrified that I will change my mind and decide to keep him or her. He went to work that night and talked to his boss to get the next night off. I went to the clinics website and printed out the forms available there and filled them out. Here is when it started to feel very real to me. This was the first time I actually looked at  my stomachs profile in the bathroom mirror. I am a very small framed woman at 95 pounds and 5 feet fall. I could definitely tell I had a tiny bump going on there. It looked similar to when I wake up with a full bladder right before I use the restroom. That night again did not sleep much lol. Strange thing I have a chihuahua and on this day she kept wanting to lay on my stomach. Not sure if she could tell or just subconsciously I was touching my stomach a lot and maybe she thought I was sick. 

Wednesday morning at 9 am was my consultation appointment. It was storming pretty bad but we still arrived early, around 8:30. I was worried about protesters, but there was only one man standing by the street holding his rosary beads with his head down and eyes closed. He did not look up as we drove in or anything like that. We were the first people there, parking lot was empty. At 8:45/8:50 it started to fill up with vehicles so we got out to wait by the door. There was one other couple and one girl with us waiting at 9:00 am when they opened the doors. I was first in line and handed the woman at the front desk my paperwork. She seemed thankful that I had done them already. It was $100.00 required upfront for this consultation. I sat down in the waiting area as other girls came in. At around 9:30 there were 10 or 11 girls and 2 of them had their SOs with them. I was a little surprised because I was not the oldest girl there. I don't know what I expected the other girls to look like but these were all women close to my age (some older) and looked well put together. So I guess even I had bought into the stigma of what a woman having an abortion is ""supposed"" to look like. 

A nurse came out and started calling our names out one by one to a separate area. This was a long narrow hallway with chairs lined up against the wall and privacy curtains between each. We all took a seat and in a few minutes the doctor came in. He was an older man with white hair and very kind eyes. He had an awesome sense of humor and explained he knew how inconvenient this all was especially with the 24 hour consultation rule. He gave us some information regarding the Republican movements making it harder for women to get the resources they need and to have abortions. He also explained why most abortion doctors are so old. He said it is because doctors who are in medical school cannot learn how to preform abortions there at the school because of a rule to where school funds cannot be used to learn this. They actually have to find an abortion doctor who will let them intern in order to get qualified. I have not checked the legitimacy of this but if true that is immensely problematic in my opinion. He also told us how there is this false belief that having an abortion will be super dangerous, increase chance of breast cancer, and detrimental to trying to have a baby in the future. He stated these claims are all false and that carrying a baby to term is actually a much higher risk of death. He then read out the state mandate that he HAS to read us by law. After he was done he explained that today we were going to have our ultrasound, he would describe it because he has to by law even if we do not want to hear it, and blood drawn. Then we were sent back out to the waiting room. 

Again we all waited but not very long, maybe 10 minutes. I was the first one called back and the nurse showed me to a room then told me to take off my clothes from the waist down and sit on the chair. She gave me a paper sheet to cover up with. I did as instructed and waited maybe 5 minutes before a new nurse came in then the doctor a few seconds after. I leaned back and she did the vaginal ultrasound. The doctor asked when my last period was so I told him the April date so he thought maybe it would be too soon to see anything. Once the nurse put in the ultrasound tool he kind of did a little ""oh!"" noise. Apparently I was 8.5 weeks along, much further than I thought. He asked if I wanted to see it and I did. There it was. Little alien looking thing. Kinda like how I imagine a chicken embryo to look. I could definitely see the shape of it and he pointed out the head and the heart. Yes it had a heart formed already. That made me a bit sad to hear. After they were done they asked if I wanted a surgical or medical abortion and I opted for surgical as it would be faster and not as drawn out or gruesome. They left and I put my clothes back on. I texted my boyfriend that I was 8.5 weeks along and that it would have happened around the middle or end of March according to a quick look at a calendar. Another nurse came in a few minutes later and took my blood pressure and asked my height and weight. Then I was sent back out into the waiting room. 

I sat with him for a little bit and he had already worked out EXACTLY when we had conceived. March 18th we had some friends from out of state come visit Austin so we rented a swanky hotel room with a mini bar. Needless to say we got trashed and did have sex but he pulled out like usual. Right as we were talking about this they called me back again and a nurse drew my blood. This took maybe 5 minutes then I was sent to the waiting room yet again. They gave me like 2 more papers to fill out basically stating that I had to have a driver if I wanted IV sedation and what to expect afterwards. I filled this out then gave to the receptionist. she stated they were just waiting on my chart then I was good to go. Another 10 or 15 minutes later she called me up and asked when I wanted to come in again. I asked if tomorrow Thursday was open. Mostly so I could not get cold feet and just get it over with. She said yes 10 am. We left and got McDonald's on the way home, it was about 10:45 when we got food so I was really not there long. Once home I changed clothes and got to work around 11:30 am. Again I went to the bathroom more than usual that day. That afternoon I went home and looked at my stomach again, I touched it quite frequently. Seeing the life growing inside of me was giving me second thoughts. I kept telling myself that it would not work with full time work and full time school, I need to graduate first before I can think of a baby. Also we live in a small 1 bedroom apartment and only  have 2 door cars. We would need to move and get a new vehicle. My bf knew how I was feeling because I kept touching my stomach and telling him how the fetus looked on the sonogram. I made the mistake of Googling ""8 week fetus development"" and ""9 week fetus development"". Yep, definitely has the heart in addition to eyelids, limbs, and hands. Once I read those articles I was REALLY having second thoughts and wondering how we could make a baby work. That night neither of us slept much (big surprise). 

Thursday morning I texted my boss that I was not feeling well. They told me to dress comfortably so I wore some loose printed palazzo pants, a loose blouse, and cardigan. We got there around 8:30 am again and this time waited until about 9:15 am to go inside. I paid the remaining $520 and was given a disclosure document with what to expect. At 9:50 they called me up to the window to take an antibiotic and anti nausea tablet. We sat in the waiting area again and I could tell my bf was getting anxious. He stepped out for a cigarette and while he was still outside they called me in. They would not let me take my purse in the back so I went outside quickly to give it to him. Then I went in the back area where the nurse led me past a key coded door I had not noticed before. Here another reception desk and long hallway. She took me to the room at the very back left and told me to undress from waist down, place my clothes in the cabinet, and sit on the chair. Again I was given a paper sheet to cover with. I was not waiting long when the same nurse came back and got my IV in. Then she put the finger thing (not sure of name) that takes your heart beat and also a cuff around my other arm. She left and another nurse came in and put in the sedation, she said I should feel it pretty quickly and I did. I was still self aware of what was going on but it felt like I had drank maybe 2 drinks. The doctor came in right afterwards and gave me a smile, asked how I was doing, then quickly got to work. He was not rude to me at all. I did not really feel anything, maybe a slight pressure but it did not feel like what I thought it would and I had no pain whatsover. He said he was all done and stepped out. The nurse put a pad underneath me then helped me put on my panties and pants. I got up and put on my shoes, then was let to another separate recovery area with black squishy recliners. There was a girl in there I recognized from the waiting room earlier, she seemed to be doing well and the same as I. They hooked up a blood pressure cuff to me and I sat maybe 10 minutes. The nurse came over and we talked for a little bit. She was the same girl who gave me my initial ultrasound the day prior. We talked about my dog and I told her how ironic it was that I found out the day after mothers day. She asked if I wanted a prescription for birth control which I did. She brought that back to me then asked who was my ride and they got him to pull out into the back. She helped me get up and opened the door for me. I got in the car and he asked how I was then remarked how he thought I would be more doped up lol. We drove home and stopped at HEB again to get pads, fill my script, and a heating pad. On the way home he mentioned how right before I got it done he was thinking how having the baby would not be the worst thing in the world, but now that it is over with he is happy we went the route we did. I feel the exact same way that he does. We do want children but want to be fully prepared for one. We do not think it fair to a child to have one and not fully want him or her. My bf works as a police dispatcher at the moment and says this is like a wake up call for him to go back to school or police academy. He has been debating both but indecisive and felt no rush to do either. Now he feels like he needs to be prepared for if this happens again and I get pregnant. If I were to get pregnant again in the future I do not think I would have another abortion. 

Also, he timed it and it was exactly 15 minutes from when they called me to the back to when they asked him to pull around. That should tell you how fast and easy the actual procedure was.

When we got to HEB I felt some blood coming out of me and slight cramping but nothing terrible. We got home around noon and it is now 7:30 pm. I am not in a lot of pain, mostly it feels like the second or third day of a regular period with blood being the same as well. 

Thank you for reading my long rant about this. I will update more about the bleeding/when it stops ect. 
I hope this helps shed some light that it is not as scary as you think it is, and you can do it.

The doors slowly creaked open and a woman in a white lab coat walked in gracefully.

""Dr. Macaraeg, We have been expecting you!"" she said in a voice that had a bit of a Russian accent.

""Dr. Volkov, they assigned you here then, of all places."" Dr. Macaraeg said mockingly.

""They sought out the person they thought was the best in the field."" She said while adjusting her glasses, a ray of light refracted from the left lens towards Dr. Macaraeg's perfectly tan skin.

""They brought you in because we have a history."" He retorted as he looked at her face, with those almond shaped eyes but they were green rather than the more common brown and she had an elongated nose structure , unlike his,which highlighted the high cheek bone structure she had courtesy of the her Slavic heritage.

""Your little crush on me? You think they would base a major decision on such a trivial reason?"" said the Russian maiden.

""I would like to think so since the whole reason I'm here is because of a strongly worded e-mail I sent to you, Nat!"" He said

""Nick that letter went against the direct orders of our superiors!"" Nat said ""the world could end because of that!""

""Don't you think that minorities should have a say in these things?"" Nick said.

""We became the Majority for a reason! Mabuti nga iyon diba?"" Nat said

""The whole reason we became the Majority is why they need to become empowered! Nick exclaimed.

""I won't hear it Nick, this is not the place to talk about the previous regime's radical plan that involved you, me and billions of others!"" Nat said while throwing her hands up into the air.

""Getting a bit loud in there!"" said an unknown voice over the speaker in the corner

""Sir, Dr. Macaraeg was just about to agree with our terms."" Natasha Volkov said.

""WHAT TERMS?!"" Nick said through gritted teeth.

""You uprooting your research and continuing in Siberia with INCREASED funding and your pick of the interns."" Natasha whispered.

""INTERNS!"" Nick threw up his arms. ""Interns are the best thing you can negotiate with, interns for keeping my mouth shut? I tried to keep it to myself Natasha but I'm living for something bigger than myself now. I just want the world to be better after I leave..."" Nick trailed off.

""I knew you, you would never have given your life for the ideology that you believed in. Integrity was not even a part of your vocabulary. You just wanted to have a medical breakthrough, become world famous and then settle down."" Natasha said with tears forming in her eyes that shone like emeralds.

""I still want that Nat, I do want to settle down and I wanted to settle down with you until I uncovered the truth about this farce that we are all living."" Nick explained ""I still want to settle down with you after all of this is done.""

""Listen Nick, I saw the documents that explained why the government had to execute the Bagong Bayani program. The program was only to be used when the world was going to shit and the only thing that could have saved it was the values and the principles behind what made our culture a cut above the rest!"" Natasha let out a heavy sigh ""The program overthrew what would have become dictators in select countries and the world saw what the Bagong Bayani program was becoming and they had to suppress everyone that did not have the same worldview.""

""You just replaced many dictators with one world government."" Nick said

""Filipinos were slowly going to take over the world inevitably because of all the immigration and the number of Filipinos becoming citizens in other countries. We just made the process move faster."" Natasha explained.

The wall opened with a slight hiss and a short figure appeared out of the shadows accompanied by 4 men in barongs, a Philippine flag pin on each of their collars, the sun replaced with the world.

""Mr. President"" Nat and Nick lowered their heads.

I've done really well there, have good reviews by all managers, got transferred to part time aswell, etc. Uni is getting busy and I anticipate moreso during my 2nd / 3rd year. 

I work about 16hrs / week. My friend said I should just quit my job if I don't need the money but I sort of disagree with that. 

This is my first sem, and I should be able to pull a Distinction average. In the second sem based on classes I'm anticipating a upper-end Distinction. If I quit my job I know I'll be pulling HDs, which will help with internships; and also securing a future job. However my current job is somewhat related to my potential career path (retail IT)

What do you guys think? Am I misinformed?"

I just turned 26, just started college again and a new job. I have been with my boyfriend for 5 years but we are in no way emotionally or financially in a place for a child.

She left and another nurse came in and put in the sedation, she said I should feel it pretty quickly and I did. I was still self aware of what was going on but it felt like I had drank maybe 2 drinks. The doctor came in right afterwards and gave me a smile, asked how I was doing, then quickly got to work. He was not rude to me at all. I did not really feel anything, maybe a slight pressure but it did not feel like what I thought it would and I had no pain whatsover. He said he was all done and stepped out. 

The nurse put a pad underneath me then helped me put on my panties and pants. I got up and put on my shoes, then was let to another separate recovery area with black squishy recliners. There was a girl in there I recognized from the waiting room earlier, she seemed to be doing well and the same as I. They hooked up a blood pressure cuff to me and I sat maybe 10 minutes. The nurse came over and we talked for a little bit. She was the same girl who gave me my initial ultrasound the day prior. We talked about my dog and I told her how ironic it was that I found out the day after mothers day. She asked if I wanted a prescription for birth control which I did. She brought that back to me then asked who was my ride and they got him to pull out into the back. She helped me get up and opened the door for me. I got in the car and he asked how I was then remarked how he thought I would be more doped up lol. We drove home and stopped at HEB again to get pads, fill my script, and a heating pad. 

On the way home he mentioned how right before I got it done he was thinking how having the baby would not be the worst thing in the world, but now that it is over with he is happy we went the route we did. I feel the exact same way that he does. We do want children but want to be fully prepared for one. We do not think it fair to a child to have one and not fully want him or her. My bf works as a police dispatcher at the moment and says this is like a wake up call for him to go back to school or police academy. He has been debating both but indecisive and felt no rush to do either. Now he feels like he needs to be prepared for if this happens again and I get pregnant. If I were to get pregnant again in the future I do not think I would have another abortion.

Also, he timed it and it was exactly 15 minutes from when they called me to the back to when they asked him to pull around. That should tell you how fast and easy the actual procedure was.
When we got to HEB I felt some blood coming out of me and slight cramping but nothing terrible. We got home around noon and it is now 7:30 pm. I am not in a lot of pain, mostly it feels like the second or third day of a regular period with blood being the same as well.

Thank you for reading my long rant about this. I will update more about the bleeding/when it stops ect. I hope this helps shed some light that it is not as scary as you think it is, and you can do it.

UPDATE:
It is now Sunday, the third day after my procedure. Friday I actually had very minimal bleeding, maybe a teaspoon all day. I worked 10 hours that day to make up for missing Thursday and I did not feel tired or anything. I actually felt pretty normal. Saturday started out the same. We got up early and went to eat breakfast then did some shopping at the outlet mall nearby. Around noon I started to feel blood coming out of me. Luckily I was wearing an overnight pad just in case. I started having moderate cramping at home that night and slept with a heating pad. When I woke up I had a full overnight pad. This was over about 9 hours so not really bad. I didn't leak. I've put on a fresh pad and cramping is not as bad as last night but definitely there. My boobs don't feel as sore as they have been. The past month or so they've been at a 6 out of 10 pain wise. This morning is the first morning they don't feel so sensitive, maybe a 2 out of 10. My nausea I was experiencing through the pregnancy went away the first day when I had the procedure. I had not been able to each much prior to that day other than Ramen and lunchables."

Katie and I fucked a lot that week.  We fucked at the office, we fucked in the back of her Kia Rondo, we fucked at my place over lunch.  We fucked horizontally, we fucked vertically.  We fucked each others brains out.  And at the end of each session, she would text her husband that she had just gotten fucked.  And then she would go home and make love to her husband and tell me about how gentle and considerate of a lover he was to her the next morning as I was bottoming out in her cunt.  This was working for me. This was working for her.  This was working for Bob.

Friday was a fuck free day.  We had to get a rate filing into the state so we worked on our finishing touches.  At 3:30, she was wrapping up and headed to the bathroom.  By 3:45 I had submitted a 724 page document to the state for review and I figured we deserved a break.  She had gotten back walking with the slightest of wobble and had her hands on her back.  I liked this look on her as her breasts were subtly more prominent  and her hips pronounced.  Woman is what that stance proclaimed.

“Bob and I are getting dinner tonight at Azura Pesce at 7:30; want to join us?” She asked me as I waited for the return receipt.

“Sure… so we’re just going to talk baseball tonight….”

“Only if that is what you think about to not cum in me….”

“See you then sexy”

“We’ll be in back, find us lover.”

I finished up, walked the seven blocks to my loft condo, changed clothes and chilled for a  while before heading to the restaurant.

Azura Pesce is just a good place to meet anyone.  The food is always amazing and there are enough nooks and crannies where private conversations could be clearly heard by everyone in the conversation but the ambient noise masked it from anyone overhearing it.  Katie and Bob were in a back corner on the patio overlooking the beach.  She had a kelly green sheath dress with a long slit up her leg while Bob was an almost mirror of me.  Deep saturated polo shirts and dark slacks -- standard mid-career male professional no thinking about it clothing.  Her hands were covered by his and their heads were almost touching as they were talking about something as I sat down.

Katie popped up, gave me a hug, and a peck on the cheek as she pulled me down to sit across from them.  Bob is a good guy, I’ve watched enough football games with him to like him.  We don’t know each other well, so I was not sure where this was going.

“JB -- you’re  the lucky bastard fucking my wife.. You cost me two tickets to Hamilton.  Katie was so sure that she wanted high stakes.  I would have thought you two wouldn’t have…”

He said this with a smile on his face and both his hands on my right forearm.  

“It was me or the doorknob….”

We ordered, we ate, we drank and we laughed.  Katie was almost always in that easy intimate physical contact with Bob. I don’t think either of them consciously realized how hands and feet and legs and fingers found each other.  It was an assured, strong, deep intimacy that filled the space.  Katie was reaching out to me as well as several times I had to put down my knife and fork as her foot ran up my leg and toes pressed near my crotch.  

“So what’s going on and what are you guys wanting?”  I had some experience negotiating group and multi-partner arrangements.  If Katie was just some intern I would not have cared but she was a friend, a co-worker, colleague, intellectual challenger and now a lover instead of a mere fuck.  

Bob started -- “We had always fantasized about Katie fucking another dude but it was just that, fantasy, something to talk about in bed or check out online to get us started…. We’ve been trying so hard to get pregnant, I just can’t do anything that could hurt our baby.”

Katie had squeezed her husband’s hand tightly.  She reached across the table and took my hand in hers as well.

“And that was driving me nuts… don’t get me wrong, I will always enjoy Bob going down on me for an hour and then spooning sex but I needed more… so I asked him if I could live out this fantasy with someone I trusted… and he was so fucking hard that night… so we agreed I could make a pass on you”

I chuckled.  

“That was a pass to end all passes; so what do you both want going forward, and what are the ground rules?”

“We want you to fuck Katie as often as you two can find the time, and fuck her hard.  If you’re okay with pictures and videos, I want to watch sometimes… I don’t know why, but I get so turned on watching you fuck honey”

“Your wife is incredibly sexy.. You should be turned on watching her getting turned on….I’m okay with this….

We talked for another hour and another beer setting the incredibly unsexy but critical limits, boundaries, expectations and check-ins that are needed for good sex in any situation but especially in such a transgressive and potentially volatile situation.  I had these types of conversations before and as we talked both Bob and Katie relaxed.  We know where we are, what we want, what we don’t want and where we want to explore.  

As we were nearing the end, they both broke for the bathroom together.  I played Angry Birds, waiting for them.  Two levels later, I saw them making out in the hallway.  Three more levels, they came over to the table, having paid the bill up front.

“Want to come back to our place for some munchies?”

“Sure… that’s what we’re calling it…”

As soon as we got back to their place, Bob poured me and him a whiskey and Katie a ginger ale.  I did not notice my drink as Katie was wrapping her arms around my neck.  Her lips found mine and my hands found her body to pull tight against me.  My tongue twirled with her tongue, my tongue pulled her lips slightly, my fingers kneaded her shoulder blades, my hips pressed against hers, my erection rubbed against her belly.

I glanced over at Bob.  He was sipping his drink, sitting in a deep recliner.  One hand was on his glass, and the other was fumbling with his phone.  I made eye contact him as his wife was sucking on my neck behind my ear.  He nodded and I focused on Katie.  

As I was moaning in pleasure as she continued to tug and tease my ear, my hands were searching for her bra clasp.  I had lost the skills that I had spent so much time acquiring in high school and college so she stopped for a moment, spun around, asked me to unclasp her dress and then she showed that she tricked me.  She was wearing a front clasping bra. A moment later her breasts were out in the air, and her dress was on the floor.  She was just wearing a pair of lacy black bikini bottoms.  

I kept one hand on her waist, and struggled to get out of my clothes as well. I kicked my shoes to the side, squirmed out of my pants and then made an unholy and completely unsexy mess of trying to get out of my shirt.  She broke the nibble, stepped away and laughed as I got myself untangled from my shirt.  And then she helped me take my boxers off and her panties fell to the floor.  

She backed into me again.  I had one hand on her breast, fingers gently stroking around he puffy nipple, not touching her areolas but teasing, hinting, exploring, anticipating the pleasure that I was going to give to her.  My other hand  was reaching below her waist, sliding up and down her inner thigh as she was moaning into my ear.  Her arms were over her head and wrapped around my neck, arching her breasts away from me and her amazing ass rubbing against my thighs.  I was kissing her neck and sucking on her collar bone as she threw her head back into my chest.  My fingers were parting her ginger pubes and rubbing against her outer lips. 

 I was hard.  She was wet.  I needed to be in her.  Her husband was seven feet away with his whiskey finished, his phone filming us, and his pants around his ankles.

“Get on the ottoman so I can fuck you like the slut you are…”

She released my neck from her grasp and broke free of my arms.  She pulled the large sectional ottoman away from the couch, crawled up on it with her feet hanging off the edge, her face aligned with her husband’s eyes and her ass in the air inviting me to enter her.  

I guided myself into my new lover’s wet cunt.  I needed to be in her, so as soon as my tip of my cock was gripped by her pussy, I grabbed both of her feet and brought her heels to her thighs and spread her legs some more so she was more vulnerable and more exposed.  I had to bend my knees slightly to find the right angle for my pleasure.  Her hips rocked into mine as I started to steadily pound her.  I was not jackhammering her like an eighteen year old on prom night, but I was also not reaching for her clit. She could do that for herself if she needed to.

Every stroke into her ended with a slight pause at the end.  As I paused, she would make eye contact with Bob.  By now he was stroking himself hard.  He had a cock that could have gotten him a job as a bull.  Mine is a almost a two fister, his was probably a three fister.  

I let go of Katies fee and she brought them back underneath her to stabilize herself a bit as I kept on just fucking her for my pleasure instead of her.  She was moaning and yelping and telling her husband that this was what she needed, she needed to be fucked hard.  

“Bob… let your slutty wife suck your dick, you know she wants you”

“Give me your cock, let me taste you honey” Katie was looking at her husband with desire, passion and lust as another man was pounding her pussy.  She was starting to finger her clit as he paused  and then got out of the chair, balancing the phone between an empty and full whiskey glass.  

I had never seen Katie suck cock.  She hadn’t want to suck mine as we were fucking each other like high school students who knew Mom was coming home in fifteen minutes.  Fuck foreplay.  This woman could suck a cock.

One hand played with Bob’s balls while the other supported her weight.  I changed my pace a little and sank my left hand into her hip to help stabilize her.  I also started to grind into with a touch of rotation instead of in and out to give her a chance to please her husband.  She spit on his cock and then ran her tongue from the start of his shaft to the tip of his head and then swirled her tongue around his glans.  And then she just swallowed him.  She bobbed and paused and shook her head as she kept her eyes on her husband.  His hands were on her shoulders. 

We kept this up for a few more minutes.  My fingers by now had moved off her hip and pressured right above her clit, pressuring the pubis bone and allowing my shaft to rub her the right way every time I moved at all.  She was moaning and almost choking on her husband as she was picking up speed.  

All of a sudden, I started to cum inside her pussy.  I was surprised, I usually have some warning but this time, I had enough and came hard.  She must have been able to feel me as she rolled her hips and Kegeled her vaginal walls to pull everything that she could out of me.  

I paused and caught my breath. I was still hard, but this threesome was not about me no matter how good I felt.  I pulled out, still hard and still incredibly turned on.

I growled at Bob.

“Fuck your wife, fuck her hard, fuck her good”

 He stopped his wife from finishing his blowjob and pulled out.  She flipped over and got on her back.  Katie spread her legs wide, welcoming her husband even as her lover’s semen filled her pussy.  He positioned her legs over his shoulders and plunged into her already wet, ready pussy.  Her legs locked around his neck and pulled him closer.  One hand was in her pussy, stroking her incredibly hard clit and the other supported herself.  Her head was at the edge of the cushion.  

He just started to pound her.  I thought he was going to break his wife except that her hips met his on every thrust.  She was being fucked.  There was no other way to describe it as she was screaming her husband’s name in an incomprehensible monologue. I had backed away for a moment and reached for the camera and my whiskey.  As they fucked I walked around them, zooming in on her face, zooming out to capture them both, enjoying how her tits bounced and seeing the energy.

Soon, too soon, she came. She started with a low moan of “No, no, no, not yet…. And then it transformed into an incomprehensible keening of pleasure.  She came off her first orgasm and as she was starting her second, Bob came in her cunt, mixing his cum with mine in his wife.  

“Two men came in you Katie, two fucking men fucked you Katie…” and she did not care what she heard  as she was lost in a rolling series of orgasms. 

A minute or two or three, I am not sure, later, she was a sweat covered mess and her rapidly shrinking husband pulled out of her.  She needed recovery time, and she needed her husband and her lover to both stroke her hair and hold her tight.  Bob picked her up like a little child and carried her to their bed.  He spooned her, and I held her hand and stroked her face with my fingers.  

“Good?”
“Good”
“Incredible”"

However, after 15 weeks of working 75 hours a week, I was so exhausted that the week between the end of my internship and the exit interview I slept for 12-15 hours per day just to catch up on sleep. I only went out a few times. Even after I moved out of my apartment and moved back home, I was just so tired. I slept for about 12 hours for the next week and a half. My mom even asked me whether or not I was depressed. She even commented on my weight gain. I told her that I was working 75 hour weeks. She still didn't get it. Have any other busy season interns had sleep problems?! Share your thoughts.

And I don't know how to get off the ride.",reenact12321,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6c1n7c/ive_been_down_ive_been_up_and_i_dont_know_how_to/,"I started my weight loss journey back in 2011 at 355 lbs. I had been around 250-280 a lot of my life and at this sudden ballooning, a few concerned people made pleas, but I wasn't ready to listen. All of a sudden, I got the Loseit App on my first smart phone on Christmas and the lights just went on. I started tracking, I started comparing, I started counting. 

Weight fell off quickly, mixed with a change of environment (internship surrounded by health minded, active people my age instead of isolated in my fretful studies at college) I started to get a rhythm. Even through a stressful final semester of school, I managed to retain most of my good habits.

Years, and work came into my life, 48-50 hours a week in front of a computer, and more of it being administrative and less of it being physical.  At my lowest to that time I had reached 260 or so, and had a panic when I slipped to 290 in just a few months.  I got serious, I got drastic. Each of these surges of dedication, I never really made better food, I just learned to go without and ate a lot of junk, just kept reducing the quantity.  This time I got serious there too, I went to an imperfect Keto diet, high protein managed my carbs diligently.  I dropped down to 240 in just a few months and was more fit in a running/weight lifting way than probably even during high school, even if I was heavier.  

And one day, I stopped. I don't really know when, I just took a break, and the break never stopped. We're coming up on a year from the rough date of that mental flip.  The bi-weekly pizza orders returned, the fast food, the mass intake of soda and candy. The binge eating, even when I did buy healthier food.  I tried nutrisystem, but that just became binge fuel on delivery day and was all together not very satisfying (and carb heavy) and I turned around and I'm 335 lbs again. 

My clothes don't fit, I don't sleep well, I say to myself I'm going to be better today/tomorrow/start proper on Monday, and I'll try to cut to my previous 1500 calorie diet, and it is immediately sidetracked by the almost mindless trance I go into when rich foods are available or I'm stressed.  I deal with anxiety about being fat and food, and yet the food is what makes me forget for awhile.   I keep having ot make up excuses not to go to my hobbies because I can't do them anymore (clothing plays a role). 

I don't know why this is happening or how to make it stop.  I go through periods where I try to dig myself out but the task seems overwhelming, and I go through periods where I just don't care about it, about anything.

Anyone else have this kind of crisis?"

* [[Day 205.9. Hillary'Hillarys, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 9 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDacLzlKqJs)
  * Okay. Day 205 I think this is version 9
  * I just saw the detective that working the Seth Rich case, Wheelers interview, but he didn't say anything about the cameras-- about the camera in the bar, the police body cameras, the cameras on the EMTs, the cameras and the ambulance accumulators in the hospital. He didn't say anything about the admittance report at the hospital. He didn't say which hospital
  * So everybody could do me a favor: If you could just scour the internet and just find out what bar he was at.
  * If other people want to scrape the internet with any Facebook posts from that bar that night, if there was a football game on it, so they could just leave that football game, or if there's a basketball game, and it was in the middle of the thing is in January
  * So just whatever significant event was going on.
  * If somebody else can get a read on pictures that we're taken at the bar--maybe what he was dressed in
  * I'm gonna go to the bar, I'll ask for the camera, I'll ask I'm going to go back to this convenience store, doesn't matter about the Hells Angel guy--if you want to shoot me, go ahead and shoot me when I'm there
  * And then I'm going to go over the hospital, and then start talking to the admittance staff, and see was there this is basics you follow the footsteps of the victim, that's how it's done, and then you publish it
  * So that you get as many leads as you can.
  * You walk down the path as he took you, you get the time that he left the bar, you go to the take the path, and they took home, you knock on all the doors, you say did you see anybody that looked like this, and with this description, do you have home security, you have a camera? Did you see anybody swerving drunk like they said he was So drunk
  * Did anybody else at the bar notice he was drunk?
  * Did the bartender serving him drinks notice we was drunk why didn't they cut him off?
  * What is his name what's that bartender's name?
  * Why isn't he on the internet trying to help solve the murder?
  * *Why aren't the parents trying to solve this murder?*
  * It makes me think these are actors.
  * I mean nobody--Jack Burkman I mean I figured out in five minutes that he was a fake
  * I mean I went to the website. It was all about how this was conspiracy theory.
  * He made a statement today about Russian hacking--they're going with a McCabe dossier peepee dossier all over again
  * This is ridiculous--I can't believe how they keep going back to this Evan McMullen crap
  * So anyway please send me all this data,
  * And I don't know if I'll be able to make it tomorrow morning, but I'll do it after my son's graduation

* [[Day 205.10 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 10 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r00i9F3j1SU)
  * Okay. Day 205 I think this is going to be version 10
  * So ~~lose city bar~~*[""Lou's City Bar""](http://www.louscitybar.com/)* is the name of the bar
  * That bar manager supposedly talked to Seth Rich about 1:45.
  * That would mean that his name is supposedly Joe Capone, and he offered him a ride.
  * If anybody could post a picture of Joe Capone so I know what he looks like when I get there that'd be great.
  * If anyone there was a Dodgers game going on that night a late Dodgers game 11 o'clock versus the Padres that was the late game
  * So if anybody has any tweets, look for tweets on July 10th of last year, and he tweets about the Jeff Dodger game any tweets from Lou's bar
  * Anything on Facebook, tweets about the Dodgers game, Lou's bar that type of thing--other sports events would be helpful.
  * But I'm just guessing, if Seth Rich really is such a big sports fan, going there five or six times a night, that he would be involved in any of the sports team, if somebody could tell me his last tweet, that would be great or last couple of tweets that'd be great
  * Somebody could say who his girlfriend is--supposedly that she heard the shot while he was on the phone with her, and he said not to worry--that that seems odd
  * If anybody can tell me what hospital he went to that would be helpful
  * If anyone knows from the police report the ambulance service which particular ambulance service that was that would be great
  * If anyone can tell me if it was a 22 or 45 normally you would know that by the shot the sound a 45 makes a much bigger sound than a 22
  * If anybody has any contacts about supposedly went to this Wonderland bar, but I don't think he did
  * The space of time now unaccounted for is longer than I thought: it was two o'clock to 4:20
  * Now it looks like it's from 1:40 or 1:45 when he talked to Joe Capone outside the ~~loose~~Lou's City Bar to
  * Now being all the way to 4:20 that's almost two hours that's two hours an hour and 40 minutes now not accounted for
  * So he's got to be somewhere, he's got to have a phone somewhere, if there's got to be a picture somewhere in the bar of him that night he's in the corner and a leather stool that he always sat in at a corner
  * So somebody has to have tweeted something from that bar that night
  * Also if I don't think Joe Capone is a real name, but if it is, please post his picture, and we'll go from there
  * I think we're gonna--this is going to be a like a John B Wells caravan to midnight
  * I think I'm gonna just keep going to Saylorsville to visit ~~ghoul on~~Gulen, and then decide whether to go to New York or go to Washington DC, and just do this in the morning, and just keep going as long as they keep getting great leads like I got on this last stop
  * I'll just keep going to Washington DC, and walk the last steps to stuff that's Rich that was the story I did 30 days ago, and I can't believe that the I can't believe that the DC police didn't pick up on that, and run with that, and get ton more leads

* [[Day 205.11. For Live Researchers for Set Rich, Part 10 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIOUcBSxLa8)
  * Okay. Day 205
  * Just don't post any answers to this please, but this is just, so people can sync in this is Lou's City Bar right here.
  * This is right here. This is wet West our W Street and Flagler
  * So if you look at it here, he would have been right here, he would have walked down either Columbia Street, or Harvard Street I've walked down both of those streets
  * So there's got to be cameras all along here, that would have verified this.
  * You wouldn't walk along the reservoir here. This is very dark and desolate, and this is kind of like the end of Howard University, but it's all like dumpsters and stuff--it's not very nice back here.
  * But this street Georgia streets pretty nice
  * So I think he would have walked over this way or even down a little bit further to W, and then just cut straight over on W
  * I don't think he would have done this jog.
  * I think you would have just gone Georgia down to W and W over here as I said I was on my hands and knees at this corner exactly where he would have been
  * You can see the lake straight down the street just the edge, and you can see this MedStar Hospital at the edge of the street as well
  * So the girlfriend's name is Kelly Mulka {{ Ms K MULkTRA? (uncool. srry) }}
  * So if anybody can do a search on, global search on that, again don't answer to this video--I'm going to toss this away after everybody gets it, but then the other one is the police chief temporary, always the temporary police chief that just came in for the weekend Anthony Haythe-- like in ""hay the murders over this way... no wait a minutes over here""
  * Anyway it's H a Y th e
  * So I'm especially interested if he's in DynCorp, if he's never had any time and DynCorp, Haiti, Kosovo, you know all the names, Syria, Afghanistan Iraq etc
  * So... Thanks

* [[Day 205.12 Hillarys Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 12 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZahntHd4dA)
  * Okay. This is day 205 I think. This is 12 
  * {{ Reading Quote behind George }} ""Everything you see I owe to spaghetti""
  * Everything I owe to my researchers: it starts out as noodles but turns into spaghetti: a great plate of Intelligence, which is awesome
  * This one I like even more which is Thomas Alva Edison
  * ""I don't fail I tried 10 thousand times of things that I know don't work or something like that
  * Here in Oil City, Pennsylvania, which I think is where Rockefeller originally took the land of Ida Tarbell dad.
  * Ida Tarbell wrote all those books.  I'm I don't know am I kind of a male reincarnation?
  * Anyway I thought of Pinkertons
  * The whole idea that Rockefeller had in naming the Pinkertons was: will give him a British gentleman's name, and it'll be a dainty name
  * So it will kind of throw people off from the fact that these are killers!
  * And some people might say, ""well that's DynCorp same thing""
  * It's kind of Wall Street's secret police
  * Only Steve Feinberg's innovation is: he got the US government to pay for his ratlines--pay for all the people doing ""security"".
  * All those 7,000 individual contractors for DHS 24-hour pay, for the whole family.
  * Top wage, fill out the time cards on a little slip of paper, just turn them in once a month, whatever you need.
  * Anyway some people also say well no Rockefeller actually in 20 years occupation of the south actually all the Pinkertons were paid for for Rockefeller. So who knows?
  * But the investigation goes well a lot of people sent pictures I do have a picture of Joe Capone
  * Now which is good I do have a picture of Kelsey Holdeth. Or I think I said that name wrong. There's another girl named Chelsea Cash or something that says she's the girlfriend now, which is odd.
  * The Washington police DC police--I just think we should start tweeting the DC police--[@DCPoliceDept](https://twitter.com/DCPoliceDept) DC Police
  * And the questions that I've already asked tonight, are:
  * Can we have the badge numbers of the people who found Seth Rich?
  * Supposedly he was conscious. Did they ask him where he was shot?
  * Will you be releasing Seth Rich's metadata--his phone?
  * Do you have a picture of what he was wearing that night?
  * What hospital was he taken to?
  * Yeah we'd love to see the badge numbers--if you have a police report that you can post for that night?
  * We would like to know how they--what--how the reward is being given out, is it being given out to PR firms that Anthony Wiener knows?
  * Ballman is is like Berkman. Ballman is the guy who's supposedly the family's a spokesman who is a PR guy.
  * Berkman's a PR guy. Five minutes to figure that out.
  * I think the background there is going to be Edelman
  * The one guy I know in the PR businesses Edelman
  * So be interesting to do a compound search on Edelman, Berkman, Ballman, and of course Anthony Weiner.
  * Because that they're all going to go back for Schumer.
  * They're all going to be doing political stuff through Schumer
  * So anyway that's it's 11:30 here in Oil City
  * I probably might go another 60 miles.
  * I might do one more tonight.
  * For some reason the DC Police Department posted the wrong date.
  * They said ""give to the Seth Rich fund""
  * This is five minutes ago--give it a Seth Rich fund July 8th.
  * Well no he would he went out July 9th... we still don't have a picture of him that night on July 9th
  * And then he was shot in the morning of July 10th--they tweet out the July 8th's obvious misdirection.
  * There wasn't a baseball game that night it was a UFC fight that night
  * So again, does anybody at Lou's City Bar and Grille tweet out anything at all about a UFC fight that night?
  * Or was there a birthday party there that night... usually somebody has a birthday at a bar on a Saturday night in Washington DC
  * Seth Rich also was a Wisconsin fan--that bar is known to be a packer bar
  * So is there a is there a club? Is there a website for the club of people that go there, and watch those things?
  * Supposedly also like Nebraska, so maybe like Nebraska football
  * So I don't know that answer he liked the Redskins as well
  * So there's another affinity club that he might have been a member of that we can talk to the people
  * Somebody posted a picture of his aunt, and I might go talk to her.
  * And then he had several roommates that he lived with--I didn't realize that. I thought he just was the one girlfriend that was on the phone when hear this she heard the shots on the phone and he said don't worry about it
  * So I'm gonna be walking that path.
  * I'm gonna be making sure I'm going to go into every business.
  * Look for cameras, going to ask people what they saw that night, keep posting, and then start tweeting the DC Police Department.
  * Start asking questions:
  * What hospital, you know. 

---
* [[Day 206.1. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 1 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE-a7BSfHL4)
  * Okay Day 206 Part 1 Here at the beautiful Clarion Hotel in ~~do blah~~ Debois, Pennsylvania or Devoy Pennsylvania
  * Don't only remember W E B De boy I don't know if he was the back-to-africa movement, no that was Marcus Garvey
  * I think DeBois had one poem that said ""hideous glee"" I don't know why I think of Hillary when I think of that
  * But anyway let's not try to do too many double entendres here with Debois.
  * I just wanted to say that finding Seth Rich here--I'm not necessarily saying it's related to the Awan brothers, but I am saying that Mr. McCae would have telemetry NGA telemetry on this city of Washington DC city.
  * Washington DC is the most camera-ed city in the United States by far
  * Department of Homeland Security.
  * They even joke that it's the Department of Homeland police--they run the DC police
  * I believe they have enough DHS has an office right in the DC Police Department
  * So there's lots and lots and lots of resources available
  * We could look at Seth Rich's credit card for instance the last day and retrace his steps publicly
  * We could go and look at the pictures from Lou's Bar and Grill
  * You probably would those might be suspects if Seth talked to anybody during the night--might have gotten into an argument or something like that
  * If he had been at other stores that day you might want to talk to the merchants to retrace his steps there, to see if any of those folks had had heard him say anything about him being troubled that day, or whatever
  * Or any comments he might have made about people that didn't like him or trouble he was having with his girlfriend whatever
  * That would be something it seems like you would want to do
  * It seem like you'd want to publish what he was wearing, you know.
  * You could say Seth Rich had a tie and an blue suit and a white shirt. And then walk around with that picture to the neighbors. Then knock on doors and say, 'hey have you seen a guy with the glasses that makes him look smart and big tie a white shirt and blue blue jacket?'
  * Therefore then you could you could fill in that block of time between 140, when he left the Lou's City Bar and Grille, to the 420 when the police officers answered the shots fired answer
  * Now I went on to the DC gov web site and this is the these are the officers
  * Now this is unconfirmed
  * What happens is my researchers send me information that I I confirm it.
  * But here's one of my researchers what they said is the five officers Robert Wingate Robinson, Derek Thar, Shea Ellis, Benjamin Velez, Mark Lee and then Jody O'Leary
  * Now they said Jody O'Leary was I think this is the motorcycle police--was the responding officer the first one to get there
  * So I don't really know.
  * But anyway the policy is that you can request to the DC police to see any body camera
  * So there's three body cameras here
  * So I would like everyone here who's seeing this to formally request it.
  * It's at DC police DEPT please I'd like to request George Webb comes in as soon as possible to view the body cameras the three different body cameras for this for his death that night
  * So we can see exactly what kind of shape he was in.
  * I'm sure the police talked to him he was supposedly conscious but dazed
  * I'm sure that everyone would like to see the questions the police asked of him, as they got it as they waited for the ambulance.
  * I'm sure the police would have asked did you see who did it
  * How long have you been here are you bleeding?
  * Where have you been hit?
  * Do you think you've been shot can you show me where you're bleeding just simple triage questions that you would ask a shooting victim
  * So there's the folks--if you want to tweet the DC police, I'd like to see all three of the cameras tomorrow, if possible, or the day after. Whatever's convenient for the DC police
  * And then I thought about this Anthony Weiner email.
  * This is what they call prima facie evidence on its own face--doesn't need any other support.
  * We have Anthony Weiner distributing secure Blackberry phones with us with a trusted staff
  * Now Anthony Weiner also on his laptop has six hundred fifty thousand emails, which many are classified, from that alone this should reopen the Anthony Weiner case.
  * And he should be called in front of Congress, and again, I say the six hundred fifty thousand emails should be released, at least the metadata, because we have a person with no classified clearance as well as Huma
  * Now in the business of selling these are sending these phones and
  * Now with James Comey's testimony and the FBI a correction to it we, know that these phones are the hacking device.
  * These phones are a token that allow hacking
  * So we have we don't even need to know that it's the Awan brothers at this point.
  * We just know he has a trusted staff giving phones out, and we know that there's classified information on his server
  * So that means he has the classified information on a server.
  * We know the phones is a way of syncing and he's giving up phones.
  * Therefore Anthony Weiner's giving out classified information A to B and B to C
  * There's just no two ways about it.
  * Why wouldn't you call Anthony Weiner in front of congressional staff and ask him where are those phones?
  * What did you do?
  * Who was your trusted staff?
  * Can we see receipts?
  * Could we see start dates?
  * And how many phones did you give out?
  * Who would you give them to?
  * These are simple questions
  * So again there was an alternative very bulletproof phone from General Dynamics, it was Hillary that made the decision to use all these doped phones or whatever from the Awan brothers or whoever.
  * But most likely the Awan brothers because they have the training--we have them hacking phones.
  * And here we have just beaucoup evidence of Hillary trying to use the special phones, in a special unsecured phones in these classified settings
  * So that's it for tonight from beautiful duBois and here we go into the Lions Den

* [[Day 206.2. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 2 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZIEkvXtHn4)
  * Okay. Jay 206 part 2
  * I just read something that was really funny.
  * It said Seth Rich may have been having trouble with a DNC staffer, and their speculation that it's Donna Brazile
  * So let me understand this: Hillary says in an email about WikiLeaks:
  * ""Can't we just drone Assange, I mean Podesta says we need to make an example out of somebody,"" and then she hits for the cycle as far as WikiLeaks owners, and leaders and founders.
  * May: Ratner dies.
  * Well I guess she missed June.
  * July Seth rich is murdered
  * Then August Jones--the UK guy, the UK WikiLeaks guy gets pushed in front of a train
  * And then September McFadden dies the founder Julian Assange's best friend
  * And then Braverman tries to go to the Russian embassy
  * But wait a minute now, there is something, there's a hidden agenda here: he had he got cut in front of the watercooler one day at the DNC-- that's it: *yeah* and *yeah* and they go and actually on television and say these things!
  * I know I'm sorry. I'm a little punchy, but it just strikes me very play
  
---
* [[Day 206.3. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 3 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPhbhsL7CQ8)
  *  NO CAPTION DATA
  * Ok Day 206 Part 3
  * The Wikileaks trio, wikieaks troika, triumvurate, whatever you want to call it.
  * The Ratner to John Jones--the two attorneys, the NY and London Attornies for Wikileaks
  * And of course Gavin McFadden all dying in May then August and September
  * SO you have the Wikileaks trio or troika however you want ot say it
  * Then, of cours, you have the emails from Hillary saying, ""let's drone Assange"" and then you have an email from Podesta saying ""let's make an example out of somebody""
  * But then you have the DNC duo, the DNC dynamic duo--everybody forgets about Sean Lucas.  Sean Lucas was suing the DNC for unfair practices versus Bernie Sanders.  By the Hillary Clinton camp, by Debbie-Wasserman-Schultz, the same DWS that hired the Awan brothers and engineered the Awan brothers. And we won't talk about AW in this episode.
  * Up until let's see, 205 days, everyone said that the wikileaks trio wasn't related to the DNC duo.
  * And of course I always throw in Eric Braverman as the one who unites all of this
  * But anyway, let's just take the Wikileaks trio and the DNC duo
  * Everyone said, oh that's a trio over here and then there's a duo over there.
  * Those two are related, the DNC duo -- Seth Rich and John Lucas those two deaths are unrelated to the Wikileaks' trio deaths.
  * Here's why I say it's a basketball team, it's actually the Wikileaks 5, I'm going to say it's actually the Wikileaks' six because of Eric Braverman
  * The reason I say it's the Wikileaks five is because of the emails that connect them.
  * That's the key metadata that connects them
  * 1100 attachments
  * Gigabytes of information
  * I think it's 1700 attachments...is it [44,000 emails  (http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/16/slain-dnc-staffer-had-contact-with-wikileaks-investigator-says.html) and 11,000 attachments? or 17,000 attachments {{ it's 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments. I am a popup factgenie }}]?
  * That's a lot, that's a connection.
  * That's not like...you know I haven't sent a letter to the founder of Wikileaks lately, Gavin McFadden, and even though we're in the middle of this hammer and tongs campaign here at the DNC, I think I'm going to send an introductory letter to Gavin McFadden just to let him know I'm alive...NO, he sends 44k emails and [17k] attachments--gigabytes of information.
  * I would say that the DNC duo is attached to the Wikileaks troika, or trio, the lawyers basically.
  * And it's really the Wikileaks 5, and now I'm going to add the Wikileaks 6. So Wiki 6
  * Wiki 6 kind of sounds like a pick that you'd pick for lotto--what's your wiki6?   {{ howl }}
  * Well my Wiki 6 I throw in is the powerball, the powerball is Eric Braverman
  * And as I mentioned yesterday, that is since day 1.  You're going to find Braverman communicating with Ratner, Jones and McFadden, all 3.  And all Trump has to do is link that again to Cernovich. That's all he has to do, and then they have to cover it. They have to come up with some kind of wacky cover story, and they have to hire somebody to front, and act like there's an investigation.
  * Do we know the hospital yet?
  * Seems like with the whole world talking about the Seth Rich case again we would know the name of the hospital he went to.
  * Now I published this morning in 206.1, all five officers's names, 3 of them had body cameras.
  * Have they called a press conference yet?  At the @DCpoliceDept called a press conference yet and had the officers come forward so they can answer some questions.  Seems like that would be very helpful
  * Now I can tell you the most significant officer is going to be Officer Jody.  Officer Jody of the motorbike that doesn't have the camera.  I believe she's going to be the first to the scene.
  * SO I would like everybody to ask the DC police department if they could arrange a meeting with me and officer Jody.
  * Also the public information officer if that's what they want to do.
  * I'd like to know when the press conference is going to be, so we can get to the bottom
  * And I'd like to know about the metadata, all the cameras, all the cameras from midnight to let's say 6am
  * The Cameras all along the way--from the bar, in the police officers' body cams, the cameras all along McGill, the row houses there.
  * There was a lady that was saying that men were talking very loudly, yelling at 251 in the back courtyard, supposedly there's a lot of cameras--McGill, rowhouses
  * All the dashcams for the police vehicles, dashcams for the EMT if the EMT is wearing body cams.  The ER driving room camera at the hospital, all the cameras in the hospitals.
  * Hospitals are the most camera'ed thing in the world
  * And the admittance report; and of course the police report
  * So that's for this morning from beautiful central Pennsylvania---I think this is where Washington came out with the army and went up against the Whisky folks because they were cutting into his whisky business in the Whisky Rebellion--check that. Ok.
  
---
* [[Day 206.4. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 4 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gvbsZ3AT6Q)
  * Okay. Day 2004 This is a 2006 excuse me this is version four
  * So the hospital is going to be critical
  * This is the lynchpin to the whole case
  * If we can't even name the hospital, we can't there's no follow-up, we don't even know where to go for the camera, the cameras of Seth Rich as he's coming in-- we have no idea of his condition, we can't follow up on the admission report, we can't any of his vitals that may have kept the metadata that may have come off of monitors that he was on
  * Two gunshots in the back you usually remember that
  * It's not like a stabbing, or somebody who swallows a thing whatever Clinton did or George Bush did I can't remember they had a thing where they swallowed a peanut or something
  * So it's not like one of those run-of-the-mill things.
  * You remember the gunshot wounds. And you remember 4:20--that time of night or whatever it is. You remember that
  * So Tim Day of WikiLeaks contacted me.
  * I don't know if he's in the UK, or if he's in Sweden there, if he's in the United States, but I said to--which I appreciate thank you, Tim--but can you tweet this out?
  * Where is the hospital? To the worldwide audience on the WikiLeaks Twitter, because if we don't have that, that's the link pin lynchpin to the whole case
  * So you got to have that to start, and then you could start working your way back.
  * And say oh well there's the there's the officer that came in.
  * That's the officer that brought him in or there's the EMT that brought him in
  * Oh he's got a body camera well let's get his body camera.
  * And then there's just a profusion of evidence inside the hospital.
  * It's one of the most electronically monitored places in the world
  * So it's going to be just perfusion of evidence and metadata in the hospital
  * And he's dead so we're not there HIPPA doesn't apply.
  * Again Kennedy I know he died at Parkland Hospital, we have his autopsy photos, that was the president of United States
  * So at this point privacy is not the issue, it's the the sanctity of government at this point, with the separation of powers
  * So that's that.
  * Like I said I published the badge numbers last night with who had body cams, who didn't have body cams.
  * The other thing is the bar. The bar. Now we know two guys shot him the least that's what the press report said
  * If two guys shot him or two guys tried to rob him, have you ever heard of robbers casing somebody casing somebody before they robbed them?
  * Maybe if they didn't take the maybe it was a political murder, they would be cased in the last place if the person the victim was alive?
  * Like they would be in the bar probably. Maybe even buy him a drink or be around him and have an intermediary buy him a drink, and start watching him, and start looking at what time he's leaving.
  * There's a good chance that if we have the bar camera footage, that we'll see the other people who might have killed them, at least have some suspects that we could start talking to.
  * ...That might live in the area and correlate those people in the bar with where they lived, and maybe they saw him walking home.
  * Maybe the bar closed, and we can talk to people who all left at about 140
  * Maybe they saw him talking to Joe Capone out in the front
  * And maybe they were worried about him--
  * Maybe there were some people that said that guy shouldn't be walking home alone at night, in the condition he's in.
  * And sometimes Howard or University area sometimes in Washington DC is not so safe. Maybe somebody had that thought
  * And therefore we would want to talk to that person.
  * That person could provide evidence
  * Maybe that person stopped and tried to give him a ride.
  * Said hey man you look really in bad shape let me let me give you a ride.
  * We don't know, unless we unless you publish the whole bar tape, and believe me if you publish all eight hours, people will go through all eight hours, and watch him there, and do a minute-by-minute timeline of what he was doing
  * So I'm going to upload this today, I appreciate if you could help me out, and just give me the hospital, and then I can get all the doctors, and nurses, admittance people, and people who work the front desk, and all that stuff I can get all that stuff, and I get all the metadata downstream, and then we'll know what to FOIA if people resist giving the information we'll know what to FOIA

  * Day 206 Part 5
  * I'm going to put you behind the scalpel now.
  * I'm going to take you to the hosptial where Seth Rich is coming in and going through that process
  * How many people need to be there as witnesses?
  * We're just going to tweet out those university hospitals to see if they were there--if they remember that.
  * Now I talked to my son in in spanish harlem is one hospital he works at, the traditional old black harlem is the other one, the Cotton Club harlem.
  * Never saw a gunshot wound in 4 yrs.
  * You've got a lot of stuff going on, especially if you are a medical school student or an intern
  * First thing you're going to do is call your attending Physician.
  * You're going to be looking for wounds--where are the gunshot wounds?
  * Where are the entry wounds? Looking in there probing to see how much blood
  * Little bit of blood capillaries
  * Lot a bit of blood veins
  * Huge amounts of blood -- artery severed
  * So that's the first thing.
  * You're going to be looking for exit wounds as well.
  * Because if a bullet lodges somewhere in there it could also be a problem
  * If it's lodged in the lungs and the lungs are leaking, that's a problem.
  * If it nicks the heart, it fills up the pericardium, and the person can drown in their own blood
  * If they nick the liver, you have to determine bullet path...
  * Liver or pancreas you have enzymes, very caustic enzymes, stomach as well, acids, and so forth, that's going to be in the perineum, the sac below
  * If you hit a kidney, those are retroperineal, your'e still going to have to call an organ finder and get that thing out of there. You can't let the urine go inside the body sac
  * If it hits the spine thing; if the bullet is lodged near the heart the person could bleed to death if they are moved the wrong way.
  * You've got a lot going on--you don't really forget stuff like that
  * This is an intense situation, and believe me, the attending physician is going to remember--the attendings is going to calling a cardiologist; a GI guy; a specialist; they're going to be calling a vascular surgeon if theres a rupture, they're going to be calling a team. They're going to bring in the MRI, the XRay, a profusion of Metadata.
  * This guy is dying here potentially, remember he dies an hour and forty minutes later.
  * He did die at the hospital.
  * He's either going to go to Howard Trauma 1, so somebody go over to Howard Trauma 1 and just say, 'hey do you remember? You were the admissions specialist. Who was on duty july 9th..do you remember?  It was right after fourth of july weekend, it was a crappy shift, but you should remember because you had to work that weekend""
  * And they're going to remember the next week and they couldn't get off
  * That's where we're at.
  * We still don't know if it's the other hospital, the one that Seth Rich is looking at on his hands and knees potentially dying when police arrived to find him
  * It seemed like....I asked Tim Day to tweet it out. He's too busy. He's got something else to do, he's got a deadline
  * BTW the world of Wikileaks is watching all night people from the UK, and all around the world, especially from New Zealand and AUS have been helping out.
  * I think they give money to Wikileaks. They might want your help, Tim.
  * So Sorry to come down so hard on you buddy, but we got an emergency room situation here bro  {{ #sorrynotsorry }}

6c26tz,1,2017-05-19,Interested in Cyber Security in the National Guard,SappyPoems,nationalguard,https://www.reddit.com/r/nationalguard/comments/6c26tz/interested_in_cyber_security_in_the_national_guard/,"I'm going to be pursuing a degree in Cyber Security this fall and I have a few questions about the Guard during college.

* What is the standard timeline for enlistment? I know that bootcamp is 12 weeks, but how long is AIT for cyber security?

* Does anyone have experience with summer internships while in the guard? It seems like you have to do 2 weeks of training every summer which could be a problem if you wanted to travel across the country to land a big internship.

* Does anyone have experience with cyber security in the national guard? Any tips or advice?

I know I should probably call a recruiter, but I thought I'd ask here first. Thanks in advance.

6c37lq,8,2017-05-19,The way my mother tried to manipulate my moving out.,Ylliarian,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6c37lq/the_way_my_mother_tried_to_manipulate_my_moving/,"My nMom isn't the type to tell someone directly if she doesn't like things. She is never blant but highly manipulative and covers her actions.

It was always clear that my siblings and I were supposed to study. In my country not everyone can go to university but you have to make a certain school degree to get there. When someone else in the extended family or the children of the few friends she had started to study she would always talk about it. If they chose something untraditional they were always lazy and tried to suck the money out of their parents. If someone dared to quit and start a different major they were useless because they clearly didn't think about their future enough. She never told any of us directly what major we should take but I always felt obligated to choose something she would approve of. My parents had enough money to support us and they placed funds for us for once we graduated. My siblings knew very early what they wanted to do and chose something leading to a classic carrier path. Roughly 2 years before my graduation my nMom began to pressure me that I have to choose as well. When I had problems how to even find majors apart from the classic ones she critisized me. I was always the creative one but if I had chosen an arts major she would have disapproved. She wouldn't have said it directly but wouldn't let an opportunity go to make me feel bad. I made the mistake to please her and find something that might fit my needs. I tried out a lot of internet tests and visited open day events at universities. She increased the pressure. Told me that the carrier I choose is important for the rest of my life and that I have to decide now. Mind that a lot of my classmates had no clue either at that time. Finally I found a major that was a mixture between arts and engineering. It met my interests fair enough and had enough down to earth subjects I could please my nMom with. Only problem was that the city was half the country away. There would be several hours travel time from home. Of course there were comments like: ""Then you can only visit us on the holidays"" and ""You can't come every weekend like your siblings."" ""You will be  completely alone in a different city.""

My nMom wanted me to go to the open day at the university before I finally decided. I guess she wanted to scare me because I had to go alone. She was a stay at home mom and there was no reason she couldn't have come with me. I organized everything from train tickets, to the hostel I would stay in, to were I had to go on that day. Of course she complained that it was expensive and I should take that day seriously. Though it was something completely new for me I managed and I decided I wanted that major.

As she had pressured me to decide and I finally found something a year before my graduation she didn't have much arguments left against it. During the final exams she began to pressure me again because I had to find a room to live in that city. My sister already found an apartment and my nMom got on my case cause she thought I was lazy and waiting too long.

Again she never told me what to look for exactly but my mother was against shared apartments. She told us horror stories of dormitories and shared living though she never experienced any of it because she never studied. Then she planted that idea in my head that everything near the city would be way to expensive. I searched for one-room apartments that weren't completely over my budged but I wasn't lucky. Of course I was too stupid because my siblings both found something. Then my nMom had the glorious idea that we could look to buy an apartment. Again that shouldn't be too expensive and she viewed it as an investment. So apart from apartments to rent I began to look for some to buy. As this didn't go fast enough she told me we had to pick a date for when we would make appointments to visit apartments and then I had to decide. So we booked a holiday flat for a few days directly after my graduation celebration. It had to be a flat with dogs allowed because my nMom wanted to take our young dog with us because ""he has to learn about the big city"". Until then I had to find anything we could look at. I made appointments with the few I found. Then I found an offer for a small flat near my university. It was ideal but my nMom didn't like it one bit. She made me write an e-mail to ask lots of different stuff. But the flat had everything I needed. I also made an appointment there but it was on the last date of our visit.

Finally the day to travel there came. We took turns to drive and had to stop every hour to let the dog out for a small walk. The trip in itself was already stressfull becaues I didn't have lots of driving experience over long distances and my nMom is the worst fellow passenger you could think of. After the 6 to 7 hour trip we are finally there. The next day we had 4 appointments to go to. We had to drive through the worst traffic. The apartments we looked at were allright but all fairly far away. My nMom would have directly said yes to every single one whereas I always said that I wanted to look at the rest first. We visited everything but the apartment I was excited for that very day. In the evening my nMom pressured me to look for apartments again so that we could make more appointments. To my surprise I actually found an offer and contacted them. So we visited that the next morning. The apartment looked nice and was for rent. The landlord lived in the house as well. My nMom was excited from the get go. It was in an acceptable neighbourhood and the apartment was fairly big for one person. Of course it was also expensive and I knew with the money from my parents I could barely afford it for the time I would study in that city. My nMom told the landlord we would contact her really soon. And as soon as we left she wanted to talk me into renting it. I told her it was too expensive but she didn't want to hear it. It was perfect in her opinion as it was something she would want to live in. She liked apartments with lots of space and told me that that was the best for me. I told her I wanted to wait for the appoinment the next day and then I would decide. The rest of the day we spent in the city. My nMom insisted to take the dog with us and that made it very stressfull. In the evening she talked to me for a very long time. She insisted on the apartment and that I should immidiatly take the chance as it could go to someone else before I decided. In the end I caved in to the idea. I was tired and stressed from that trip and didn't have the energy to defend myself anymore. We agreed that we would call the landlord the next morning so that we could measure out the apartment to plan where my stuff could go. That night I silently cried myself to sleep while my nMom slept soundly next to me. At that time I didn't know why I was so devasted because I would get an apartment and everything. At that point I just wanted to get back home.

The next morning my nMom arranged everything with the landlord and after that we drove home. I got accepted at the university. I moved there 4 weeks before the lectures began because my nMom and my brother had to help me move and that was the only time they had time. So I spent 4 weeks in a city I didn't know anyone in. I was very lonely at first but felt free for the first time. When lecutures began I met new people and wasn't completely on my own anymore. After 3 months I went home for the first time and the first thing I heard was: ""You still like it there? Your father and I thought that you wouldn't make it through the first three months before giving up."" I was hurt by that because it isn't like me at all to give up. Especially after she told me for years how bad it is to quit your major.

I lived on the minimum during my first semesters because I knew money would get tight with the rent. I would have never asked my parents for money. I worked several holiday jobs. At christmas during my first semester I was stupid enough to mention that the rent was expensive and I had to budget my money. The only thing I heard was that ""You just don't know how to budget and waste money."" Yeah thanks mom. /s  It's not like you were the one who wanted that apartment that eats up most of my monthly budget. Or ""Your siblings don't have these problems."" Yes because they pay like half the rent. After one year I tried to move into a shared apartment. When I told her she said that it would be really inconvinient for her to come help me and that I had no reason to move. I finally moved out when I did a required internship and moved to another city for half a year. Then I searched for a cheaper apartment all by myself and never asked her for help again.

Sorry that was really long but this still makes me angry. It's nothing big but at that time I felt like she abandoned me and didn't help me with anything.

So the Tl;Dr would be: I got a major in a city far away that my nMom didn't like. She ""helped"" me find an apartment and I ended with one I couldn't afford with my budget. In the end she told me I wasn't good with money and would just waste it."
6c428p,1,2017-05-19,How to navigate a touchy but potentially awesome situation,jacobsgotthememes,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6c428p/how_to_navigate_a_touchy_but_potentially_awesome/,"I'm a guy who just finished my first year of college and my best friend the whole year was a girl. She's from my hometown and we graduated together but we never talked before college. We would hang out watching tv eating dinner or playing D&amp;D 2 or 3 times a week and go to church together whenever she stayed in town. 

I always definitely into her but she was dating someone who went to school 4 hours away from us when we met and that relationship continued all year, leading her to visit him most weekends. Now, right after the year ended, she texted me that she and the guy broke up because he wouldn't shake on religion and she wants to marry a guy who shares her beliefs. They broke up like 2 weeks ago today. 

I think I'm halfway in there, I just don't know what to do next. She's doing a study internship this summer at our school an hour and a half away. How long do I give her to get over the last thing? Should I start by texting her more, do I offer to go visit her for a weekend since I have a different friend in town I could stay with, wait for her to come home occasionally and try to get some time in then, or wait til next semester?"

**Are there any other options for recovery or any way to escalate this further with Facebook or Twitter?** Each page is already set up nicely and has a few hundred likes so I would like to be able to access them and take over management.

The only other option I can think of is to just make new pages, but **is there a process for deleting the old pages as to not confuse people?**

6c4spo,1,2017-05-19,Questions about my student loans,Gardwan,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/6c4spo/questions_about_my_student_loans/,"Hello everyone, I had a few questions about my student loans and was wondering if anyone could help me.

I recently graduated from pharmacy school a week ago with $108,000 in student loans. All my loans are from direct unsubsidized federal loans and I have a 6 month grace period before I am required to start paying them off. I am currently working for walgreens making $28/h as a grad intern and have a pharamacist offer for $57/h (118k/year) upon my passing of the NAPLEX and MPJE. I am working around 20-25 hours a week so my income at the moment is around 2k/month. My credit score is 750+

The questions:
1. While looking through my loan statements I noticed that I have some loans with interests as low as 5.2% and others as high as 6.2%. Overall my interest is listed as 5.7%. Do federal loans automatically consolidate into a single interest?

2. A company called Sofi has contacted me for refinancing my loans. Their pamphlet says fixed rate (3.38%-6.7%) and variable (2.5%-6.49%). Is it advisable that I refinance and if so should I go with variable or fixed? I am aware that I lose some benefits of a federal loan such as loan forgiveness, but that is not something I intend to do. If I do follow through with sofi, in order to get the best rates, would it be advisable to put my pending pharmacist salary as my expected income? 

3. I've heard a lot of talk about the idea that if your interest is less than say 6%, it would be better to make minimum payments towards the loan and then invest in the market in hopes of making more than an 8% growth and slowly surpass the amount lost in interest by the loan by the amount gained in the market. Where would I invest for this and would it be advisable to get a financial adviser?

4. For my personal interest. How do companies like Sofi get their profits? How does it benefit them to offer lower interest rates and what is the ""catch"".

6c4ti0,1,2017-05-19,Current pharmacist graduate student with $14k CC debt without options.,davecow,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6c4ti0/current_pharmacist_graduate_student_with_14k_cc/,"Hi everyone; hopefully this post doesn't get buried in the rest of the posts and someone with experience can provide some input. Below I am going to split my situation into 3 parts: Debt, Future, End-Goal

* I currently have about $14k in cc debt between four credit cards with APRs ranging between 14-20%. Due to some poor judgment from an old relationship, I also owe my ex-girlfriend about $15k. 
* I will be entering my 3rd year of pharmacy school in August and will be graduating with my Doctorate in Pharmacy in May 2019. I am currently a part-time intern at Walgreens making $16 an hour and am guaranteed a job upon graduation with a salary that should at least be around $95k/year. I don't have any student loans because my parents are funding my education, but I cannot get myself to ask them to help me out with a personal loan, since they are already doing so much for me. 
* I have looked into personal loans from SoFi, lending tree, upstart, etc. and it is very difficult to get a large loan with an APR lower than 20% with some type of interest only repayment plan until I graduate in May 2019 and can begin to take on larger monthly payments. Essentially what could erase all of this is like a $40k personal loan for 5 years in which I could make payments on the interest until May 2019 and then full payments thereafter. I don't mind a high interest rate. It's just hard to find this type of loan with my current student/intern job position and without a co-signer. My credit is currently 694.

In summary, essentially I know I dug myself into a hole; I understand how poorly I mishandled my money and I want to just be able to pay off the ex-gf debt and get back on track. I KNOW I will be making good money come May 2019, it's just hard to prove that to a bank without them wanting to sell me a student loan (I don't need help paying for school, hence why I don't need a student loan).

Thanks!"

* [[Day 206.6 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 6 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKwbVvHPAwc)
  * Okay. Day 206 Part Six
  * I don't mean to role play the Tim Day saying at WikiLeaks over and over
  * But it it just goes to show perspective
  * I believe that you have about 24 to 48 hours as a as a WikiLeaks person to jump on these leaks
  * Now when it comes out that forty--the person in question in the most biggest news story in the world right now, sets forty four thousand messages and seventeen thousand email attachments with gigabytes of information to your Dead founders company, to your dead London lawyers company, to your dead New York lawyers company, and they died in the middle of that may all died within a three or four month period you got about 24 to 48 hours
  * And what makes me say that? Again history.
  * Look at the Hillary case.
  * When that story breaks they had about 48 hours to take advantage of it.
  * What happened?  It closed. McCabe closed it down and nothing happened
  * Here we are in a malignancy still
  * Gosh I think four years later five years later, I think the case is all but dead.
  * Because you give the conspirators time to destroy the evidence
  * This is just like an emergency room situation, and I don't mean to come down hard on Tim day at WikiLeaks, but you have to understand that reporting is like being in an emergency room: you get a lead, and you have to jump on the lead, otherwise the conspirators can destroy the evidence.
  * ***Look at Hillary Clinton's life. In every case she's been in, it's but destruction of evidence that's all along the way! Look at McCabe look at all the things he's done***
  * So anyway Huma--the same thing with a Huma situation: nobody jumped on the TruePundit story.
  * I think I was the only one.
  * I connected the dots with the WikiLeaks, and just said hey this is WikiLeaks. Eric Braverman is WikiLeaks--Seth Ridge WikiLeaks. So I'm half right.
  * The other shoe is going to drop here. It's going to be Eric Braverman went to WikiLeaks
  * You're going to find out, Tim, you're going to find out that about a year from now, and you're going to really feel stupid that you didn't tweet out what the heck hospital did Seth Rich go to--you're going to not feel good about yourself I'm telling you that right now
  * But that that means the patient's already dead, and the relatives are looking at you, going why did you try harder doctor?
  * When yesterday's news broke that it is WikiLeaks--that's your patient Tim, at your door. You got to do something with that.
  * Your founder tweeted out the fact he was the guy--he was the leak at DNC leaks--you get it?
  * Yes you sit at the junction. You're the Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain on top of the Little Round Top
  * You got to do something.
  * You got about 24 more hours. we're 24 hours into this you got about 24 more hours to get that Hospital name
  * I'll get it anyway.
  * It doesn't matter but use the worldwide power of WikiLeaks to help solve the murder of someone who gave you this DNC leaks story.
  *  Okay. Right I've given WikiLeaks story
  * I've gone to the Ecuadorian Embassy
  * I've gone to Ecuador
  * I've gone to the embassy in Germany, Russian embassy in Berlin, to get a story to RT, and get a story to you guys.
  * I risked my life okay?
  * So you've got to understand what the other side is doing, to try to get you these stories
  * You don't just publish them
  * They happen with real journalists, real people, taking real risks, risking their life? Okay
  * So get with the program man,  you got to get with the program, that's all I'm saying.
  * I'm just trying to give you a perspective.
  * People stayed up all night from the UK all across the world in New Zealand, we had to help from Australia, we've got all these folks now
  * You gotta understand when the ambulance comes in the door, you don't start texting your girlfriend, you get on that case.
  * You go in there you probe the wound you find out the you triage the damn thing and you call the people you need and you get it off your hands if you don't have the skills you get it off your hands we get it into somebody who does have the skills okay
  * So don't just sit on it don't you say well hey I'm the first-year intern, and first year interns don't do gunshot wounds-- that's not how it works. Okay?

* [[Day 206.7. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 7 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ir27sD4OzU)
  * NO CAPTION DATA
  * Ok Day 206 Part 7
  * Tim I'm going to go around you.
  * This is for all the folks at Wikileaks--anybody who works there, ok?
  * First let me say in a military situation: my dad's is a radio guy in the signal corps -- you send a message in 3 different ways.
  * That way if your radio communication is jammed you still have a runner.
  * If your phone line is cut you still have a radio message
  * If both of those your radio message is jammed and your phone line is cut you still have a runner
  * If the runners are all killed you still have the other 2 forms of electronic communication
  * Hitler was a runner btw for messages in WW1, but anyway--got the iron cross twice, so that's...anyway...
  * Don't want to see another Hitler get in power again {{ too late: HRC }}, as a Jew. That was an aside, shoudln't've done that.
  * So, there's these networks. I'm going to break it down--it's called a relay network.
  * Because I can't get into a plane in NY and fly all the way to Sweden where the server is, and plug the thumb drive directly into the server so that Wikileaks can publish stuff, or anybody
  * Now Wikileaks has a dropbox but if the dropbox is compromised and you learn that the dropbox is compromised...you have a thumbdrive network
  * If you talk to Julian or anybody at Wikileaks, they'll know about the thumbdrive network.
  * So here's how it works.  You're part of a network, it's an anonymous network.
  * That way if you're caught--interrogated, you don't know who your upstream is and you don't know who your downstream is.
  * You only know 2 things.  What your upstream pickup is, and what your downstream drop off is.
  * If it's really sophisticated like the Wikileaks network is, that changes.  There is a sign to then deliver you a dropoff point and a pickup point, right at the last minute so that the whole network isn't compromised  if somebody doesn't follow the network
  * I'm not saying I'm in that network, because that would be treason, unless is misprision of treason; unless I was an insider and I knew about treason being committed.
  * So the bottom line is the people in the network don't know what they are delivering.  They don't know
  * They don't know if they are delivering HRC's 60k emails, or Humas 650k emails, or Seth Rich's 44k emails or the Awan brother's blackberry server emails--they don't know.
  * So you look in the news for news about these troves coming out, and that's how you seem really smart when Gavin McFadden dies because you think, 'hey he didn't really die of that heart attack over those 30 days, I mean he could have been 'heart attacked', but somebody compromised him
  * Somebody compromised McFadden, Jones and pushed him in front of a train, Ratner
  * You don't know how the thumbdrives are going where they're going.
  * There's this thing called Diplomatic pouches
  * Same thing, Revolutionary war--sons of liberty, you can google it Tim
  * Nathan Hale, etc, so he's got a statue at the CIA if ppl don't know who he is
  * People doing the right thing for their country: Misprision of Treason
  * When things come out in the news, you go, ""hey that could have been my thumbdrive, get it?""
  * When that happens, you want ot see the people who are receiving the thumbdrive, to act on receiving the thumbdrive
  * And if you can prove the Government's story is false about Seth Rich, or Gavin McFadden, or Michael Ratner,
  * But the really easy one to prove is Seth Rich you want people to act in accordance with showing them the government's story is a fabrication. Ok?
  * Sorry I had to break that down
  * I can go into the coordinates of where I was for the cops, if you want, if I have to spell that out
  * But hopefully I won't have to do that.
  * So hopefully somebody at Wikileaks will grab the reigns and realize that the window is closing.

* [[Day 206.8. Hillary'Hillarys , Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 8 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFx3_SMI8ws)
  * Okay. Day 206 Part 8
  * Sometimes it's hard to help people do their job sometimes
  * But anyway yeah we called the Mary Alice who's on duty right now at Howard, and she confirmed that there's a big meeting
  * These are always gag meetings.
  * They're going to do the same thing and all the other hospitals
  * McCabe is going to send somebody around, and I would too, he's smart
  * I mean that's why you just have to move with a crack of the bat on these things
  * So that's Okay. We'll work around it, there's a there's a metadata all over the place.
  * That's just one avenue that's been cut off-- there's going to be a thousand more so
  * The dance continues

* [[Day 207.1. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 1 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZL0BCvFDWM)
  * Okay Day 207 here at the Variety Cafe on 25th here and Seventh Avenue
  * So I think the case now goes to generating as much metadata as possible.
  * I'm not trying to come up with any theories at this point.
  * I think it just as important to generate as much metadata for the Seth Rich thing as possible
  * KC Kelsie Kelsie Kelsie Kelsie Kelsie Mulka M U L K A.
  * She's on Facebook she has a LinkedIn profile
  * She's in Washington DC
  * Supposedly 2:03AM she has a phone call-- it lasts 89 minutes.
  * What I love about those things is there's lots and lots of metadata
  * So I would like to interview her
  * I'll uh there's also Ron wheeler I was on Lou Dobbs talking about body cams
  * I would like to go to the DC police, and talk about body cams. Get that footage.
  * Again more generation of metadata
  * So at this point it's all about collection of evidence.
  * For instance and also taking the last steps of Rich again ,which I did 35 days ago
  * But also now with more with the walk from Lou City Barm all the way to down Harvard Street--East on Harvard Street, South on Georgia Street, back to the Flagler corner.
  * And then what I want to do is--I mean if I'm guessing at 2:03, he would be walking home, talking to her, she's in Washington DC--I assumed he was going to her house
  * So just: what did they talk about?
  * And let's get some mile posts and signposts along the way, and then associate that
  * So if at 220 he's in front of the rain shop, and saying, ""baby I want to marry you, and I'm look you have these rings,"" that lets us know that look up
  * Now and see if there's a security camera there, and just tied correlation, event correlation, looking for cameras, looking for different metadata, I also want to interview the Howard University trauma one folks--they remember him coming in at 4:20 a.m. then we're going to look for admission reports like that
  * So we're going to just anyone who has any ideas about metadata no formulation of theory at this point.
  * Just metadata metadata metadata.
  * Thank you [Music] 

---
* [[Day 207.2. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 2 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DMaKhOkEXI)
  * Okay Day 207 I wanted to give everybody a map so that you could start collecting metadata
  * Seth's going to start here at Lou's City Bar.
  * He's going to walk down Harvard. So you're looking for cameras along this street: Harvard--it's a very Main Street.
  * I doubt he would have went down side streets. I think you would have stayed on this main drag here on Harvard
  * So if we could just begin sending me different business locations along here.
  * When you use Google Maps that have cameras and then going south here on Georgia the same thing--all along the way here there should be cameras all along the way this is a major university here. Howard University
  * There's MedStar over here across the way. I still believe he went to Howard University
  * So he's shot here.
  * Howard University trauma one is right there, so it's just straight down W Street it's a very short distance
  * So sirens are going to be blaring, there's gonna be all kinds of people, and commotion here at 4:20 a.m., from here to here
  * So cameras along here in on W Street are going to be especially important.
  * Talking to neighbors along W Street it's going to be especially important
  * There's a woman here who is in the Gilmore apartments--I believe it's Gilmore or Gill wood condos that said at 2:51 AM she heard men's voices, loud men's voices, talking here, and that like they were almost waiting for someone here
  * So now he gets on the phone with his girlfriend here. Maybe at 2:03.
  * Joe Capone the manager of Blues City bar talks to him and offers him a cab at 11:45
  * He calls his girlfriend some time in here on Harvard at 2:03, and then it's on the phone with her 89 minutes
  * So all we need from Kelsey Mulka is just: what did he talk about?
  * And that may give us clues, because usually people--if they're drunk they're walking home, they're usually going to say something about what they're looking at
  * They're going to say, ""oh look the water looks beautiful, or oh there's a ring shop, or oh there's the place we first went when we--dated,"" because I believe she lives here.
  * I don't have her address yet, but I believe Kelsey Mulka lives here.
  * And then I think we have to start knocking on doors between Howard University and W on W Street here and Flagler
  * So, I just want to collect evidence, collect metadata, collect things that could--either residents or witnesses that were quoted in the in the press, or different camera locations along here, and then also doctors any doctors from any police reports, or nurses that are quoted, that especially trauma room doctors, that have in previous cases any names
  * So just start generating names. Social media sites, because these are the people I want to talk to when I get to Washington DC okay
  * So right
  * Now it's all about evidence collection metadata and that's report number two for today
   
---
* [[Day 207.3. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 3 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS2FqsZbn44)
  * Day 207 This does not relate to Seth Rich but this does relate to Anthony Weiner
  * The reason why I'm on 25th here, 25th and 10th street
  * 10th Street Pizza is that way about a mile is cross st. of Park
  * So Park is parallel to all the avenues on 10th avenue, so 25th and Park is where Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner live
  * I believe it's 254 Park
  * For points along the way for Anthony Weiner's walk in the morning to get to his office at MWW associatiates.
  * So we want to start collecting data for MWW
  * Why didn't Andrew McCabe collect the server logs for MWW?
  * Where that classified data that was on his laptop might have been stored?
  * Why didn't he collect all the employees of MWW, where that data might have been sold to investment firms uptown here on 47th street with Lehman Brothers and all those, or downtown on Wall St.
  * So why did we not know who those employees were?
  * We're also going to go to Brooklyn, where Hillary for America is, and we're going to look for celltowers along the way.
  * And we're going to look for celltowers that aren't Verizon celltowers
  * We're going to look for special celltowers that somehow Blackberries connect to--special Blackberries--*not approved NSA Blackberries but Hillary's special blackberries that Anthony's trusted staff put together--whoever they are
  * And we're going to look for where the connection points may be because again that's metadata.
  * You put the tower in, that's evidence, there's no opinion there
  * So we'll move on
  
---
* [[Day 207.4 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 4 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH2pgrLiajs)
  * Ok Day 207 um Part 4 I think maybe Part 3
  * I'm here at NY Presbyterian and I just went over with a doctor--try to guess which one--the Seth Rich report.
  * Which is done by a fourth year resident--so we're going to be able to find this guy--who was from WHC Washington hospital.
  * He was on rotation. Your rotations can be a month it can be three months whatever, but he's rotating to Howard Trauma 1. SO that's the guy who wrote this
  * It's very detailed as far as the procedures performed when he came into the OR--I believe it's Howard 1
  * What he says is theres 2 wound...there's 3 wounds, an exit and entry so that's one bullet hole through the abdomen
  * And the other one lodges somewhere in the liver, ok so that's where the 2nd bullet comes in.
  * The liver is divided into 8 segments, up near the top, skinny part near the midline, there's 2 segments on the top and the bottom segment, three is the bottom, segment near the midline. Ok. So that was damaged
  * And they went in there, and did what they call an xline, or...an X-lap, which is cutting the body here, doing an incision doing laproscopic to quickly assess where the bleed is.
  * What they do is they pack it with different gauze, so they quickly pack the four segments of the liver to see where the damage is--and that's what they did to find out where that the wound was
  * The second thing they did was they had to go into the bowel. There was a bowel injury.
  * They recepted about 12 cm of the bowel. They left it open with discontinuity, which means didn't close it off.
  * They were going to wash out the bowls in the morning was the plan.
  * There was no emergency to this at all
  * The guy had said he'd seen dozens and dozens of bullet wounds here and they had lived...
  * So it's very unusual that somebody that is in this condition would have died
  * The other thing he said was that [Seth] was then given VIP status, which means that all the people that normally would rotate through there--the normal positions that would rotate through, and see on their normal rounds, were now sheltered away, corned away, and only the attending nurses and physicians could see him in the last few minutes
  * So they walled everyone off. There were law enforcement officers combing all over the hospital, blocking everyone off for access.
  * And so we don't know who the attending physician is. But if we can get to that fourth year surgery resident, go through this, get him on camera, video his interview--he's already out there--we're going to find out his name very quickly, and be able to find out who that attending physician was
  * We'll be able to get to the actual last minutes of Seth Rich

---
* [[Day 207.5. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 5 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldPIbCP_9So)
  * Okay. Day 207 This I think it's part six but if it's part Five I'll check it later
  * So here you can see across the Hudson River.
  * That's the area that John Rockefeller, I think, when he was up in Tarrytown, he gave that whole thing to the state of New Jersey
  * So that's why it was a beautiful view, and nothing over there
  * We're going to keep coming back to the Rockefellers, but right not right now
  * So the [Medical] code. This is the code situation.
  * I talked to a doctor with a lot of experience in the ER, went through the code situation.
  * Anytime a 27 year old would drop to a 0 pulse, the meters and are going to go off like mad.
  * They're going to call what they call a code or *code blue* people are going to come from everywhere.
  * They're going to have all the stuff they need to resuscitate that person.
  * There's a triage procedure. They call ABC--that's you're going to check the airway, you're going to see if the person is naturally breathing, and then you're also going to check their search of circulation. Do they have a pulse?
  * The next thing you're going to do is IV,  you're going to you're going to and all--I'm just repeating what a Physician just told me.
  * You're going to want to be able to push all different types of things into that person, if there's trouble, if there's any kind of situation with a heart like MI--or anything like that, or weird heart rhythms, push epinephrine, and then do the shock, push epinephrine and then do the shock.  All those sort of things.
  * ***That did not happen with Seth Rich.***
  * Now--I have two scenarios, two potential scenarios, one is the SEIU janitor
  * By that I'm not talking about people who work for SEIU, I'm saying people who have been embedded into SEIU {{ hitmen / assassins }}
  * There goes the Yonkers train right now so--where I am--Geolocates me
  * So you're going to want to be able to--if you have the SEIU janitor, and because of John Podesta's relationship with SEIU, that's the only reason I say that, and Hillary Clinton's a relationship
  * Where you can take these Arkansas convicts, like we've seen from the guys who go to the White House, I think it's Campbell--I can't remember his name--from the Veritas videos--that's scenario one
  * Scenario two is what I call the *disorderly orderly with the pillow* or the *SEIU janitor*
  * Scenario two is the *""whoops-I-did-it-again-nurse-anesthetist""* {{brittany shears}} who's on rotation, and just comes in, and pushes a whole bunch of potassium into the person's bloodstream, and that kills you pretty quick
  * So those are the two ways there's no trace to pushing potassium
  * So that's why I'm identifying, very specifically, what may have happened
  * And why that attending physician--remember that Seth Rich is walled off now into the VIP area
  * So the normal residents that are rotating through now cannot see him--only the attending physician and the nurses are able to see him
  * So the attending could have walked in there, and saw that he was dead.
  * Police officers were there, law enforcement was there, and they could have said uh-huh, we're not calling code.
  * We don't want any witnesses to this. This is a VIP for some reason.
  * That's what happened
  * Now Seth Rich's brother Aaron, has said he wants to get this data out to the public
  * So I'm trying to interview him
  * We're trying to set that up today for a Skype interview.
  * That's where we are so far this morning 
  
---
* [[Day 207.6. Hillary's Hackers Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 6 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDbl2SGLcTY)
  * Okay Day 207 here on Henry Hudson Parkway I think this is version 7 [6]
  * So there's this thing from voat, and different discussion boards about SEIU in the past
  * About Jennifer Palmieri and Robby Mook and John Podesta and and Hillary Clinton
  * I just want to let everybody know that's not where I'm getting my SEIU information from.
  * This is way before then. This is Andy Breitbart SEIU stuff
  * And I don't want to confuse the janitors on the Clinton team, with the people calling the shots--the Mafia dons that are calling the shots.
  * Podesta's calling the shots. He's Hillary's henchman. He's Hillary's kind of Walsingham to her--Elizabeth
  * [Robby] Mook and Jennifer Palmieri are literally the cleanup crew
  * I mean they are literally called in after the fact, to try to generate some alternate reality.
  * That's the job of PR they're PR people now
  * So is Anthony Weiner
  * Now I'm going to **MWW**, which is is [Weiner's] old PR firm right.  The only nickname I know it is *Mossad WorldWide*.
  * But you generate an alternate reality.
  * I mean if you want to generate a Flint water crisis, you have people stop putting orthophosphate in the water, and then all of a sudden you blame a bunch of state people, because it was under state control at one point,
  * Or whatever Crisis you want to generate, then you come in with the Mossad worldwide, and you and I don't even know maybe it's media worldwide--is the real name--I just noticed Mossad worldwide
  * So MWW is going to be important, because Anthony Weiner goes there for two months, with his laptop
  * Now hoops I did it again with the sinking all of the 650,000 emails could end up on Mossad Worldwide's server
  * Now the important part about that is Andrew McCabe never subpoenas MWW's servers
  * So we're going there now
  * It's a very short walking distance and going to collect the metadata again, between 254 Park Avenue and where where MW is on Park 
  
---
* [[Day 207.7 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens Part 7 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er8p12E93-o)
  * Okay. There is 304 Park.
  * You can see it's at the intersection of Park Avenue intersection of Park Avenue and 23rd
  * So MWW I thought it was Mossad Worldwide.
  * It's *Monster Worldwide*--it's just *affectionately* known as *Mossad Worldwide*. {{ An Ad-network posing as a jobsite }}
  * I don't see any cameras awfully close to a Verizon store.
  * There's a little hint for all my folks, that know what I'm talking about.
  * But that's MWW Anthony Weiner's firm--he only worked there two months.
  * But if I'm walking here, from the distance I'm walking here ,with my blackberry--if I have a laptop in that office, it's syncing up right now.
  * It's syncing up all 650,000 emails--are syncing up going to my laptop, up there, which is going to be connected to my server. Right?
  * So, everything I've collected on Huma's server is going to be I'm walking home now, I'm walking the way Anthony would have walked home, and walking down here on 22nd, we're going to come up to 254 Park 254 Park
  * What's famous about 254 Park? What's famous about 2:54 park?
  * Is Jason Goodman.  Jason Goodman of Crowdsource the news
  * Jason Goodman of Crowdsource the news is at 254 Park, as well as Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin.
  * I believe that's 254 Park.
  *  I can't quite see it, maybe I walked too far?
  * No that's 276. Let's keep going. Maybe down there? Maybe past 21st?
  * So everybody just look for cameras, look for stuff along the way here
  * I'm sorry I missed exactly where 254 was.
  * We'll keep walking might have some scaffolding coming up on the right, or left, excuse me, keep looking TD Waterhouse? No
  * Just a little walk in New York City today for your pleasure.
  * 254 there we go 254 Park Avenue South
  * So you saw how short a walk it was for Huma and Anthony to walk down there 2 MWW Mossad, erm, Monster Worldwide
  * And think all those emails all 650 pounds

---
* [[Day 207.8. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 8 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXpbBbXbi0g)
  * Okay. Day 207 part 8 I think.
  * I'm sure everybody has heard of what happened at Time Square , right now.
  {{[Driver ran into a bunch of people, threatened the police](http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/19/times-square-driver-once-threatened-to-kill-police-officers/), just like in London on 322}}
  * Yeah I was close, and my family was close there as well.
  * They're here in town as well as relatives.
  * It was behind me so I really don't have anything to say or any firsthand, and I just kept going to be honest I don't know anything about that.
  * I was going to say that on my earlier video today, if you Mossad worldwide, or I'm sorry Monster Worldwide, and then between that and Anthony Weiner's house, I stopped at a location called 466 276 excuse me 276 Park.
  * And I stopped there with a flag.
  * If you'll notice in the video, of the last video, and I said, ""is that where Anthony Weiner lives?"" because he goes in there quite a bit, or something to that effect.
  * And then I kept going down to 254 Park.
  * **The bonus for today.. it was going to be that's the Guatemalan embassy or Consulate.**
  * And that's where a lot of Mossad, ""focusing the truth"" through Guatemalan passports, and El Salvadorian passports--of course, this thing happened in Times Square.
  * Of course totally unrelated, but still kind of unsettling.
  * And I certainly don't want to be a causal agent, and hurt anyone, anyone getting hurt.
  * And I don't I think that would be a far cry to tie those two things together.
  * But I can't stop saying what actually is the system, because it's not going to get any better.

---
* [[Day 207.9. Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 9 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dA0HRew3jk)
  * Okay . Day 207 here in New York I'm on 26th Street
  * So the Seth Rich thing--if you put two and two together, you're going to find that Guccifer releases just one slice of how the DNC was organized.
  * And they were organized by a *quintiles*
  * Everybody's going to say what's a *quintile*?
  * It's when you divide your your donor base into fifths.
  * And fifths are five million to 25 million. 1 million to five million. One hundred thousand to a million, and then I think it's 50 thousand to a hundred thousand.  And then under 50 thousand--I can't remember what the spreadsheets are, but--they're going to be five. Five in a quintile.
  * And then you're going to have a master spreadsheet. So it's going to be six. Six spreadsheets.
  * You can have one of those for every county.
  * If you're Gavin McFadden, you're going to ask Seth Rich.
  * If Seth Rich is saying ""Hilary stole money from the Berniecrats and gave it to the ~~hillock rats~~Hillacrats, there's 80 ~~hillock rats~~ in the ~~you wan~~Awan network, and there's 120 ~~Bernie craps~~[sic, lol @YT-translation], Berniecrats,""
  * He's going to say, ""give me every county in the United States. Send me every county.""
  * And Seth Rich is going to say, ""well wait a minute--that's a not only a master spreadsheet, there's going to be six spreadsheets for each county. That's going to be 16, that's gonna be 17 thousand, seven hundred eight hundred attachments--that's going to be a lot of attachments, right?
  * And Gavin McFadden is going to say,""Seth I've done journalism a long time. You're going to be able to prove that each of these individual representatives that Hilary was supporting, was getting money from some other Berniecrat. We can't do that unless we have the detailed data.""
  * ""Seth: send ALL the spreadsheets.""

Ended up getting to know someone, she goes to Stanford doing computer engineering. She's graduating this year and has opportunities from past internships. They have like a job fair that comes to the school to recruit new graduates. 
Okay so I know there is no comparison between a private school like that and a CSU, but can people expect any type of recruiters to come to fresno state? Or whats the plan in our area after school? How are you guys doing and do you recommend it? 

Originally wanted to go to SJ state for opportunity, but what I want to know is;

Does San Jose have a much higher upgrade over Fresno State? Or is it similar because it's all still CSU. Does Fresno/ SJ state have recruiters come to the schools interviewing for their companies as well? 

I know Fresno State does not have a solo software engineering degree, instead it is integrated as a part of their computer engineering.

Also just a bit about me, I'm interested in lower level programming, wanting to learn more about kernels and OS for Android phones. Hoping to learn to get better at it,  develop roms. That is just what I'm into as of now,  I know it can change as you progress. So that's what im into but I'm open to advice or suggestions from anyone.
I've kept my eye on stuff at bitwise in general but so far I've seen things more along the lines of web browser related events."

(Corruption),[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6c5zbu/f4a_bring_your_kids_to_work_day_corruption/,"Your CEO has changed. She was cold, pretty heartless, but this week something has made her feel so much more warm and welcoming to her employees. She's had lunch with interns, and instead of them coming out with puffy eyes, they are smiling and thanking her for such an amazing time together! 

Something did change, and it's not what you think. At her house, an alien symbiote slithered into her bed and fucked her brains out, filling her pussy and ass with it's silver juices, infecting her and making her into the host of it's corruption. She tried to fight it, but the pleasure the silver brings simply overwhelms anyone it takes hold of, making them need to spread it to loved ones, no matter the age or the sex. 

The CEO has invited a mother and lovely son to the company the day before to help give a nice little test run of all the fun ""activities"" the kids will do. The mother has no idea her boss is about to turn her little boy into a slut, begging for silver cum and juices, but the mother will find out soon enough...

Activities include

Transformation, non-con, corruption, sounding, waterworks, squrting, lactating, futa, anal, pegging, bi play, pegging

No age limits, this is only the start of the story, there will be so much more to do once the trial is over and everyone brings in their lovely children to unknowingly taste the silver love! 

Send me a PM with one way you think the boy should be tested :)"

I make more than enough to pay everything, I just had no clue that she wasn't paying anything. I left the cash behind so that they could have money to spare while I went home to take care of some family problems (my sister died earlier in the year and my grandma just died a couple​ of months ago.) 

My other roommate's parents are telling me it's my problem. My girlfriend got an internship centered around my house being here, and my clients are on this side of the state. In fucking me over my friend has insured that I lose everything. 

This is the lowest point in my life, and it's happening because I don't get paid frequently enough. I make enough money to pay all the debt, even though it's not mine, I just can't do it fast enough. 

The worst part is, aside from losing $30k in annual IT contracts, that I'll probably have to go home to my parents house. They're the most entropic humans in existence, it's why I left when I was 17.

I was so close to having everything I ever wanted, I got to come home to the only family I've ever connected with, and it's all gone. "

6c6onh,8,2017-05-19,Venom in the MCU,Fett202,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6c6onh/venom_in_the_mcu/,"I've been thinking a lot lately about the best way to introduce Venom into the MCU and I think I've come up with a pretty solid way they could do it starting to get the ball rolling as soon as Infinity War. 

- During Infinity War Peter could get the black suit in a similar fashion he got it in Secret Wars. His suit is damaged and there's a machine that replicates clothing. But he mistakes another machine for the clothing replicator which would reveal the symbiote and attach itself to Peter

- Fast forward to the Spider-Man Homecoming sequel. Peter now has the black suit and slowly over the course of the film we start to see how it is changing him. He becomes more violent with how he deals with criminals. Not as friendly as he usually is to his friends.

- During this time we are introduced to Eddie Brock, which we could introduce similar to how they did in Spectacular Spider-Man, Eddie being a former Midtown high student and intern as ESU and already great friends with Peter so we can really see how their friendship falls apart. Feeling sympathy for Brock when his quality of life falls apart. By the end of the film when Peter finally ditches the symbiote, Eddies life will have been ruined and will hate Peter and blame him for all of what happened to him. As the church bells ring and the symbiote falls off Peter it will find Eddie who could be trying to steal Peters job at the bugle, explaining him being at the church. The last of Eddie that we see in the film would be in a post credits scene similar to venoms introduction in [Spider-Man TAS](https://youtu.be/q1R5IgSFmIw)

- Jump to the MCUs Spider-Man 3, Venom is the main villain of the film. I would base the story of the film off Venoms first major appearance in The Amazing Spiderman. Venom stalking Peter throughout the film and making his life a living hell. Then when Peter finally fights Venom things don't go his way and near defeat, end the film with Peter faking his death to fool Eddie as that would be the only way to stop Venom and  Eddie thinking he's bested Spider-Man retreats to the Caribbean islands. 

- Now we could have a Venom spin off movie that would put Eddie Brock in a ""good guy"" viewpoint of the film. I would focus the plot of the film on the Amazing Spider-Man Carnage storyline. Open the film with a line of gruesome murders by who we think is Venom. Spider-Man freaking out thinking this is Venom on a killing spree tried to trace these murders back to one event. He discovers that an old cell mate of Brocks, Cletus Kasady, was a serial killer and recently escaped from Ryker's island. Peter comes across Kasady who jumps to attack him reveal Carnage. After a battle that Peter nearly looses Carnage escapes. Realizing he can't defeat Carnage on his own he seeks out Brock, shifting the focus of the film to him now. After a brief fight with Venom Peter promises Venom his freedom if he helps stop Carnage. Venom agrees because Carnage is killing innocent people and goes with Peter back to New York. After tracking Carnage to a Heavy metal concert just like the comics. A giant fight ensues that trails into the subway. To add a twist to the film, Nearly defeated the Carnage symbiote jumps off Kasady and jumps to Peter taking him over and giving us Spider Carnage. Really putting Venom in the spotlight. Now a conflict in Eddies mind, does he kill both of his greatest enemies in the same place. Brock after taking control over the symbiote and destroying Carnage but sparing Peter. He leaves but promises to destroy Peter another day. Ending the movie there 

These are just my thoughts about how he could be introduced though, I really hope venom is introduced kinda like this one day. He and Carnage are some of my favorite Spider-Man villains and I've always wanted to see them done the right way "
6c6zdm,3,2017-05-19,[M4F] Care of Magical Creatures,Dr_JS,Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/6c6zdm/m4f_care_of_magical_creatures/,"*It was hard for Hagrid. Hogwarts had been the only home he'd known since his childhood. He had shed blood here, in battles and to the blast ended skrewts. He had made friends here. He had found family here.*

*However, with Professor McGonagall's retirement last year, the last familiar face was gone from the school. Flitwick, Trelawny, Vector, and Sprout had all moved on to other career opportunities or to the contented boredom of retirement.* 

*Plus, at 89 years old, he was no longer as spry as he once was. His bushy beard and wild mane of hair were as silver as Dumbledore's had been. His joints ached and his back was tight. He could no longer, single handedly, carry the 12 Christmas trees into the Great Hall. He could no longer remember the names of the Centaur foals or keep track of his teaching duties. It was time to retire.* 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had some large shoes to fill, both figuratively and otherwise, taking over duties for Hagrid. He had been the grounds keeper for longer than many could remember and a very capable Care of Magical Creatures teacher to boot. He was my favorite teacher during my time at Hogwarts and, if I allow myself a hint of immodesty, I believe I was one of his favorite students. Not to take away from the famed witches and wizards that he knew. But, I think he saw a bit of himself in me. Most wizards, after all, are an indoor lot. They relish their libraries, their bubbling cauldrons, and dark lairs of contemplation. Hagrid and I were of a different sort. 

Growing up, I relished the woods behind my home. Hiking. Swimming. Climbing. Running. Searching every nook and cranny, aching to soak up each droplet of sunlight and understand every square inch of my small kingdom. I had an affinity for animals, even then. They found me, ran with me, played with me, and protected me. I didn't know it, then, for what it was... Magic. 

Muggle born and unsure what to think when I received my letter, I arrived at Hogwarts and, unlike my classmates, felt drawn not to the Castle with all of its glittering candles and translucent ghosts but to the forest and the lake... I could hear them, calling me. Their voices were so much more complex than the ones I had heard growing up. The animals behind my house were toddlers and these creatures were speaking. I could hear the unicorns, the squid, even the acromantula. None of this even came close to my elation at meeting the Centaur or the Merpeople. 

I was sorted into Ravenclaw and thrived in all my subjects, though Care of Magical Creatures was my speciality. I earned 7 OWLs and 5 NEWTs (Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Herbology, and, of course, Care of Magical Creatures). Yet, I didn't spend my free time studying in the Library. Instead, every spare moment would find me running through the grounds, climbing in the forest, swimming with the giant squid, or visiting with Hagrid. 

He took an interest in me. Tutored me. Fostered my love for all creatures, the magical and the mundane. When I graduated, he even contacted a close friend of his, Charlie Weasley, and got me a summer internship studying Dragons in Romania.

After graduation, I spent the next 5 years following in the footsteps of the great Newt Scamander. I explored the wilds of the world, cataloging and updating many of his entries in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" and trying to make my own mark on Magizoology. 

I was in Greece, studying the mating and nesting habits of Griffons, when I received Hagrid's letter. He told me of his plans to retire and that he had suggested my name to the new Headmaster as his replacement. He asked if I would be interested. I dropped everything. Like Hagrid, my time at Hogwarts was the happiest of my life and being a teacher there had always been my dream. Once more, the old game's keeper was looking out for me. 

And, so, a new adventure begins... The sun glinting bright off the windows of the castle and the surface of the lake, I stand, awaiting the arrival of my very first class. So much to learn, so little time.

6c7eo5,6,2017-05-19,"Rising 2L in need of some advice regarding job options and opportunities, any and all input/opinion is appreciated",TwinTotals,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/6c7eo5/rising_2l_in_need_of_some_advice_regarding_job/,"Long post, please accept my apologies. I would love the input of anybody who is willing to read this, though. I am completely torn right now regarding an important decision regarding my 1L summer employment situation. Like the title says, I am a rising 2L and as of right now I have been stressing quite a bit because I still haven't been able to secure a summer job. Today, however, two important developments occurred;

1) I had a lunch meeting with one of the founding attorneys of a prominent litigation firm in my city. This particular firm initially had both of their summer intern slots filled, but one of the interns received a grant of some sort and is now deferring his employment until next year. The meeting went extremely well, and the attorney said he really likes me and requested that I send him a copy of my resume and a cover letter by Monday. He also said that he will tell the hiring managers in his firm that he will make a strong effort to get me in the open position. This firm specializes in a number of fields which are each perfectly aligned with my interests. As such, this is the position that I would ideally be able to take.

The sense I got from the meeting was that there is a very good chance at getting ~~an interview~~ the position, especially considering one of the founding names is backing my application. This would be a paid internship. The senior partner told me that he wants to have the position filled in the next two weeks, and he hopes that I will be able to take it.

2) A couple days ago (in a move of relative desperation) I had applied for an *externship* with the legal branch of a marketing technology company. The job listing was last-minute, as was my application (I applied about 90 minutes after the listing was posted). The listed duties seem interesting to me, but are not **nearly** as attractive as those with the other, more prominent firm. The main problem that I have with this is the externship part, as I was not considering doing one until very, very, **very** recently (as in the last 72 hours), and I would obviously prefer to generate some kind of income. This company called me today, about 4 hours after my meeting with the attorney from development #1, saying that they were eager to hire me, but they did give me the option of taking a few days to think things over. The hiring manager told me he would prefer an answer by Monday midday, but that Tuesday morning would be fine if necessary.

**My question is this: What should I do?** I would be happy to find a chance to get some sort of work experience, and my very distant second option has contacted me asking for a ""yes/no"" response regarding an unpaid externship by Monday, while paid employment with my absolute first preference isn't a sure thing, but is at least highly likely and comes with the endorsement of one of the firm's founders.

I am feeling completely overwhelmed with the decision. I *really* **really** want to work for the prominent firm, not only because they are full of incredible names for references, but also because the pace and variety of clientele there is a spitting image of what I hope to be working with in a few years' time. As of 1pm today I was completely ok with waiting the 1-2 weeks it would take to get an answer, but now I'm being asked to make a decision in 3 days by my more distant second option.

Has anybody else been in a position like this? What are the things I should be weighing, and how ought I to be weighing them? Realistically I would be happy with either option, but my research into the background of each company has shown me that the first firm is much more deeply-rooted in my city's legal community, as it has been around for more than 30 years. The other company is a startup.

**tl;dr**: Rising 2L, yet to find a job, really want a job. Had incredible meeting with founding partner of prominent law firm specializing in the practices which line up with my interests. Strong possibility of paid employment in 1-2 weeks' time with personal endorsement of said partner. Received phone call hours later from second company whose application was last-minute and is not very aligned with my interests, but is asking for a ""yes/no"" answer to employment offer by Tuesday morning at the latest. Second company's position is an unpaid externship. I have a strong, **strong** personal preference for the first, larger firm, but am at a complete loss as to what I should do.

Edit 1: Wording

Edit 2: Got a call from Firm #1. Got the job with Firm #1! Thank you to everyone who offered input whether it was via comment or message. Summer is looking up!"

Vaccarello seems to be finding his groove this time around, the last menswear collection felt like the interns were just extending Hedi's B-list. I'm liking the continuation of Hedi's exploration of the 60s-70s with Vaccarello's 80s downtown NYC/Miami vibes and a bit of 90s indie sneaking in (the album cover shirt and the Radiohead pin).

Don't like that the jeans have external branding now (""Saint Laurent"" in the marker-pen logotype on the coin pocket).

New teddy colorways (khaki and grey) for our Chinese friends to find new ways to fuck up when copying.

6c8dat,4,2017-05-19,Letting the boss know,UMASSCollege,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/6c8dat/letting_the_boss_know/,"Mercy was sitting at a table by herself in the cafeteria when I found her. She was partly surrounded by a bunch of papers that were laid out in a half circle in front of her. A partially eaten sandwich and a handful of strawberries were on a plate on the outside of the spread. 

I set my own tray down on the table across from her, careful not to cover her papers. Mercy looked up as I sat down, setting down a document she held in her hands. “Hey Kim.”

“Hey Merc, I thought you were past the overwhelming paperwork stage of running UMass.”

“I thought so too, but I leave for a week to take care of business and suddenly everything breaks down and people think I need to review their every action.”

“What broke?” I asked as I picked through my sandwich to try and determine what meat they were trying to feed people today. It looked vaguely like roast beef, but I couldn’t be sure. 

“X-Ray 3. The beast down near the pediatric wing.” She saw me eyeing my sandwich, and added her thoughts. “I think it’s roast beef. I brought my own, it’s chicken if you want to finish it.” Mercy gestured over to the half eaten sandwich on her plate. 

“Thanks, but I think I’ll just have this today, it’s not so bad if you don’t look at it.” I said as I took a drink of my tea. “And I know the machine, it was old anyway. It was just a matter of time, how’re you going to fix it?”

“There’s a technician with an outstanding bill of quite a bit. His wife needed twins delivered by C-Section I believe, and there were some other complications. I was going to contact him and see if he would be willing to fix the machine and in exchange we’d consider his bill paid.”

I nodded, it wasn’t the first time we had done done something along those lines. People could do work in exchange for having their bills written off, most jumped at the chance if they were offered. “I bet he’ll do it, or he’ll at least look at it. What else are you working on?”

“Kendra is running the clinic up in Maine. I get that it’s the first time she’s on her own, but she feels the need to run every decision by me. I’ve finally told her that unless it’s an emergency she can’t contact me, she’ll have to ask someone else for help.” Mercy grabbed a strawberry and bit into it, flipping a paper over. “She was freaking out because she’ll be short staffed for the next three weeks because a few nurses have taken medical leave. I told her she should know how to handle that- all she has to do is ask Dr. Hawley in staffing for a few people to cover.”

“Awww, the baby has left the nest and is struggling to fly.” I teased as I reached out for a strawberry. “But seriously, she can handle it, I bet the political scene just has she spooked a bit.” 

She smacked my hand before grabbing her plate and moving it out of my reach. “Get your own.”

I pulled my hand away, rubbing it. “Watch out, these hands are worth a few million dollars.”

“If they’re worth that much you can afford to buy your own strawberries.” She said in reply as she picked up a paper from a stack. “Kendra needs to learn to stay calm in times like this, we can’t afford to freak out. Coddling her won’t help that.”

“If you paid me anything decent I could. And Kendra will, I bet the poor girl is just stressed out. You should send Seth over to visit her, I bet she’d appreciate being able to see him.” I bit into my own sandwich as I waited for her reply. 

“Maybe I will. I’d have to find a reason to send him in order for the hospital to pay for the trip.” She went quiet, eating another strawberry as she read a paper. “I guess I could talk to Dr. Hawley, see if he couldn’t be sent over to help cover those nurses on medical leave. He’d have to be okay with it though.”

“Do it.” I washed the taste of the mystery meat out of my mouth with a chaser of tea. “Anyway, that’s kinda sorta related to why I sought you out, so I might as well jump into it.” I set my mug of tea down, and Mercy set the paper down, looking at me. “Y’know reddit? Well, someone cracked the password on the old UMass account I made, and had been passing that information around to some various people, who have been posting on it.”

Mercy closed her eyes, taking a breath. I continued so she could get the full story before talking to me. “Well I know one poster is Dawson, and I’m pretty sure that Mya Lynn posted as well. But that’s not the big thing, someone… Someone from your biochem class overheard your conversation with Garrett and posted that… I felt like you should know.”

With that she snapped her eyes open, staring into my soul. I couldn’t handle that stare, I knew the anger wasn’t directed at me… But it still had me wanting to run. Mercy had a wicked temper that she was normally very good at controlling. God help whoever actually posted it should she find out. 

“I should have shut down that account after it was first created. I thought I was done dealing with the reddit drama.” She spat.

“Well Merc, there’s nothing you can do now. I don’t know if you can track down who it was.”

“I probably can’t…” She rubbed her temples, her anger quickly turning to more stress. “I can’t forbid them from posting either.”

Before I could open my mouth to reply she was already voicing the solution that made the most sense to her. “People are going to think I’ll let him be killed. I have to make a statement about it. That’s all I can do.” She swept her papers together into a giant stack, picking it up and tapping them down together. 

She pushed her plate with the strawberries over to me, which was unusual, she loved strawberries. “I have stuff to do, and now this to worry about. If you need me, I’ll be in my office.” She told me as she stood up, moving towards the exit of the cafeteria. 

I saw how a group of interns watched her as she left. Their eyes opened wide with awe, one kid even let his mouth hang open as she passed by their table. They had been staring at her since I had sat down next to her. Mercy had grown to celebrity status, or more, legendary, mythical, whatever you want to call it- people adored her. She had made UMass the best place to be in the Federation. Not only that, but she’s taken UMass to a whole new level, expanding our reach and upgrading our equipment as much as she feasibly can. 

The rumors circulating around had reached my ears, that the waitlist to get into UMass college was over a year long, or that to get a job was pretty much impossible, but it meant life to some people. UMass has the least amount of Federal control in the entire territory. Mercy has free reins for the most part, there’s a few obligations we have to fill concerning help for the military and what not, but other than that we’re on our own. We’ve even hired our own private guard staff so there’s not that many Federal troops on our campus or in our buildings. Things are run on our own terms. And people love Mercy for giving us that.

Posted on May 17, 2017

[Link](https://mainerepublicemailalert.com/2017/05/17/breaking-monica-lewinski-comes-out-of-nowhere-with-the-bombshell-scandal-of-the-century/)

She claims Bill Clinton Failed his financial responsibility to their now 28-year-old son…

The intern with the blue dress who showed the world that Bill Clinton had the ability to look America dead in the eye and lie through his teeth is back in the spotlight with a bombshell that will turn the Clintons’ world upside down. In a lawsuit filed in the 14th district court, Monica Lewinski is suing Bill Clinton for breach of contract for not fulfilling his fiscal obligations…to their now 28-year-old son!

 If you remember, after the impeachment hearings, Monica Lewinski disappeared from public life for nearly five years. When she reappeared, it was on a very small scale and often she was depicted with her young nephew on family outings. Well, according to this new case, that child is actually the product of the affair between Lewinski and the former president, kept hidden with confidentiality agreements and a massive amount of cash.
The cash has, apparently, dried up as Monica’s son, David, who knows who his father is and is ready to face him down after a life without one, finished college and has moved into the private sector for employment. The suit alleges that the payments, under contract, would continue to Lewinski for her silence until 20 years after Bill Clinton’s death and that her son, as an adult, would be bound by the same gag order.

The suit says:

“David has never met his father nor does he want to. The plaintiffs would have been satisfied to have never told anyone had the Clintons maintained their fiduciary responsibilities under their legally binding contract.”

Lewinski and her son are seeking a lump sum of $40 million to cover the remainder of the contract’s earning potential. They have also honored their side of the deal and not said anything publicly, gone to the press or made any kind of comment. The court filing is the only mention. The liberal media is, of course, ignoring the story like it never happened."

I got a conditional from UCL for MEng in CS. 
This question is for all the current undergrad students enrolled in the CS program: How is the program at UCL? What are the internship opportunities? How recognised is this program around the globe? And what future prospects do we have after doing the masters?

It's been exactly a year since we last had the beefy crunch. On my way to my summer internship last year I remember picking up 10 bcbs because I didn't want to go grocery shopping the first day. I hope they come back soon, I miss them dearly 😥

That being said, I feel like this means they have to bring the bcb or the volcano menu back soon. I'm hopeful 💩
What are your thoughts??? Will it be back soon?"
6cb8tw,1,2017-05-20,I [19 M] think that girl [22 F] I just met might be interested in me but she's in a relationship and I'm not sure what she is doing,throwaway09409,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cb8tw/i_19_m_think_that_girl_22_f_i_just_met_might_be/,"This week was my first week at an internship and I'm staying at this intern housing far from work that not many interns chose to live at. Anyway, on the first day, Monday, after work, I Ubered back to my housing and was walking down the hall when I was randomly approached by her (22F). She said ""Hi"" and asked where I worked and what department I worked in etc., all the time smiling and somewhat happy to talk to me. I mentioned I didn't have a ride to and from work and she said she could take me every day.

The next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday) on the car rides, I felt like she was interested in me. She was laughing and giggling at a lot of the stuff I was saying, she was running and caressing her fingers through her hair often and brushing it back, she invited me to eat lunch with her and also get dinner with her (For lunch, I was gonna eat with her but I ate lunch with someone else instead, so she just walked over to me at the end of lunch to say Hi, then leave. Dinner that day I was gonna have with my roommate). She also mentioned multiple times how she felt really lonely not having a roommate, but she also said she was thinking about moving out (the housing we both live in is pretty bad). Then during the middle of our conversation one day, she mentioned her boyfriend once, despite being all giggly and wanting to talk to me. The same thing happened on the ride back, she was laughing at something I said that wasn't remotely funny and said her boyfriend is the same. 

Those two ""My boyfriend"" drops kinda shifted how I viewed her, since I thought she was interested, and now I'm a bit confused. Everything seemed like displaying interest: Being approached, constantly giggling, the hair flipping, her saying she's alone multiple times, asking to eat lunch and dinner with her. Even when random BS happened to her or when she forgot something, she would just giggle at it. I thought maybe she was just a friendly person, but she seems like she doesn't have her shit together enough to do these things for someone else. The few car rides I rode with her was enough for me to learn she's a mess.

The last two days of the week, she was very quiet and I don't know why. I would drop questions or make comments but she would just give me shorter answers with no laughs or ask me questions back. She said she was tired but while eating lunch with her one day, she was pretty closed off to me but a bit more open to the other person she was sitting with, but even with the other person, it didn't resemble the ""interest"" she showed me in the rides. Yet, she would still offer to give me rides, and one day after work, she was willing to drive an hour after work to take me to the dance studio I wanted to be (at first, she said it was too far, but decided she said she would like to drive me there). I said there was a closer one (which is 10 miles one way from where we live, but starts two hours later, so I would have to call her up again when its about time) and she said she wouldn't mind taking me there. I talked to someone about this and he said it was really nice of her to go out of her way to take me places very far away just for me, which seems a bit weird despite her seemingly giving me a cold shoulder. Like now, I'm just confused what's up with her.

On Friday on the way back, I told her that I found another ride who was willing to take me to and from work, since she said she was going to move out Saturday, then she said all of a sudden, that she wasn't going to move out because she said its too much work and that she's too lazy for some reason. She said she was quiet the whole time because she was thinking about moving out the whole two days (I don't believe this for some reason, since she seemed to be more open to others but not to me). I insisted a lot, but a little jokingly, she should move out, since she was always trash-talking about the housing and feeling lonely there. I told her if she wasn't going to move out, that she could still give me rides ""if she wanted to"" and then that was the end of that. She didn't mention anything and now that leads to the present day of me writing this giant story.

I will admit I'm really bad with women and cannot understand them for my life, but I feel like she was maybe using me for interest this whole time. She was more ""bubbly"" around me for the first two days but a lot reserved the next two, and she's ""neutral"" with other people she meets from what I've seen. She has a boyfriend (long distance rn since we're both in new cities), who I've seen her text a little bit while I was with her, yet I felt like she's dropping subtle hints at me. It's completely possible that everything she threw at me was strictly platonic and literal and she's just wanted a friend. Can anyone help me understand what she wants from me? I'm definitely over-analyzing everything about the relationship  but I can't draw any solid conclusions. I won't lie that I'm somewhat interested in her and that I think she's cute, but I don't know what's gonna happen.'

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: Girl approached me one day and seems to be dropping lots of hints that she's interested in me, but mentioned she had a boyfriend. She went from being outgoing around me the first two days to giving me the cold shoulder the next two, yet she's willing to drive long distances for me. I can't understand what she wants or what the kind of relationship is between us."

These are brief I know.
For a fantasy idea, I'm thinking Dragon warriors who are trained to bodyguard princesses and make use of trained dragons to travel between the kingdoms.
I want to play a business setting where you would be playing an intern, do I use my position to manipulate, are you just very willing how much you're willing to do for a full time placement. Business, suits, semi public, risk of being caught, cheating, etc.

The friends little sister, fresh high school graduate looking at colleges, why not save a couple of dollars and stay with your older brothers friend. Can alter this in lots of ways, did you always have a crush on me, are you manipulated with drugs/alcohol, or had you just not realised what a slut you are.

This one is an idea I've had for a while and never got to play out fully. You would play the store clerk in my wifes small lingerie boutique, with her being off work for over a week sick, I come in one afternoon to help with organizing a new order, possibly offering a new job opportunity.

One last idea is that I would own a small mountain retreat, a place where people go to get away from the hussle and bussle and unwind. Forest trails, clean rivers, multitudes of waterfalls, a lake, and natural thermal springs. For this you could play a guest, a college student working a summer job, or one idea that I particularly like, a model doing a photoshoot at the retreat.

Hope some here strikes your interest remember these are all up for discussion and alteration. 
Basic ideas, plenty more available, and happy to hear yours.

I'm kind of vanilla, in the sense that I'm not going to force you (manipulate or coerce possibly, still a willing partner is preferred.) I don't want either of us to piss of shit on each other, I don't really want to tie you up and suspend you for days, may pin your head above your hands/lightly bind them to a headboard, I don't want you to be my sister/mom/aunt, my dads new wife or daughter though is fine. Pretty much everything else is open for discussion.
Edit extra, I do prefer decent sized messages, 2-3 sentences minimum, details, and an ability to remember those details, I lose a connection to the story when you go from a skirt to a dress to yoga pants in the space of six posts."

Na een zeer lange interne discussie hebben de coalitiepartners VVD en D66 vandaag in een gezamenlijk statement het vertrouwen opgezegd in Kabinet-MrJoey98 I.  

Er heerste al langere tijd intern veel onrust binnen het kabinet, en anonieme bronnen van beide partijen melden dat er al eerder gesprekken tussen beide partijen waren geweest om de samenwerking met coalitiepartner GROEN te beëindigen, dit vanwege de heersende onvrede over de lakse houding van hun coalitiepartner en de premier, maar dat dit keer op keer op het laatste moment was afgewenteld.   

De spreekwoordelijke druppel die de emmer uiteindelijk deed overlopen was het feit dat D66, door een ledentekort en het opstappen van meerdere ministers en Kamerleden, niet langer de mankracht had om hun Kamerzetels te vullen, en ondanks meerdere pogingen om dit probleem op te lossen moest de partij concluderen dat het voor de stabiliteit van het land niet gewenst was om dit al wankele en verdeelde kabinet met een té krappe en instabiele meerderheid op te zadelen.  

Partijleiders /u/alpha_c en /u/quintionus van VVD en D66 respectievelijk gaven in een gezamenlijk statement aan dat het in het landsbelang is dat er snel nieuwe verkiezingen worden gehouden zodat er een sterke en stabiele regering gevormd kan worden die het landsbelang kan dienen.

The Ripple(XRP) Effect - Fundamental Analysis:
lennartbedrage44 in cryptocurrency
ripple.jpg

Lately, there’s been a tremendous amount of buzz around Ripple(XRP), but is it only because of the massive growth we’ve seen in the past few 30 days, or is there something more?

In this article, I’ll dive into a brief back ground of Ripple, objectively examine the arguments for and against it, explore its potential from a economic standpoint, then close with potential threats to your investment and a summary.


Meet Ripple(XRP)-

Released in 2012, Ripple aims to enable “secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks” through their real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) and currency exchange and remittance network. Ripples distributed open-source internet protocol consensus ledger was created as basic technology for interbank and regulated financial institutions to integrate Ripple into their own systems. This differs from the Bitcoin full node and other crowdsourced altcoin consensus networks in several ways:

Ripples common shared ledger is a network of independent validating servers which compare their transaction records, rather than the full network of nodes coming to consensus prior to each transaction, enabling faster transaction speeds.
Although their protocol is open source, it was not created as a plug &amp; play solution, like bitcoins full-node software, nor does it rely on crowd-sourced support.
Unlike Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and other Alt-coins, Ripple is recognized as legal tender by several governments, which gives it instant liquidity via financial institution, as well as purchasing power over material goods. Because of this, it cannot be evaluated in the same ways as other coins, which are largely evaluated based on assumptions &amp; speculation.
In terms of value, it’s more like cash than a commodity. Because of this, it is evaluated in a much different way than Ethereum(ETH) and other alt-coins with intrinsic value, but is accepted much more rapidly because it’s easy for the mass-market to understand. Remember: without market acceptance, there is not value, regardless of how innovative something may be.

Just 4 short years after its release, on 01MAY17, Ripple announced that a consortium of 47 banks have successfully completed a pilot implementation of Ripple in Japan, making it the first country in the world to enable domestic and international real time money transfers via the cryptocurrency. This event lead the XRP value to sky-rocket from $0.051580 USD to an all-time high of $0.430085 in just 16 days… but why? Is it 100% speculation, or is there something else going on here?

“It’s not a real cryptocurrency!”
Or is it? Well, those whom bring this argument to the table are probably referencing facts that I’ve mention during my introduction to Ripple: Its a centralized and regulated crypto-currency which does not need global consensus for transfers, and it is built specifically for (and potentially by) financial institutions. Though a lot of the Anarcho-Capitalists may want to steer clear of this one due to its highly regulated nature, regular capitalist may believe these core differences to be its greatest strengths:

Regulated - As I mentioned in my analysis on Ethereum(ETH), Bitcoin’s lack of regulation was likely he reason (or at least, that’s what they told us) that the proposed ETF failed to pass the SEC’s evaluation several months ago. If adhering to some sort of trusted regulatory standards, this could drive federal confidence, which in turn drive bank and lending institution faith…trickling all the way down to the consumers. This insures rapid mass market acceptance.
Consensus - As mentioned before this is much different process than Bitcoin’s global consensus, which means that transaction times are nearly instant regardless of volume transferred. Additionally, all transfers adhere to distributive ledgers DLT standards, which is a requirement for many financial institutions to be insurable.
Institutional Management - You’ve probably guessed this one already. Although the demand and speculative value is driven at some capacity by ‘the people’, this currency is about as close to the World bank and SWIFT as you can get. This is largely due to the amount
Deliberate - It feels like a big bank, because it is. Ripple was built specifically for the financial markets, which is why they specifically targeted regulatory compliance.

Economic Value
As mentioned in the last point, Its easy to see that Ripple offers tremendous value to financial-institutions and retail investors. These two groups make up 358 billion (numbers from 2013) non-cash cross-country annual transactions, and the FOREX market which sees more than $5.1 trillion $USD each day. Per a report released by Capgemini and The Royal Bank of Scotland, this is growing at an average rate of about 7.5% each year globally, though China and other Emerging Asian economies have been leading the charge at around 21%.

Seems like a lot, right? Well, for sake of uncovering the immediate value of XRP, we will zoom into the recent adopters of the distributed ledger technology: Japan, India, and the Central Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa(CEMEA) regions.

Japan.jpg

Japan is the third largest economy in the world by nominal GDP ($6.11 trillion), fourth by purchasing power parity(PPP) and second largest developed economy. Currently, their GDP per capita is roughly $48,412 (vs $56,430 in US) and their major trade partners include the US, China, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea.

Japan GDP.png

Aside from the speculation that they maybe soon pressure their trade partners (excluding the US and China) to adopt a system which allows for instant, near free transfers of funds, here’s where it gets interesting for the immediate future: Japan has already started accepting Ripple(XRP) as legal tender. If Ripple raises to just 25% of the overall transaction volume of P2P, P2B &amp; B2B within Japan itself (represented in the chart by Other Services, Real Estate, Retail, Transport, Communications, Finance &amp; Utilities) which is equal to about 20% of their overall economy, Ripple would be handling roughly $1.27 trillion USD in Japan – alone - every year. To put that in perspective, the current (at the time of writing) market capitalization of Bitcoin(BTC) is $30.7 billion USD (or &gt;0.4%). Unlike Bitcoin, Ripple is legal tender which means that it can be exchanged for material goods and services, which means that it’s likely to have explosive acceptance in the local area.

India.jpg

India-based Axis Bank announced in April that they will soon begin leveraging distributed ledger tech for cross-border transactions and to make banking simple and convenient for their customers. About 15 days’ prior, another large financial institution, Yes Bank, also announced that they would be adopting Ripples ledger for the same reasons. If Ripple continues to grow in acceptance at this rate in India, we could see another economy, roughly 1/3 the size of Japan’s ($2.074 trillion USD) add to Ripples annual transaction value. Now, from an economic stand point, this is most interesting because agriculture represents more than 50% of India’s employment, which means that India would be the 2nd case of consumer trading Ripple for staple foods.

India GDP.png

It is likely that Ripple will not handle as large of a percentage of overall transaction volumes in India because only two major banks have adopted this currency and it is not the only Crypto. The latter is probably one of the most important variables, as this means that Ripple will be duking it out for market dominancy. As all of my projections are fairly conservative, I would estimate that Ripple will handle roughly 10% of India’s over all transaction volume in the next 365 days, equal to roughly $311.1 billion USD.

One last thing that I would like to mention is that India is literally the ‘I’ in BRIC and roughly 13% of the BRIC countries total output. If the BRIC comes to fruition, India may be able to convince it’s other close trade partners to jump on the XRP-Train as well.

Dubai.jpg

Abu Dhabi Bank, the National and largest bank of the UAE, has already begun offering cross-border transaction services with Ripples distributive ledger technology as well. As they deal extensively with their middle eastern neighbors, such as Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, the UAE is likely to set a trend for other CEMEA countries to follow.

UAE GDP.png

This might be a surprise to some people, but Dubai’s largest industry is the energy sector (shocker!) followed closely by Real Estate and their Finance industry (double shocker!). Although their GPD is much smaller than Japan and India’s (about $370 billion USD), I am anticipating Ripple to handle a larger percent of the UAE’s transaction volume (31.11%), especially in the finance, Real Estate, Retail and Logistics industries. This is due largely to the fact that their population is only roughly 9.157 million, but most Abu Dhabi nationals are very financially inclined (or at least heavy spenders).

Potential Threats
As this threatens SWIFT (unless they are completely on board) and the US dollars’ supremacy in the economic &amp; financial markets, I would not be surprised to see a false flag attack, in which the NSA attacks Ripple and blames it on North Korea or China. Frankly, this would be a cake walk compared to Stuxnet or WannaCry and they could probably hand the task to an MIT intern. Where semi-centralization is Ripples strength in terms of transaction speed and regulation, it is also the biggest security flaw and may open it’s user to some heart ache, hair loss and heavy drinking over the next several years.

Possibility
So, what is possible in terms of value over the next few years? Well, if we consider the following scenario:

XRP accounts for roughly 20% of Japan, India full GDP, but 31.1% UAE’s GDP ($7.152 Trillion USD) total exchange volume in the next 2 years
Max XRP Supply stays at 100 billion
No other countries adopt XRP (not likely)
No hacks or other catastrophic events remove confidence
Exclude speculation, demand, rallies, and GDP growth projections for each country
Then we’re looking at each Ripple(XRP) market capitalization over ~$1.75 Trillion USD, making each coin $17.52 in real value. This means that if you were to invest today at $0.362794, your ROI would be about 4,989%. That said, I think that it’s likely it will go over $30 in the next 2 years, due to speculators flooding the markets and other countries signing up. Again, these are conservative numbers are based on total transaction value in USD equivalent.

For those whom subscribe, I will update as new variables are available to my appraisal

Bottom Line
Although it was most definitely created by an insider of the banking industry and does not ‘feel like a crypto’, I personally feel that due to its rapid market acceptance, liquidity and position as legal tender in 3 large economies, Ripple(XRP) is both primed for explosive growth in the near future and likely to be one of the safest value based Crypto-investments we can make today.

Another thing, China is the anchor of the West Pacific, so we should all watch their evaluation of Ripple, very closely. If they were to jump on the XRP-Train, you are likely to see Australia, South Korea, Indonesia and Singapore do the same.

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood floor.

I see people hunker down, doing their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new group of interns was arriving later that day.

___________________________________________________

Put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Who you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous standards I construct for the annual review? My secretary, tired of being thrown the most menial tasks? A young intern who I try to seduce using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me?

Or maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be the head of a larger company, looking to take over another smaller one - and add another slut to her harem. Or a reporter who turns up dirt on the company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anybody else you want to be! Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well!

My ultimate fate is up to you - will I be your personal slave, obeying your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut - spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and humiliated in public settings and verbally abused.

Bondage, foot worship, petplay, and forced tattooing/piercing/branding are all things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. Futa is okay.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!

6cdezc,63,2017-05-20,Finally secured an EL position! Here's some advice for everyone that can't find a job,jordanpitt269,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6cdezc/finally_secured_an_el_position_heres_some_advice/,"I am bragging a little bit but mostly I want to inspire confidence in the entry level job seekers in similar situations. My situation:

-3 exams, all after graduating
-2.97 GPA
-0 internships
-an entry level processing job at an investment bank for 6 months that could not be less relevant to actuarial
-I'm not very outgoing, really thought interviews would be my downfall
-out of school for 2.5 years, the first two years spent delivering pizza

What helped:

-the bank job. Having any professional experience at all is really easy to sell in an interview. Any office job can be talked up in terms of transferable skills, working with a team, using computer programs, etc

-passing 3 exams over 14 months

- The Infinite Actuary technical skills course. Can not stress this enough. It's been brought up by all of my interviewers and even though most of the course is introductory (except Excel stuff goes over a lot of functions), I was at least able to say it gave me comfortability working with large data sets, basic concepts for programming in SQL and VBA

-being specific about skills on my resume. I mentioned specific projects I worked on in school and in my own time but I wasn't too specific. It helps to give just enough detail to intrigue the person reading it. Then elaborate in the interview

-basic ratemaking book on the CAS website and other actuarial literature. The job I landed is in P&amp;C and before my interview I read the majority of Werner and Modlin's book. At my interview I brought up the fact my daily fantasy sports spreadsheets used similar concepts to underwriting principles and using rating variables. The more you know about the job you're applying for, the more talking points you have to make a better impression

-if you don't already have some technical skills get some. Hopefully most people on here have used some sort of stats package or matlab or sql in college. Mention these on your resume. Again be specific but be able to elaborate. If you have no experience with anything there are so many online resources for Excel, Access, SQL, SAS has a free version, R is probably the most powerful open source tool for analysis with tons of free packages.

I was at a point where I thought I would never get a job. After 3 exams I wasn't getting any call backs. 3 months into my bank job I was getting call backs nearly every week. I still felt like I could never compete with students that have 3+ exams and internships and good grades. I believe now that if I can get in so can anyone else but it's definitely a lot of work. In college I was naive thinking I would have no trouble because I had a false sense of the size of the EL market and demand for jobs. I had a huge reality check over the past couple years but I persisted and now it's paying off. Better late than never, but I can't wait to finally begin my career, right before I turn 25.

I also want to thank this sub for critiquing my resume several times and for all the advice I read here on a daily basis

6cerey,2,2017-05-21,Why can't this just be over?,030417,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/6cerey/why_cant_this_just_be_over/,"This is going to become a rambling novel of a post, but hopefully I'll keep it coherent.

I've been intending to quit tomorrow, just about every day, for the last 3 years. I don't know how many times I've told myself ""after this bag"" ... ""this is the last time for sure, dumping the rest"" ... ""there's no way I'll smoke once the semester starts, or during my internship, or once this next semester starts, etc."" I make myself believe 100% without a doubt in my mind, that I'll be sober tomorrow. Then I wake up, panic, figure out how to get weed and quit tomorrow or in a couple of days. Repeat for 3 years.

On top of that, I've been able to hide smoking from my girlfriend. I've lived with her for 3 years and lied to her about smoking the entire time. This is even while I'm smoking an eighth every 1-2 days. We're both insanely busy, with predictable schedules, and I'm very good at lying and hiding it. Nobody knows I smoke other than a select few people. The amount of guilt, shame, and depression I feel from lying to my girlfriend kills me... but I always rationalize it as ""well you already smoked once and lied about it, that you might as well smoke today since you're gonna quit anyway tomorrow."" This somehow makes me think that I'm actually being a good partner. Like ""wow, look at what a nice guy I am, I'm not going to lie to my girlfriend and smoke weed behind her back tomorrow.""

So I live with her, and am always high. I'm always in a constant state of fear that she knows I'm high, or that she can tell I tried to cover up my smell or something. And since I'm always high, I'm having anxiety attacks over trying to remember where all the evidence is, all while acting like I'm a normal boyfriend. I just hate myself when I look at how shitty I've been because I need to get high one more time.

I'm starting a job on Monday, and it's a pretty big opportunity. I almost lost the job because of my piss test, but they took their time before testing me so I passed. I just want to start this job and be sober... I've wanted to be sober for 3 years now and I just want to get to the end of this... I want to move on and have a life again. I'm sick of feeling like I have to numb myself down to a confused paranoid state of mind to ease my anxiety... even though my anxiety is fueled by smoking weed. I just don't want to lie and work my ass off trying to hide it. I want to be present in my relationship, and be honest with my girlfriend. I really hope tomorrow is really the start of that, I really do. I have just lost all hope for that happening though... I don't know how many times I've gone to bed expecting to be sober the next day, just to get high again.

I just want to be fucking done. I know for a fact that I'll be much happier sober, I just wish I could get out of this first.."
6cet23,7,2017-05-21,"Some many difficult things in the present and in recent past, becoming hard to maintain a positive attitude...",fightagainstananke,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/6cet23/some_many_difficult_things_in_the_present_and_in/,"edit: I realized the title is effed after I posted it. I'm leaving it. Also, this is a throwaway. 

I am really struggling with life circumstance, as if I'm on some sort of amusement park ride and no matter the choices I make, its only going one way. At 38 years old (m), I feel like I'm too old to not have this shit worked out. Today, as I was heading out to the grocery store, I seriously contemplated just leaving and not coming back. The thought of getting in my car and just starting a new life was so appealing that it scared me. The lie was that I could actually get off the rails and have an impact on where I am going. I didn't, but just need to vent a bit and I don't have an outlet. I need to be clear that I am not suicidal, I just am struggling with circumstance and want to tell nobody and anybody some stuff that I facing. 

One of the big reasons that I don't have an outlet, is that my social circle is really small. 
My parents (mostly my Mother), decided society was too corrupt let her kids see, and when I was done with 4th grade decided home schooling was the thing. I didn't have interaction with other kids until they decided I hadn't studied hard enough and shipped me off to a 50 student private religious school in Idaho for Junior year. There, I met a girl  that I liked and became close with. This was the worst thing that could happen, totally unacceptable, so I was brought home after the school year was over. Mother didn't get to be involved to approve the 'relationship' so it had to end at all cost. This is probably a good time to mention that Mother was an abusive parent. 

As the oldest, I got the least of it, but still there was screaming, beating with kitchen utensils, late night tantrums about our normal stupid kid shit, regular trashing of our rooms, etc. My brother and sister had it worse than I did. Once she slapped the shit out of my sister so bad that her face was black and blue for weeks. I remember that they hid her until her face was better. My bother was always a large kid, big frame, almost as soon as he could was telling her that the beatings didn't hurt and would laugh at her as she hit him. She hit him harder until she couldn't keep going. 

The sicking and predicable part of it, is that it was all justified by religion. My mother is the most religious Jesus nut swinger there is. Hard core conservative and true believer in that we are all going to hell, and that a good beating and some extra Jesus would do us all a world of good. 

I never made it through college, I wanted to major in Electrical Engineering but I kept listening to them that I needed to do community college then some bullshit Christian school. I did what they said, but when it came time to choose a school they wouldn't 'let' me go to a school that I wanted. I needed to go to an school with an engineering program, not a Jesus program. I was sheltered and didn't know that I could just go. They threatened to pull all support and not sign financial aid paper work if I picked the school. So I never went. I have 130 hours at the community college level. Joke was on them, as I got lucky. I had an internship in an IT department and they eventually hired me. I still work there, its a great job, and aside from job stress it is the best part of my life. I enjoy the work and have good benefits. 

My Brother did get to go to school. Like when they sent me to Idaho, they had decided that he wasn't getting enough learning and sent him to high school. This time, for some reason, they decided the local community high school would be fine. He had grown to be too big for his own good. At 6'6"" 275lbs and naturally super strong he did all the wrong things in the gym and blew out his back, L4S1 was done before he was a Junior. For some reason, they always said since he was so young, he didn't get surgery to help him out. He struggled with extreme pain for years. 

Anyway back to me. In about 10 years ago, I met a girl that I really liked. There had been others that I never told my family about (read: hid from them), but this one.... She was special. When I told my Mother I was seeing someone, she flipped her shit. I am not exaggerating that she literally screamed at me about her at every opportunity during whole time the girl and I were dating. Mother hated it that she didn't get to pick the girl to the point she refused to meet her. Anyway, at the 2 year mark, girl and I decide to get married. Upon getting invited to the wedding, my Mother flips her shit and threatens my Dad with a firearm because he didn't stop me, and also threatens to kill herself with said firearm. My Sister was still living at home, called the Police, and Mother got a 48 hour observation. Mom and Dad still showed up to the wedding. I was such a dumbass that I didn't tell them not to come. 

Here is where it all comes around, and where I'm struggling. 

Last year, May 2nd, my brother committed suicide. He had spent 15 years addicted to opioids, had multiple surgeries to repair his back and had recently found his fiance had been cheating on him. I had separated myself from him a bit, as his opioid addiction wasn't always legit and spent there was a time where he was hitting me up for money every single time I talked to him for drugs. At the time of his death I didn't know he was in such bad shape mentally, he had moved back home, supposedly was clean and working with the Drs on the constant pain in lieu of self medicating. I was still doing everything I could to avoid all interactions with my parents. I feel partially responsible for his death, as if I had just been around I think he wouldn't have done it. Of course, my Mother hasn't helped. She has said on several occasions that my Bother had mentioned that he really missed having a close relationship with me, and that he resented my wife for 'causing' the distance. Now, I believe that my Mother is embellishing this, but it sure doesn't help the guilt. 

A year before my Brother's death, my Wife started struggling with extreme facial pain. We thought it was TMJ, and spent a great deal of money and time trying to treat it. Turns out it was all a red herring, the real issue (we think anyway) is something called Trigeminal Neuralgia, one of the most painful nerve pain conditions that one could have. Its terrible how  her face hurts. She had just opened her own business that had been a dream of hers, which now is about to close (hiatus is the status now). Its a somewhat rare condition which means the Dr's just argue with each other about treatment and medications and don't actually do anything to help her. I spent a great deal of time helping my wife the year before my brothers death. I wasn't able to be there for him. 

Remember that part where I love my job? I do, really. We are in the middle of one of the largest projects that we have done to date. Working with another entity, merging operations, there is quite literally more work than we can do in the time we have. Myself and my boss have been putting 55-60 hour weeks in and this will continue for the next year or so.

This last year my wife's condition has gotten worse and worse, particularly the last few months. She pretty much sits in the chair and cries from the pain. There is like 1 day of week where she can get up and do something, and even then its just that the pain is a little less that day. Between the meds, pain and despair, she frequently lashes out at me just because I am present. I don't claim that I have made every perfect decision working with the Dr's, or have always been super on time with scheduling and such... but I work hard to make her as comfortable as I can. From a selfish point of view, I literally go to work, and then do things to make the house go and help her. I do all the housework, all the meals, all the shopping, all finances *everything* for us to keep going. 

For example, last Wednesday I called a large hospital in the area that is very well known, to make an appointment asap in the Neurology department. I got the deets, and went about my business. We looked up the Dr later, turns out they made the appointment with a resident, which we both think isn't appropriate for where she is with her illness. One of the side effects of her meds is that she doens't sleep well, so I get up this morning and she is up already and in pain and surly as hell. I wasn't up for 15 minutes and she is already dressing me down with me for not having rescheduled the appointment with a tenured Dr. She said all sorts of untrue things about how I 'never help her' and that 'its clear I don't care' etc. 

Financially we're just making it. Her illness has caused her business to flounder, and also has been an extreme drain on the finances. There are times where we are down to the last few bucks before payday. This itself is so very stressful, but at least time will help. 

I just feel like there is no escape at any turn. My core family life has never been good, brother is dead. My relationship with my wife was great for a few years, but this illness has consumed everything. We can't have a sex life anymore (guilty for even saying that). Finances are in the shitter. Work is crazy. Life wasn't supposed to be this way. I was going to grow up, get an education and make a difference in the world. Life was going to get better after I escaped the abuse of childhood. I would find a girl and we would be happy together. I was going to make it happen, the sky was the limit. We would be ok. 

My girl's physical problem makes her miles from ok. Maybe my life has made me where I can't support her properly and I don't even recognize it. Her condition, my brother... I am miles from ok with all of this. Pretty sure my life is on rails, I am looking forward to just getting over the hardships and becoming a positive person again.

Also I'm still a very new developer, if the question itself doesn't make that apparent.

For me, this is a little practice project, where I can fool around with different technologies and practices and hopefully have a working product in the end. I've decided I want to use entity framework as my ORM and I've been scrounging around for weeks looking for articles and examples on the ""proper"" way to work with it. In addition, I've seen IoC containers pop up everywhere as I learn more about programming, so I wanted a chance to work with one of those as well.

Something I saw pop up quite a bit was repository pattern. I've worked with it loosely in an internship, but I can't say I truly followed the pattern. It sounded like a good idea and my previous experience solidified that idea. I began implementing it, but I came across another article that pointed out that Entity Framework already follows Unit of Work and Repository pattern. So making your own IRepository&lt;T&gt; would add an unnecessary layer of abstraction. That makes sense, but I still wind up at a loss of how to continue. I'd like to be able to make full use of the IoC container as well, and I'm afraid removing the interface might make that a lot harder.

With my music manager, I plan to have two ""data sources"". The first obviously being the database holding song information, and the second being the song files and their tags. With this in mind, would it still be beneficial for me to use a repository interface? And if not, I guess what's the proper way to use entity framework in 2017?"
6cfaty,4,2017-05-21,I (30f) went on a weekend trip and my BF (29m) didn't tidy up my room.,Canimad,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cfaty/i_30f_went_on_a_weekend_trip_and_my_bf_29m_didnt/,"I've been really busy with finals and starting a new internship. I live with my parents. Recently I have been telling my boyfriend how stressed I am and he doesn't really know what to do. Dating a year and a half. Edited to add: I am really clear about what will help destress me. Most of this goes right over his head.

I am really particular about my bed and I really hate coming home to an unmade bed. My boyfriend has known this since we first started dating. He's helped me make my bed numerous times. It is really important because I am somewhat of a perfectionist and it really messes with my depression when my room is messy.

When I left for the trip I left really early in the morning. We had been fooling around that night and left out some rope that we use to tie each other up and various other items. I specifically asked him to put it away, make my bed, and run an errand for me. He said he would. I asked him twice and he said yes both times. He often stays over at my parents house to sleep in when I leave for work or school.

I'm with my group and halfway to our destination when he texts me saying he left the bed unmade but ran the errand. He said that he didn't have time because he was going to work. I said ok. But then he texted me later saying he wasn't going in to work because he didn't feel well. This has been a common occurrence lately. He works in a family business. I just said ok and that it wasn't a big deal.

I get home just now after being away for four days. I was honestly kind of wondering if he had maybe surprised me. But he hadn't. My bed was totally unmade, I had a ton of stuff from that night spread all over the place (rope, lube -- please remember I live with my parents). I had dirty clothes laying all over and he didn't even clean up the food we ate that night, it is still sitting on my desk and hadn't even been put back in the bag where it came from. And I had two packages arrive that my parents left sitting in the middle of my floor. So they definitely saw how disgusting I left my room and the stuff that we do in here.

I let him know I was home. He is out at a birthday party tonight for a sibling and he texted me back saying that he's glad to hear it. I am so very pissed off. I know I need to confront him but I don't really know how to say it. Our relationship has been strained lately and I honestly just feel like crying. I am holding back everything in me not to text him right now and tell him how I feel, but I know they won't solve anything. I am pretty sure this is what is going to break us up. I wanted to see how I can try to do some damage control.

TL;DR: my boyfriend left a bunch of sexual items out in full view of my parents and didn't do a simple task I asked of him even though he knows how happy it would have made me to come home to a clean room. He also didn't go to work that day because he didn't feel good. I am so mad that he could lay in bed all day but not tidy up my room."

I hated everything and everyone but never really wanted to. I just know I'm a good person, but it never comes out.
After I graduated it only became worse. I really didn't know what to do with my life. My parents just went through a terrible divorce. They spend all their money on lawyers to screw eachother over. It weighed so heavy on me that I decided to go away and live in the city where I studied.
Then I found a girlfriend after so many years. She was so lovely. Every little detail she did was perfect. She loved to cook, she loved to clean, she was beautiful, she loved me so much.
I still was in a depression, but now I finally had a reason to fight against it. It was exactly what I was waiting for all my life. I just knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, beautiful her.
She ran an internship where we would only see eachother in the weekends. This was the final part of her going to college. We would finally be able to start an actual relationship. I wanted togo live together with her and grow a family (which I didn't have anymore because of my parents' divorce).
She found someone else who she loved. She didn't dump me for that, but she just started thinking about our relationship. She realized that she would never be happy with someone in a depression. She dumped me.
Depression winned again. It won and will win again. Always. I lost my reason to live. I need help."
6cg34i,127,2017-05-21,How my boss fired me and got angry because I left,chloeru,talesfromthejob,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthejob/comments/6cg34i/how_my_boss_fired_me_and_got_angry_because_i_left/,"So yeah, this really happened. 

I worked as a paralegal for a small law firm (20 employees) in a coworking building (not our main office). I had no guidance, no internal education, no deadlines, salary was bad, supervising 3 interns: I was really really bored and had no idea what to do. Despite several meetings where I told my boss that this was not going well, he always made promises to look into things but in the end he never did. One week before my contract ended, my boss and his partner scheduled a meeting. I assumed they would renew it as legally they should've told me a month earlier. However, they did not. They had to let go of me because of monetary issues. I was perfectly fine with it as I had other job interviews planned. They gave me a contract for another month to find something else and apologized for the lack of guidance etc. Two days after, my boss handed me the contract, telling me he changed it into two more months. I told him that I was planning to get another job earlier, so I was fine with signing it, but that I wanted to leave earlier if I find something else. He understood and agreed. 

The first month continues and I get another job. I told my boss that it would be my last two weeks and he seems happy for me but also a little overwhelmed. He was not ready for me leaving. However, my last weeks continue and I do not hear anything from my boss. He wanted to sit together and talk about my work and what to do with the interns etc, but he never planned a meeting or let me know. 

My last day arrived and I invited all coworkers from the main office for drinks in the coworking space I work at. No one showed up, only my boss. I invited some friends and people from the building and some gave me presents. My boss was just sitting there, not really saying anything. After an hour, he leaves and says: let's still plan that meeting, I will call you Monday. I am surprised, but agree as I still need him for a reference for my new job. Later that night, I get a calender invite from him for a meeting on Tuesday. I took the month off as I have to move to another city and still finish some things here at Uni. 

On Monday I got a text from a coworker saying: hey we are not letting you go this easy, what about a drink at the main office Wednesday at 5pm to say goodbye to you? (On Wednesday we had a company dinner planned and my boss told me earlier I should come there too.) I thought that was really sweet and thoughtful, although I should do all these things on the days that I'm free. On Tuesday, I drive to the office for the meeting with my boss. He is sitting in his office and says hi, but he is still busy. I wait outside for 15 mins. Than someone asks me what I am doing here. I say I am here for the meeting. She tells me my boss will be leaving soon. I walk into the office and ask: you know we have a meeting now? He says: I am really sorry but I have to leave, let's do it another time. I am surprised and say: I do not have time anymore upcoming week.  He says he will call me and I just leave, wondering why he did not just send me a text message earlier. 

Wednesday arrives. I do not want to go to have my goodbye drink anymore after Tuesday and my meeting with the boss. However, I still drive to the office again. When I arrive, it is completely silent in the office. Literally no one is there. I walk around and see one partner on the phone. I get some coffee and just wait. I feel very stupid and as I am about to leave, the partner walks towards me and hands me over some flowers. He apologizes that no one could be there. Stupid thing is I still have to go to the dinner later that night. I still go there. 

Dinner is awful. Everyone ignores me because they feel ashamed of not being at my goodbye event, I want to go home. I try to leave early and say goodbye to people. I say goodbye to my boss and he is very surprised and even a little angry. He says: but we are still seeing you right? Me: uhh don't think so. Him: why not? Me: because I don't work here anymore? Him: oh. 

Later, one of the interns told me he was angry because I left. The only thing I could do was laugh at that moment. They fired me, they let me come to the office for no reason on my free days TWICE, and now he's angry? He had enough time to plan a meeting with me in my last month. 

I have to add: I now found a great job and this experience taught me to be more careful with accepting jobs too easily. I will (at least for now) never work for a company again that has no HR department or internal employee policy. I've learned my lesson! "

I'm a CS student, graduating this summer. A few years ago I built a GPU mining rig and have 0-day mined every available alt-coin that has been released since. I've done some reasonably well payed internships and a decent amount of contract work during my time at university.

As a result, I now have around 20K GBP in savings at 0.5 interest in a major UK bank, and around 45K GBP across random extremely high risk crypto-currencies (that was worth 20K not too many weeks ago). I also have about 35K in student debt with the usual incomprehensible fee structure and recently risen interest rates.

In general I would like to continue living in the UK, but I'd short the UK economy because of general brexit shenanigans.

Not entirely sure what to do, so any advice would be welcome."

In high school, after a big party, she would set her alarm so she could get up early and buy donuts for everyone. She'd also always stay late and help clean up. Also she was always there to help anyone that threw up or felt bad. She was just a great friend, I remember her laughs a lot, she laughed at everything.

She had an internship under a huge dick. Seriously, he taught law classes at my highschool and that guy should not have been allowed there.  He had anger problems and would throw desks across the room. One time he called me up to his desk and threatened me for being high (I was a straight A student that didn't smoke). He also would publicly call me out for being high (I wasn't) to the entire class. The guy was an asshole.

So she interned with this piece of shit and he called her into his office. He told her she was being punished for messing up a report and proceeded to smack her ass with a yard stick repetitively. 

There was a court case and everything. Of course he is a lawyer so I'm sure he got a better deal than what he deserved. 

Anyway, since then, she's become one of those feminists everyone makes fun of on the internet. She essentially excommunicates anyone that talks about Trump. She says there's no such thing as racism towards white people or sexism towards men. She says rape only happens by men and also women wouldn't lie about being raped because they're better than that. Every type of illogical sjw argument there is out there, she agrees with it.

I still very much miss her, but being near her is like walking on egg shells and it's hard not to get mad at the things she says. 

It's been years though. Is there any way to get my friend back?"

With the long office hours, regular travelling and an on-duty phone I’m never truly switched off.  All my past hobbies, friends and relationships, *even sexual ones*, have become a forgotten footnote of my personal history.

Time management has become a finely tuned art form.  Instead of shopping for groceries they are delivered to my door at a scheduled time; instead of cleaning my own home, I’ve hired a maid; and instead of post office gym sessions I get my exercise cycling to and from work.  This last sacrifice comes with a bonus at work shower, lest I stink out my meetings with clients.

Today my hectic schedule is no different with a client meeting at 8am.  Yet before I’ve even reached the office, my entire schedule is blown like the rear tire of my $2,000 road bike.
After a quick repair at the side of the road I manage to get work at 7:50.  I slide my bike into the stand without securing the chain and quickly make my way to the staff showers.

To my dismay each of the private stalls are fully in use.  I pace back and forwards for a few seconds waiting for one of the culprits to hurry out the shower.  The clock on the locker room wall tells me its 7 minutes to the hour.  This meeting was with our most important and least understanding client.  

With the bold decisiveness which had elevated me to my lofty position I poked my head into the nearest of the stalls.  A slender, young and firm derriere stared back at me.  I traced the slightly fluffy cheeks upward, over a very slim waist and broad wide shoulders before recognizing the short hazelnut hair of the young office intern.  Unwavering I dropped the hanging towel from around by person and stepped into the shower behind the young man.  

His torso swivelled in surprise as I stepped close behind him in the shower.  My hand against his boyish waist prevented him from fully turning.  Instead he could only swivel his neck to see my face over his shoulder.  Nothing more, nothing less.

“I’m running late for a very important meeting”  I whispered in his ear.  “I won’t be more than a few moments. You just keep facing towards the wall and I’ll be out before you know it.”

The aghast nod of assent was enough of an approval for me and I edged him closer to the wall so I could drench myself in the warm stream.  Quickly I soaked my skin, washing the sweat and roadside dirt from my skin with the young man’s own shower gel.  

Throughout my companion was deathly silent and frozen stiff.  I whispered a thousand soft apologies into his ear to make him feel at ease.  In an attempt to share the facet we were perilously close.  

Continually his firm little buttocks pressed against my groin and my soft soapy breasts squished against his swimmers back.  There was no doubt he could feel the sharp excitement within my nipples.

The longer I stayed the longer I considered the young man.  His body was so young, so fresh.  I was little past 30 myself yet I’d never been with someone so young, at least not since I was so myself.  He was a perfect young specimen and I was curious just how experienced this man-boy was.

Time was getting away from me however and I sadly must go.  A devilish idea came into my head just before retreating.

I slid my arm around the minuscule, yet iron waist of the youth and whispered one last time in his ear.  

“Shall we say, 7:30am tomorrow?”

I asked before I licked the lobe of his ear and nibbled gently between my front teeth.  I then stretched for his shower gel once more, pressing firmly against him as i did so, and then placed the bottle in his hand.

“Enjoy the rest of your shower!  Take all the time you need.”

-----------------

Hi all,

Please take the time to respond with a continuation of the prompt.  First to finish is not an admirable quality for us girls.  To help you along below are some ideas of how you could continue:

* Write about you and your background.  i.e. company and/or sexual.

* Write this prompt so far from your perspective.

* Write about the rest of your shower thinking of me.

* Write about the remainder of the day in the office.

* Write about the anticipation for tomorrow.

None of the above need to be followed and creativity is encouraged.  Just trying to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.

Hope to hear from you soon!

I've always used a desktop as my primary machine, but I'm doing an internship now in a different city this summer, and living in a small studio apartment, so I just brought my laptop with me. This has made me rethink some things long term, whether I should continue using a desktop. Every time I move, I end up getting rid of tons of crap, and this move is no different. I literally packed my car in 2 hours and hit the road. Having my computer take up so little space and feeling comfortable at a pretty small desk is actually pretty cool.

I was actually going to bring my desktop (didn't realize there wouldn't be room for it anyway here), but at the last second I thought ""man, transporting the computer/monitor/keyboard/mouse/speakers is going to be such a pain in the ass.""

The desktop, along with keyboard, mouse/mousepad, 5.1 speakers, all that, takes up quite a bit of space. I don't do any gaming, basically use it for email/internet-browsing/movies/music/programming. I do sometimes find programming on a laptop keyboard kind of annoying, but not too bad. Hopefully most of my programming will be at work moving forward though, not ""for fun."" (Though I have a wireless keyboard I could use which would only take up a little extra space.) Laptop speakers aren't great either, but it can be connected to some nice external speakers wirelessly. Plus I've always gotten a really huge desk (like 6' long, probably 2.5-3' deep) because my desktop setup takes so much space.

This is all more or less long term thoughts for when I finish school and get a real apartment. If I wanted to sell my desktop, can you get a decent amount for it if you remove the hard drives? (Sorry, I don't believe people won't try to find my data -- I once took an old PC to a recycling place that gives you a small amount of money, and they were quite disappointed and greatly reduced the amount they gave me when they found out I removed the hard drives.)

Anyone have any thoughts or experience with this? I wonder if getting rid of the desktop would get me to live more simply too in terms of less computer usage."

The last (and so far only) time I posted, it was about how MIL wouldn't 'allow' me to visit DSO in Chicago. MIL did end up paying me back for the $300 ticket I could no longer use- she also apologized-ish, saying that it was an unfortunate situation that was due to BIL1 wanting to go to Florida for spring break with his GF, SIL (which, imo, they should be able to do if they want to anyways). I ended up adopting a kitten with the money MIL refunded me, so at least one good thing came out of it!


So on to some BEC moments of the last few months:

1. MIL made DSO fly home from Chicago for barely 24 hours for Easter. He flew home Saturday morning and flew back Sunday night.  This was instead of taking a trip that literally everyone else in his class took.

2. When DSO got home from Chicago, MIL had a long list of chores he had to do, which meant I had to wait longer to see him.

3. At a graduation party for BIL1 and BIL2 (DSO and BILs are triplets, but DSO has 1 more year for his degree), MIL mentions about how theres an ""unspoken agreement"" that all 3 boys would come back and help for their mulching weekend, no matter where they are. Luckily, all 3 boys essentially said ""yeah... no""


Some good things that happened:

1. I finally met SIL when BIL1-who goes to college about 20 min from where I live- invited me to come to his college with DSO to celebrate his graduation.  SIL and I bonded over how ridiculous it was that we didn't get to do what we wanted for spring break

2. DSO got an internship an hour away from where I will be spending the summer! Hopefully, this will mean plenty of time together without MIL interfering.


TL;DR: MIL continues to control her college-aged sons, but DSO and I will be far away during the summer and she won't have the same power!

Can you add people to a slack group and only give them access to a certain channel, or a few channels, without having to privatize all the rest of the channels?

Right now most of the channels we have are open channels, along with two channels that are already private.

From what I understand, the downsides of private channels are that
1. You can never unprivatize any channels once they are made private, so if there are eventually 50 people in the slack channel they won't be able to join some channels easily because none of the private channels will be shown as possible channels to join
2.  You can't easily share messages from private channels to other channels

But I know it's for the best.",TisteAndii,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6cjimu/im_an_alcoholic_whos_103_days_sober_unfortunately/,"I'm about to turn 33 years old. For the past 15 years, I found every answer I thought I needed in the bottom of a bottle of Jameson. If I didn't have a full bottle going in to a night of drinking, I was worried I wouldn't have enough to get properly blackout drunk.

I started barbacking in bars around 20 years old. I've done it all, bartending, and for the past couple years, assistant and general management. It made it so easy to tell myself I wasn't an alcoholic, that it was just part of the job. ""Research"" is what I would tell myself. All these samples that breweries or distilleries would bring in was just me doing my due diligence for quality control. And I'd constantly make other concessions to myself... ""Well I just spent 12 hours serving all these drunken assholes, why shouldn't I deserve a drink or two now?"" But it was never just a drink or two. It always started off that way, and a bottle of Jameson later it was 3pm the next day and I'm waking up having no idea how I made it from the couch to my bed. Do the panicked ""check to see who I called/texted"" last night so I'd know who I'd have to apologize to. Cancel any plans I had that day because ""I wasn't feeling well all of the sudden"". If I could tell you how many times I flaked on plans because I was ""sick"", which more often than not I would just take my medicine with a whiskey and a beer, figure hair of the dog right? I can't feel worse, so why not ease the pain a little.

I started being stupid. Careless. Taking a little bit of this, trying a little bit of that, mixing some shit I shouldn't have, all because when I was blackout drunk, I thought I was impervious. 

I should've died. I didn't, but I should've. And I woke up that day, looking at the mess of bottles and packages and wrappers laying around me, curled on the floor of my bathroom, soaked in sweat, and decided right then and there that I wanted to live. I destroyed all the booze I had an decided I wanted another shot at life.

Today, today I have 103 days sober. For me, it's hard still to grasp that that's possible. I used to have a hard time going 3 days without a drink, let alone 103. Unfortunately though, for my career up until this point I've chosen to work in a bar. I thought at first, when I got sober, I could handle it. Until I couldn't. I was getting anxious, panicking, worried about going in to work and making myself physically and emotionally sick. So I talked to the bosses, I was running the bar I was working at at the time, and asked them if I could step down. I thought the solution was less hours and less being there, I could still make a couple bucks and maybe feel less stressed. So I gave them about a month to find and train a replacement, and I went from 5-7 days a week at 50-80 hours a week, scaling back to 2-3 days, like 12-20 hours a week. It was a relief at first. And then the anxiety started again. I would have 4 days off, and then the day that I had to go back to work, I would wake up and fall apart. Dreading the hours I would have to walk through those doors and my world, my career, revolved around the very thing that was trying to destroy me.

So last night, I gave my notice. I told them I couldn't be around booze anymore, that I had to choose my own health, my own well-being, over a job, and at this point a family, I had come to love. Over the past 10+ years I have spent grooming myself, learning the ins and outs of the bar business, craft beer, brewing, selling, pouring, and everything else that comes with it. And not to pat myself on the back too hard, but I was damn good at it. And I never brought my bullshit in to work. I suffered alone, behind closed doors, where I could just drown in a bottle.

Well now, at almost 33 years old, I'm leaping out with faith instead of fear. I have just recently finished a short web development course, while also taking a bunch of online courses. I've built two websites, one which was ok, the other I'm a bit proud of. So I'm going to start looking for internships hopefully in that field just to get my foot in the door. I've always excelled at anything I've put my mind to, so I'm hoping by some divine cosmic power that something affords me the opportunity for this career course correction. I'm honestly terrified, I have enough funds in my bank account to last me maybe two months before I start to struggle, having pissed most of it away on booze and whatever else. I'm scared to start over, to have to figure out what to do with my life that doesn't involve the very thing I've spent the past decade trying to be the best at. But what I do know, and this is what I'm holding on to, is that my soul feels better. That for me, I know this is the right choice, because I'm choosing sobriety over certainty, because in that bar environment, I'm only one stupid decision, one weak lapse of judgement away from it all falling apart again. 

So while I'm terrified, I'm also confident in myself. I know that I'm a better person sober than I ever was drunk. I've repaired some relationships that I thought I had destroyed, and have built a really strong network of support and friends who are in my corner. My family has been incredibly helpful, and while it feels like starting over, this time it feels like I'm doing so with a cleaner slate. One that's not dripping in alcohol. 

So I'm sorry for the wall of text if you've made it this far, but I just wanted to share this, because I'm scared. I have no idea what I'm going to do for money, but I'm sending my resume out to anyone and everyone that will give it a look. I'm willing to take whatever comes to me, grunt work doing image gallery layouts, mopping floors somewhere, but whatever it is, I'm going to be doing it sober, so I have faith that karma will help guide me to being a better person, the person I've spent the last 15 years drowning in the bottom of a bottle until he was barely there.
So thank you for reading this and know that while putting down that last drink is tough, and that's the first of many battles you'll have to face, that if you really want it, you can overcome this disease. I know I'm still in the pink cloud, in my infancy of sobriety, but everything is one day at a time. I'm not worried about where I'll be a year from now, I'm not even worried about tomorrow, I'm just worried about today. And today, today I'm not going to drink. And when I lay my head down on that pillow tonight and drift off to sleep, I'll do so knowing I conquered this demon again. Came out the victor in today's battle, and that that, that's a battle I plan to keep fighting, and keep winning.

Thanks for reading and if you need help, while I'm still newly sober by all accounts, I'm here for anyone that wants to talk or just bullshit with an internet stranger. We all need help sometimes, I'll gladly offer what I can. Thank you.


**EDIT:** Thanks to everyone for the tremendous amount of support you all have shown me on this post. I cannot express my gratitude enough. While I did this for me because I knew it was what I needed, every little bit of support that you all show bolsters my resolve and makes me stronger in this fight. Not only that, but it gives me confidence in my future that things are going to be all right.

And most importantly to the others commenting that they're either just starting out their journey with sobriety, or are well in to it, just know that for us much support as I've been shown here by complete strangers, all of these people are rooting for you just the same. And I'm sure that in your own personal life, you'll find just as many, if not more, people who will gladly get in your corner in order to help you beat this motherfucker of a disease. And you're going to be alright. 

So again, I can't say it enough, but thank you all, so very much, from the bottom to the top of my heart. "
6cjrvp,0,2017-05-21,[M4F] Beyond Human Nature,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6cjrvp/m4f_beyond_human_nature/,"Note: Old prompts and scenarios are still open. Feel free to suggest anything you like, too. I'll at least give you feedback, and I am singularly difficult to offend.

Some of you may have read my previous prompts, and a select few of you glorious nutcases even upvoted them. Thank you for that, but now I'm back! There's a reason the signs say ""Don't Feed the Bears."" I apologize if I've been a bit repetitive lately, but this prompt took a *long* time to write, and I think it can be adapted to pretty much any whim and desire. Ask and ye shall probably receive. I also don't expect you to match the length and detail of this prompt. This was developed over quite a long time with a bit of thought. Roleplay responses simply cannot receive that kind of attention without going stale.

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds. Furthermore, there are televised PR and recruiting events for those interested in working at the broadcast center, as well as interesting and exciting gameshows like ""Who Wants to Be a Mother?"" ""The Genes Are Right,"" and ""Whose Sperm Is It, Anyway?"" (Okay, maybe it's not that goofy. I just liked the wordplay.)

Of course, there are also the Baby Bashes for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships. Olympus corporation is looking to hire event staff to answer questions at the parties, demonstrate the equipment, and act as little Venuses to encourage good pairing. Partygoers should look up to the event staff as their goal in attending a Baby Bash.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

I have a tendency to tell incredibly bad science jokes. For example: what do complex analysis and Spanish have in common? I always forget to conjugate.

I'm a physics and computer science major, going into my senior year. I love reading (currently working on House of Leaves), writing (I've written two novels and a stage script, which has actually been published), watching Rick and Morty, and finding stupid videos on YouTube (for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdzCv_9eaoM).

For those who care what I look like, I'm 6'3"", slender, and I work out regularly. Anyways, I'd love to hear from you. Let's chat and see if we click. Maybe find a time and place to hang out. Grab coffee or visit a museum. Something like that."

We began dating two years ago when I met him the spring semester of my freshman year in college. We met in class and started to go out and things picked up. I knew from the Ryan he had problems with depression. He was depressed when we met but very open about it and seemed to be proactive at receiving help for it (he was on meds, seeing a therapist). He failed out of school that semester anyway (spring 2015). 

When we first met and throughout the entirety of our relationship, we got on like crazy. We laughed all the time, had a ton of great sex, and were never sick of eachother. 

We spent the summer apart as I moved home with my parents for four months, and everything went well. We had a little bit of a LDR (three hour drive.) But had visits and not a problem. Still happy and in love.

The fall semester of my sophomore year starts and we both go back to school. We were both under a lot of pressure and I noticed that Ryan was extremely depressed. He wasn't eating or going to class and spent the day in his apartment alone. I would check on him every day after class and call him and check on him. Eventually he decided he needed long-term help and dropped out for the semester, and moved back home with his mother (about 30 minutes away). Throughout all of this, he was still showing me that he cared for me.

We both have cars so we were still able to see eachother often. He received help and went back to school the following semester (spring of 2016). Everything between us was always fine. That upcoming summer (summer of 2016) I got a job offer on campus that provided free housing and great pay, so I moved up there more permanently and spent the entire summer with him/my friends. 

Summer came and went, and no problems. I could see he was starting to be a bit more depressed towards the end of the summer and was beginning to worry. However he has always been kind, loving and affectionate with me. We were still always having sex, and we seriously never argued once. We were best friends. 

Then in September of 2016, he broke up with me one morning soon after the semester started. Saying that he was depressed and couldn't give me what I wanted and that he was afraid of falling more in love with me and entering a long term relationship because he did not want to get hurt in the end. I accepted it but was confused. 

A few hours later he showed up at my apartment and we got back together after a long discussion, I figured that he was depressed and made a mistake and that if he could prove to me that he did not mean all of those things then I could try one more time. After that, things between us were fine. 

All throughout fall 2016, the holidays, and early spring 2017, everything was fine. We had a few minor arguments along the way but about nothing serious. 

We had begun to talk about possibly having a future when I graduate next year. I got a good job up by where he lives, a great internship, and I was going to move in with his mother since she had a spare bedroom. We were planning a vacation. All of this was set to happen today. Last Sunday we got into an argument, but made up and all was fine. He also admitted to me that he was starting to feel depressed again. 

I called him Monday morning just to say hello. He tells me that him and I aren't right for eachother. That he's been thinking about it for awhile. He wanted to break up sooner. He didn't have the guts. He had a crush on a coworker of his he's known for awhile. He doesnt want to date her, but realized I may not be the one. He said he loved me and we talked about it for hours. But he said he couldn't be with me. That he was more attracted to someone else than to me. That he would want to date this coworker of his if she wasn't in a relationship. How could he be with me when he questions what love is? 

But he never showed a single sign. Held me all night every night we slept together. Told me constantly how beautiful he thought I was and how much he loved me. That he thought I could be the one. He never showed me any signs that he didn't care. Or that this ""crush"" was even happening. He didnt admit to it until I kept pressing him for reasons to break up, either.

He cried when we were ending it and said that he couldn't come see me because he knew he wouldn't be able to leave me. That he does love me. It made no sense. 

A part of me wants to believe he's just depressed out of his mind and needs help and is running out of the fear of being hurt. But I obviously know it's over and that I can't beg him and all of that. I know that. But I just don't understand any of it. 

I'm having a hard time sleeping and he's all I can think about. I know I deserve better and someone that can handle their depression and emotions. 

I just want to know how someone can look me in the eyes and tell me that they love me like no one else, and then days later say it was all a lie.

Sorry if this was a jumbled mess. I hope it made sense.

6cjz9z,17,2017-05-21,Too much time alone?,RealUniqueUser,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/6cjz9z/too_much_time_alone/,"Hello! Are there any INFP's that oddly struggle with having too much time alone to themselves? I personally think it's just because this past month I've had off from college before I head off to an internship.

The time alone has been incredibly great, but so detrimental. It's been so counter productive and I don't like it. It's not good, but it's been good to reflect on a lot of things from this past year to myself.

A few reasons I feel like it's been counterproductive is because:

- Time alone is good, it's awesome for thinking things over, finding out more, but having no one to talk to about these things have caused anxiety and has made me so irritable, when I'm typically a genuinely nice person.
- I've had nothing to keep me busy.
- Before college ended, I got rejected by a girl (it actually ended well, we're friends, it was handled well by the both of us. Communication was clear and we both respect one another even more now). But overthinking that whole scenario and still, being somewhat hung up on it hasn't led to good conclusions in my head, which I know are all false, but it doesn't help me and how I process things.
- I'm staying with my roommate and we're so different but tend to get along well. I get along and fit in with the family, but I feel like a maid because all I ever do is clean for them, and never receive any credit or even a thank you. Which doesn't hinder me from doing the dishes, cleaning the house, etc. I do it partly for his parents, and because I hate things being dirty.
- FINALLY, I'm struggling super hard with how other perceive me. I've always felt inadequate, but because I have time alone, I think too much about I fall short of a lot of things.

This girl and I both worked as interns for a consulting office for the past three months.  Due to the nature of the work and office scheduling (she was still in undergrad), we ended up working the afternoon/late shift together pretty frequently and most days pretty much everyone else in the office would leave before we did, so we ended up talking a lot and getting to know each other. Mostly pretty standard small talk stuff (we’re from the same state, both went to Catholic high schools, have some overlapping tastes in podcasts/tv), but we also ended up talking about family, travel, social issues (she was writing a couple papers) as well. I don’t know that I would characterize our interactions as flirtatious necessarily, but we had some laughs, and could generally converse pretty easily. 

We hung out a couple times outside of work too, mostly at office social events, but I did take her up on an invitation to a competitive dance event for a student group she was a part of, and she also invited me to her birthday party (which I couldn’t attend, unfortunately). Generally speaking we never hung out one-on-one outside of the occasional Uber ride or when waiting around for others. We sent the occasional text/chat message to each other, but nothing too serious. 

As a personal rule, I don’t typically ask out direct coworkers (people on the same floor or a different office are exceptions), because I think it can make working relationships unnecessarily complicated/difficult, but since it was our last week (we were both leaving for different jobs), I decided to take the plunge and ask her out for drinks.

Some additional context: I did it after work pretty early in the week, as we were both walking home from the office. Since I had to catch a bus and we both had some scheduling conflicts (she was in the middle of finals week, I already knew I was looking at a decent amount of work for my first couple days of the new job), we agreed to work out an actual time/location later. I didn’t push the issue for the next few days because I know from experience finals week tends to be busy, but at our going away party on Friday, I asked if she still wanted to go, she said yes, and we agreed on Wednesday night. 

Last piece of context:  it was her school’s commencement week, but she told me about when her parents were flying in, stuff she had planned with her friends, etc. when we were working out a time. 

Wednesday afternoon rolls around and I get a text from her saying only: “Hey I have to cancel tonight. I have to go to a graduation banquet I forgot about.” 

Two things stick out about that to me: one, she didn’t suggest an alternate date for to reschedule. And two, considering the timing and wording, it definitely seems like she was just trying to make up an excuse.  I usually understand this to mean that a person doesn’t actually want to do whatever it is you’ve asked them, but if she didn’t want to go out with me, why would she have actually set up an initial date instead of just saying she was busy or refusing me outright? I send her a text asking if she wants to reschedule, and get no response. That was four days ago now.

I want to give her some benefit of the doubt because obviously its legitimately a busy time for her with graduating from college and dealing with family, paperwork, etc. but at the same time if she actually wanted to go out with me, it seems like she would have responded by now, if only to say that she doesn’t know when would be a good time, but we could talk about it later or something. 

In theory she could get back in touch with me once all her school stuff is cleared up after this weekend, but I’m not naïve enough to think that will happen. 

I’m just making this post because I’m not sure where I went wrong here, and I wanted to see if anyone had been in a similar situation and had any insight on how to move forward or maybe any thoughts on why I got blown off like this?

Also just kind of wanted to rant about the situation because it’s really frustrating.

  **tl;dr**: Work with a girl for a couple months, get along pretty well, ask her out and get blown off with no warning. Wondering if I did something wrong. "
6cldwy,1,2017-05-22,Need advice: Should I move out?,AdviceTaker101,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6cldwy/need_advice_should_i_move_out/,"Ok I need some advice. Growing up, I was a hard working student and always saw myself having a successful career in technology. Unfortunately, my parents didn’t share my view and told me in high school that my only option was to be a medical doctor. It was for “family respect” as I was their “investment.” Also I’m Indian and apparently this type of stuff is common. My dad messed up my college applications pretty bad as well. He said the essays I wrote were crap since they didn’t emphasize medicine so he made me rewrite them and they were so impersonal that I was rejected from all the prestigious colleges. I still got into one college which I ended up attending.

So one year of college goes by and I finish most of my premed courses with straight As but I hate the thought of being a doctor. I’m not interested in helping people clinically. So when I come home for summer break, I tell my parents I’m not going to be a doctor and they respond that they will not support me financially. I stay firm and say no because I hate medicine. I would rather eat dirt than be a doctor for my family’s respect. Finally my dad tries to compromise with me. He says I go to medical school for 4 years and do whatever I want after that (so no residency in his words). I’m hesitant at first but I accept (in retrospect this was a really bad idea but other than the army I wasn’t sure how to pay for college). I do 4 years of college and get into an American medical school. It was not an easy process in the sense that my dad tried to micromanage everything. He prevented me from taking any internships because I “should always be studying,” gave me no phone until I was a senior, broke my laptop before finals which tanked one of my semester grades, looked through my school emails without my knowledge for quite some time, and gave me really bad advice from time to time with the most infamous that I “shouldn’t waste time shadowing.” 

Anyways, the week before I’m supposed to leave for medical school my dad tells me he has changed his mind and I “have no choice but to do residency.” He had totally reneged on his promise. I was so mad when he told me that I just stared at him thinking about how I can choke him. 

So now I’m seriously considering moving out. This whole process has taken a huge toll on me psychologically and made me slightly suicidal. I know that my mental health will only get worse if I go to medical school and I will take someone’s spot that deserves to be there. However, I only have 3 months to make money. How much money should I make to be in a safe zone before I move out? Or should I just take the hit and go to medical school and then be kicked out within a year from that one? Has anyone dealt with this situation before? Did their parents try to track them down? Also, don’t tell me that I should try to talk to my parents. I did that multiple times and nothing changed.

I have never had a job or internship relating to programming or anything in the tech field before. I have a really bad GPA, 2.1, because I struggled a lot with depression and a suicide attempt and there were a few semesters I bombed my classes and nearly got kicked out of college. 

I don't really know where to look for some sort of entry-level programming job in my area, especially with my low skill set.

A lot of people in my school are far more skilled and far more knowledgeable so I honestly think that it might be best if I don't even try to go for a programming job and continue to work at my summer job at a fast food restaurant."
6cluad,1,2017-05-22,How do I go on without her?,treyes1984,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6cluad/how_do_i_go_on_without_her/,"She's left the state for a internship. It's been a long up and down roller coaster with her for the past 8 years or so. She left me once for a school friend, but I begged her to come back. After she came back she continued to see people while living with me and I knew it. We slept in the same bed day after day. She still can't tell anyone that I'm here in her life and she acts like she's single with everybody. I've caught her numerous times talking to other men and she's actually even done it in front of me. I don't want to go on anymore. I don't think I can do this whole separation thing from her. She doesn't seem to miss me or want to even talk to me. She's busy making friends, going out dancing and drinking and has no problem not talking to me. I hate feeling like such a loser, dependent on someone else for my happiness. I've wasted my youth, time, money and every resource to help her get to where she is today and I don't think it phases her at all. I'm not happy or comfortable anywhere. I don't think I can do it. I love what I do for a living, but I'm so used to sharing this with someone that I don't know what to do without that person. Sleeping all day when I can is what makes me happy. When I'm sleeping nothing can bother me. All I have are my dreams when I'm sleeping, and to be honest they're mainly about her in some shape or form. I don't want to go on. I want to just turn myself off to not have to deal with possibly losing her to someone else. I love my family, but I don't want to go home to them. I moved out of my apartment to buy a house I couldn't afford and moved into her moms house. Shes gone now and I'm still here. I sold my truck because I couldn't afford the maintenance, needed to pay rent, borrowed another car from my dad to only have to sell it, sold the my other car so she could get a new car, and now have to borrow my brothers car to which I wrecked while driving drunk because I couldn't deal with her being away. I'm a mess through and through. She makes me whole, we did everything together. Don't get me wrong I'm not always sad, but for the most part I am. She's on my mind all the time. I don't hate my life, but Im not happy with it. Why don't I have my family? Why don't I have my wife? Why don't I have my kids? I could've been a Dad right now, but we aborted him/her. I don't think I will ever forgive myself for that or her for that matter. Her life and schooling was more important to her than the life of a baby, our baby. I should've left her years ago, but I thought I would never be able to find someone as pretty as her. Sounds stupid now to say that, but that's the truth. "
6cmws2,2,2017-05-22,"Spiritual encounter, though probably a night terror",seagoat48,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/6cmws2/spiritual_encounter_though_probably_a_night_terror/,"Last night I had possibly the worst night of “sleep” (if you could call a grand total of one hour sleep) I’ve ever had. It started with a tremendously unnerving night terror, one that convinced me that I had an encounter with a demon or some sort of spirit. I bolted upright, with my fists clutched tight onto some form of cloth, or shirt, or whatever the fuck a spirit would wear. I screamed at the top of my lungs too, a mix of anguish and rage, rebuking the damned thing (whether imagined or real) as I did so. It went a little something like this:  
*Cole bolts up in bed*
*Cole screams, loudly* “Agghhhh!!!” 
*Cole proclaims viciously* “I got you motherfucker! In the name of Jesus Christ begone!”
The whole incident must’ve lasted less than a minute, but I shit you not, I’ve never felt something so real and terrifying in my entire life. Of course, after my body had dropped out of battle mode, I leapt out of bed and shot on every light I could. Immediately afterwards, I called my father. He and I chatted for roughly 20 minutes and he told me, as any sensible parent would, that the brain is a very powerful thing, capable of creating all sorts of illusions and false realities. I was convinced, however, that it was an account of spiritual warfare, as I had heard loud knocks resounding from the bathroom over the past couple of nights. The knocks I heard this night at around 10 PM were even louder than the previous nights. I was already somewhat spooked heading into dreamland, so perhaps that had some effects on my subconscious mind. Furthermore, because I was so spooked, I prayed extensively for protection from evil spirits and demonkind, asking for the Lord’s protection over me and family members. Perhaps I was ruminating over this concept in my pre-deep sleep phase and perhaps my brain created this incident. Yet at the same time, I can remember emerging from my slumber. Now that I think about it, the reason why I woke up was because it felt like something was messing with my right hand. When I went to sleep, I had either left my right hand at my side, or rested it upon my chest. But when emerging from my dark and cozy innermind, the first thing I noticed was that my arm was belt at the elbow and my hand was erect. Upon realizing this, I immediately locked my hand into a tight fist, and that’s when I felt “the thing” pull away. This is when I bolted up, and locked onto it with my left, and shouted those lines. My jaw was clenched, my hands were clenched, my abs were clenched. I felt like I was really in a struggle with a spectre incognita. In the act of letting go, I made an effort to dismissively toss it backwards as it was floating 3 or 4 feet in front of me. 
Now here’s where things get interesting. In my childhood I often had this repeating nightmare where this particular fucking bastard of a ghost would interrupt my dreams, and would cause me the panic of fleeing from it, or silencing it, or just resolving the nightmare in general. Y’know, a good ole game of pickup mindfuck, one on one, spirit always gets ball. Every time I had this nightmare, I could tell that it was the same motherfucker, because the thing always had this distinct presence about it, one that was different and more real than the other monstrosities that populated my nightmares. Its qualia was foreign, as if my mind didn’t create it. During this incident, I felt the thing’s presence. Let it be known that I haven’t had one of those dreams in years. I’ve also recently quit smoking marijuana, so that could also be a potential reason for the opening of the floodgates so to speak. But this time was different. It was outside of my head. Well that or it was a hallucination, but I don’t think hallucinations occur after only being asleep for an hour. Tomorrow--err today-- is my first day continuing last summer’s internship, so the stress of that first monday back could also contribute to my experience. Needless to say, it was a remarkable experience. And also one that really pissed me off, seeing how I’m going to have to work a 9 to 5 shift deduping contact databases and making cold calls to potential clientele. "
6cn6xi,9,2017-05-22,"I'm 26, and just accepted a job outside the US. Now what to do with $20k in US savings, my car, and my earnings overseas?",forrey,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6cn6xi/im_26_and_just_accepted_a_job_outside_the_us_now/,"After 2 years of living with my parents and working at a startup company post-college, I decided it was time to leave America behind and do some international travel. I ended up in Israel, doing a short internship at a large tech company, and when they offered me a job, I decided to accept. 

I'm very fortunate in that A) I have no debt, and B) the position I was offered has a comfortable salary (by US standards it isn't high, but by Israeli standards, it's incredible), so my cost of living is covered. I estimate I'll finish each month with a surplus of 4000-7000 NIS (roughly $1,110 - $2,000) after food, rent, taxes, healthcare, misc costs etc.

In addition, I have about $20,000 dollars in a US savings account from my time at the startup, and a car worth approximately $12,000 that's sitting at my family's house. 

So here's the big question: I don't intend to stay in Israel forever, maybe a couple more years. So what are my best options for the following:

- For my Israeli earnings, once I have an emergency fund built, is it best to simply keep them in an account here? Is it worth looking into investment options in Israel?

- For my US savings, I know I need to do something with them that will yield interest. My parents have offered to add the money to their investment fund (they're certainly not rich, but they're fairly frugal and careful with money) which is managed by a financial advisor and they say it's fairly diversified and the interest rate is probably better than that of an IRA. Would I be better taking them up on the offer or starting my own IRA or investment account? 

- At the moment, my car has fairly low costs. Registration is just $100 a year, and I've lowered the insurance to the lowest possible since nobody is driving it ($560 per year). Nevertheless, is it worth keeping for the next couple years, knowing that I would be using it when I move back to the US, or would I be better off selling it now and investing the money? 

Cheers!"
6cnbpc,12,2017-05-22,30 Days! My Struggle,foxfiire,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6cnbpc/30_days_my_struggle/,"Hey everyone! I told myself that when I made it to 30 days, I would make a long and self-indulgent post about why I quit, my experience with quitting, and my sobriety. So here goes.

I decided to take a break from drinking in the wake of my second cousin's wedding. A number of things about that night added up to make me uneasy with my drinking:

-The fact that I was still mildly hung over from the night before when I got to the wedding
-The fact that I felt so uncomfortable until the open bar started. Then it felt like I'd reached the promised land and I could finally ""relax""
-The fact that I didn't make any honest attempts to connect with family members until alcohol was in my system 
-The fact that I talked about alcohol for probably 65% of the night. I was a big homebrewer and also into craft beer, and I came to the startling realization that alcohol was probably more than 50% of my identity. I didn't like that idea because I know there's more to me than that. If this tells you anything, my mom suggested the next day that ""maybe we could theme your wedding around different breweries."" I cringed
-The fact that I could've easily embarrassed myself in front of my extended family. As I lay in bed after the wedding, the room spinning hellishly, I played back through the ham handed conversations I'd had. No, I hadn't puked or done anything inappropriate, but I had foolishly engaged in conversation with my sober, very Christian, very judgmental aunts when semi-blasted. Not the best call

So the next day I decided I was going to take a break. I didn't make a solemn vow or anything, I just had very little desire to drink after the wedding. Plus my college graduation was coming up the next weekend and I knew I would be brutally hungover for it if I didn't quit drinking. So I found this subreddit and bought my first case of seltzer water. I was fortunate in that I was busy: packing up, getting ready to move out, finishing my internship, and so on, so it was fairly easy to keep my mind off drinking. Plus I didn't really have any friends anymore so none of them were going to tempt me to drink.

During that first week sober I started to reflect back on my drinking without the rose colored beer goggles I normally wore. Here's that I found, in no particular order:

-I once was so hungover that I puked out the window of my then girlfriend's car, all down the side of her car. She broke up with me a week later (wonder why?)
-That same girlfriend had had to care for me once when I was mega blackout mode and apparently I said some weird things (that I thought I was evil? What?)
-I was once too hungover to go to the family Mother's Day gathering 
-I realized how much my drinking had hampered my performance during my internship
-I looked back with concern on the several times I vomited in bed while passed out. Lucky I didn't choke
-I thought about the time I fell and smacked my face on the ground while inebriated. I had a big scrape on my check and a concussion which I was unable to treat because of poor healthcare in the region 
-Several sexual opportunities were missed or dampened, shall we say, by my drunkenness
-I once got locked out of my dorm at around 4 am in December coming back from parties. I was lucky that my car was within walking distance and that I had a sleeping bag in it. Not sure how that would've played out otherwise! 
-One time when I was drunk and angsty, I pounded on this shop window and the owner came out and grabbed me around the chest! He was yelling at me and yelling at the other shop keeper to call the cops. Fortunately I was way more athletic than him and was able to spin out and run away down an alleyway but it was sketchy nonetheless
-I drunkenly embarrassed myself at a wine tasting by flirting very openly with a girl who was clearly quite drunk and insecure. As we left the tasting, her intimidating brother asked me my name and told me to make sure nothing happened to her. She drove us to her friend's house (yikes, she shouldn't have been driving), where she fell apart and I peaced outta there. I knew a lot of people at the tasting and hoped they didn't judge me too much
-I once went to a party during exam week, got way too drunk, embarrassingly tried to get multiple girls to come home with me, and then barely made it to my exam the next morning. It was at 12:45 in the afternoon and I made it there exactly at 12:45 (I did end up getting an A on it even though I went to the bathroom to puke twice)
-Once while walking back from a party, I guess I couldn't quite make it so I found a patch of grass 100 yards or so from my house and laid there for like an hour. I'm lucky nothing bad happened 
-Perhaps worst of all, I had several periods of intense and persistent suicidal ideation which I guarantee I could've avoided had my moods not been messed up from drinking heavily everyday 

I'd previously been able to rationalize these things: 

-""Well, I'm at a drinking-heavy college and that's just the culture here. My friends do it too."" 
-""Well, it can't be that bad because I still have a 3.9 and have never gotten in trouble with the authorities.""
-""Well, I'm developing my taste for good beer and sometimes I go overboard.""
-""Well, I made this beer, it turned out really well, it only cost me 25 cents to make, and I have a hundred more bottles in the basement."" 
-""This is just part of who I am. I'm a sensitive and timid guy who gets cooler and more confident when he drinks. No one understands me and alcohol makes me feel better. Blah...""

Lots of gross thinking there. In that I first week of sobriety I saw how shitty alcohol had really been for me. I saw I had been very lucky to make it through the past four years without having to go to the hospital, getting an STI, dying, losing my scholarships, or letting my grades slip. I knew I'd be moving back in with my parents soon and that I had a clear choice: I could continue drinking or change my habits. I chose to change my habits. 

I'm lucky in how easy it was for me to quit. I was suddenly whisked away from the people and environments where I'd done most of my drinking. I was back at home with my parents, who are very supportive of me while not making a huge deal about my decision to quit drinking. 

In my first two weeks home, I felt so good and fresh without drinking. I cleaned my room more thoroughly than it had ever been cleaned. I was very productive applying for jobs. I started lifting weights. Since then I've slowed down a little bit, but I've still been lifting and applying for jobs. I had one interview (didn't get the job) and have another one next week. 

I've only had a strong pull to drink a few times since coming home, all when I was feeling lonely. I'm looking at a few different organizations around here I can join while I'm looking for jobs so I can meet people and have some structure in my life.

Things that have helped me stay sober:

-This subreddit is number one, I've been on here every day since I quit
-Seltzer water
-The change of scenery
-Exercise
-Micro managing my nutrition 
-Having a good supportive friend 

Before I wrap this lengthy post up, I want to recount a major victory I had yesterday. Basically, I had signed up to serve beer at a music festival in exchange for free admission before I quit drinking. Yesterday I got the reminder email that that's what I would be doing and emailed the person in charge explaining the situation and asking if they could move me to another role. They were awesome and supportive and now I'll be helping sell art instead :)

Looking forward, I have no interest in drinking. I don't think it's something I can moderate and I hate the detrimental effect it has on my moods and my body. I think that sober me will be a much better employee and a much better partner once the stars align and I've got both of those things locked down. 

Thanks for being here and being so positive. I find I come here everyday not just because it helps me stay away from booze, but because it just makes my day that much better to see people who are fighting to improve their lives. You're all inspiring to me. And if you read all the way down here, you're doubly inspiring LOL. I got a bit carried away. "

I never had the looks; never had the talent; never had the brains; always had to be happy to languish in the middle of the pack. 

In college, I'd see others getting As and A+s while I could only be content with Bs and Cs. They get to see the world during exchange programs while I had to stay because my grades pale in comparison.

Finishing off college in 2016, I only manged to scrape a pass and haven't managed to secure a job since then, while I see others getting promotions and even my juniors getting jobs when they had just finished their own education. I can't even secure an interview for a trainee / internship position despite having a degree.

I keep telling myself that, you're not as bad as you think you are. You still have a roof over your head, 3 meals a day, and no worry as to whether you'll survive by the end of the month as I do have a supportive family. But I'm soon to be 27 with no career, and no relationship. No real sense of achievement after, what, 16 years of formal education. No sense that I have gained any meaningful after all those years.

People often say that everyone live their life differently and yours may not be the same as others but what is the point of living if you can't find anything worth redeeming about it? At the back of my head I know suicide is the worst thing to do but every morning, every night when I look at the mirror, I find it harder and harder to even muster up a fake smile for myself.

Every time I send resumes into the void, it gives me a small glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, this might be it. And every time I'm proven wrong again, that this is just another rejection in a dumpster pile of rejections. 

It's gotten to the point where I even lie to complete strangers about my situation. I'd be damned if that person I just met knew that I can't find a job after 13 months and judge me for it. Maybe he doesn't care, maybe he won't even remember; but I'm just so afraid of letting people know how worthless I am.

I recently got a job with a medium size startup. Initially it was an internship but they liked my work within the first week and decided to change the contract to a full time iOS developer. I am offered £18,000 salary for an internship it's fine but I'm not quite sure for a junior position. Any ideas would help or any thought on how I might renegotiate if you think I can"
6cpiay,3,2017-05-22,The perfect 14th season,braujo,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/6cpiay/the_perfect_14th_season/,"So I was talking to some friends and we started to think about how this season was weak and what we'd like to see in the next one of Grey's.  Personally, I would love to see the first part of the 14th season being about Jo and Jo's husband, Paul Stadler. I read this ""theory"" -- I wouldn't really consider it one because we don't have material enough to sustain it -- here where Jo is actually the bad guy in this story, so she'd be the abusive one, not Paul. 

So yeah, I think that the first part of the season should be about Paul coming to Grey-Sloan to make that lecture. At a first moment, everyone'd hate him, and Alex could even threaten him like we saw he doing to Jason back in season 9. Then the hospital would find out the truth about this whole thing and Jo would, I don't know, run away. She'd vanish for a while.

The second part of 14th season could start with Megan finally arriving in the Grey-Sloan -- I don't think she's going to be there after the fire, but eventually Owen will want to have her around -- and the whole Riggs-Mer-Megan thing would start. I don't really like this idea, though that's the only thing I'm sure is going to happen. 

The finale could be Jo coming back to revenge, I don't know. Maybe she'd even kill Maggie while going after Paul -- yes, I want him as a main cast. Gotta' love Matthew Morrison -- and/or Alex -- don't know if she'd want him dead, but I think this could add thrill to it soooo....

Also I'd just love to see something with Izzie's ""children"". If not a son/daughter she had with Alex's sperm, then Hannah Klein, the child  given up for adoption by her.  Now Hanna would have 21 years or something close to it-- Izzie was born in 1980. She had Hanna when 16, so it happened in 1996 --. The writers could put her in Grey-Sloan as a nurse or even as a genius intern, like they did with Maggie. I picture Hanna as a more mature Izzie, so it'd be cool to see. 

Sorry about my english. Anyway, I'd like to ask you guys what you'd like to watch next season. And what do you think about mine? Too goofy? Absurd? Terrible? haha

6cplzb,63,2017-05-22,"Penelope Christa's Birth Story! (positive labor experience, TW depression)",jasminrants,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/6cplzb/penelope_christas_birth_story_positive_labor/,"On May 18, my due date, I was about ready to have this pregnancy finally be done. I'd asked my doctor for an NST because I'm overly anxious in general, and everything was fine. She also stripped my membranes again, and set a tentative induction date for the 25th. I'd only dilated from 1 to 1 1/2 within a week, even after nights of excruciating contractions, so I was feeling pretty dejected and felt like I'd be pregnant for another week. 

So I spent the day laying around, having more contractions after the sweep, and quite a bit of bleeding. I was just watching Friends all afternoon, but I'd noticed that they were becoming more and more regular. Within an hour, it'd gone from 15 minute intervals to four minutes, and the pain ramped up so much within another hour that I couldn't help but cry and and moan/yell. My husband had come back from work at that point and we decided to call my OBGYN to see about what to do. He told us the usual ""Well you can come in and be checked, but this is your first time and it might be a while before you can be admitted, so stay at home as long as possible.""

After another hour, I just couldn't take the pain anymore. Legs, back and uterus seating with pain every three minutes, we made our way to the hospital on quite possibly the hottest day ever. They triaged me, and determined that I was only dilated to a three - fun. So I was offered morphine, which I gladly took, and wheeled off to my room. It took the edge off a little, and I got some rest. 

At around midnight, I felt a snap in my left side, and when I called the nurse to go pee afterwards, there was a huge gush of stained greenish fluid - my water had broken! And she'd taken a poop in there. It felt like it would never stop streaming, but I got really excited because I knew then that she'd have to come out within 24 hours. With the amniotic fluid gone, contractions had ramped up on the pain scale again, and so within about an hour, I asked for the epidural. 

Let me just tell you, I have the utmost respect for anybody who can go through labor without pain meds, but holy cow, that epidural was amazing. It worked like a charm - I got really lucky, I guess - and I got a good three, four hours of sleep in total. When I woke up, they checked me, and told me I was about ready to start pushing. Talk about a pleasant surprise to wake up to. 

So, after an hour, the room filled with people. The OBGYN, a resident, an intern, my wonderful nurse, a EMT intern, a NICU doctor because of the meconium, and my poor husband, all staring at my vagina, and 90% of them shoving their fingers around inside of me so I wouldn't tear. It lasted for an hour and a half, and I'm not going to lie, even with the epidural, it was the single most painful experience in my whole life. I had two second degree tears, and of course the stitches afterwards were painful as well, but when they laid her on my chest after examining her, it didn't matter. I remember shouting ""Look at her little conehead!"", and then just feeling the most overwhelming love. Labor was tough, but with the medication, and the way my nurse supported me, it felt like something I could do, and I think I'll forever be grateful to her for her amazing help. 

It's been a hard first few days, since she's been cluster feeding at very inopportune times, causing me to absolutely crash emotionally, and I had a bad experience with one nurse in particular, which upset me more than it should have, but Penelope is worth it all. She's worth the emotional turmoil that I'm in right now, and I know that it will still be difficult for quite a while, but I need to hold on, for her sake. I'm pretty sure this is PPD, and I'd expected it, having had issues with major depression before, so I've already asked to resume my medication and get a referral for a therapist, all that remains is figuring out the logistics. I'm horribly scared a lot, but her cute little face cheers me up when it gets harder. It'd be nice to have friends or even family around to help, but as it stands my husband and I are on our own. I just need to learn not to be so terrified that something will happen to her. 

So, if you've made it this far, here's the baby tax: [Penelope Christa](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/sOra4), born 05/19/17 at 07:26 am, weighing 7 lbs 11 oz and 21 1/2 inches long. She couldn't be any more perfect. "
6cq8mc,10,2017-05-22,New Civil Engineering student at VT,PolarBearCubGamer,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/6cq8mc/new_civil_engineering_student_at_vt/,"Hey there, fellow Civil Engineers!

I am currently a sophomore student attending Virginia Tech in the field of Civil Engineering. 

Originally I started out with Computer Engineering since my father told me there were greater job opportunities for it (which is true) and because I will earn a higher pay. But within the second semester of my freshman year, I really didn't like it because it didn't have much of a physical application to me: I wasn't really into circuit analysis, advanced compiling languages, or computer-embedded electronics at all, and I loved principles related for the design of buildings and other construction-related tasks (worked construction before Uni and loved it). I like the more physical stuff.

Many people say that Civil Engineering is relatively easier than all other forms of engineering, but make no mistake, I didn't switch to it because of this ""supposed"" relative easiness to other majors, but because I actually love to design things and see how different materials interact under different stresses, field work, exciting projects at times, etc...

On the other hand, I do know some of the cons of Civil Engineering such as it's ""cyclical"" nature in the economy: sometimes jobs are booming in number across the country, and other times (in some areas) jobs are quite scarce to find, so it is more economy-driven than other engineering disciplines (save for Petroleum Engineering). My upperclassman friend in Engineering also stated that, during his internship (specifically structural/construction), there were long hours at times due to mistakes in design or poor management of the projects.

Again, I really love the idea of what Civil Engineers do, even if it takes long hours or if it is a cyclical industry, this is what I really love to do. My father was quite angry when I decided to switch, and told me that I wouldn't be able to pin down or locate a job. He always had pessimistic views towards my personal decisions, and he was mad because ""instead of going for the money/where the jobs are"", I decided to go for ""what I truly like to do/is applicable to my personal interests"".

I have several questions:

1.) Is Statics class the hardest class a Civil Engineer will take? Many upperclassmen said that Statics is the hardest class they took, and that all other classes were a breeze compared to Statics.

2.) Do all Civil Engineers have to take the PE exam and pass it? Is the FE exam required too?

3.) How is the job market for Civil Engineering as of now? To make it easier, please state your city, state, and company so that I may see where the trend is growing and where I can possibly intern at next year.

4.) Would you suggest a graduate degree in Civil Engineering? I plan to finish this Bachelor's in three years and go directly into the workforce. 

5.) Are there any sub-specializations of Civil Engineering? Do I need a graduate degree to attain these specializations?

6.) This may be quite individual, but how is the work/family/personal time balance for you Civil Engineers?

7.) What was the hardest project you managed/constructed/assisted with?

8.) Can a B.S.E. in Civil Engineering allow me to work for project management as well? Will it also translate into some other engineering fields of work as well?

Thank you fellow redditors for taking the time to respond and to give me your insights, and I appreciate all the assistance from your responses! This is quite an important decision for me, and I can also PM anyone if they want to know specific details about my CivilE curriculum at Virginia Tech, specific information, extra-assistance.

6cqmr6,4,2017-05-22,Monthly Feature #1 - Camissao,Gringoface5,society6,https://www.reddit.com/r/society6/comments/6cqmr6/monthly_feature_1_camissao/,"**As you all know, the Society6 sub is a community of Society6 artists to share our latest work and get advice from each other.**
**In this month's feature, we get to know the artist behind [Camissao](https://www.society6.com/camissao).**

**Where are you from?** I am from France and currently live in the UK.
**How long have you been a member of Society6?** I have been a member for around 6 months now.
**What has been one or more of your major or minor victories as an artist?** I’d say it was the first time I had a paid commission that wasn’t from friends or family. It’s nice to have people you don't know appreciate and value your work.
**You have been featured on Society6 (also DesignbyHumans- Design of the Day and currently the Artist of the Week - Congrats on both of those). Those are victories we all hope for. Have those features propelled your success? Did you see an immediate increase in sales and followers after?** I wouldn’t say “propelled” as it feels a bit strong. I think for both websites it had a different impact. For Society6 my follower base started expanding a bit faster, but also I had more followers that didn’t have stores, hence potential buyers. For DesignByHumans there has been a lot more visits on my shop (very useful to be able to see that!) and finally made my first sale here, as I’ve been here for a shorter time. As for sales on society6, it’s increasing slowly (and hopefully surely).
**Is there a piece of work that is one of your favorites, either in your process of creation and/or end product?**  I’d say [Prickly Gymnastic](https://society6.com/product/prickly-gymnastic_print#s6-6906246p4a1v45). Any piece I make that includes flowers or plants takes me longer because of the amount of detail, but the harder the work the better the feeling of satisfaction. It’s also the piece that has been a bit of a jackpot for me. It’s the one that’s been selling the most in a short time and that started getting me featured on DesignByHuman.
**Where else can we find your work? Any Social Media or other Print-on-Demand sites to share?** I started on Instagram [@camissao](https://www.instagram.com/camissao/), I’m now trying out Twitter as well [@camissaoLS](https://twitter.com/camissaoLS), even though I’m terrible at it haha. As for print-on-demand sites like you mentioned, I’m on DesignByHumans, Curioos, and RedBubble (isn’t it a saying in English, never put all your eggs in one basket!)
**Is art your primary focus, or do you have other obligations (other jobs, is your art a side job that you would like to be a main one, etc.)?** I’m a graduate in graphic design. I got my postgraduate degree last year but it’s been a bit tough, to be honest. I’ve been living off of savings and commissions all whilst looking for a job, but there are very few companies that are willing to take in graduates, and even when they do, most won’t pay you, which I think sets a horrible example for people that want to hire artists for commissions. No one should be doing work for free, and I’m surprised that companies keep on advertising unpaid internships as I recently learned it is illegal in the UK (sorry if that was a bit of a rant!). So yes, ideally I'd like to start my career in graphic design but for now, I'm just trying out for anything, as long as I don't have a heart attack when looking at my bank account at the end of the month!
**Ranting is 100% allowed, as people are always asking for free work. I recently did a design for a Starbucks, because FREE is never an option. For someone who is just starting on Society6, what is one piece of advice you'd give them?** I’m not sure, I’m not really an expert haha. I think though when you create art if you’re not sure about a certain piece, don’t ditch it. The truth is your favourite piece probably won’t be your customer’s favourite. There are artworks that I thought I’d never sell and in the end, they are more popular than pieces that are, in my opinion, stronger and have a better aesthetic. Do what represents you but never forget that everyone is different and see things in a different light.

**That is excellent advice. I trust all the effort you are putting in is paying off, as I have been seeing your work every where. We all look forward to your next piece of art. Congratulations and good luck in your future successes.** 

**Please take a moment and follow Camissao on all media as showing support is a pay-it-forward process.**

6cr043,67,2017-05-22,B4 background check turned up a misdemeanor that I thought was expunged. Advice needed,Bounce1856,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6cr043/b4_background_check_turned_up_a_misdemeanor_that/,"I accepted an offer to intern with a Big 4 last August, and my start date is June 15th. This past Thursday, I received a call from their HR asking me why I did not disclose the misdemeanor DWAI on my record. I explained the situation and she asked me to email her a statement on Friday morning as to why I did not disclose this.

In my statement, I told her the absolute truth, which was: the offense occurred when I was 17. I accepted a plea deal in which all of my charges would be expunged as long as I completed probation and other requirements. I successfully completed everything and the case was closed in 2014. At that time, the court, my probation officer, and my lawyer assured me that the charges had been sealed and I did not need to disclose them on job applications. She emailed me back a short time later and said that she would forward my response to the internal team responsible for due diligence and she would contact me if she needed any more information.

Later that day, I called the court to figure out what was going on and I found out they never fucking sealed my record. For 3 years I had every reason to believe that my record was clean, but I guess that isn't the case. I submitted a petition to seal it but I have to wait on a hearing date. It probably won't be sealed until mid-summer at best. 

My resume is strong, as I just graduated Cum Laude, was the president of Beta Alpha Psi last semester, am entering a MACC program, and have done case competitions with this firm. I know many of the partners on a first name basis and know that they would vouch for me if it came down to it. 

I'm sick to my stomach guys. I have no back up plan. If I had known that my record was still dirty I would have disclosed it, but now I'm afraid that my integrity is in question as it's my word against theirs. I sent in my statement on Friday at 10am, and it's now almost 6 on Monday. I've been mentally preparing to have my offer rescinded all weekend.

Does anybody have any experience with this type of situation or have any insight as to how they might handle my case?"

*Masters*: U Toronto (Doctoral),  UBC, Western (PhD stream), Oxford, Duke MAPE (really interested in this program)


I had a few speed bumps to put it lightly and a streak of A- that I would rather like to take back but can do nothing about. I worked exceptionally hard on my honors analysis course. Analysis II grade has not been released but I am guessing average or better (did get an A- on the midterm). The course is very difficult and the second course in the sequence is at the level of my institution's graduate analysis (Used Royden). And in my statement of purpose I believe I can make a good case that I rushed the math due to the fact that I switched from business major where I never completed more than single variable calculus. 

With this largely mediocre profile I am unsure of the range of schools to apply to. I have some masters listed because I believe now I am ""competitive"" with my peers and so will be able to do well when given a chance to just focus on new content and thus will have a better chance at top schools. Irregardless, can anyone recommend a range of schools to apply or a particular school which would be a good fit. Also, for the masters programs, what are my chances?

6crw86,4,2017-05-22,[libido][fantasy] The only thing that turns me on anymore is thinking about my boyfriend having sex with someone else...help?,confusedontues,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/6crw86/libidofantasy_the_only_thing_that_turns_me_on/,"**Long, desperate for r/sex advice post ahead**  

&amp;nbsp;

So my boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. I've always had a normal libido, while he's had a high libido. My ""normal"" meant sex whenever we saw each other (at least 3 times a week), masturbating in between, practicing BDSM, heavy making out, and actually *wanting* these things.   

&amp;nbsp;

Then, a ton of shit happened. He got an internship in another part of the country, which wasn't a huge deal, because we had an end date to the LDR. However, this is also my first relationship and I'm really independent - far more so than my bf - so our communication did suffer a bit. Then, my dad's cancer came back, untreatable this time, so *I* moved across the country to take care of him until he died. Then surprise! Dad had no will and left behind a ton of bills, a hoarder-level house, and not much money. So I stayed home for months to get things as far along as possible in terms of settlement (not far enough, the battle is ongoing). 

&amp;nbsp;

In the middle of all of that, I was living with my mom, and all three of my sisters, my niece, my step-dad, and my sister's boyfriend in a 3 bedroom house. I was sleeping on the floor, roaches were biting me, mice running across my bed,I was babysitting my niece because my sister is not a good mom, all while still working my job remotely, on a three hour time difference. So I was a *bit* stressed. Then, my boyfriend's grandpa died, so I was also trying to be supportive of him whilst trying not to just book a one-way ticket to a very remote place and never be seen again. In the midst of all of that, we were supporting each other, but it was a lot and I put on weight, which turned my body issues up tenfold and turned my libido down to nothing. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, and they also got turned up tenfold.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, 8 months after my dad dying and 3 months after our LDR becoming just a regular R, my libido still hasn't come back in full. It's had its moments, but those moments are typically tied to my ovulation. I'm in therapy working through my dads death and the resultant binge eating order and all the other shit that would require a whole new post. For a while, watching porn together worked, but now even that doesn't really do it for me and my libido is just kaput. Gone. I don't masturbate, I don't think about sex unless prompted, and worst of all, I don't want sex with my boyfriend.

&amp;nbsp;

So, we've talked about the issue inside and out. Nothing is working, I'm frustrated with myself because I want to please him but I can't. He's frustrated because he's crazy attracted to me and has a high libido but I can't get into it. Like even kissing turns me off. I can't get into anything. So, we've hammered out an agreement that lets him have sex outside the relationship while I try to work out my libido. I'm fine with this - I suggested it, we've planned it out, I chose his pics for his Tinder profile. The rest of our relationship is so strong that neither of us are concerned. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, to my problem. My libido has been hiding in it's little hidey hole for months. Then, we start talking about my boyfriend having sex with other women. And the thought has been turning me on. A LOT. The idea has always been sexy, but now it's the only thing that makes me tingle. Like every time we bring it up, I get *excited* picturing him fucking a hot black girl with a big butt (his fave) and coming all over her. Writing that turned me on **a ton.**

&amp;nbsp;

But now I don't know what to do. How can we channel this into sex between us? I don't want all of our sex to be initiated because I'm thinking of him with another woman, I want it to be...normal? Is this the only hope for my libido? 

&amp;nbsp;

Literally any guidance would be appreciated, sorry for the long post but I though the detail would help eliminate some questions in the comments. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Even just advice on increasing my libido would be helpful.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR**: My libido disappeared due to non-stop chaos, and now the only thing that gets me horny is thinking about my boyfriend enthusiastically banging a hot chick.

I'm a graduate of UNSW and am now working in the Macquarie Park area looking to help young uni students and guide them through uni so they can achieve their end goals.

A bit about me, 24M graduated UNSW with a business information technology degree in 2014 and have worked as a graduate for a global tech company (the biggest one). Before that I worked as an technology intern at one of Australia's most well known retailers.

I've recently become a professional hire at another global technology company around the Macquarie Park area. 

I went through uni without a mentor and can now see how much easier it'd be if someone showed me the ropes. 

There's so many tech professionals around MacUni but I'm not aware of any mentoring/mentor opportunities. 

So I'm looking to take on mentoring as a way of giving back. 

PM me if you'd be interested."
6csnrq,18,2017-05-23,Economic Slavery,k3vincast,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/6csnrq/economic_slavery/,"I watched the Wife of Lot video. I have begun the process of studying to prepare for every which way my family will approach me about this video, but I don't care. I am currently in school planning on saving up as much as possible and then going to graduate school. When I am finished with my schooling I am moving away from were I live. I don't live with family or anyone for that matter but I am in the territory and a sister lives two doors away from me and is noisy. I want to live as myself and out myself in the EXJW community. I just can't right now.

But on to the point of my post. More than the bunker video, more than the disfellowshipped video this RTWOL video is the worst video the society could have ever made. The b0rg is condemning thousands to lives of struggle and disappointment. The GB doesn't know how the economy is for people without an education, just how difficult it is for millions in America. I believe they still think is like in the 70's, 80's or 90's were if you had a pulse and could tie your shoelaces you got a job. Now due to the gig economy and repressed wages it is getting increasingly harder to make ends meet. 

In the future a major change to economy will hit and witnesses 40 or younger without the proper college degree will be ruined. Robots and AI will take over all the jobs that witnesses do to support themselves. There are already window cleaner robots. The car I want will soon drive itself, and malls around American are closing as people shop online. 

That video is clearly misleading and it shows how the society doesn't understand how reality works. To live in their original apartment both parents would need to work. Did you see their first place? It was huge and in NYC even in the worst areas it would cost 2000-2500 a month. Then after the wife gets the job they move into an apartment that even some employees of Goldman Sach would struggle to afford. The second apartment would cost 5000-7000 in NYC it had a terrace and she was able to afford a new grand piano.

That's the intellectual dishonesty of the organization. They show a family that has way more then what most witnesses have and then portray it as possible because of their belief in Jehober. Also showing the mom as being unreasonable despite the fact she's probably suffering from PTSD from when she had less. I was homeless twice in my life and sometimes I can't go to sleep because of the fear of being homeless again keeps me up. A few things stood out to me about how evil the video was.

- When Gloria got her job as a Real Estate Agent why didn't they say at their current apartment and save? In every organization video when people's cost of living went up they immediately start living at it or beyond.
- Why Gloria shown as being unreasonable for wanting to get a job? She had one daughter in college and wanted to contribute to the cost of expenses in the family.
- The new apartment was shown as a unspiritual choice by Gloria, but I'm sure her husband agreed to it too and moved the family into the apartment.
- Don't spend time with non witnesses family, especially if they are not talking about Jehober or the organization. Do you just want to see how loved ones are? Sorry in the b0rg you can't, but it's not a cult or breaks up families. I can understand if there was improper behavior at the family gathering but people were speaking low, dressed amazing and professional. 
- Don't go to college or get internships because you might work with someone who has two mothers!
- If you meet someone that has two moms or dads you must let them know that you don't agree with their parents lifestyle, not their lifestyle their parents. 
- The internship the daughter had was not that. There are strict guidelines on how much time an intern can work since they are usually in school at the same time. 
- While your at it drop out because reasons, did you also notice that she had blue fingernails when she was ""Interning"" but when she quit it was gone.
- What are they going to do about their new apartment? You sign at least one year leases. 

Teens and Children will now be pressured to not go to college, like I was when I was younger. The economy with become a true two tier economy, with educated information brokers on the top and uneducated manual labor struggling at the bottom. Parent and Children will make decisions about their futures listening to 7 men who haven't worked out in the real world in decades.

Writing that sentence is hard. Everything has been going so right for me, how could I possibly give up on it all, you may ask. 

Because I'm not worth it. Or at least so I thought. I have accomplished more in my twenty years than many others accomplish in a lifetime, and I am very grateful for the opportunities I have received. 

I attend a prestigious university, have a high GPA, and a secure internship for the summer. But despite much success, I couldn't help but feel hollow. 

This is depression. This is what it does to even the most successful of people. Suicidal ideation is very real, and something that should not be taken lightly. It can creep up at the worst of times, or as in this past month, at the best of times. 

I began to seclude myself from those around me, cry in my room over nothing, carry a knot in my stomach as I went from class to class, class to work, and work to my dorm again. What motivation can a person have left to live when they've given up?

I went out for dinner with friends, and even then, I never felt so alone. As they mingled over food and drinks, I thought of the many ways I could harm myself after returning to my room. Afraid of myself, I could not imagine being left to my own devices. 

Now, looking back on that night, I fear the “What Ifs.” What if I hadn't reached out, what if I hadn't called my mom at that very moment to rescue me? Where would I be now? Six feet under? 

It takes courage to reach out, to be vulnerable to others. And there is strength in that vulnerability. My feelings are valid, and I define my own self-worth. I have much to live for:amazing support groups both on campus and at home, dreams to accomplish, and a future to live for. 

No, I did not kill myself this month. I am a survivor of depression, and please know that if you are in the same position, having the same thoughts, things will improve. Just give yourself the chance to try. Live.

I read textbooks on R, but that's not the option, most of them are oriented for intro or in best case for intermediate users. Moreover, I think I learn best when I actually need R for some sort of real problem solving. Unfortunately my scope of work does not require deep analysis.

There are not many job options for data scientist in my city(and in country as a whole), good options require really highly skilled professionals. I had a look for freelance options, but projects I've seen also require very high skills. 

Is there some kind of online internships in which I could participate in developing projects on R and have a chance to gain more experience?

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
6cukrw,17,2017-05-23,[GoG] Short story on the incredible attitude and generosity of u/Myte342 - Thank you once again!!,TeamAce,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/6cukrw/gog_short_story_on_the_incredible_attitude_and/,"Hey guys,

So, I created a thread for MGS V here on GoG (link on the bottom), requesting the game because I'm a fan of the series since playing MGS I in the old days, because I had tried Ground Zeroes (a demo version, kinda) and loved it, and because I was 100% confident that I would love the gameplay, the story and all the content that it was to play during months and months to come. Since it had a nice promotion, I thought ""Hey, why not, let's give it a try"".

Not too long after creating the thread, I was already having some support. The thread was being upvoted (which, to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if it was the opposite; I've seen to many giveaways where the appliers just downvote them so they have more chances to win it) and a reply from a fellow redditor saying he was going to gift me the game when he could. I couldn't believe it! Created a request just a few hours ago, was made visibile from who read it and it lead to a generous person who was actually going to gift me the game. How awesome is this?

But the story doesn't end here. We were both working, and, as so, Myte342 said he would buy the game when he got home in a few hours. Time had passed, and maybe 7/8 hours after, he sent a message saying that when he got home, the promotion had already ended... the game price was back to $20, but even then he said he would give me the game.

Since it was my fault, since I was the one who created the thread with the request a few hours before the ending of the promotion - fact that I wasn't aware of; I found out about the promotion the day before, but thought it would go on for a few days, at least -, I told him that it was okay if he wanted to retreated the offer, since that wasn't what he had ""agreed"" on; $8 is one thing, $20 is another... as so, I wasn't expecting for anything else, and would probably try to create another request in a few months or when another cool promotion appeared.

Much to my surprise, I had a friend invite on Steam from Myte. I accepted, of course, and a few minutes later... I gifted me the game!! Not only that, but the f*cking Definite Edition, with that Ground Zeroes ""demo version"" (that serves as a short prequel, basically) and all the DLC packs for the Main Game and Online feature!!! I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The promotion had ended, but he still bought me the game and an edition even better that what I could possibly expected, it was the ""complete"" version of the game... Oh man... I'm currently installing the game, of course, and I'm sure I will have a blast with it. Anything less than enjoying the game to it's fullest would be a shame, since the great act of generosity (well, and because the game is damn incredible).

I apologise for this text being quite long, but I wouldn't want to thank u/Myte342 with just a simple paragraph and that would be it. I wanted to know not only how I appreciated the community of Gift of Games for ""acknowledging"" my thread and giving it some support, but also (and specially) to praise Myte's attitude and generosity, that was definitely the most kind act I've seen here on reddit to my person. As I said on the request thread, this community is unbelievable. I can't buy games right now, since I'm still completing my dissertation and working on two unpaid internships, but will definitely repay GoG when I get my job (possibly more or less in a year), for this massive generosity as a subsection of reddit.

Thank you for reading and thanks once again for u/Myte342, an huge shutout for him!!!

Russia, seems to have a deep seated problem, however... and how is that going to be solved? What is it that can be done to wake the government of that country up? Does the country have a problem with how privacy is dealt with... privacy of families, businesses and individuals, and former government officials. Is their relationship to privacy, part of a thing that makes government corruption - past and present - sometimes hard to deal with?

I was thinking recently pretty deeply about why Russia is still such an ornery country in the world. It seems to have never quite gotten the memo about being a modern Western civilization that works together with other countries and where policies are implemented fairly, on behalf of the public's interest. 

I watched the Academy Award winning 1971 film ""Fiddler on the Roof"" recently. This is a story about the pogroms in the Ukraine, when this region was a part of Czarist Russia. As I understand the story, these very religious people - like the Amish in Pennsylvania - decided to create little settlements that weren't permitted by Moscow, and they were eventually evicted. Another way to read the story, however, is that they were communities which would not implement the draconian policies that the Czar was demanding, and it looks as if they were sheltering rebellious people from outside the community. These rebels eventually became those who marched and fought for their rights, in the Bolshevik Revolution. 

The odd thing is, however, that the USSR continued to suprress religion during the years of its existence. It seems to me to be very unusual that a revolution happens, but then the same policies that seeded that revolution are continued, in some way. Over here, in the USA, we tend to make heroes out of people who were once oppressed by society. The black people are the heroes we regale in thinking about our own Civil War. Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever as a saint, because he freed the slaves in the Confederate South. The Jews are the heroes of WWII... All the European nations have given accolades to Washington DC, for not only saving their own butts from the Nazis, but also for uncovering and stopping the genocide of the Jews, in Nazi controlled parts of Europe.

Now, maybe not everyone knows this, but the acronym NAZI stands for ""Nationalist Socialist Party of Germany."" To use modern parlance, it was a ""communist takeover"" of Germany that happened under Adolf Hitler. What does this mean? Well, through the lens of our thinking as a world during the Cold War, we could easily draw some conclusions about Soviet influence in the rise of the NAZI party in Germany.

The question then becomes, ""Wouldn't the Soviets have become natural allies of a communist regime that had come into being in Germany?"" There were some very sketchy things that happened during the rise of the Nazi regime. There were these ""brown shirt"" folks who were rambunctious people who assaulted others on the streets who were against the eventual rise of this Nazi Party. Of course, there were also organic internal forces that would make a nationalist movement like the Nazis attractive to a certain segment of German voters. Germany was suffering grievously under the economic trade restraints imposed on it after WWI. In fact, the ""Marshall Plan"" - where the US and others chipped in to help rebuild the German economy after WWII - was done because it was recognized that these economic hardships had driven the nationalist sentiment that led to the rise of the Nazis.

Let's turn our attention to the genocide of the Jews. How and why did this occur?  Let's start putting the pieces of that puzzle together, realizing that even morally bankrupt people have motivations for their actions. One has to remember that our own beloved USA had a policy of rounding up ethnically Japanese people and putting them into internment camps during the same war. So, this was what a modern civilized country was expected to do as policy, during a time of war, right? However, this was also eerily similar to what happened under the Nazi regime. 

The Nazis saw the Jewish people as being potential traitors, and they wanted them all rounded up. 

Of course, Jewish people had been controversial for a long time in Europe. Famous writers like Oscar Wilde dissed them, in their writings. Shakespeare, in 1500, in the ""Merchant of Venice"" portrays Jews in a very skeptical way. Some Jews in Europe were very wealthy, and I imagine that there would be some concern about that. Maybe some Jews were fingered as being partially responsible for Germany and Austria-Hungary's losses in WWI? I don't know... but honestly they would have been seen as upstanding citizens by most people, nonetheless - as they had been for hundreds of years. So, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that the Nazis coined the term ""the final solution"" to refer to the genocide of the Jews. What is wrapped up in that phrase? It sounds as if they were trying to plan out a different course of action to deal with this segment of society, and things just kept going wrong. If the Nazi regime was secretly a client state of (or at least one with strong diplomatic ties to) the other communist country in the area -  the USSR - wouldn't the Nazi leaders have been discussing their plans with the USSR beforehand? The USSR was also waging expansionist wars. It took a big chunk of Finland before it joined the Allies in WWII. After WWII, it took the eastern countries that it had walked over in the war, and made them into colonies of the USSR.

Obviously, there were too many Jewish people to intern in the same way the Americans did with the Japanese. Perhaps, there was talk about putting some dissidents in these concentration camps, and not making them a destination for every Jew on the continent. There was that wrought iron sign saying ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work makes free) over the gates of Auschwitz.This says to me that probably these places had been intended to be work camps. However, once you intern one person or two out of a community without due process, all of their friends are going to be a problem for your government; you've just poured gasoline on a fire, in some sense, right?  

Moscow had big problems with the Jews under the Czarist regime - and in fact, they had led to terrible civil unrest - and eventually the Bolshevik Revolution. This makes me think that the hamfisted nature in which the Nazis dealt with the problem of what to do with the Jews has a history that has never been told.

My guess is that the Soviet diplomats were in a room with the Nazi diplomats at one point, and there was a nod and a wink given that made the Nazis believe that the USSR might be willing to take trainloads of Jews who were deported from Germany, en masse. There is a lot more room in Siberia for work camps, than there is in Germany - and it would have been easier to house them out there. Then, for some reason, the Soviets didn't ever get back to the Nazi leadership on the matter. 

I'm not sure if any of the above paragraph is true... but I think it's a solid line of reasoning.

If something like this were true, it would explain a lot of draconion Soviet Era policies in East Germany. It would also help me to understand why Putin thinks he can act without consequences in places like Ukraine... simply annexing the Crimea. If a child learns that he can get away with something without being caught, he becomes more and more sly and mischievous, when it comes to disobeying his parents. Do some people in the Russian regime privately think its a hoot that this little tidbit of history didn't ever get known by the West - all through the decades of the Cold War?

The Nazis, of course, burnt the government records before the nation finally fell to the Allies. The war criminals who were prosecuted may have talked a lot at the time about the overall social issues that undergirded their own regime's rise to power... but they may have stopped short of announcing details of collaboration with the Soviets - most would have known nothing, but those who did would be shy because the Soviets had occupied such a large chunk of the country.  People would have friends and relatives over there, who could be vulnerable to retaliation. 

Now, if this sort of thing were true and if it were bandied about widely today, I'll bet the Russian government would have to answer to its people. If the Soviet government could be, in any way, found to be complicit with the Nazis when it came to the genocide... that would really cause a public uproar. The importance of the Jewish communities who silently resisted the Czar before the Bolshevik Revolution is a very important chapter in Russian history.

If things that have yet to be unearthed about Soviet history come out, now... I think it might cause massive political changes in Russia. But again, this is just speculation.

Note: All weights are in pounds

Date Started: 1/9/2017

Date Finished: 5/23/2017

Gender: Male

Age: 23

Height: 6 ft 4 in

Starting Bodyweight: ~214

Ending Bodyweight: ~217* after first cycle, 223-224 after second cycle (I creatine loaded during cycle 1 week 4 which accounts for 1-2 pounds of the bodyweight)

Waist Size: 34.5 in to 34.75 in

**Training Background:**
I come from an active background pre-lifting because I played a lot of baseball and basketball. I started lifting about 4 years ago at this point, but my first couple years were just general bro-lifting and don’t really count so much. I also lost around a year of progress due to a pinched nerve in my low back, but all of my real progress up to this point has come from 6 months of SS, and then another 6 of the Texas Method. I decided to run this even though I’m not really considered advanced enough for it, because my lifts stalled pretty hard during the Fall months, especially my Bench Press, and I was looking for something with a good mix of high intensity and high volume to get some new PRs, and because moving heavier weights is fun. 

**Things Changed**
There were some important modifications I made, especially for lower body because I was doing it for two lifts instead of one, but I was able to keep the integrity of the program intact. For Bench Press, I kept it pretty consistent between the two cycles. On the intensity day earlier in the week, I replaced the 5x5 overload work with three heavy sets of seated DB OHP. I did this for a few reasons. First, it was just too much heavy benching in one day for my shoulders to handle. I tried it for the first few weeks of cycle 1, and just had to drop it out because of shoulder blade pain that was creeping up. In addition, I was giving up barbell overhead pressing, and I wanted to include something that would hit my shoulders pretty hard to in some way compliment all of the benching. For the volume bench day, I cut down the incline benching to 3 sets for the same shoulder reasons. I also changed the DB incline to DB OHP, and I cut out the 3x8 CG bench, again because overworked shoulders. Also didn’t do the ab wheel because I’m lazy.

For squats and sumo deadlifts, obviously changes needed to be made. The first cycle, I had an intensity day where I did the 10 sets of squats, then I deadlifted but cut it down to 6 sets (3x3, 2x2, 1x1 with the prescribed weights). The volume day in the first cycle was as faithful as I could be to the program, and I did assistance work like front squats, leg press, RDLs, leg curls, and calf raises. I also did lots of banded hip thrusts and banded TKEs for prehab on each of the days.

For the second cycle, I tried something different for lower body. I had a squat day and a sumo deadlift day, where for each lift I did the 10 prescribed sets, and then I did a moderate amount of assistance work between the two days (compared to the first cycle) so that I didn’t run myself into the ground. I also added in a third speed/power day, where I did power snatches, power cleans, and box jump variations. 

**I did TONS of Upper Back Work**
I seriously did a lot. The first cycle I had two dedicated upper back days, and the second cycle I wasn’t able to do this because I had 3 lower days, so I split the upper back work across them and kept the total volume the same. The lifts I focused on were lat pulldowns, close grip lat pulldowns, Kroc rows, cable rows, band assisted pullups, and barbell rows. I also did a fair amount of dedicated bicep work to try to ward off any potential elbow pain. I really attribute this, cutting out just as much volume as I needed to, and lots of stretching and foam rolling to keeping my shoulders pain-free.

**Deathbench for Squat and Deadlift Discussion**
Overall, the toughest squatting and deadlifting I have ever done. For each cycle, the first few weeks were challenging but not terrible, and then it progressively got harder until the last week, where there were some truly crazy grinders. First cycle I hit all the numbers, second cycle I stalled hard on week 7 for each lift. I could only do sets of 2 instead of 3. I basically just did whatever I could manage for each set with the prescribed weights, and in week 9 I ended up squatting 300x4 for just one set, and then just deadlifting 315x1 so that I wasn’t burned out for testing my maxes in week 10. 

**Deathbench for Bench Press Discussion**
This was so much fun, I loved all of the benching and wished I didn’t have to cut a little bit of the volume out on the assistance work. The first cycle, weeks 6-7 were the hardest but I got all the numbers. The second cycle, in week 7 I had to cut it down to 5x2, 3x1 from the prescribed 5x3, 3x2. I basically just followed this throughout, and I was still able to get the prescribed 215x2x5 in Week 9, although some reps were very grindy. 

**Standing Press, Power Clean, and Front Squat Discussion**
This was really special for my OHP, it went up 25 pounds (125 to 150) over the 5 months even though I never actually trained it once during that time. I attribute the gains to the heavy DB overhead pressing and transfer from all of the benching that I had been doing. For power clean, I really didn’t have a strict progression. I just went by feel, focusing on sets of 2 and 3, moving up in weight when it was feeling good, and also doing a fair amount of hang cleans. For front squat, it probably came from front squatting as an assistance movement as well as general gains in leg strength. Most sets were 2-5 reps, and I would do anywhere from 3-5 sets in a workout.

**Program as a Whole**
Hard work but tons of fun, and you get to do a lot of variety, using both heavy weights and lighter exercises for hypertrophy. It was a great blend of higher intensity work and higher volume work and I really enjoyed it. It was a nice change of pace and gave me some steady gains. Only thing is you’d better plan on bulking while you do this, otherwise you’ll burn yourself out and maybe even get hurt. 

**What’s Next?**
I want to keep running this style of training for the big 3, but I also want to incorporate some OHP, especially because I got some sweet gains from not even training it. I’m really just an intermediate lifter and this is intended to be an advanced program, but I think I’ve shown that it can be very effective for an intermediate. Unfortunately, I may not be able to run another cycle until September. This summer (starting in a week and a half) I will be doing a strength and conditioning internship, and the site wants me to do a program that they’ll give me in order to get a better appreciation for what we will be putting the athletes through. From what I understand they encourage you to also do your own workouts, but it depends on what they have me do whether or not I will be able to run another cycle this summer (obviously if they have me doing a fair amount of benching and squatting I’m not about to do deathbench on top of it). I don’t want to flood the sub with reviews of this program, but to my knowledge this is the first review of deathbench for more than one cycle, and I have not seen anyone try it for all the big 3 lifts other than myself. If I end up doing another 2 or 3 cycles and continue to see great progress, then I’ll do another review later next year. 

Shoutout to /u/mdisbrow , you have made an excellent program!

6cyk31,7,2017-05-23,Should I go into computer engineering at Queens?,gameofpoetry,queensuniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/6cyk31/should_i_go_into_computer_engineering_at_queens/,"I can't decide between Software Engineering at Carleton or computer engineering at Queens. I visited Queens and absolutely loved it. The reason why I am hesitant to go to Queens is because my end goal is to become a software engineer. 

Would a computer engineering degree from Queens prepare me  to become a software engineer? I already know how to code in two languages, and I plan on learning more coding languages over the summers. But, I am afraid that an employer would prefer a computer science students or a software engineering student over a computer engineering student for software related jobs.  

Also, how difficult is it to get an internship as a computer engineering student? I heard that at Carleton they have a great co-op program. 

Thank you!

6cyuam,3,2017-05-23,I [20/F] am jealous of my boyfriend [20/M] of two years,missingblergh,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6cyuam/i_20f_am_jealous_of_my_boyfriend_20m_of_two_years/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little more than two years. We both attend the same college. We're in similar majors, with similar career goals. We're in the same clubs.

I don't measure up to him at all.

His GPA is significantly better than mines, in a much harder major. Even the classes we've both taken, he did better. In our hobbies, he's better than me. I'm significantly behind skill-wise (both compared to him, and everyone involved in our clubs). He's even held leadership for two years, and I'm still struggling on basic things.

He's been accepted into a competitive summer internship, with high potential for relative opportunities from finishing it. The skills, experiences, resources, etc. will help him either get a job after college or go onto graduate school. He's also getting paid a boatload of money for this internship, and getting housing and transportation paid for.

I will be taking a full summer worth of classes (AGAIN) because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life last year, and to fix my GPA. I will be going further into debt (he's graduating college debt free) to do this, and will have to work to cover my living expenses during the summer. He's getting scholarships on top of scholarships on top of parental assistance, and I won't even be working enough hours in the fall to support most of my living expenses. 

I will also need to take more classes after graduation (maybe a year's worth) to become eligible for a lot of the things I want to do. My career goals, including what graduate programs I want to do, are more ambitious than his, but I'm in a significantly worse position to attempt these goals. He has a better shot at what I want to do, than I do.

His parents paid for his car, and I can't even drive, let alone afford a car. Many of the part time jobs I'm interested in (to help with my graduate school application) require a valid driver's licenses, and presumably a car. So I'm stuck working retail right now, which isn't helping my future at all (besides letting me pay bills, and I realize not everyone has that fortunate).

I've been really jealous of him for quite a while now. I still love him dearly and he loves me, and I would NEVER do anything to sabotage his success. I just wish I was successful as well. Or rather, as successful as he is, with as many things going for me. I can't even listen to him give me any good news, because I will instantly go into a bad mood (sad, crying, depressed). I listen to be supportive, but it's getting to a point where he's hesitant to tell me, because he knows it's going to make me feel bad. He tells me that it's not that serious, and that he doesn't really care about these things, so I should either. He tells me that he's not that great, or special, or smart, or talented, etc. But, compared to me, he is. He doesn't want me to place him on a pedestal, so to speak, but I keep doing it automatically.

I'm at home right now until summer classes start, and he called me today to tell me about his internship adventures. Everything is going awesome for him, and I'm happy for him, but sad for myself. I started crying on the phone, but not enough for him to notice.

What can I do to fix this? (I'm expecting any answers to be directed towards my attitude towards the situation)

tl;dr: My boyfriend is comparatively more successful than I am (GPA, life experiences/skills, etc), and it bothers me. I wish I was as great as he is, even though he keeps insisting he's not. I need to fix this, because it is another unnecessarily stressful part of my life."
6cyucz,18,2017-05-23,Hey dad. Let's catch up.,renoka,PepTalksWithPops,https://www.reddit.com/r/PepTalksWithPops/comments/6cyucz/hey_dad_lets_catch_up/,"It's been almost 3 years since I last heard your voice and seen you alive and well. A lot has happened since then. The first year was rough and I've been holding up well but I still had my waves of ups and downs. Today, I finally felt the wave crashing down and I'm missing you a little extra. 


Man, where do I start? Kim, my sister, is graduating from elementary school next month. I'm going to be a senior in college next year! I remember you visiting my dorms when I first moved in. I remember coming back home from break and saying how you'd come pick me up and how you're just a call away. I remember how proud you were for me going to college. I remember how goofy you were when we would FaceTime. 


Mom is hanging in there. She's been working a lot and I'm doing my best to support her emotionally and financially. Grandma and I are coming back from our vacation together. We went to visit your older brother! He reminds me so much of you. To the hair, the eyes, and laugh. 


I'm starting my internship soon! I wish I could tell you all about it and what's happening with sports and all. I miss talking to you about that stuff. I was in a long term relationship but that ended badly. That's a story for another day. 


All in all, I'm growing as an individual and I have amazing friends and family around me who I can talk to and find comfort in. I'm eating healthier and working on staying in shape, and I'm happy! I didn't know what to expect from college and the real world, but everything has been playing out. It hasn't been the smoothest of rides but I'm getting through. I just wish you were here to watch me go through life and see all my accomplishments. Wherever you are, I hope you're proud of me dad. I love you and miss you. Until next time we meet..."
6cyvpc,0,2017-05-23,Convinced my [25M] girlfriend [23F] to travel across the country and stay with me for 3 months but now I want to break up after 1 week. How do I do it?,dunnohowtobreakup123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6cyvpc/convinced_my_25m_girlfriend_23f_to_travel_across/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for a little less than 2 years. I met her while I was doing a summer internship 2500 miles away from home. We dated for 4 months before I left to go back home for grad school. We decided to give long distance relationship a shot and overall, it has worked out pretty well. There were some hiccups along the way, but nothing too difficult for us to handle. We visited each other every 3-4 months and talked on the phone daily. Everything was happy and peachy. 


2 months ago, my mom got into a horrific car accident. She became paralyzed from the waist down and her left arm is broken. Since then, my dad and I have devoted a majority of our time to taking care of her. Everything from changing clothes, showering, using the bathroom, eating, etc requires me and my dad to help out. It has taken a huge toll on the both of us, mentally and physically. In addition, the pressure and stress from grad school and candidacy exam (an important exam that determines whether or not I stay in grad school) has really gotten to me. I tried my best to separate my feelings of frustration and anxiety from affecting my personal relationships with other people. However, my constant negative and bad mood was affecting the relationship between me and my girlfriend. Ultimately, I convinced her to come to my hometown and stay with me and my parents. We believed that spending time together will be beneficial for our relationship. She could help out and take care of my mom while taking summer classes at a community college. Previously, when we were physically near each other (and not long distance), things were always great. She is a supportive, understanding, caring and considerate girlfriend. Any misunderstandings and miscommunication problems from the long distance aspect of the relationship were gone whenever we were physically together. We felt that this time, it would be the same too. Thus, she agreed to come over to stay with me and my parents for the summer. 


Over the past week, she has been trying her best to integrate into our family and to get accustomed to the new environment. However, my parents strongly dislike her and is pushing for me to break up with her. My parents are more of a go-getter type of personality. They have taught me to be proactive, observant and efficient. On the other hand, my girlfriend’s style is completely different. She is more laid back (or chill), does the minimum amount of work and doesn’t plan and think through the whole process before making decisions. She requires a lot of guidance, doesn’t always do things logically or use common sense. She also isn’t very careful or detailed when doing things and generally, is quite lazy. 


For example, when helping my mom transfer from the bed to the wheelchair, she accidentally banged the foot rest onto my mom’s ankle a few times and trust me, it hurts. Have any of you banged a toe against a table leg? That’s what it feels like. There are many instances where she just stands around and watches while my dad and I are struggling with assisting my mom. We would need to give her specific instructions before she takes any actions to help. I understand that she may not be familiar with the way we do things but I feel that some of it is common sense. She should be able to observe and recognize that we need help and take some kind of action to provide assistance. I have openly communicated with her regarding my parent’s expectations and she understands them. She has broken down and cried a few times because she feels that she is a disappointment but after the talk, she still acts the same way and nothing has changed. 


My parents are not impressed with her thus far. They describe her as incompetent and is frustrated at the way she is. I know those are very harsh words and it sounds like we are judging her as if she’s an employee. I believe that families operate like a team and everyone should contribute the best that they can in order for it to function properly (especially in critical situations like the one we’re in now). Finding the right partner means that both parties need to be compatible in personalities, styles, beliefs and interests. My girlfriend and I have a lot of fun together and enjoy each other’s company. We make each other laugh, smile and feel very comfortable. But when it comes down to handling household chores or doing things in general, it seems like we have a very different approach and mindset. I don’t want to try and change her. That’s not going to work and it’s not fair to her either.  This is something fundamental to who she is as a person.


My parents have convinced me to break up with her and I agree with that point. Now I am stuck with how I do so. Part of me feels like it would be best to do so as soon as possible and to not lead her on. However, she has already signed up and paid for summer classes which are not refundable. It is not possible for her to find her own place to stay because that would require her to be independent and drive on her own to go to places. She is afraid of driving in a big city (She’s originally from a small town where there’s much less traffic). Thus, I am inclined to keep things the way they are and break up with her after she leaves in 3 months. My hope is that when she is back in her hometown, she will have her family and friends to support her through the break up. If I break up with her now (in my hometown), she will have no one to turn to. I don’t know if this is the best option or if there is something else I should do instead that will lessen her pain. What should I do? 


Also, am I too harsh on my girlfriend? I am afraid that my expectation level for my girlfriend is too unreasonably high. I recognize that she doesn’t owe me anything and that she is not obligated to help me or my dad in taking care of my mom. And I do appreciate every little thing that she has done to try and help. The main reason why I am pondering about the possibility of breaking up is because I am afraid that her current work ethic and style is indicative of how things will be if we one day get married and have kids. I don’t want to spend my life carrying the majority of the weight of the family on my shoulders. 


TL;DR- Girlfriend travelled across the country to spend 3 months with me and my family. After 1 week, I want to break up with her because we have very different style and way of handling things. How do I do it without hurting her too much?

6cz6sm,1,2017-05-23,MBBS in China,betty-1993,University,https://www.reddit.com/r/University/comments/6cz6sm/mbbs_in_china/,"China is one of the oldest civilizations in the world having a written history of more than 4,000 years, rich culture and a respected educational tradition. That tradition continues to this day, especially in the field of Medicine. One of the major areas of focus in our educational services is the medical education. Universities have welcomed thousands of medical students in the last few years from across the world to study Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in China. Scholarships programs for foreign students and medical education standard really attracted the students. These medical universities for MBBS program are recognized institution and their degrees are honored across the world. Every year, we graduate a numerous number of doctors who have been serving their medical profession particularly in the region of Gulf.
China is fast becoming the most favored destination for studying MBBS in Asia. Every year, more than 10,000 overseas students come to China to study Medicine. Studying MBBS program in China has become increasingly popular since 2004. National Medical schools are recognized by the Medical Council of China and recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the “Directory of World Medical Schools”. Also, the bachelor of medical degree is well recognized.


Most universities have strong reputations and have taught MBBS for years. The medical degree awarded is valid and eligible for Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCHS), Medical and Dental Professions Board, Health Professions Council of South Africa, the Professional and Linguistic Assessment Board (PLAB) in the UK, and the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) for Screening test conducted by the National Board of Examination under each country. Some universities will specially invite foreign experienced medical professionals to give a lecture or doctor licensed examination preparation training. The majority of the graduates are working in their respective countries as licensed Doctors.

The program has a six-year duration. After completing basic education, there is typically a year-long internship for practice. Students also have the option to do their internship in China or their homeland. Respective universities may have certain additional criteria for applicants to meet, such as a high score in the subjects of Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Additionally, international students will still need to study the Chinese language in order to communicate with patients in the clinics. Some medical schools require foreign students to pass the HSK test (Chinese language proficiency) before graduation.

Here Are Certain Facts About Studying MBBS In China

Graduate with a globally recognize medical degree

On completing the requirements of the teaching program and passing the graduation examinations successfully, international medical undergraduates will be granted a graduation certificate and conferred a medical degree by the university. International students can take the diploma and required documents to the embassy of your home country for accreditation if needed.

Explore the long-standing history and profound culture

With the staggering achievements that China has made during its 30 years of opening up to the outside world, more than 260,000 international students are enrolled in China’s universities and colleges each year, making it one of the most popular places to study as an international student. Regarded as a representative of an ancient and mysterious culture. The modern world is globalized and interaction between people of different cultures is essential. Those that have gone abroad and learned how to interact with other cultures will have a distinct advantage over those that stay at home or choose to go to places more similar to their home country. Living and studying in China brings you into contact with a unique culture that is vastly different from almost every other country in the world. Even if you don’t walk away being an expert in Chinese culture, the ability to work, study and make friendships with those different from you is a valuable skill in today’s world and can benefit any career.


Internship can be done in hospitals either in your country or in China to complete MBBS course

All of China’s university-affiliated hospitals where students undertake internships must be with the tier of Grade III, Level A, which have the most advanced international-standard medical instruments and also lots of patient beds. As we all know, China has the largest population in the world. Therefore, the medical market of China is developing at a rapid speed and becoming one of the world’s largest medical markets. Also, a student could be allowed to do their internship in any country of their choice.


Chinese language skills

China is now one of the world’s dominant economies and the Chinese language will continue to grow in importance. The boost that Chinese language proficiency gives to a career in business is enormous, but China’s global rise means that career in international politics, development, non-profits, education and a host of other fields all stand to gain from a working knowledge of Chinese as well. There will be more and more demand for Chinese skills in the future and this can give a serious advantage to job seekers.


Study in a society with excellent public security

China is a peaceful place with social harmony and good public security. In order to guarantee people live in a comfortable and secure society, the Chinese government takes a tough stance on crime and law and order. According to the official statistics, the violent crime rate is dropping year by year. The government also takes special care to provide international students with a safe study and living environment on campus. Separate hostels are available for boys and girls.



Colorful and fulfilling campus life

The weather varies from location to location in China, so each university has its own beauty in each season. Students can enjoy their study life on campus or travel around the city on vacation. Meanwhile, to help international students to learn the magnificent and attractive Chinese culture and custom, most Chinese universities organize all kinds of special activities, which is also beneficial for them to settle into life in China. International students can experience not only the cultural history of China but also the spirit of a new generation in China.


Living costs and tuition are considerably lower in China

Studying towards an MBBS in China is 70% cheaper than undertaking a similar program in the US or the UK. The US MD program course (equivalent to MBBS) cost around USD 160,000-200,000. This excludes four years of Pre-med study. While a student can complete an MBBS course from any of the China’s medical university list for 6 years for only USD 30,000 - 50,000. Compared to the rest of the world the fees charged for MBBS courses in China are expansively reasonable. The charges of tutoring in the universities in China are subsidized by the Ministry of Public Health of the Chinese Government. Although prices in China are rising, the cost of living here is still favorable compared to most industrialized countries. You will be amazed by how comfortably you can live and how strong your purchasing power is. All in all, it is very economical for international students to study in China.


Academic training

Education in China is advancing practically in any field. You can work to obtain a degree from a Chinese institution or transfer credits you earn while in China to your school back home. China’s educational institutions are advancing at a rapid pace and more and more overseas students are coming to take advantage of world-class Chinese facilities and instruction.

6czrnp,293,2017-05-23,"Valve, please regulate ACE, or ideally, BAN it",dengts,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6czrnp/valve_please_regulate_ace_or_ideally_ban_it/,"Former Wings players tried to leave Wings because the club owner refused to pay them, which happened more than twice (no prior notice and only empty promise). Subsequently, these players were  to permanently banned by ACE. (Due to pressure, now ACE seems to give up the proposal and blames EHOME, because EHOME broke its promise on banning ex Wings players along with other ACE teams, and add two of them (Faith_bian and y) into its squad. This is nothing but another smart trick for drawing attention away from itself.) The entire ban conclusion was reached in an online meeting (link: https://redd.it/6d0fml) without any players or their representatives, only club managers: one or two proposed this idea as they were afraid that more  players would leave teams “ARBITRARILY” in the future, (or secretly tried to eliminate strong competitors,) while other managers complied by replying “+1” or simply “1”. No matter how ACE rephrases the “ban”, a ban is a ban. Lots of fans stood out because the whole judging process was unfair and opaque. Some supporting ACE may fightback by arguing it is the players’ fault to leave the team at the first place. However, one can easily invoke **the clause 32 and clause 38 of PRC’s labor law**: (Translated version below) 

Clause 32:

The employee can inform the employer of voiding his/her labor contract **at any time** in one of the following scenarios: 

1.The employee works during internship. 

2.The employer compels the employee to work by violence, threatening or illegal restriction of human freedom.

3.The employer **did not pay** or provide working conditions according to the contract.

Clause 38:

The employee can void any labor contract under one of the following conditions

1.The employer did not provide labor protection or working conditions according to the contract.

2.The employer **did not pay the full amount of wage on time**.
…

Even if we ignore these facts and still claim players have fault, ACE’s proposed punishment plan was by no means reasonable. First, let’s recall in traditional sports who should be punished like this: players who play faked match(es) or use forbidden drugs. Second, the former Wings players are quite young, most of whom are only teenagers.  Permanent ban for them in this case is way too much. I think this is the reason why many fans are so angry about ACE. ACE, an unofficial organization, (FYI, **not related to Chinese Government, nor appointed by Valve**,) **only representing employers’ interests**, should not serve as the judge of CN DOTA. As we have already seen, their judging process is one sided with the absence of employees or employees’ representatives, and is not transparent: if it was not IG’s manager who tried to defend himself, we would never know what was happening. That is why many wise fans advised to improve CN DOTA’s environment, for example, we should form **a union of players and fans** to balance the power of employers and provide **consultations** for players facing **unjust treatments**. But the useful advice is simply ignored by ACE and its members. Instead they try to set fire among fans and now isolate EHOME. Let’s ignore individuals’ fault in this drama once again and ask: “who empowers ACE and makes it CN DOTA’s dictator?” Their so called rules are established without supervision and they can freely ignore fans’ voices. 

Some DOTA fans speak for ACE because they were convinced by ACE that without ACE or the current capital investing clubs many players will starve and DOTA2 can never reach today’s prosperity. That’s what also makes ACE so arrogant as **CN DOTA’s god**. That’s also why they can say they have zero fault and blame players or clubs for not obeying it. That’s why they call fans against them “**brain damaged**” and make fans fight against each other. Many fans are now so heart-broken that they are happy to see the defeat of clubs of ACE and won’t vote for LGD to participate epicenter. From my point of view, **this incident is inevitable as we all know conflicts would arise among interest parties within a rapidly growing industry. But ACE’s outdated rule are not adapted to the current state of CN DOTA.** Moreover, ACE rejects to work hard on improving this, reject to listen wise suggestions from rational fans, and never blame its incapability of forming a good environment for CN DOTA. I, along with many other fans, feel hopeless and even want to quit DOTA2 after witnessing so many disappointing actions by ACE. After all, dota2’s success is owing to Valve of course and DOTA2 fans, not ACE. Valve if you want this success to continue, BAN ACE or at least regulate this **dictatorship**, directly or indirectly. 

Side fact: ACE is now behaving like the OPEC in oil industry but it’s hard to speak for it’s eligibility as dota2 is not a capital concentrated industry: you don’t need tons of money to form a club. Let’s look at what’s happening outside CN, there is no trust organization like ACE and players can freely form teams by themselves. The establishment of ACE is to prevent clubs from over-competing for players. But this can’t make ACE a judge for dealing with any affairs. And we may have better solutions to deal with “over-investment”. ACE’s existence may prevent the emergence of small clubs as small clubs are not automatically members of ACE: you don’t get invitation in CN qualifiers as long as you are not a member of ACE. As new players, it would be very naturally to join clubs of ACE because of its power. We almost always end up with those big clubs. So in CN DOTA, big clubs play a central role, which is different from Valve's idea: let players play central role and encourage small and new clubs like **Wings Gaming**. **EHOME** now is permanently banned by ACE and as a result it is banned by third-party tournament forever: EHOME won’t get invited in any CN qualifiers held by ACE. ACE now is trying to give an example. You can say EHOME is at fault. But without it, ex wings players may be given as examples instead: permanently banned. Some may also propose that all players of EHOME should leave their club and join ACE. This is basically what ACE wants. Don't you (like myself) think this kind of power is quite horrifying? ACE is now becoming an unleashed animal: no one can Challenge it or its rules. Also don't forget:  **CN teams with best records in TI6 were Wings Gaming and EHOME, which ACE is now trying to destroy.**

Edit: the fundamental source of ACE's power comes from the fact that ACE decides who get invited in many CN qualifiers. If ACE continues to play as a dictator, Valve can consider let **Perfectworld**, CN's official and neutral agency of DOTA2 to takeover this power. 

Edit: Rumor https://tieba.baidu.com/p/5130789192 says Perfectworld, the authority of CN, will takeover the power of ACE on hosting CN qualifiers post TI7. As a result, ACE will mostly step out of the scene. The ""ban"" from it will also be voided to a large extent. 

Edit: Ehome.K just got banned from playing NESO by ACE even after it has received invitation notice from the host. https://redd.it/6d2map

Edit: Shadow, Blink, and iceice were fined one month wage and banned from 5 tournaments post TI7. Faith_bian and Y currently are not players of ACE and hence get no punishment for now until they apply to become players of ACE again. http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404110998779908337#_0 

Edit: I'm NOT saying ex wings players or EHOME have zero fault, my solution is right or Valve should regulate it directly. My intention is just to show **how big power ACE has and how it can do whatever it wants**. Part of me still thinks ACE is more or less needed. **Even if ACE did something good, doesn't mean anything or the way it does is correct. Doesn't mean nothing can be done either.** We should make it **better**, make things **transparent**, and **balance** its power. Let's discuss. I believe authority and us can come up with something better than that.

Edit: What I mean by **fans** in the union is like the **jury**. They have to be selective and can represent the voice of the **dota2 community**. So we need them to be as objective as possible. A union with only players is also acceptable for me. We simply need parties representing players or voice other than the employers' side. If there exists such an organization to consult those kids NOT leaving their team by themselves, perhaps this drama can be avoided. Have you ever considered ex wings players didn't search help from Lianjie because they don't know her very well? They might run to ROTK because they trust him as a player of trustworthiness and integrity? But an organization with absolute power is not acceptable from my perspective. Even the president of US can be challenged. Of course, Kim Jong-un can't. Please don't let ACE become an unleashed animal!!!

Edit: I myself highly agree with /u/nadoter's point:
""the only thing ACE should regulate is contract transfer (involves $$$), but now it's meaningless since there is already auto-regulation from valve (drop-add period / season). they are completely useless now and even getting high horse with meddling with banning players/teams from 3rd party LAN that has nothing to do with them."" Actually this was **the most important founding reason** of ACE."

Poke holes into it, please!",piratesballet,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6d01sz/a_plan_for_buying_my_first_car_poke_holes_into_it/,"Hi! I'm 19 &amp; doing tons of research before getting my first car. I'd mainly need the car for running between work, college, the gym, internships &amp; home... (would buying new be better than used?) I want the plan to begin in August, so I'd love to get tons of feedback and holes poked into it to figure it all out. When I'm done, I'll come back and rewrite a post explaining my process &amp; hopefully help anyone else in my position! (:

Before the dealership:

1a. Determine what my budget can afford and what I'm willing to put toward a car for a down payment. (10% of car price for an used car, 20% for a new car.)
2a. Decide the length of a loan I'd like and use an online calculator to then determine what you can afford.
3a. Find a car you'd like, that fits your needs, etc.


1b. Get a approved loan from credit union (and get proof of it in a printout.)
2b. Check the reputations of any and all dealerships my radius.
3b. Get an interest rate quote.
4b. Prepare a separate email/get Google Voice to avoid spam and harassment.

*I'd really like help with how phrasing should be done with the emails, if possible!*


1c. Email all reputable dealerships within my radius at the beginning of the month, providing the specifics of the car I'd like and ask for an out the door. Provide the dealerships with the date I plan on coming to get the car.
2c. Slowly weed out dealerships who aren't willing to lower prices, and send the lowest price offered to the other dealerships. Once the prices are within $100s of eachother, pick the lowest price and contact the dealership. This would happen near the end of the month; to pressure any dealers that may be trying to reach a quota into a lower price to get an easy sale.

At the dealership:


1a. Check out the car, make sure all is working as anticipated, etc.


1b. In the finance office, say no to extras. Including warranties, as they're all overpriced and practically useless anyway.
2b. Show the preapproved loan with the interest rate. (I'm not quite sure how I would get the dealer to then quote me with a lower rate to go through them for financing instead. Help?)
3b. At the end, carefully read over the contract to confirm that there are no extra charges and it matches the verbal agreements made.


Important things to remember:


1. I am doing the dealership a favor by making a purchase, they are not doing me a favor by selling me a car.
2. Stay firm; don't be afraid to speak up. The dealer may not like you, but you're going to like the results better if you do.
3. If you end up going to the dealership to negotiate and you're outside: wear sunglasses. The dealer can't read you as easily and it gives you a bit of an edge."

6d046y,1,2017-05-24,[19/m]Should I tell him shes playing him?,scpackersfan123,relationships_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/6d046y/19mshould_i_tell_him_shes_playing_him/,"I met this girl sophmore year. Initially, we were acquaintance friends. As we got closer (from eye contact and chemistry), she had told me she was done with her boyfriend. We had sex a few times a day or so after that. Then, she told me she needed his place for her internship, hence her not breaking up with him. Yet, she was still silently into me. She kept calling me attractive all the way through. She always liked to tease me. However, we hadnt hooked up in a month, and I was always one to drop by and start making out with her for the reason of fun and I liked her. She seemed to know that, and she liked it. So far so good, we semi defined us as friends. I knew I liked her more than me, and I let her know too. However, it had been a month. Then, after so many failed attempts of asking her, she came downstairs (shes my neighbor) instantly ripping off my clothes. Expecting quick sex. I tried to stop her, but it was too hot. Afterwards I got pissed that she played me, however defined we were. She admitted that she did in the moment. I apologized for flipping after sex the day after, and hadnt heard from her the same (we didnt have anymore kisses or sex) for a little after that. She kept acting innocent. We actually never had sex again, but that wasnt the end. 

So I asked her what was up eventually, slightly mad that she couldve been fake to me. ""I dont like when people expect things from me"" she said. Essentially telling me to fuck off for asking where she went. I flipped. On text. Yea it was stupid, but I was going through shit and had little tolerance for small time petty players. Thats the idea I had of her. And her righteousness didnt help that either. 

Now, I was only somewhat close to this girl, and she burned me the minute I started to be the one who texted her after a few fucks. And she thought she had me.  she thought she knew she could at least cause I am a little too nice and vulnerable (I am an Identified Patient in my fam). She had sex with me as a trophy, probably. Thats probably where her calling me attractive every ten seconds came in. Cauuuse I do some MMA and am pretty damn in shape.

Now, do I know more than anyone that this is none of my fucking business. This happened 2 months ago and Ive kept silent except to my closer friends. But Ive had an angry, guilty concious for the entitlement this bitch holds, to use her boyfriend of years for his money and love and then probably drop him, if not, keep him as a perspective boyfriend (just as she tried to do with me before I flipped and confronted her flaky behavior). I know he will blame himself. Thats what these girls will try to do to unsuspecting guys. 

When she breaks this dudes heart, either through a slow degredation of their relationship or her dropping him, I know how he will feel. And in his position, I would rather know the bitch cheated before I spend a whole summer of money and housing for this girl. What do you guys think? Should I facebook this dude a single truth (not expressing my opinion). Please try your best to not bullshit me on me being righteous. Cause Im just plain mad and I hate unfairness and imbalance. These were huge themes in my life once, after all...

6d361r,1,2017-05-24,I love my boyfriend but I like someone else too. I'm restless about the matter.,Lostintheleaves_13,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6d361r/i_love_my_boyfriend_but_i_like_someone_else_too/,"If anyone ever actually reads this, thank you for taking the time to go through my [ridiculously long] post. I felt that I needed to pour my heart out. All these thoughts have been piling up in my mind and it's made it almost impossible for me to think of anything else. 

My boyfriend (22) and I (22F) have been together for years now and I feel like our relationship has grown stronger and wiser; I couldn't really ask for a better person to be by my side and I feel that my love for him is still growing. So I don't really know why this is happening. I have thought about it so much and come up with so many maybe's. At this point I'm not sure if I wanna know why anymore, I just feel so restless. 

I met a guy (23) about two years ago at an event in my university. I could kind of tell from the beginning that he was maybe interested in something more than a friendship, but it was not clear to me and too early to know for sure. Plus, he is a very interesting person, so I kept talking to him. He did seem disappointed when I (very casually) told him that I had a boyfriend, but we became friends anyway and over the next months I got to know his personality quite well (though not entirely well). 

We became close to the point where I would find myself trying to cheer him up when he shared sad and personal thoughts. He tends to get more sincere and open when he's drunk, and so one night he went out drinking and we had a philosophical conversation through messages, at the end of which he told me that he knew we couldn't be more than friends but he would settle for it. I felt so confused by this, because it actually made me somewhat happy to know that he thought about me that way, but I tried to supress the feeling by thinking of it as the thrill you get from pleasant attention. He also asked me not to say anything about it, so I didn't, and it stayed like that for a long time. 

We kept talking to each other, however; we had long, interesting conversations about all kinds of things, and found some topics in which we had different opinions and so we would discuss. I should say here that this is something I feel I can do with my boyfriend too...there's actually nothing I feel I can't do with him that I can do with my friend, so I don't see this situation as some kind of ""seeking-for-something-that-I'm-missing-in-my-relationship"" thing. I could be wrong, since someone with an outer perspective might see something I haven't (that is if someone ever actually reads this), but it just doesn't feel that way. But I digress. 

Flash forward to August/September 2016. I felt that I deeply cared about this guy; I truly worried about his issues, I liked to be there for him and we talked to each other everyday. My boyfriend started to jokingly say that he was my lover and it terrified me, because I knew that he knew deep down that something was up. Not from my part, and I should mention that I was never flirtatious with my friend, but my boyfriend knew about him since way back and didn't trust him, as he thought he might not have the most innocent intentions. I personally felt my friend was harmless in that sense...I could feel he was a little hurt by seeing me love someone else but still kept being my friend and did no attempts at changing that situation, so at one point I thought he had perhaps moved on from that feeling... but apparently he hadn't. 

One night I got a voice message from him in which you could hear a song about someone regretting seeing a woman not being theirs. He did tell me he was going out so I supposed he was drunk and decided that I wouldn't mention it the next day. I knew he would feel uncomfortable and I guess it was just a talk neither of us wanted to have. But it did affect me. There was a part of me that wanted to get carried away by the excitement it gave me. More than that, I wanted him to stop suffering because of me. I didn't want to be a reason for him to be sad, I should be a source of joy to him. Part of me wanted to ""grant him his wish"" and I realized that I cared about him more than I knew, in a way that I maybe souldn't.  I felt very guilty about it just by knowing that my kind, sweet boyfriend would never suspect that I feel this way. At times I just looked at him and thought ""you don't deserve this."" But I didn't know how to not care about this other guy, and at this point I didn't want to give up his friendship and ""abandon"" him. I was partly being selfish, I know, but I just felt that he needed me as much as I needed him and that it felt right to be friends. I listened to him when he told me things he'd never told anyone before, and I knew it made him feel so good that I showed such empathy and I never judged him and I could read him well and decode his character. Maybe that's why he liked me? Because he felt truly known and not judged by who he really was and he had never felt that before? He's kind and respectful (barely ever establishes physical contact), and so very troubled by his own mind. His self-perception; the way he interacts with others; the times he's felt hurt or disappointed by someone he cared about; the sometimes awful things and experiences that have made him who he is. It made me sad to think that someone so unique had maybe never been shown that much kindness, and I just really wanted to make him feel like he mattered. I felt this ""something else"" growing between us without us ever really mentioning it, but I thought we could keep it at bay. Until we couldn't. 

One night we were having that kind of conversation that you both know has to do with your situation but neither wants to address directly. So I gathered up some balls and told him I wanted to ask him something. He said that he probably knew what it was, and in that case, the answer was ""yes"", but he didn't mind it and that we could continue to be friends. I asked if he remembered the voice note with the song and he said he did. He was so ashamed. I sort of had a ""I can't no longer pretend that this is not happening"" moment and told him that I loved my boyfriend, I really did, but that I also liked him. I felt so relieved. He, however, wasn't expecting that kind of reply and it caught him off guard. He felt happy that I felt that way but at the same time he was so fucked up by the fact that he had maybe arrived too early, or too late, or that maybe he had arrived just in time to be part of something that could not be. We both went to bed relieved and uncertain. 

Some time went by and we kept talking. We rarely saw each other in person, because I was an intern at a job in a different city during that semester; I only saw him on an occasional trip to visit my parents or that kind of thing. We met a few times and it was rather weird, the way we could talk and act as if none of this drama was actually happening. After one of those times I saw him he confessed to me that he came close to kissing me. I didn't notice at the moment, but it got me wondering if I would have let him; it was painful to admit to myself, but I thought I would have. I still think so. Later on, I felt the need to settle the matter. I wasn't even sure how to, but I mean, I just wanted to know what we were doing. What were we doing? Were we waiting for something to happen? for the feeling to go away? For one of us to say something that would settle it one way or another? or would we just keep on like that for God knows how long? We talked about it. He kind of wanted things to stay the way they were, but knew they would eventually come to some sort of resolution. At this point I needed to be clear and honest. I told him I cared about him very much and I didn't want to give him up. But if he were to make me choose, I knew very well how things would go 😞 it made me sad to say that but also happy that I was telling the truth. I never really made any comparisons between him and my boyfriend, because it was always clear to me that I wouldn't break up with him. It was quite a different kind of love. Older love, well-rooted love. So many memories, so many happy times and so many difficult days that I feel so proud to have overcome. So many things I love about him and still think are adorable, so much excitement when I think about spending time with him and getting to wake up next to him; so many hopes. It might seem confusing and impossible, but I swear, Reddit, that's the way I feel. It's taken me very long to realize that I can absolutely adore my boyfriend and still like and care so much about my friend. 

A while after that we saw each other. We went out, had some food and beer and a really pleasant evening. He took me home and went his way, and later that night he told me he was going to put some distance between us. He was getting away because he thought he couldn't be my friend while he had those feelings for me; I should have seen it coming, but it hurt like hell regardless. I knew it was the best thing to do, and even though I would have loved for him to stay around, I knew it would have been horribly selfish. I couldn't give him what he wanted and needed, and he had every right to move on from that. I also wanted him to. I still think he deserves someone who loves him the way I love my boyfriend, someone who can take care of him properly. 

He came back eventually, and we started talking again. It's not what it used to be and it's painful, but I know it's better that way...Although, I sometimes feel like we're heading the same direction as before. We still share long talks from time to time and I get the feeling there's still something going on between us, some days more strongly than others. Maybe it's one of those things that never really goes away. 

I wonder what it is about him. Maybe it's because he makes me want to save him. I know it's not my place, but I can't help but care. Maybe it's because I've been in a relationship for so long that I miss the little excitements you get when you're starting things with someone. He and I haven't started anything, so maybe that's what perpetuates this state. Maybe it's both of those things, maybe it's none, maybe there's no concrete reason. These days I let myself wonder way too much what would happen if something actually happened between us, and I feel like something actually will. I don't know how or when, I just get the feeling. What if I gave him a kiss? Would it make it all worse and impossible to forget? Would it give us some closure? Would it be that wrong, even if it never happened again? Am I really a horrible person? It scares me that I think I could live with having done something like that. It's even made me question my views on monogamy. It's messed up everything and I feel like I can't do anything but wait for something else to happen, whatever it is.

6d3apt,2,2017-05-24,In A Complicated Dilemma – Need Advice!,[deleted],askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/6d3apt/in_a_complicated_dilemma_need_advice/,"*Lengthy Post*

So, this girl (Rachel) and myself are going into our senior year of college together and have hit things off really well this past junior year, however, I am in a huge dilemma! She lived directly across the hall from me and so we spent a great deal of time together which made us, and our friends, realize that we just click and are perfect for each other. We literally say, think, and do pretty much the same things and have just recently started to take things further... but she has had a boyfriend for 2/3 years! She had a crush on me all first semester but I never thought I had a chance because of her relationship so I just found her fun to flirt with and talk to. But, come late March, she finally confessed one night ""sometimes I want you"" and then a week later said ""I like you"" so I decided that I might have a chance. So before our Easter Recess, we finally kissed/made-out after a bonfire and then had a week apart from each other. 

Then, the first weekend we are back together at school, we hook-up/make-out again and we also talk a lot and the night before this, she opened up to me and told me how she sometimes wants to break up with her boyfriend who cheated on her a couple times and treated her like shit the past year before he graduated (she was a freshmen and he was a junior when they started) and she doesn't like how they are living different lives since he's away from her and she's still at school and doesn't like his friends both from home and the ones from school. So the next day after we hooked up she puts their relationship on a ""break"" because she doesn't know what she wants. Then the next weekend we hook-up twice and she finally lets me go down on her. Both of these nights we continue to talk about us together and she tells me how she really likes me and has never felt like this before since her relationship she is in now is her first ever ""big"" relationship so her liking me during it is all new to her.

I'm a gentlemen when it comes to women so I have never pressured her into doing anything and have taken this all at her pace and her guidance. Up until this point I have sent her books (Breakfast at Tiffany's and Bonjour Tristesse) with cute notes in them and have also written her several poems admiring her beauty and also confessing my feelings towards her. She tells me she has never felt so desired and liked in her life and loves how romantic and honest I am. So with this in mind, I let her know that I completely understand the complex situation that she is going through and simply let her know that she is in control of what she wants but I also let her know that I will give her space and time to figure things out more, but I tell her that I am very patient and have no problem waiting for her if she needs a lot of time. 

So the next weekend comes around and I have restrained from talking to her in that I wanted to give her space since she is on a break with her boyfriend, but she texts me and is flirty so we eventually hook-up again and this time we both go down on each other, her initiating it all. During this hook-up session we were about to have sex but I said I wanted to wait to have sex with her as I want it to mean something and she agreed. Later that night I sleep over in her bed with her and we just talked. A couple days go by and we are talking about our situation and she texts me:

""God idk sam something about you I just like can't resist. I think you're so smart, funny, interesting, kind, and so unique. I care about you in a real way. I'm obsessed with your family and your interests. You're so different from anything I thought I would like, Not trying to offend you but it's just kind of crazy for me and scary all at the same time. I feel bad though I don't wanna do anything to hurt you""

Which I pretty much reply telling her I just want to be with her and be a part of her life and she mine.

So, we have one more weekend before finals and summer begins and we end up spending a great deal of time together both studying with each other in the library, getting late night snacks and smoothies, and watching movies together – spending 6 full days with each other. We hooked-up 4 times during this period since her roommates were gone and I slept over 2 nights. The most significant night was the night before she left to go home and we found ourselves talking about literally everything and pulled an all-nighter together. During this session she really confessed how much she likes me and sees me as a great boyfriend/us dating and also talks more about her relationship... telling me how her sex drive is higher than her boyfriend's who has never made her orgasm (which I have), only lasts 5 minutes, and just isn't nearly as experienced or romantically sexual as I am to her (which she loves). So she continues to tell me how much it sucks that she is missing out on a good sexual relationship and confesses that she gets herself off thinking of me. We continue this convo with her telling me how much she loves us hooking up and how even us kissing is better than her and her boyfriend's as we connect on such a different level and kiss and touch each other in the same rhythm and in tandem. We also describe our ideal partners together and pretty much tell each other the other is perfect for us.

So she leaves the next day after we have one more cute little hangout (I brought sandwiches and we watched a movie) in her bed, talked, and hooked up one last time. 

So we've both been home for almost 2 weeks now and have been talking non-stop, sexting and saying how we miss, think of each other, and want each other so much. Though, the other day, she tells me how she still needs to talk to her boyfriend and try to figure her side out ""before we could ever be together"" and so we talk and it pretty much ends with her saying:

 ""Basically I don't know if I can just end it with mike. He's been my person for 3 years it scares the shit out of me honestly. How do you just cut someone out of your life who's been there for so long? It just really really scares me. That may be stupid reason to stay with someone too but there I said it. It just sucks how I feel like I have to pick someone I guess. Like I wish I could have just met you not like this almost so I could just be normal. I honestly do see myself dating you I just don't know when. And I'd say yeah wait for me but that's not fair to you even though it would be hard for me to see with you someone else. Just do what you want I guess and I know I can't have both worlds. I feel like I'm gonna go back to school and wanna date you but that's like not right of me to tell you that or expect you would even do that so I'm not. I don't know I feel like if I just left you alone it'd be better sometimes. Not trying to be dramatic but yeah I feel like I just take the easier route naturally which sucks""

So I say:

""Well okay there it is. I dont respect making such a decision based on time when you've had to go through what you have but I guess it's just you're ""easier route nature"". It just seems like you know you want me but won't let yourself do it and I don't get it. Part of me wishes I never met you because of this and how I've just been an outlet for you. I'll give you the summer and hopefully you'll follow your heart but until then I'd like to be left alone.""

She says:

""I completely understand. I'm sorry. Have a good summer""

So, 3 days go by and I'm in the whole ""icing her"" mentality as I do not plan on talking to her at all this summer, but last night she texts me this:

""Hi I promise I'll leave you alone like you said but i thought I'd just say before you go that I don't want you to forget about me because that's never what I meant. Anyways, good luck in New York I hope it's everything you're hoping for.""

I didn't reply but am just confused as to what she meant when she said: ""I don't want you to forget about me because that's never what I meant."" Like does she want me to still think of us together and that things will work/she likes me?

I will be very busy with an internship and job down in the city so I will be very distracted which is good BUT she has an internship at home but has none of her friends with her and has to commute almost 2 hours to see her boyfriend which she once said she's ""Not trying to drive 2 hours just to hangout with him."" We both are over thinkers and she tells me she thinks about me all day so I know I will be in her head. I do believe this time apart will be great as it will show her what she's missing in her current relationship but just need your advice!

How should I go about this whole situation/what do you experts see happening? 

Thanks a lot!!"

* [[Day 213.1. Hillary's Leakers Hackers and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW201jHRYYk)
  * Okay. Day 213 part 1
  * I spent about five or six hours for some for someone, who works in the Congress, both in the House, and in the Senate, in the IT department just to get is an extensive and understanding as I can get
  * Now you're going to see this video posted soon, and it's also going to be in front of the jail, where Guccifer--the first hacker is, in Arlington County Jail.
  * ***[Guccifer's] going to play an important part as a star witness versus Trump***
  * So this this whole drama is **Hack** on one side: that's the *Republicans, Adam Schiff, Schumer narrative*
  * And then the other one is **Leak**: which is *Seth Rich, Shawn Lucas, Eric Braverman, all the de WikiLeaks lawyers and founders*
  * So in order to actually get to the Truth, you can't stand at the curb of the Longworth office building and then speculate about what's going on inside, you have to talk to people that are insiders.
  * This is the sort of the *Luke Rosiak thing* where the *Frank Sowers*--who doesn't want to be on camera...Then you go around Frank Sowers
  * I mean it's it's just--we're going to get to the truth there's no doubt about it
  * Now I did not I'm going to say this right  now for all law enforcement especially FBI:
  * **I did not steal the BlackBerry of the person that I was with last night from the Congress**
  * So I'm gonna just say that straight away
  * In this business sometimes you drink, it would break the ice with everybody, and I probably drank too much last night. I'm going to say that straight up
  * And we're about ready to upload the video. But I did not steal this gentleman's blackberry
  * ***He's a very committed patriot, and I'm trying to get him we tried last night to get him the blackberry***
  * We realize that it has confidential information, so I'm in the same situation now that other people are that got Blackberries from Anthony Weiner's trusted staff
  * What do you do you? You immediately when--you have some device that has classified information you immediately try to get it back to the person who owns it
  * You immediately know you're doing something wrong
  * You don't think C means Cadillac on top of a classified document
  * *The whole idea that Hillary is somehow inept is is quite laughable*
  * ***This this group--the Awan brothers is going to be the one responsible for the OPM hack***
  * ***This gentleman was hacked by OPM--that's the government workers.***
  * Not only the current workers, but also the retired workers
  * And it's more important to retired workers
  * ***If you go back to Arkansas, Hillary had a kind of a naughty and nice list--ho's nice to me, and then everybody else sort of was forced on the naughty list***
  * ***And this list exists now in California it's a extract from various government hacks and also government databases***
  * ***And the OPM hack is I believe 22 million people***
  * ***The other hacks that Guccifer did--Guccifer is a a cover for the Awan Brothers.  Okay? And I know that sounds outrageous right now. But Guccifer is a cover for the Awan Brothers***
  * Guccifer did the Sony hack.
  * ***Jason Goodman, the person was filming last night, is a victim of the Sony hack. He's in WikiLeaks twice***
  * So you see how people get personally motivated, even though he's a million-dollar-a-day guy, producer-director: He got hacked
  * ***So Hillary is using the hacking of the Awan Brothers to extort contributions through John Podesta,***
    * ***[Podesta/'Enforcer' or MGMT Enforcer Network] Going and basically playing the Savior***
    * ***[Podesta/Enforcer] going to these people and saying, ""they got your information. It's going to kill you in Hollywood. You'll never work again. I think I can get there--with Secret Service, with Joe Clancy at Secret Service--I think I can get there with Andrew McCabe at FBI.""***
    * ***[Podesta/Enforcer] saying, ""I can't get the attention of the Secretary though, unless we we give we give this--we put a ""convincer"" *on top of this (a bundle of cash on top of this) to convince, and I think $500,000USD [campaign contribution] would be the thing that would get her attention. She's, she's busy""***
    * {{ snatchers: I FINALLY get your [RICO swave](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/content/rico-act.html) joke: Hillary is running a FakeyHack Protection Racket. She's extorting the political elite using privileged intel she is stealing, and using their own intellectual property as blackmail leverage ((( Kind of like how wannacry holds your personal information crypto-ransomed ))) }} 
  * **So it's a very subtle, almost self-congratulatory bribe. A self-bribe.**
  * **Some people could call it extortion, but it's beyond extortion**, 
  * Because normally the mafia comes in and says, *""we're going to break all your legs we're going to throw you off the building""*
  * ***This one is saying, ""I know the guy who's about ready to throw you off the building, and I think I can save you, I can save you, I need $500,000 and I need it right now""***
  * So that's the *modus operanti* here.
  * And I'm going to put the I'm going to put the film up very quickly, and you're going to see that
  * The hack of all the US Armed Forces personnel that happened in September ish last year
  * I don't know exactly what date. I'll get that.
  * That's also going to be the Awan brothers
  * ***So the good thing about doing the detailed research is that you don't just get the Seth Rich--You don't just solve the Seth Rich case. You're going to solve all the hacks***
  * That's why I keep going back to the Awan brothers
  * I know people want me to go to Seth Rich, but I want to solve all the hacks,
  * Because there is a winners and losers list
  * And it's innocent people, *innocent people that have done nothing wrong*
  * Many of them *children* okay
  * So the VA a maryland VA hack is mostly children and young adults that have never served in the armed forces
  * So that's why it's so important to get all the hacks, and not just the Seth Rich case

* [[Day 213.2 Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFDKMlNU3zI)
  * Okay. It's day 213 I just talked with an expert witness in the Commonwealth of Virginia
  * She is an expert witness in medical cases and also gunshot wounds that's her specialty
  * We'll just say her name is Cynthia at this point. She asked me not to use her last name
  * But she said there is just no way, in the timeline, that all the things that they said happened could happen and have him die at 5:59
  * She believes, like the medical intern the four-year medical insurance that is out there, and I believe is Dr. Eowyn, that she believed that the time of death was much later
  * Now that's a medical expert. I don't know. She thought it was a small-caliber weapon.
  * More like a 22 or even lower caliber than that
  * Now I don't know if that's preserve organs, or for what reason, but she said in the District of Columbia--this is emphatic
  * If a there's a robbery and then a gunshot causes death, there is no choice whatsoever, to do an autopsy
  * ***An autopsy must be performed***
  * Now in this case there is no reason why Burkman--the PR person--Jack Burkman or the representative family, Baumann, would not release the autopsy
  * That's not going to embarrass Seth Rich. We know he was shot
  * The other thing is there's a medical billing trail
  * In being admitted in the office into a hospital, there will be medical billing
  * Like anybody has ever been to a hospital can be quite convinced of that
  * So there is going to be a trail of billing, as the persons getting care
  * So these are two things we've got to get to
  * She's also reached out to Larry Clayman
  * I think if people can start tweeting Larry Clayman, I have key evidence for him and connecting back to the Dennis and I can't member Dennis's last name for some reason right now Dennis Cunningham .... that's not the right name, but the guy with the supercomputer--the hammer the James Clapper Hammer
  * So if Larry Clayman can get a hold of me I would appreciate it
  * And we'll have the blackberry video...the Congressional blackberry video up soon 

---
* [[Day 213.3. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXrsPxfUVc)
  * {{ GW is in front of Trey Gowdy's office, 2418 }}
  * Okay. I just went to Devin Nunez his office here in the Rayburn office building
  * And just setting up an appointment to speak with Mr. Gotti
  * We talked we informed the staff though of this potential blackberry syncing ability, that if any one of the Congressional staff, even an intern has a laptop, that could be configured then to the members phone getting all the emails
  * So it could not it might not just be the 80 members the Awans work for
  * It could have been anyone working here in this office building, in the Senate or in the House
  * ***So this is a obviously a very strong security concern***
  * Now you might have seen Luke Rosiak wrote an article today about Debbie Wasserman-Schultz threatening the Capitol Capitol Police-- threatening the Capitol Police
  * Now we talked to a couple of congressmen that we want that I've met earlier last night you'll see Jason post a picture and he said being a Democrat from Massachusetts he said that the member that she's got a lot of explaining to do it's going to be tough to get out of that if Jason was there we should have videos that up later
  * Now we'll put video of the interview up later we don't - yeah we're here yeah we're on the move and this is shotgun journalism we're going fast and shotgun meaning no violent overtones at all but I'm just talking about moving with the speed of information
  * Now the other interesting piece is that Trey Gowdy's not only in this Senate ethics I'm in the House Ethics Committee but he's also on the committee for crime and terrorism Huma trafficking equality and and Huma trafficking
  * So the buck literally stops here
  * Now I know there's somebody out in YouTube saying go to Trey Gowdy's office we tried he's voting right now
  * So we can't talk to him but we did we are going to talk to his communication staff to get an appointment

* [[Day 213.4 Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an7ugWA6kh4)
  * {{ GW is with Jason Goodman in the Verizon Store where HRC got her Treasonberries }}
  * Day Whatever 213 and
  * This is the same model that our contact had this morning--same model
  * Available here in the beautiful Verizon Wireless Store at the basement of Congress
  * Show me the other blackberry, would you Jason?
  * JASON: Well this I've never seen before.  This one has the Android operating system.
  * Something like you could use StealthGenie with?
  * JASON: maybe
  * Maybe. Well thank you very much, everybody

---
* [[Day 213.5 Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPiRNGGEqsw)
  * Okay Day 213 I think this is part three or four
  * Just a process thing with Luke Rosiak [journalist @ thedailycaller.com]
  * Luke, you quoted the neighbor with the date of the move for the Awans
  * And I just want to nail down exactly what day that is
  * You quoted the neighbors, saying when the moving van was there
  * Is it possible that I could get that name of the neighbor?
  * And I just want to go and confirm exactly what day they moved
  * The other thing is I think I mentioned this a couple times messaging
  * The two pictures that are used by the Daily Caller
  * I don't believe are the pictures of Jamal Awan and Omar Arwan
  * I don't think those are correct
  * And that you guys have published it twice now
  * So I just want--wondered if we could just do some more fact checking there
  * I noticed that nobody publishes the pictures of Hina Alvi or Imran
  * And the story is really about them
  * So I was just wondering if we can just publish a picture now as well?
  * Just to get a picture of all the conspirators 

---
* [[Day 213.6 Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_kELmGVLU8)
  * Okay. Day 213 I think this can be part five or six
  * This is the Congressional blackberry that I showed last night
  * I'm not going to show the markings on the other side here
  * There you can see I'll just show you the same blackberry I should show you quickly
  * This is a representation of a person who cares about the country and is coming forward
  * And more of these [Blackberries] are going to come into the picture
  * And more of these are going to be given to me and other journalists
  * And the conspiracy is collapsing in on itself.
  * ***This tracking of IT, and tracking of assets is very verbose in the networking business***
  * {{ snatchers: can confirm }}
  * ***So I just wanted to let everyone know that now's your time to come forward***
  * ***Don't be a part of the people that are in the witness box***--be a part of the people that are--excuse me in the the bucks of the accused in Nuremberg--***be the people that are in the witness list, testifying against the people in Nuremberg***

* [[Day 213.7 Hillary's Leakers and Hackers - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYR7mBsaYCw) -- second video marked 213.6)
  * {{ George is outside of LONGWORTH House Office Building }}
  * Ok Daaay 213
  * We're walking into Longworth Office Building.  This is the people's house, so you have a right as a U.S. Citizen
  * {{ 2 goons give George a sustained dirty Look }}
  * -- I'm doing a quick film guys, thanks-- 
  * You have a right to come in here...there's public space.
  * Every member is going to have a front office,
  * So that you can cut in and talk as a constitutent, you can mention that you are interested in certain issues
  * And then their staff will help you, and they even have a Congressional system--I think it's called iconstitutent
  * That you can enter your concern, any particular issue you're interesed in
  * Now, let these members go through here
  * You'll see the members all have pins and staffers will have pins
  * I'm going through security now so I'll have to turn my phone off
  * But we'll go to Trey Gowdy's office, maybe Louie Gohmert's, a couple of other members just to give you a feel for it
  * {{ SYMBOLS: per door: 5 bars, 1 eagle, 13 stars, 6 hellenized/pseudo royal arch masonry symbols as ornamentation; 5 inset lancastrian roses in relief on either side of threshold; 10 visible fascii/arrow bundles in pairs, along outer frame of each door }}

* [[Day 213.8. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5YGbTIQ_rs)
  * {{ GW is with Jason Goodman}}
  * Ok we just left--it's Day 213
  * We just left Devin Nunes' office
  * And we informed them about the DailyCaller Article today
  * Talking about the fact that the Awan Brothers who were working for up to, I think, 80 members of the House
  * Now had fled to Pakistan, so we're following that case
  * He's the head of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
  * So we'll keep following this case and see what's happening here in Congress

* [[Day 213.9. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atQXJpNbXns)
  * Okay 213
  * We just went into Debbie Wasserman-Schultz's office
  * Not quite the same reception we got at Louie Gomert's Office as we asked her about the Daily Caller article, where at 2:30 is it - 32 minutes 30 seconds, oh yeah she kind of threatens the Assistant Director of the Capitol Police
  * JASON: well I don't think we can say that, but we're talking about Obstruction of Justice
  * George: she says return the [IPAD]
  * JASON: So ... involved in an investigation she's insisting that it be returned an impact on the budget
  * GEORG: yeah I mean threatening a law enforcement officer's budget is--I mean--
  * Democratic Congressman here today are saying that's not good.
  * JASON: that's true we did
  * GEORGE: So we don't want to point those members out for their fear of their future seat.
  * I mean you never know if there would be a ~~in patata campaign~~[*intifada against that comment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intifada) {{ snatchers: George botched the word, because he's probably still hungover }}
  * JASON: But it's worth mentioning that *they mocked us*, they laughed at us, they didn't have a business card for the communications director, and someone came out to tell us // {GW} *leave the intern alone* //  'stop talking to the guy he has no comment'
  * GEORGE: Okay. Well there you go

* [[Day 213.10. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h71Ca1l6j_E)
  * Okay. Day 213 ***boilover day***
  * There's the Longworth office building right there
  * And just down that street is where brave and fearless Jason Goodman accosted Debbie Wasserman-Schultz
  * He has audio of it and so he's going to post the audio
  * And he is kicking himself for not getting the story
  * But there's a lot that was learned today, and it's amazing just being around, and this whole backpack journalism or whatever, really is instructive and I'm learning.
  * And I think Jason would admit...
  * JASON: {{ off-camera }} yeah
  * We're learning... we're newbies
  * But one thing we don't have is a lot of fear, and we've been just going to the representatives, and asking them questions
  * And we found one representative that knew the Awan brothers
  * And I think. We're going to keep asking the questions
  * JASON: well we found two, but only one would admit it
  * {{ BOTH LAUGHING }}
  * I could tell she knew who he was. Yeah.  The look on her face when he said that 
  * We're going to post it on #HRCRatline the audio of the chase
  * And I was impressed. I mean I was like wow. I've done some dangerous stuff
  * But that was...yeah
  * So anyway. The other thing is people keep sending me representatives and sending these senators to go talk to
  * And keep doing that
  * And especially people who are receptive to the idea
  * I think Jim Jordan somebody sent me from Ohio he's always been a favorite of mine
  * And he kind of is in the shadow a little bit of Trey Gowdy
  * And--make them compromise everybody make them compromise everybody
  * And I don't think Jordan they've got the Jordan yet
  * Just keep sending the names we'll--it's right there--we'll walk over there and we'll go do it
  * We'll ask the questions
  * Jason is even more --- yeah than I am
  * I have all this respect, and I don't know.  I think about Mr. Smith goes to Washington and Jimmy Stewart and all this stuff
  * But we are going to just keep up. This story isn't going anywhere
  * We figured out today, after talking to the congressional staffer last night, that you don't need to be--you don't need to have top-secret clearance to have access to
  * JASON: Oh yeah. They have access to the data.  He said that.  They have access but they don't have the clearance.
  * GEORGE: They don't have the clearance.
  * But all I have to do is get a laptop to an intern.
  * Then I send a member, or a staffer, or an intern down to the Verizon shop in the basement. They come back with a new Blackberry-- which has been mandated for certain communications--and I'm in business
  * Anywhere they go, the interns got all the data!
  * JASON: The question is: how are the Awans getting hacks on the new Blackberries?
  * GEORGE: Well yeah, mean I think that's the reason force of the Genie product stealthGenie.
  * Because the Congress Senate over here you can use moved over in July last year to to iPhones
  * But a lot of people in Congress, as you saw prominently displayed, it was almost like I'd gone back on a time machine ten years, and was seeing BlackBerries prominent. Prominently displayed at the Verizon Center there
  * So I think because of this hack, or this methodology that works for 12 years, remember.
  * This has worked since 2002, that they needed to come up with something else, and I think stealthGenie was that spyware for
  * JASON: that's all spoken about it WikiLeaks, right?
  * GEORGE: StealthGenie?  I don't know about StealthGenie
  * JASON: Vault7 then?
  * GEORGE: Vault7,no. What's interesting is the Congressional person we met his wife is REDACTED
  * JASON: Are you giving him away for saying that?
  * GEORGE: Yeah I just...I just ed-d--No.  Anyway, be expecting it
  * It's going to be redacted
  * Kim Dotcom I think inside track here, because you're chasing me on this one bro
  * So it's going to be REDACTED
  * It's going to be fun.
  * JASON: that guy just said 'two cellphones' got up, turned around, and looked right at us

* [[Day 213.11. Hillary's Leakers and Hackers - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyMIwkhQR8Q)
  * NO CAPs, reported...(FCC law requires captions :))
  * OK end of a long day, Day 213
  * I called day 212 you know Fahrenheit 212, that was kind of the boiling point where this thing frothed over
  * Day 213 is when it not only reached a boiling point it came over
  * And this DailyCaller article by Luke Rosiak is--as of yesterday--easily produceable, printable, and we can give it to members of congress now and say, 'here's an up-to-date summary from the dailycaller.  And I realize it's from a right-wing outlet with Tucker Carlson but it's pretty solid reporting of hey we've had people accusing people of kidnapping, extortion, intimidation of Congressional employees, cover-up, potential hacking, lots of evidence'
  * So these folks were in our Congress for 14 yrs. They are still under the employ--Imran is still under the employ of DWS.
  * Tried to ask her on the street today and she declined to answer
  * My intention is to get every member of the House and every member of the Senate to say the words ""Awan brothers"" in the Congressional Record or in some kind of Committee Hearing
  * Because I think this is Watergate now time maybe--if Watergate lasted 14 yrs rather than one burglary
  * It not just 20 burglaries that happened when the Awan Brothers left.
  * It's the burglary of all the information over every possible deal
  * Imagine a member of Congress negotiating or meeting with different lobbying groups and saying, ""here's what we want to do here and there and all that's being intercepted."" And then you can intercept what the proposed contributions are as well for the finance folks
  * It's always the finance folks where the action is and where all the nasty stuff happens
  * That's dirt on everybody
  * A hoover strategy of blackmail against everybody in congress
  * This is--it's amazing that Congress even works!!
  * I guess because Hillary didn't call in the chips. The chips--you have to make it look like this is accidental or somehow it leaked through an employee
  * But she's getting all this through the Blackberries and the laptops
  * Like I said this afternoon, all I have to do is send one intern in there, who's going to be there for 3 months, to get the ""thin client"" as they call it (the laptop) in the office, that's preconfigured with the Blackberry, and I've got everything!
  * And I don't even need a TOP SECRET security clearance
  * ***So this is exactly WHAT happened. I've confirmed this with members of Congress.***
  * The other thing I wanted to say is DC.
  * There's a video out there with DWS saying, ""there's going to be consequences"" to the Capitol Police
  * And if you have the power of the purse over the District of Columbia--the Committee that DWS is on has the power of the purse over that.  So she can cut funding to the Capitol Police.  She's in that power position
  * You're also in charge of--if you are on those committees--all the properties, official government properties, federally-owned properties.  Hospitals, the VA, up there on the hill, children's hospital, all those hospitals
  * You also have the harbro. You're also going to have Washington harbor.
  * So if I control Washington harbor, and I control whatever contraband is coming out--prisoners for organ harvesting, drugs, it could be anything
  * I'm going to end up linking this to a guy named Aaron Alexis, Lee Malvo--and that's going to be later on
  * The Office of Naval Intelligence is going to be the one that control that harbor, that's why I keep mentioning it
  * Hey Wayne Madsen--story's coming your way
  * This whole thing's going to unhook
  * One thing about going from the top of the pyramid where all these decisions are coming from, rather than chasing the fireworks at the street level--not to demean the Seth Rich murder investigation--still going to work on that. I just published Dr. Sava's SSN and all his aliases
  * But it's important to solve everything.  Just everything. For the last 30 yrs. Just solve it 'em all
  * And it's done by going after the brain-nerve stem the central intelligence of all this
  * Which is going to be Hillary, and it's going to be George Bush before that.
  * There's all these histories and mysteries that are in our sights now
  * If you have the background, and the email to be able to connect the dots. Then people don't doubt
  * When it's all theory, then it's much more skeptical and speculative and it's not convincing
  * But by going for documents.  DocumentsDocumentsDocuments that's how to win the battle
  * There are just certain things you can't phoney, you can't fake
  * And there are footprints
  * And all these things are going to come to roost
  * And I believe Gilani--the stepmother who filed the complaint in April against the Awan brothers for intimidation, extortion, and threats of kidnapping and murdering her relatives.
  * ***I believe she's been kidnapped to Pakistan***
  * ***Why would someone who had been threatened, her children had been threatened, her family had been threatened with murder and kidnapping...why would she go back with the Awan brothers?  That doesn't make any sense whatsoever when she's here in the United States***
  * So these are the things like
  * DWS if you watch the video with the Capitol Police Chief. She threatens him like 4-5 times about lost equipment
  * And that lost equipment needs to be returned to the members
  * ***So are you saying DWS that 20 members of Congress all lost their laptop--their 'thin client'--from their office, and lost their blackberry the same day in kind of a ""Hale Bopp Drop"" of blackberries.***
  * Was there some kind of blackberry protest that I don't know about, by Antifada, or whatever they call that group?
  * And they all just threw their blackberry and laptop out of the window?
  * ***No I don't think that's very reasonable to say that 20 different Congressmen lost a thinclient / laptop from their office and a blackberry from their office the same day.***
  * *It just doesn't make a lot of sense.*

* [[Day 212 Super Secret Suppliment (redux) Hillary's Leakers, Hackers and Henchment - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqmgyewb2S4)
  * Ozay Day 212
  * So I've spent the last five hours or six hours with a IT staffer inside the Senate and House
  * Okay. And in the reporting business the idea is get the person who you're trying to get information from drunk, and sometimes you have to drink yourself
  * So I'm going to be just straight up I have had some as well {{ you think? }}
  * But the the key is truth and the key is getting to what actually happens in Congress
  * And what the what the hell is going on what's the deal and
  * So Jason just gave me this blackberry
  * And this as I mentioned that Congress still uses Blackberry
  * And the Senate just recently came on blackberry but you can see the official markings right here
  * And I want to get this back to my contact, but I don't want to give away his name
  * But there are rumblings inside the Congress of this series
  * And these researchers that are part of this series, that are saying, ""hey this thing is is crumbling... this whole network of whatever has gone on for the last 20 years with Clintonseses is over""
  * And That.is.true
  * And I think John Podesta realizes that, and that's why he's going slightly a apoplectic with his Suites {?}
  * Now why are we here in front of Virginia Justice Center?
  * This is the Arlington County Justice Center
  * Because the thing I talked to you about before--the peepee dossier that haha Andrew McCabe spent a lot of money developing.
  * Peepee dossier which says two prostitutes peed on Trump
  * Also there's two other pieces.
  * Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen, the attorney for Donald Trump, supposedly hired Guccifer, not the person in jail here Guccifer but Guccifer 2.
  * And he also employed these people in Prague, Czechoslovakia
  * So Michael Cohen supposedly flew from the United States to Czechoslovakia to hire Guccifer 2 to hack the DNC--that's the cover story.
  * Well. That's not true.
  * Because the true story is Seth Rich on the 23rd, 24th or 25th--we're really honing in now on when exactly the drop was for the for the thumb drive
  * I don't have that yet, but it were in the 'hood
  * And then Guccifer 2 comes out on June the 15th
  * So that's where we are. If Guccifer 2 is a big cover for ""how the hell that all these secrets get out?""
  * So that's the DNC cover story is Guccifer one?
  * Now who is Guccifer one?  Guccifer one is in the County Jail here in Arlington Virginia. In Arlington County Virginia, Fairfax County Virginia.
  * And what did Guccifer one do?
  * He hacked Sony
  * JASON : Now why did he do that?
  * GEORGE: Because he wanted the information for Stars, major Hollywood producers, and actors, and I'm sorry I'm slurring, but that's the truth
  * And it was a Sony hack and Google it. It was Sony hack. And I believe the guy on the other side of this camera, Jason Goodman, got..is in the WikiLeaks TWICE!! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ for the Sony hack
  * So the Sony hack was was very interesting, because it wasn't like this super-complicated Vault7 blablabla we have all these sophisticated tools,
  * It was like 'Lakers' they tried to password 'Lakers', and that worked for like half the people that worked for Sony {{ #lemmingfail }}
  * So he was in he was in Romania
  * Hillary had him extradited--and McCabe--and they brought in here--he's now right downstairs
  * I was told tonight, by the owner this Blackberry--secure classified blackberry that I need to get to him tonight--that Michael Cohen--in this hackers versus leakers, will be the John Dean.
  * He will be in this kangaroo court that they're going to have for Trump
  * He going to be the guy who says, ""oh well yeah, I did hire this hacker, and then Guccifer 2, not Guccifer 1 that's in the basement here, but it could be Guccifer 1 who's going to be the star witness that said, ""oh I hacked Trump. He paid me to hack the DNC,"" which is all a hoax
  * So we're here to say that:
    * ""we know he's down here.""
    * ""We know the Feds have kind of a deal.""
    * ""We know they've said, 'here's what you need to say'""
  * So it's great, because we're ahead of the game, and it's coming.
  * Wait, just wait.
  * One or two weeks.
  * It's coming. That's all

  * I mean we're looking at that VA hospital, Children's Hospital, Washington--MedStar hospital--the other the other hospital, and I can't remember what what that fourth hospital is but it's kind of this VA row
  * You have to understand DC, and the purse that, the dominance that the members of Congress have over this committee has over the budget of of the DC mayor, the police force, the National Harbor, it all the resources within DC.
  * And you saw, through the video, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz directly plying her leverage against the Police Department
  * I mean it's not even--there's no attempt at at disguise!

Now, I haven't been keeping up with parts/specs in the past couple of years so I'm wondering what sort of performance boost I would get with this updated system? Is my graphics card already outdated enough to where it would bottleneck this build or what? I'm fairly certain my current specs bottleneck my graphics card, but I'm not that sure. Essentially, is this build worth it? What kind of performance increases will I see? Would I also need to upgrade my GPU in order to make this worth it, etc?

Also, feel free to change things around to make a better build. If it's possible to decrease the price to get something that's the same performance so that I could maybe fit a new case into the budget, then that would be fantastic. (Also pcpp says that the current CPU fan won't fit on the mobo, is there a similar fan that will keep the CPU as cool as possible, while also staying quiet?)

Edit: in addition to all this and seeing that the base upgrade is worth it, is the price and differences between a Ryzen 7 1700 and Ryzen 7 1800x worth the extra $200? Or should I actually get the 1700x?"
6d4fej,1,2017-05-24,Interviewing while being trained for long-term,throwmeawayperfin,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6d4fej/interviewing_while_being_trained_for_longterm/,"Hello /r/personalfinance. I had a question about what my obligations here are, and what to expect. I put a tl;dr at the bottom.

I graduated with a B.A. in healthcare management last May. Currently, my student loans amount to $19,000. I had a 10 week internship, saved roughly $4000 dollars from that, then moved back home with family. I had a lot of trouble finding a job because I didn't have a lot of work experience, even though I had been in two internships during college and volunteered for over a year at a hospital doing data-collection for a research study. 

I managed to find work in November. I’ve working as a receptionist at a private urgent care clinic owned by a larger corporation. I’ve been here for a little over 6 months now, and I’m earning $11.00/hr for  40 hours a week in a large California city. The receptionists do quite a bit more than the job description states. My supervisor is currently training me to be the hospital’s first Intake Clerk to compensate for this. He and the CFO are working on the job description, but for now I’m the only receptionist (out of 4) being trained in the work that the new job will require because I have the most ""free time"" to do this training. I haven't asked about a wage increase because it hasn't come up in conversation.

I initially planned to work at this job for a year to get work experience, but started to get really burnt out around March when I realized I wasn't earning enough to pay back my loans even if I were to put my entire check toward loan payments for a year. I have been job-hunting since then. 

This month, I have gotten a second health-education job that pays $18.75 an hour, but is per-diem, and I haven't had any shifts pop up yet. I'm in the last steps of interviewing at a university nearby for a per-diem role (No wage has been disclosed yet, but they told me they'll likely expand it to full time after the summer and some change. I meet the coworkers for an on-site ""interview"" in early June). I also have had two other interviews for county-level roles (salaries roughly equal to 40-50k), but the wait-time on these has been very slow and I don't expect a call-back anytime soon.

In a few days, I have an on-site interview at a biotechnology company as an Intake Specialist (No wage disclosed yet. When asked what I was expecting, I said roughly $20 - 25/hr and I wasn't shot down, but wasn't given an exact wage either). That role is for a 6 month contract , but most people at this company have become full-time after their contract, and I see that happening here because it's a completely new role they've made out of necessity. The other people interviewing only have offers for 3 month contracts, but I was offered 6 months when I e-mailed them to essentially say ""Hey, moving for a 3 month contract is going to be impossible for me at this point."" I would need to move into an apartment in a high CoL area for this to pan out (33% of the wage range I suggested would get me a single room in a shared apartment).

Should I make my current employer aware of these interviews going on? Should I use these as leverage to ask for a wage increase? There has been a lot of turnover recently, and I feel bad for having all these potentials panning out when I'm the only one being trained a job they're going to want everyone at my current job tier doing. My supervisor really likes me, so I don't want to burn that bridge, but I feel like walking away now when my department has already had 4 people leave within a 2 month period would be a slap in the face.

If I get an offer at the biotechnology company, should I take it, or should I bide my time with the per-diem roles (and government roles)? I'm afraid I'll lose out on the other potential offers coming up, but it feels like I'm meeting *everyone* for the on-site meeting and they've described it as more of a coffee date, so it seems like they're really likely to give me a good offer. 

I feel like I'm jumping the gun, especially since I'm blessed to not have to pay rent where I'm at right now, but my current job is very, very taxing and I'm tired of it. Even people in the middle of a health crisis have approached me, seen how much I'm doing, and stated ""Wow, you need another pair of hands!"" We're constantly under-staffed and it's frustrating because we have the feel and workload of a small clinic, but the bureaucracy of a corporation (wages and job descriptions seem like they are dictated by corporate). 

Not sure what my course of action should be here.

tl;dr Should I take the more immediate out and burn bridges where I'm at now with a 6-month contract role, or the slightly-less immediate route and try living on the per-diem jobs while waiting for offers from the county? Also, does it make sense to use potential offers to negotiate a higher wage, or should I stay hush-hush even though my supervisor has long-term plans that assume I'm going to stay long-term? "

6d4kxi,1,2017-05-24,"First Solo Trip - To plan or not to plan, and where?",JustTellMauler,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/6d4kxi/first_solo_trip_to_plan_or_not_to_plan_and_where/,"**TL;DR: where and when should I go in the next 2 months for 4-5 weeks? Should I plan something, or just book a flight in and out? Pretty few limitations, but heavily leaning towards Europe**



Bear with me as I word-vomit my entire train of thought. 



**Background:**
22M. Just graduated college, and I'm set up for a year long fellowship in SE Asia this coming academic year. While I've traveled extensively, its mostly been with groups, and I've never really ""explored"" anywhere on my own. The whole idea behind the fellowship and the like is to go get myself to ""shit in a hole"" for a little bit, see more of the world, and push myself outside of my comfort zone.

But before I go on this SE Asia trip, I'm looking to test-run of solo travel. I'm quite a 'Chad' and I think life has been a bit too easy for me, so I'm looking to go after two things I know that make me uncomfortable - being lost, and being alone - to prepare me for the next year. My main question: should I plan something and book things in advance for this trip (and if so, to where?) or should I just get flights in and out and wing everything in between?



**Trip Timeline:**
 I have from **June 8 to Aug 20** to do whatever. I don't need to use all of this time by any means though, so something like 4-5 weeks within this timeline may be better. Strange circumstance, but my summer internship turned into a full time job starting as soon as I return from SE Asia, meaning I suddenly have the rest of this summer free to go travel. This summer is my test run. 



**Budget:**
Without digging into savings, I have about **$5000-7000**, which would need to include flights from the West Coast of the US. I'm planning on backpacking wherever I go, staying in hostels, living pretty cheap and moving plenty.



**Travel Experience, if you care:**
[Here's where I have traveled so far](http://www.amcharts.com/visited_countries/#AT,FI,FR,DE,IS,IT,NL,NO,RU,ES,CH,GB,BS,CA,US,CN,JP,KR)
and in most cases I've traveled quite extensively through all of them. Road tripping across Iceland, weeks on the Trans-Siberian Railway, guided tours through Japan, cruises through the Mediterranean, etc. 

Places I'd rather not go:

SE Asia (already heading there for a year)

Certain places I can't go due to work (Russia, China, Middle East)

S America (have plans already for that in time)

Africa (not my jam)

This basically leaves going back to Europe to pick out places I haven't yet seen. Belgium, Ireland, a few cities in Germany and Spain, maybe Eastern Europe, or Portugal.  College did teach me Portuguese half-decently. The only active visa I have right now is a multi-entry with a couple years left for Russia - though all that's left there to see for me is Kaliningrad.  



**What I'm Into**
Culture (concerts, museums, classical music, walking around all day, etc)
Food (and beer/wine)
Limited Outdoorsyness (not trying to go camping for a week, but a nice long hike is prime)
I'm not really looking to find women or clubs or anything like that.  



**My Questions**

Where should I go?

Assuming I have already convinced myself to head to Europe, how terrible will it be to try and find space in hostels and such during peak season?

Should I plan something out, or should I just book flights in and out and freeball the rest of the trip wherever I go?
 
Is Eastern Europe - the one area I haven't spent time in - good for backpacking through? Meaning, friendly to US travelers, easy to find hostels, etc

many more questions for /r/onebag regarding the packing/bag selection process, but I'd also love to hear what others have in mind

who is going anywhere cool (likely in Europe) around this time that wants to catch a beer?

What else should I be thinking about, questioning myself over, and deciding upon to do this?

6d4ved,8,2017-05-24,Frustrated,smelerby,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/6d4ved/frustrated/,"Almost broke NC just now. Wrote the message and everything. Before sending it I grabbed my laptop and opened this sub instead.

What did I write?

""I was walking home just now and I just stopped for a moment and looked at the sunset. It reminded me of you, just so beautiful. I miss you. I miss us""

God am I glad I didn't send that. I know I wouldn't have helped myself in any way by doing so. It's just so frustrating. I'm starting to get really pissed at the fact that she just doesn't seem to care anymore. Her mom told me a few weeks ago she was still crying on the couch from time to time. Guess that didn't last very long, did it?

Past few days have been hard. I don't even know why. I vented about it here before and I'm sorry that I ended up posting again. It's the only way for me to vent right now. The one person I could always turn to when I was having a hard time has left me hanging and is the cause of all this in the first place. I don't want to bother my friends AGAIN and I'm all alone in the house right now.

I'm starting to feel alone. I used to exchange over a thousand messages with my ex every single day, now I can leave my phone at home all day and come home to a few insignificant messages. It's stupid that it makes me feel lonely, but it has left a big void since the breakup. I guess I just miss someone to share with.

I'm getting through the days ""okay"" right now. Internship and gym keep me busy, but those few hours before I go to bed are still hard. Even just sitting at the couch watching tv reminds me of her, how she'd be curled up against me and how she'd be eating her favourite candies while I was eating my greek yoghurt before bed. 

Anyways, I'm sorry for the rant again. I'm hoping I can sleep a little better than the past few days because I'm exhausted. Pretending to be happy is just exhausting."
6d4w51,7,2017-05-24,The Other Guys (The 2nd Guy on the Team to score a lot),doodypoo,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6d4w51/the_other_guys_the_2nd_guy_on_the_team_to_score_a/,"After seeing [the post by](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6d2142/kyrie_irvings_42_points_was_the_most_points/) u/aaliyaahson showing King James's teammates top 5 scoring outputs in the playoffs, I got intrigued to see what other stars have or have not gotten help. 

Here's the scoop:

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

**Edit 3:** 
Honestly wasn't trying to imply that Shaq was Kobe's sidekick, but by popular demand here are Shaq's best playoff teammates:

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

**Shaq**

Player|Points|Game
:--|:--|:--
Kobe|48|5/13/2001 Semifinals, Game 4 vs. Sacramento
Kobe|45|5/19/2001 Conference Finals, Game 1 vs. San Antonio
Dwyane Wade|43|6/18/2006 Finals, Game 5 vs. Dallas
Kobe|42|5/11/2004 Semifinals, Game 4 vs. San Antonio
Dwyane Wade|42|6/13/2006 Finals, Game 3 vs. Dallas

&gt;

Fun Fact: The only player other than DWade and Shaq to score at least 30 during the playoffs amidst Shaq's 3-year tenure with the Heat, was Damon Jones.

Fun Fact: Nothing is fun about poor A.I. I know he didn't always help himself, but when you realize that not a *single other player* on the 76ers scored more than 30 when A.I. was there, something is wrong.

**Edit 2:** I wasn't trying to imply that Shaq was Kobe's sidekick. I believe that it's quite the opposite. However, as the data shows the teammate that scored the most with Kobe in the playoffs was Shaq. I'm sure if we broke it down in to #8 vs #24 it would of course show a variety of players other than Pau Gasol, but that's what I was expecting. I was hoping at least one other Laker than Shaq would crack the top 5. 


There's 0 implication. Just data. I'll do Shaq later just for comparison. "

No problem, right? However it has turned out to be a huge headache and I've gotten nowhere. IT isn't my area of expertise - I'm computer savvy but that's as far as it goes, and to makes things more difficult I'm working on Spanish computers and my knowledge of the language is limited. 

I can't initiate a system restart or even a refresh without getting an 'Insert Media' error.  I've tried downloading and mounting a Windows ISO, which eventually lead me to converting an install.esd file to install.wim, everything set up perfectly based on the guides I've read online but I still get the same error. 

I have also tried upgrading to Windows 10 but that doesn't seem possible based on the fact that I'm using Windows 8 Enterprise. 

Does anybody have any idea how I can initiate the reformatting process and/or upgrade without any product key or media for Windows 8 Enterprise? Is the only solution just to pirate a new OS? "
6d59f8,2,2017-05-24,F4M --- Roleplay based off TV/Movies. R34 Ideas inside.,Television-RP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6d59f8/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_r34_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, bubble butt opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Game of Thrones**; Daario or Robb Stark would be my top choices. Maybe even Mero! I'd like for them to be fucking a Dany impersonator with a great curvy body.

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Trial And Error**; Josh the lawyer, please! A backwards little town with him fucking a gorgeous new intern or simply having a night of fun.

♥ **Great News**; A few ideas that mostly revolve around sneaking, fucking during a live broadcast, etc. If you play Greg, I would like to be a secretary, reporter, a celebrity guest on the show, etc!

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. 

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **Daredevil**; I'm solely interested in Matt! I would like to play as a female criminal such as Black Cat! Other than that, a secretary/intern/woman coming for help to his office would be ideal.

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. **Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot!** I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love; anal, creampies, rimming(giving/recieving), rough sex and dirty talk. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"
6d5aj1,35,2017-05-24,i didn't release music in over 1.5 years because i was depressed. i then completely changed my sound and within a month my first song is now sitting at 120k+ streams. i hope this post helps someone believe in themselves &lt;3,cozyboycries,Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/6d5aj1/i_didnt_release_music_in_over_15_years_because_i/,"TLDR: i started with metal, rock, and indie––nobody listened to my music. i hit some crazy life shit and became depressed for 1.5 years and almost gave up on music entirely. i switched my genre to downtempo experimental trap and released a song on a whim. that song now has 120k+ streams in just one month. the message: do what you love and persevere &lt;3 [the song](https://soundcloud.com/cozyboycries/i-gave-head-to-my-best-friend)

&amp;nbsp;

this is my first post on /r/Music, so forgive me...

&amp;nbsp;

it all started when i was in 7th grade. i scrounged up $75 and bought a shitty electric guitar and amp off craigslist (against my mom’s wishes) and delved into playing post hardcore and metal songs as hard and as fast as possible. yep, i was that kid.

&amp;nbsp;

when i hit high school, the acoustic emo wave hit me like a ton of bricks and i switched to playing almost exclusively acoustic heartbreak songs (think dashboard confessional and daphne loves derby) and i would sing and play for girls during lunch. finally, some friends and i made a band and we started writing a bunch of songs together––i was the guitarist and had nothing to do with singing or lyrics, mind you. after awhile, we found a student audio engineer on craigslist who had a dope studio and dirt cheap prices and we recorded a 7 song EP. it was so much fucking fun.

&amp;nbsp;

fast forward a year and our EP ended up doing nothing special on the internet and eventually the band broke up. however, i was completely awestruck by the recording process and i knew i had to get into it myself.

&amp;nbsp;

one of my teachers (shout out Mr. Sempli!) let me borrow 1 of the 5 macs in our school’s computer lab (against the administrations wishes) and i hit garageband HARD that summer. i started learning the recording process by watching youtube videos online and, since i had no hardware for recording live instruments or vocals, i taught myself piano and started recreating kanye west beats in MIDI. towards the end of that summer my friend let me borrow a rock band USB mic and i wrote some raps and hooks and copied kanye’s flow while changing the lyrics––my very first, terrible terrible rap songs. they were so bad! but i loved them because they were mine (i still have them heh) and these songs solidified my love for making music and recording.

&amp;nbsp;

by next summer i was ready. i scrounged up enough money to buy a mic (i was working 3 jobs at the time) and my teacher let me borrow the big, beautiful mac once more. i torrented logic pro (don’t worry, i have a legit copy now) and started recording the songs i’d been writing that year. i made more terrible songs, but i was getting better and i was having the time of my life spending hours writing and recording and exploring all the logic pro plugins.

&amp;nbsp;

another year flew by and college shit came to a head––do i study engineering? or music? i was always good at math and decided that it would be easier to change majors from engineering to music than the reverse. i finally saved up enough money for a laptop––i was going to college afterall––and bought a legit copy of logic pro X. the songs i recorded the summer before college were actually pretty good. they were indie rock.

&amp;nbsp;

then came college. that shit was hard. i struggled in engineering (like every engineer does) and i didn’t make music for almost an entire year. it almost killed me, literally. by my second year of college i said “fuck it”, i’m making music again even if i fail out of engineering. somehow it all worked out. i was heavy listening to bon iver and sparklehorse at this time and decided i was going to make a solo lofi-indie-folk project. i wrote some songs and self-produced a 6 song EP that summer while working my first 40+ hour a week engineering internship while living in my best friend’s spare bedroom (living at my mom’s was fucked, i couldn’t go back).


then i transferred colleges. yep, that was rough too. i lost all my friends and familiarities and started anew at a different school in a big city. furthermore, i was low on funds (did i mention i’d been supporting myself since high school?). i needed money, so i got a campus job doing computer shit and started doing freelance videography and photography for artists. i was charging $100 - $300 per video… and people were paying! that was a crazy time. i networked with a lot of artists, but most of them saw me as an “engineering major who does video for money and music for fun” when in reality i was an “engineering major because i was capable of it who needed money for rent so i made videos, but really really wished he had the balls to only pursue music because that’s his passion”.

&amp;nbsp;

oh! and my EP? one of my songs reached 1000 streams in about 6 months. i was ecstatic.

&amp;nbsp;

by this time i started work on my first full-length album. this was going to be my best work yet and it was gonna blow! i got another internship and this time i got my own hotel room for an entire summer… talk about moving up! i was used to sharing rooms to cheapen rent and living in spare bedrooms haha. i worked and made music the entire summer. it was great!

&amp;nbsp;

and then it happened.

&amp;nbsp;

i dropped my album and right after i fell into a deep depression. it lasted roughly 1.5 years. some things resurfaced from my past that i wasn’t ready for and i just fell away. i was afraid; i was sad; i was lonely; i was hurt; i hated my own music; i felt like i wasn’t good enough to ever make music that people would like; i was tired; i was uninspired; i was broken; i was burned out. the list goes on.

&amp;nbsp;

oh, and my album? it didn’t do anything. i think it still sits with one song at 400 streams.

&amp;nbsp;

""music music music. why the fuck do i make music? what the fuck is wrong with me? i work so hard and don't sleep and get “creative”… for what? to have no one but myself give a shit? i want to connect with people. i want to inspire people like how i get inspired by the artists i love. i will never reach that. i’m an uninspiring person––fuck that, i’m stupid for even trying. i’m not as talented as bon iver or as cool as kanye. i’m a fucking engineering major with little to no free time and no safety net. look at all of these music majors! they are so talented, i’ll never be like them. i’ll never get anywhere with music....”

&amp;nbsp;

god that was a crazy time for me. i've never been so negative in my entire life and it lasted a very long time. however, there was a silver lining. spooky black. i started listening to mother fucking [SPOOKY BLACK](https://soundcloud.com/spookyblack). something changed in me. i couldn’t get enough. i listened to his entire discography on repeat for hours, days. it was a drug. i couldn’t get away from his music. i don’t know why it struck me so profoundly, but it did. right time right music i guess. i started asking my friends “have you heard of spooky black?”. most of my friends thought his music was lame and his videos were weird and gimmicky, but i simply could not get enough. how does he make these sounds? he’s a genius. then i started learning that he was working with producers and he mostly just sang and that he was a 16 year old kid with short songs and millions of listens. i was baffled and stirred... although it would still be about 1.5 years until i actually did anything about it.

&amp;nbsp;

i then started slowly dabbling in making beats and learning how to sample. i had basically ditched indie at this point (i just didn’t really like it anymore) and joked to myself about getting back into rapping like i did in high school. i didn’t show anybody anything. i barely even told people that i was still making music. i was just trying to make shit that i would want to listen to while exploring this new genre: downtempo experimental trap.

&amp;nbsp;

after about a year of dabbling i started liking my own music again. i was still fucked up and situationally depressed, but music started coming back. it was equally exciting and frightening. i still didn’t tell anybody anything. i was afraid to give my music life outside myself. i made some terrible songs and some… good ones? i wasn’t sure to be honest. towards the end of the 1.5 year span i was really coming out of my deep sadness. i finally dealt with some familial things from my past and i was living healthier and sleeping more and making little songs every now and then. by this time i had a decent job that i liked that paid well enough to live without chasing my tail all the time. things were looking up. finally, on a whim, i decided to drop my favorite song on soundcloud under the name cøzybøy. at this point i had really only told a handful of my closest friends. i loved spooky black, so i sounded kinda like spooky black, so i decided to direct message spooky black fans on instagram with my song and spread it throughout the downtempo community as much as i could.

&amp;nbsp;

in a month, my song hit 120k streams. i cried. i was so overwhelmed that i cried in the middle of the day at work. i wasn’t balling, mind you, but tears were definitely coming down my face.

&amp;nbsp;

and to top it off, i got more than just a stream count. people loved the song. i was getting so much love in the comments and direct messages &lt;3 people were saying how my song helped them through a tough time. some people said they were huge fans and knew all the words and couldn’t wait to support my next release. others said they’d been listening to the song on repeat for hours. the feedback was so crazy to me. i was (and still am quite honestly) so overwhelmed at the response.

&amp;nbsp;

since then i have dropped 2 more songs and i have big plans for cøzybøy and i feel so much happier with myself and my music.

&amp;nbsp;

here’s the thing, i didn’t come from money, i worked 3 jobs throughout my junior and senior years of high school and i worked 20+ hour jobs throughout college. i never took any lessons, i never had a mentor, i never studied music, i never knew what i was doing. i just knew that i loved what i did. it was inescapable. i know that i have a long way to go and there are many more successful people in music out there than me, but today i am on cloud nine and i just wanted to share my story and tell everyone (including myself) that you can really do it and never give up and love yourself &lt;3

&amp;nbsp;

oh, and here’s the song: https://soundcloud.com/cozyboycries/i-gave-head-to-my-best-friend

Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd edition by Andrew Gelman was the best textbook. I should have started this first over statistical rethinking and that one puppy book.

It's a really good book and very comprehensive. I've taken statistical inference and computational statistic so this book is perfect for me. 

The stat/math is strong in this book but nothing too bad for an master of applied stat student I guess. I'm very much applied and only theory class is stat inference really. 

Currently doing this for internship.

Was curious if you guys have any Bayesian Network book recommendation?

I currently have

* Adnan_Darwiche_Modeling_and_Reasoning_with_Bayesian_Networks
* Bayesian_Reasoning_and_Machine_Learning_David_Barber
* Building Probabilistic Graphical Models with Python
* Denis,_Jean-Baptiste;_Scutari,_Marco_Bayesian_Networks_With_Examples_in_R
* Daphne_Koller,_Nir_Friedman_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_Principles_and_Techniques

It seems like Dr. Adnan Darwiche is good from the rating. Dr. Koller is more overall. The python one seems too applied. Likewise with the R one. Would love comments on these books including the R one. I need to do one eventually for my internship."

So I'm a 21 y. old guy working as a nurse in intern medical clinic. It's a really tough place, people die here nearly on daily basis. I love this job so much that I can't imagine myself doing something different. I'm always trying to be kind and smile and it nearly always with me developing a very good relationship with my patients. They're always happy when they see me, usually even they families know me because they even talk about me when they are at home!
I love this job so much, I can bring some hapinnes to often last days of someones life and make them smile.

But as I said many of these people die. And recently some intersting stuff started happening to me.

I often see figures in corner of my eye. Like they just stand there and watch me. It's always just a split-second. I don't really get scared from that. A few times at home (I live alone) when I saw someone like this while playing games I said something like ""Hey friend! I'm just playing some games right now."" 
I'm not sure if it was crazy but I just felt like saying hi. 

Later I starting waking up with my stuff moved around. Nothing big, I had for example a chicken breasts on my PC table in the morning. It was on a plate right next to my keyboard.

But then I even had a few nightmares, last time it was 2 days ago. They always show different stuff but all of them end the same way. Something enters my place goes trough the kitchen to my room stand right above me and I wake up scared.

Maybe it's just that I'm overthinkig something but could I be doing something wrong with my work? Could I attract something or someone to myself?

Huge thanks to anyone who will read this!

6d6grm,6,2017-05-24,Chatrealmer's Ridiculously Unofficial Movie Draft Update Memo (CRUMDUM) - Summer '17 - Week 9,MovieLeagueMike,DiamondClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondClub/comments/6d6grm/chatrealmers_ridiculously_unofficial_movie_draft/,"&amp;nbsp;

**1st Place - Night Attack - $301M ($53M last week) - $58 - 5.2 Multiplier**

They quickly fell far behind, but, staring at a nearly insurmountable deficit, somehow persevered and actually took the lead, managing a comeback of historic proportions, one that no sane person thought possible.

Stupid Game 3 Celtics.

Here in the Summer Movie Draft, however, everyone saw this comeback coming. Justin and Brian started out $200M back before releasing a movie, but we all knew *Guardians 2* would change that. Night Attack is now the one with a lead of $38M (as of Monday), and with their *Pirates of the Caribbean* opening this holiday weekend, don't be surprised if that lead soars to $39M!

Okay, it won't be that bad, but we don't have really high hopes for *PotC: Dead Men Make No Sales*. Mediocre reviews for the *fifth* iteration of a franchise does not spell blockbuster, especially given the competition from classic-in-waiting *Baywatch.*

&amp;nbsp;

**2nd Place - DTNS - $263M ($6M) - $45 Budget Spent - 5.8**

Tom and Jennie may have fallen from first place, but that doesn't mean they're just sitting around moping. In fact, they put their early-season movie draft experience to use and just completed a promising pitch to the bigwigs at Hasbro for an addition to their NERF brand--SNERFS. And we could have seen Papa SNERF and the gang on store shelves this coming holiday season had Tom and Jennie not been adamant about replacing the suggested foam pellet ""magic spell casters"" with a wide assortment of torture devices designed to rend cute little foam limbs from cute little foam torsos to teach those cute little measly-$43M-making bastards a lesson.

&amp;nbsp;

**3rd Place - Frogpants - $182M ($62M) - $51 - 3.6**

Scott and Brian move up a notch to third place after finally getting some post-*Power Rangers* good news with *Alien: Covenant* winning the weekend and grossing more than their Week 8 duo of *Snatched* and *King Arthur* combined ($36M - 35M).

Does this make up for the crushing disappointment--shared by us all--of finding out *King Arthur* was just another old-timey swordfest and not the long-rumored lost mashup of *King Ralph* and *Arthur*?

Or that *Snatched* dropped 60% in its second weekend, suffering from the unfortunate lack of a second Mother's Day to force reluctant moms to accompany their equally reluctant daughters to a poorly-reviewed mother-daughter comedy in a desperate attempt to prove they can have fun together?

Perhaps not, but Scott and Brian did salvage some level of solace by Photoshopping Schumer and Hawn's faces onto the bodies of Xenomorph victims.

&amp;nbsp;

**4th Place - Big &amp; Tall - $166M ($4M) - $18 - 9.2**

For the second straight week, Father Robert and Patrick drop a spot. This really isn't unexpected, given that the league will hit Memorial Day with Big &amp; Tall the only team with only one movie released. Sure, it's no fun slipping down the standings, but on the plus side, owning any of the other eleven released movies would have raised to unacceptable levels the risk of owning CHiPs. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
**5th Place - ScotchBros - $59M ($0M) - $29 - 2.0**

This is it. If Cargill and Jason's season turns around, this is where it starts--on a sun-and-skin-drenched beach home to the wacky, ribald shenanigans of *Baywatch.* And we are all in. We think *Baywatch* will pull off what *CHiPs* could only dream of (the dream lasting fifteen minutes into its opening day)--being a raunchy, R-rated comedy *that makes money.*

Sure, in our younger days, many of us referred to the TV series as *Babewatch* and tuned in with a certain prurient anticipation. But we hear that the movie version takes a much more nuanced look at the stresses faced by the men AND women keeping our beaches safe. Do they blow off steam with some risqué humor? Sure. Who wouldn't? But the film apparently spends most of its time probing sensitive issues from a decidedly feminist point of view sure to resonate with today's modern audiences.

Hang on. Seems that was just a research intern having some fun. Go ahead and disregard everything but ""risqué humor"" and ""probing.""

And watch the box office bucks roll in.
 
&amp;nbsp;

**6th Place - Cordkillers - $50M ($1M) - $19 - 2.6**

Nobody is going to celebrate Memorial Day more enthusiastically than Mulango and Kristi. Yes, beginning of summer, picnics, pool parties, blah, blah. More to the point is that it signifies the end of Cordkillers' box office wasteland that was March through May and ushers in The Month of Redemption.

The Summer Movie Draft may be five months long, but Cordkillers' fate will be decided in June, their month anchored on its final day by both *Despicable Me 3* and *The House*, and kicked off three weeks earlier by *The Mummy.* This latest incarnation of the Universal horror classic features Tom Cruise sprinting for his life and swimming for his life and driving for his life and fighting for his life and being thrown about an out-of-control plane and why isn't this called *Mummy: Impossible*?

&amp;nbsp;

**CHATREALM**

1. IcyWeiner - $556M

2. Karmakin - $545M

3. 10 teams tied - $525M

We should be able to start whittling down the number of contenders to a manageable amount by the next CRUMDUM and make some predictions. If not, we'll go ahead and make wild ass guesses. Who'll know the difference?

&amp;nbsp;

---------------------
These guys are all counting on box office returns to win the Summer Movie Draft, but when are box office returns a bad thing? When the box you're using as an office has to be returned to the neighbors so they can send back their malfunctioning dishwasher.

6d6vjk,68,2017-05-24,Seduced by an older man in NYC (part 1) [First Time],im_daddys_boy,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/6d6vjk/seduced_by_an_older_man_in_nyc_part_1_first_time/,"I know this is an incredibly long story, but I wanted to finally write it out and share it with others. Everything below is true as close as I can remember the details!

&amp;nbsp;

Almost a year ago I scored a great internship that I knew would open me up to a lot of new opportunities. The only problem was it was in New York City, a several hour drive from where I went to college. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to go. I had just broken up with my girlfriend of two years and the end of my junior year was a bit of a rough patch. I needed a change of pace and some time to rediscover myself, so moving to New York for the summer felt like the right thing to do.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Fast forward a month and it’s June. I’m living in recently renovated 3 bedroom in an affordable part of Brooklyn, my effort was being recognized and complimented at work, and I was really settled into my new life. I walked and rode my bike everywhere I went, working out regularly when I got home in the evening. My muscles were becoming more pronounced and gaining definition. Exercising and eating right just became a natural habit and never had I felt healthier. All that working out also got me worked up. I don’t know if it was the heat or just because this was the first time in two years I hadn’t had consistent sex, but I had also never felt hornier. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

Up until then, I had only had sex with girls and only a few at that. Throughout college I began to realize just how high my sex drive is, and when my girlfriend didn’t sleep over, I was watching porn and teasing myself. It started off out as gradual curiosity, but over time I found myself watching more and more gay videos. By the time I was in New York, I was regularly watching mmf threesomes, solo male, and DILF videos. I even bought a prostate massager and toyed my ass on Chaturbate once in awhile, surprised and very turned on by the number of viewers and all the awesome compliments I was getting. Don’t get me wrong, I was and still am attracted to women, but as I was discovering these fantasies I could not get cock off my mind. I kept finding myself returning to thoughts of older men and having my cock harden to the kinkiness of the age difference. Just the idea of a strong, confident man taking control and showing me the ropes of hot man-on-man sex by fucking my brains out made me lose it. I wasn’t sure at this point if these were just fantasies, or if I actually wanted to get fucked by a man 20 odd years my senior. At the gym I noticed the older, fit guys flexing. Walking through Midtown to work I noticed all the hot studs in their suits rushing to work. Everywhere I went I couldn’t stop my eyes from wandering and undressing men in my mind. I wasn’t actively trying to make these fantasies happen, but it was impossible to repress my attractions.

&amp;nbsp;

One night I got off a late shift at work and needed a drink, so I headed to the closest bar and ordered a beer. It was about midnight and the place was pretty busy, mostly a 30 and up crowd Not too calm but not too crazy: my kind of vibe. I was checking messages on my phone when someone claimed the seat next to me at the bar.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Hey, can you check the Yanks score from earlier real quick? My phone died.” 
 
&amp;nbsp;

I looked over and next to my left was a guy in what guessed was his early 40’s wearing a stylish and well fitting navy blue suit. He was fit and had a confident, masculine voice.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Uh, yeah. Sure,” I said, looking it up. “3-0 Yanks.”
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Great. Thanks.” He replied, taking a sip of his cocktail.
 
&amp;nbsp;

My eyes drifted downward and I glaced at his tight fit pants and how they hugged his defined body. When he took off his jacket, he rolled up his sleeves, revealing strong forearms. I felt my heart rate go up and all of a sudden a nervous sensation rushed through my body.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“I’m Kevin. Want another one?” He asked, pointing to my drink.
 
&amp;nbsp;

He asked about my job and he mentioned he was into real estate a few hours north but spends most of the year in the city. He was leading the conversation but I also could tell he was trying to be casual about it at the same time. I’m not usually one to make conversation with someone next to me, so appreciated how laid back he seemed. We drank that round and the conversation kept going as the alcohol started to ease my nerves and loosen me up. He made me laugh and I could feel myself slipping out of my normal personality. He was wooing me, not the other way around, a dynamic unlike anything I really experienced with girls before. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

I felt someone bump into my stool, and Kevin instinctively guided me forward by the small of the back so someone could pass by. His touch sent a light shiver down my spine and my heart fluttered. I may have subconsciously bit my lip slightly as we continued talking, though I don’t think he noticed. I knew I was attracted to men, but I had never actually been hit on a guy before. Wait a second, I thought. Is he even hitting on me? I have no idea if he’s gay or not. Am I just projecting my own fantasies on the situation, or is he actually into me?  Things were moving quick and I felt like I had to make a decision. Do I let go of my inhibitions and just see what happens, or do I do what’s more comfortable and stay inside my comfort zone? I took a sip of my drink and gave in to the moment. I wasn’t necessarily flirting, but I was letting him initiate things and steer whatever might happen. When I finished my third beer I was about ready to cut myself off from drinking, and that’s when he hit me with it.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“So I know we don’t really know each other, but I have an uber coming in ten minutes and I’d like you to come back to my place for a few more drinks if you’re interested.” He must have seen the uncertainty on my face as I processed how to respond, because he lightly brushed my thigh. “I will admit, I think you’re really hot, but I also just want to continue talking to you. A few drinks can just be a few drinks and that’s fine.”
 
&amp;nbsp;

“I’d love to,” I said blushing. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

The next thing I knew we were driving back to his apartment, the sexual tension building as we both pictured what might happen next. I playfully flirted with him and tried to keep him guessing as to if we would be just having drinks, or if he’d be getting some. I could tell he was a gentleman and would respect whatever I wanted to do, but it was clear he had plans for me if I let him have his way. 

&amp;nbsp;

“You know, I don’t even follow baseball,” he said grinning, “I just needed an excuse to get close to you.” I smiled and complimented him on his pickup skills.
 
&amp;nbsp;

We arrived at his place, he scanned us in, and we hopped into the elevator, my body buzzing with anticipation and sex hormones. When the doors opened at the 3rd floor, they opened right into his apartment. He said he was in real estate, so I expected he made good money, but I didn’t expect him to have Greenwich Village, 3 bedroom 2.5 bath kind of money. He held my hand as we exited into his living room and I embraced the feminine feeling of being led. We went to the kitchen and he picked out a bottle of wine. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

We made banter as he poured two glass, but it just felt like beating around the bush. Only a few sips in we shared a brief moment of silence that felt incredibly tense. Again I felt that rush throughout my body as we locked eyes. I bit my lip and he went in for the kiss, lightly resting his hand on my hip, pulling me in as I kissed back. I melted in his arms, losing myself in the moment. His stubble brushed against my smooth face and I could smell his masculine cologne. I felt lightheaded and warm. So warm. When he broke our kiss I fumbled over my words trying to tell him I’ve never been with a man before.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Kevin, I . . . I . .  well, you’re the first man I’ve ever kissed.”
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Shhh,” he said, towering over me. “I could tell, baby. Let me know if you feel uncomfortable, ok?”
 
&amp;nbsp;

I felt safe and completely free as I let his hands roam over my body. He spun me lightly by the hips and faced me away from him, my ass rubbing against his bulge as he pulled me close. He kissed up and down my neck, one hand eventually reaching my cock through my pants and the other cupping my ass. I was putty in his hands. He commented on how curvy my ass was and how much he liked my toned body. I made a show of stripping, seductively swaying my hips as I removed my pants, letting my unbuttoned shirt fall off my body. I was wearing tight boxer briefs that hugged my round bubble butt. I could tell he was an ass man, because he couldn’t take his eyes or his hands off it. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Let’s get these panties off of you,” he growled in my ear. I bent over, shimmying out of them. “Do you want to try some new things?” he asked, knowing damn well I’d do whatever he wanted.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Yesss,” I moaned back, my cock now unbearably hard.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Then get on your knees, beautiful,” he instructed. I dropped in front of him and stared directly at the massive bulge in his pants. Holy shit, this is happening, I thought. I rubbed it from the outside, feeling it jump as I teased him and took in the moment. I put my mouth on where the head was and sucked ever so slightly, feeling him tense up. Even though I had never sucked cock before, I knew from my own experience with blowjobs that the passion put into it makes all the difference. I undid his belt and unzipped his fly, his cock springing up to attention right in my face. It was a solid 8 inches long. Thick. Straight. Perfect. I looked up at him in shock and he just ran his fingers through my hair. At this point, my nerves were completely gone. I wrapped my lips around my first cock and it was bliss. I loved everything about giving head. The submission, the sensitivity of the head, licking up the shaft, the eye contact. It was better than I had even imagined. None of my practice on dildos came close to the real thing, and I used a little too much teeth by accident. Whatever skill I lacked as a beginner, I made up for in enthusiasm. Kevin gave me a few tips and told me to imitate what I’ve seen in porn. Before long he was making noises and groaning as I slurped on his beautiful shaft. I could subtly taste his precum in my mouth, salty, manly, and leaking in thicker globs as I continued. He particularly liked when I stroked him really slow, twisting my hand around as I moved up and down, my tongue flicking his frenulum. 

&amp;nbsp;

Suddenly his breathing became more shallow and I could feel an unmistakable tension building in his cock. It stiffened in short bursts as he flexed it, maximizing the sensitivity and pleasure. He warned me that if I didn’t stop, he was going to cum, but I just kept on going. He placed his hand on my head, guiding me down deep onto his dick and I worked it as furiously as I knew how. Wave after wave of warm cum erupted into my mouth as he moaned in heat. Somehow I swallowed it, managing to keep my lips wrapped around him and letting him ride out his orgasm. When he finally finished, my lips were covered in his cum and we were both out of breath.
 
&amp;nbsp;

“Fuuuck,” he moaned, “What a good boy you are.” I had just made an older man cum with my mouth! I took the whole load! I couldn’t believe my fantasies were becoming a reality. He sprawled out on the bed and handed me a tissue to clean my mouth before kissing me deeply. I hopped up on his lap and straddled him, pressing my body and my stiff cock against his. We made out for a while before he started caressing my body. He’d start off by running his hands up and down my body, soft as a feather, before groping my ass and occasionally slapping it. Suddenly he grabbed onto me and flipped us both over. Now I was on my back as he hovered over me. He stroked my cock (which was noticeably smaller than his by the way) then put his mouth on it. I was in heaven. He fit my whole shaft down his throat and did the most amazing flicks with his tongue. He put my blowjob to shame, and I thought I did a good job. With how turned on I was and with how much my balls ached from being full of cum, I couldn’t last long. It was only a few minutes before I exploded  into his mouth, shrieking softly as he massaged every drop out of me. I fell back on the bed, totally spent. 

&amp;nbsp;

I knew what was supposed to come next, of course, but it was already around 3 in the morning and I had work in just a few hours. FUUUUCKKK. As much as I wanted him to fuck me, I knew this wasn’t the right time. He said I could sleep over if I wanted, but there were things at home I needed to grab before the morning, and I didn't want to show up wearing the same clothes to work. He understood, although I could tell he was disappointed. He told me how good of a job I did for my first time and again commented on how sexy he thought I was. I blushed again, he really knew how to woo a guy. I threw on my clothes, put my number in his phone, and we kissed goodbye before I walked into the elevator. He slapped my ass and made me promise I’d be back. I knew I would."
6d7jpo,79,2017-05-25,"PSA: You don't have to read or follow Abraham Hicks or any guru or anything; you DO have to align your actions, beliefs, and thoughts. My insight on the Universal Law and some examples and fun stuff.",b0xturtle,lawofattraction,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/6d7jpo/psa_you_dont_have_to_read_or_follow_abraham_hicks/,"Hello all. Am long-enough-time ""manifestor"", long-time lurker. I've noticed a few consistent trends in the community here for a while and would like to provide some personal insight that might help other people in their journey.

**1. Is it real? I'm not having any success and it's really disheartening because I really wanted such-and-such, etc.**

Of course it's real. It's the *""je ne sais quoi""* of reality, the driving force behind every ""I was just thinking about you,"" every ""That's so funny I was looking for something just like that,"" every ""You read my freaking mind, dude!"" And so on and so forth.

The Law of Attraction works and is always working. Everything you attract in this life is sourced from your core beliefs/desires, reinforced and strengthen by your thoughts, actions, and belief. One of my deepest-held beliefs is that I'm a well-traveled guy and I will travel a lot while I'm young. Given below are two actual scenarios that occurred to me for two FREE, amazing travel opportunities and the respective actions, thoughts, and beliefs that led to their outcomes:

**a. ""Paid Internship in California""**

Thoughts: 

""This internship would be unreal, and I really need to get away from Mom and Dad right now they're literally up my butt (not literally but close enough).""

""I have such a good chance in getting it. Well, I mean, do I? Mr. L said I'd have a better chance if I applied next year knowing the requirements... but I want it this year. I want it now.""

""I just have to be positive about it.""

""This is a huge company, and it looks like they get some high-caliber peeps applying. It's alright though, I'm at a good school with a good program... or maybe I'm not, but like, that could be my angle. I'm a big fish in a little pond, right?""

Actions: With three weeks to do the application, I drudged through it, constantly checking their LinkedIn intern threads, reading the same forum posts over and over, and generally just being nervous and not confident in myself. My essay was a polished ""eh"" with no heart, and I made a half-hearted attempt at supplemental material with a rinky-dink PowerPoint.

Beliefs:

1. I'm not really confident about this, I'm trying to make myself feel confident but I'm not confident.
2. So many other people are applying from bigger, brand-name schools and I'm just an under-dog they might believe in.
3. I'm not gonna get it.
4. This was difficult and honestly way over my head.

(**I didn't get it. I honestly could feel that I wasn't gonna get it, but I went ahead with my current game instead of being introspective and open-minded, because LoA, positive thinking, anything can happen if I VISUALIZE it hard enough, amirite? Nah, if you don't feel it then you don't feel it, and you're gonna have to adjust it until you do.**)

b. **""South Korea Study Abroad""**

Thoughts:

""You know every time I leave therapy I see the picture of those three kids posing by that national park in South Korea. I didn't even know this school did exchange programs; and what a weird place to host an exchange program. Still it'd be cool as hell to see South Korea.""

""Oh shit, Karen forwarded the application for the study abroad to me. She even said I had a good chance of getting it. Man, I fucking love therapy.""

""I bet no one even knows about it, me and two other kids are gonna be the only people go because we just put our names in.""

""This essay is like Satan's butt crack: absolute fire. The Deep Focus playlist on Spotify is my go-to for important stuff from now on.""

""I'm gonna get it. My references are way too good, my essay is way too good, and I doubt anyone even knows they do this program.""

""What I if I don't get it? I mean, I'll just go back to flipping burgers, doing dabs, and making some good ol' fashioned cash money by the beach. $500 a week ain't nothing to laugh at, boy.""

Actions: 

I went ahead and got good references from professors I liked, who I knew would be excited for me. I knew and FELT that I had a good shot, so I finished the application and gathered the required materials with a sense of purpose and urgency, a couple days before it was due. The morning of the due date, after class, I marched my butt to the computer lab and wrote a Pulitzer Prize-worthy essay, or it may as well have been because I wasn't leaving that PC until I had something good. I also went ahead and re-confirmed my summer job anyway, because I was still gonna wanna make some $$$ before and after the trip.

Beliefs:

1. I can get this, I so deserve this trip and I'm super qualified.
2. I doubt anyone even applied, so few people even know about this department, let alone this program!
3. This essay is the bee's-absolute-freakin'-knees.
4. My references are bar-none the best for this program.
5. I'll still have a good time with or without it, so I'm not gonna piss myself in worry.

(**Yeah, I got it. Turns out, out of 25-30 applicants, my essay was among the best and floated to the top of the pool, according to a lovely committee person I shot some soju with earlier. I had deep, genuine confidence and joy - I just knew I was gonna get it.**)

**2. Well I want fourteen billion dollars and a chiseled 24-pack without having to leave my bed, anything is possible, right?**

This isn't a personal attack on anyone at all, but the fact of the matter is: do you really believe that you can achieve these things without ANY action? This isn't a rhetorical question, **actually ask yourself that**. If so, then you're a probably metaphysical spirit master who lives in a castle made of gold and beautiful Norwegian models - and you wouldn't be concerned with this. If not, that's okay! That's pretty normal. You really can't try and force yourself to believe something that your mind absolutely refuses to accept, you'll give yourself a headache.

For the rest of us, grounded in this boring ol' physical reality built on *rules*, it takes a little more work. Yes, work - and action. You, and everything around you that exists (see: all matter) is in a constant state of vibration. You will remain in a state of low vibration until something transfers energy to you and you start moving and vibrating a little bit faster. The beautiful thing is, once you start vibrating, everything around you starts to vibrate a little faster as well. The wavelengths that comprise you and your little world will speed up, becoming something new, non-resemblant of what you were before.

That transfer of energy will usually start as a tiny little blip of a thought in your brain that tells you: ""Hey, we should move to Philadelphia, see something new."" And then you move your muscles and start burning some calories to fire up Zillow, making phone calls, and applying for jobs in Center City and it all just *feels* right. Eventually, that energy and vibration will dampen and transfer elsewhere in the universe, and you'll be vibrating at a low-speed again -which is fine, because if that's your content equilibrium then why change?

When you increase your vibration level you're moving into a higher state of energy and action; it's all about finding the vibration level you want to be at. It isn't some vague spiritual hokum stoners stay for shits and giggles.

(That's at least the physical gist of it, to the best of my personal explaining levels/understanding. For a large majority of people, including myself, it is more of a cosmic, spiritual phenomenon. Either way, it happens.)

**3. Hey, speaking of rules, I chanted 234 reasons why I'm grateful this morning in order to wake up the Manifestation Cyclone after chugging a gallon of boiled ginger extract but it's not working. What am I doing wrong?**

I don't want to step on any toes here; I know a lot of people in this community love Esther/Abraham Hicks and all that she does and I think some of her teachings have merit. 

However, are you really focused on what it is you want? Or are you getting wrapped up in small, arbitrary details? Are you trying to do spiritual, Law of Attraction-esque things to make it work?

You can't force the Law of Attraction to manifest something that you're not really, genuinely in search of. 
It can be a nice placebo effect to try and compensate for genuine attraction and alignment, but there is no substitute to self-awareness and alignment with what it is you want. Focus on your thoughts, actions, and beliefs, and see how it all fits together in the grand scheme of what you want.

Let's say you want an Audi. You see it in your mind: pearl-black, HD center display, roars like a dinosaur, your cheating ex-girlfriend/boyfriend/asshole-person shits themselves every time you start it up. It's time to manifest it.

Are your thoughts positive and aligned with owning this car? Are you happy about having this car? Are you gonna maintain, wash, and care for it? Or are you caught up on the parking situation outside with your roommate, or that credit card bill that's a little steeper than usual?

Are your beliefs aligned with you owning it? Are you sure you can afford it? Are you sure you can pay the insurance? Are you sure you can explain it to your parents when they got a Chili's gift card for Christmas?

Are your actions aligned with getting and owning an Audi? Are you consistently saving up for that steal of a bargain you see in your daily morning Audi search, nabbing a couple extra shifts every week? Are you making it known that you're in the market for an Audi, checking out dealerships and used car Facebook pages and asking around your personal network? Entering every local Audi giveaway you can possibly find? Researching and getting excited about all the cool Audi features you have?

That my friends, is true, genuine alignment. Before you realize it the stars will align and the Audi Gods will present to you exactly what you're looking for. And to think, but a mere couple months ago you were but a child with a dream and no 2010 Audi A6 with 86k miles on it.

**4. I have a lot of anxiety and depression, and I really want the LoA to work for me because it sucks feeling this way.**

You're right, it does suck. It sucks a whole lot. Your perseverance is unmatched and it's awesome you made it this far. I've dealt with serious anxiety and depressive symptoms my whole life, and I really want you to know that the best thing is to try and get some professional help of any sort. Right now your crocodile brain is so obsessed with **keeping you alive** from a danger that probably isn't there, which can really prove to be an obstacle to shifting thoughts and beliefs. Have hope and know, **truly know **that it can always get better**, and have the courage to take the steps you need to feel better.

I started counseling and therapy almost two years ago and my life has transformed so dramatically, giving me the ability to raise my vibrations and channel the uncomfortable amount of energy I want through me. Please, do it for both of us, talk to someone. You deserve happiness and can have it.

**5. I want to manifest my ex back but they don't want me back but I miss them and I know for sure truly that they're who I want. :(**

You're right, you do miss them. You miss how they made you feel and how life was with them in a relationship. There's no denying that.

However, in this time of hypothetical lonely pondering, would you be able to deny the attention of a smokin' hot girl/guy/person with a great personality, interesting hobbies, and a keen desire for you?

If the answer is ""honestly no, that sounds pretty darn fantastic but that won't happen."", then you're on the right track! Yes, it is fantastic! And yes, it will happen! Align yourself to the desire and let what's gonna happen, happen. Be open to a new vibration wavelength. Don't mope about, shift your paradigm like that old guy in the light blue sweater on YouTube says and let yourself be in the way of the GQ model-of-an-opportunity that you're attracting!

If the answer is ""yes, I truly truly truly want them back."", then please, take a step back a minute and reflect with me. If that person is desiring anyone but you, it just won't happen. You're not on the same frequency of life. You can't force someone to be with you. That's kinda rape-y, And you're not that kind of person.

****----------****

Anyway, thank you for listening to my thoughts and insight on the Law of Attraction. I know it is a lot to read but hopefully I brought value to someone's life. 

To all the beginners and believers out there, it works. Trust me.

To all the skeptics and naysayers, you're right. It doesn't work. I won't try and convince you.

(I'm sorry if the formatting is potato, I ranted this all out on mobile. I'll check for errors tomorrow morning.)

Peace and love friends.

Are the coop placements almost always completely related to the field?

6d88ma,21,2017-05-25,Am I the only one that thinks Mer's relationship with Maggie &amp; Amelia seems forced?,tigerXlily,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/6d88ma/am_i_the_only_one_that_thinks_mers_relationship/,"Meredith is a relatively private and closed off person to most of the world. However, she always has a few people close to her that she is loyal to the core to. It can just take a while (and a lot of tequila) for her to get comfortable enough to open up.

We've seen this so far with a good amount of people - first Cristina, then Derek, then the rest of the original interns... That tight-knit group has grown and evolved a lot over the past 13 seasons. It's usually felt authentic, but something about the past 2 years just hasn't sat well with me.

Aside from Mer/Alex, we see how close Meredith and her sisters (Maggie and Amelia) have gotten. They live together, and seem to be the new best friends. But it doesn't ring true, to me. Sure, these 3 haven't always been the best of friends. They feuded quite a bit when they first met, but now their closeness doesn't seem natural.

What bothers me is that Mer has never been a ""family"" person. She calls the people close to her her family, but never bound anyone to anything based on blood or legal ties (this is evident in her first encounters with both Lexie and Maggie). So why is she bffs now Maggie and Amelia? They don't really have much in common... and neither Maggie nor Amelia seem like the type of person Mer would choose to hang out with.

I guess most of Mer's real friends are gone now... but can't she find anyone else at the hospital that she actually has things in common with? I just don't get it."
6d8es9,25,2017-05-25,New SSR Trial - Light Defense,aexiv,Granblue_en,https://www.reddit.com/r/Granblue_en/comments/6d8es9/new_ssr_trial_light_defense/,"It's been awhile since we last saw a light character in the trials section! In fact, last light character was Juliet, and to this day, I still do not understand why Cygames assigned the drunk intern to label her as ""Defense"". Fortunately, this new character truly suits the role of ""Defense"", with the option to not even attack at all and instead stack buffs! Let's see how they fare.

*Favoured weapon: Swords*

Oooooh myy, the one weapon present in any end-game light grid. Until something new comes along.

**Ougi: Massive light DMG to a foe / Bonus DMG (DMG enhanced)**

Reminiscent of Sieg's ougi, it does SSR-level ougi damage and then packs on a 60-70% echo. Pretty decent chunk of ougi damage, considering the next skill...

**Skill 1: Activates Support Skill 1. Cooldown: 1 turn.**

Now to understand this skill, I need to unorder things and talk about the first support skill as it hinges all on it.

**Support Skill 1: Boost to hostility and defense. Boost to ougi damage and cap upon taking damage (max 5 stacks). Unable to attack.**

The hostility and defense gain are quite impressive; it essentially applies a 70% damage reduction on the character along with some extreme hostility gain. I'm talking extreme: in the 50 autos I tanked from the trial boss, MC only took 3 or 4 hits. Perhaps I got lucky, but to me it seems very noticeable. However, in a party setting, in 5 turns, character only got hit twice...So RNG is RNG, no matter how strong the hostility boost.

You can probably see this as the more defensive version of the Sociecopter, which may or many not be ideal because we come to the one shortcoming of this passive. Being unable to attack means there's no meter coming in. The passive doesn't give any meter at all to the character either naturally, HOWEVER, what the support skill doesn't say is that if the character takes damage, it'll build more meter.

In order to take advantage of the second part of the support skill, you ideally need to feed meter from somewhere to add onto the passive gain; you can use the character to tank stuff during Ferry downtime after ensuring they get to 100% meter first (which isn't hard considering the amount of turns you need). Being unable to attack does make it so you can spam that attack button faster with your hard-hitting characters, so that's one potential benefit (see: Sociecopter in grande parties).

The ougi-cap and damage components stack up to 200% damage up. Unfortunately I'm not able to test ougi-cap because my light grid is still very piss-poor, but we can assume the damage cap is also a 200% increase. A key thing to note here that is rather disappointing is that the echo from the ougi **is not boosted**. It is still calculated off the base ougi damage rather than the 200% damage up ougi. Another key thing to note is that the buff **will not expire until you ougi**. 

Skill 1 will go on a 9 turn cooldown after you use up the stacks, which is a pretty hefty cooldown timer, but in light, it actually doesn't matter too much when you're operating around Ferry.

The next two skills are pretty basic, and fulfill their role as a defense character splendidly. 

**Skill 2: 1-hit DMG immunity. Last: 3 turns. Cooldown: 4 turns.**

Honestly, a one hit immunity every 4 turns. Single target ougis, combined with Support Skill 1, will just become negligible. It is still a hit and miss considering the RNG nature of hostility up, but from my testing, it may as well be ""Gets hit regardless"", so this skill synergises very well with the support.

**Skill 3: 60% DMG cut to all allies. Last: 1 turn. Cooldown: 6 turns.**

Nothing fancy, nothing bad. Light was lacking a phalanx character, so this fills that void.

**Support Skill 2: Deal light DMG to all foes based on number of turns spent in Skill 1.**

Six turns is the maximum amount of turns required to be in stance 1. At the end of using Skill 1 again, 800% damage to all enemies.

Final thoughts

Honestly, this character just makes the downtime of Ferry extremely safe. Skyrocketting defense, hostility up, immunity, wall; you may as well not even look at your HP and just smack away at the boss. The timing of their skills match up perfectly with Ferry as well, and the ougi boost *stacks* with Ferry and Kaguya. Here's what I came up with this character.

* Turns 1-4: Ferrilicious TA with echo.
* Turn 5: Ferrilicious ougi.
* Turns 6-8: Build up some meter (assumming you have outside sources of TA like Elysian, Amira, GW dagger etc)
* Turns 9-12: Get pummelled for 4 turns to build up ougi-buff as well as some meter.
* Repeat cycle.

Even if RNG says no and doesn't hit the character as much as you'd like, you'll still end up with at least 2-3 stacks of ougi buffs. Just a very nice defensive character to have for tough content, and even better, they're not waiting until Xeno Diablo to release them, which gives people enough time to build up EMP and play around with them even more.

The only negative is the lack of damage compared to the gorillas of light, but if you need to bring a defensive character, this character will definitely be on the list. Does its job well, has synergy with the Ferry meta, and benefits from a sword grid. What's not to like?



...

SSR Baotorda hype? Could also be Light Charlotta, but...please, give us male Draph lovers a bone to chew on. It's been almost 2 years since our last beefy bull (Ghanda)...

If any light lords have different opinions from my rather lackluster light knowledge, feel free to correct me."

What time of year do you apply? And through which sites/portals? Is it significantly harder for second years compared to third years?

Long backstory: While I was at college I had a small group of close people that I and my boyfriend often used to hang out with. One of those people was a girl named Jenny and I used to think of her as my best friend - we had similar sense of humor, similar interests and I could connect with her on personal level. We used to have a great time just talking and hanging out after the classes or on weekends.
Well, situation drastically changed after one of our mutual professors offered me a job immediately after college. I was a good student and I could understand why this position was offered to me, but still wasn’t even sure if I wanted to take the job because this environment seemed a bit toxic and unorganized, and I had also envisioned somewhat different scenario after the college (I wanted to travel and live abroad for a while, and this job would immediately tie me to my hometown). 

Long story short - after they found out about that job offer and my internship, she and one other girl from our group started being cold towards me, stopped inviting me to hang out and actually started to chase after that position that was initially offered to me.  In the meantime, I already kick started my own business and started working on some projects alongside my professor (just helping out,  I wanted to see what would my job would be like if I started working there), and I was present on many occasions when Jenny and that other girl tried to include themselves in various projects. Eventually Jenny succeeded and she was offered my position, and I moved out of state with my boyfriend and further developed my business.

Sounds like win-win situation, right? Well, turns out that Jenny used my absence to cement her position in professor’s office by gossiping about me (note that we were once pretty close and she knows some personal stuff) and therefore denied me a chance to keep some professional contacts in my field at my hometown. She is now professor’s favorite; they go drinking and clubbing together etc.  From what I’ve heard, environment is even more toxic now, and I feel pretty great about not ending up working there...but...

Current problem: My gay best friend of 5 years just posted a picture of him French kissing Jenny while partying last night. And I feel really hurt. He was my support during that awkward job hijack that Jenny pulled, and I really wrap my head around what just happened. He is also one of the employees at the same firm (different department but all know each other) and I just don’t know what to say to him... should I even mention it? Should I just accept that it’s the way it goes in this weird office environment and think of it as part of the job...I have no idea. He is one of my only friends, and i really don’t want to lose him. But at the same time I’m beyond pissed and I don’t know how to react. I can’t talk to him in person, since I moved to different country, and I don’t know if I should text him, or email him, or call him, or do nothing and wait for him to contact me?

I have no idea guys...thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text (and my bad English, it’s not my native language) I would appreciate any comment or advice.



 
Edit: I forgot to mention that they are not romantically involved in any way nor planing to get romantically involved in future, this is just something that they did for ""fun"" and posted it on social media for some reason (he does that kissing thing sometimes if he is very drunk, and girls love it since he's gay so they say it doesn't count (weird, I know))
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My gay best friend just posted a picture of him kissing a girl (ex best friend) who tried to sabotage my job and relationships. They are both at my hometown, and I recently moved abroad. Not sure if I should react"

6d9re9,13,2017-05-25,Guidance needed: dealing with MOH being a bridesmaid of someone that hates me,mrs-hughes,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/6d9re9/guidance_needed_dealing_with_moh_being_a/,"A couple of years ago I had a falling out with a group of friends. I was basically - the clean up crew at parties, the person everyone dumped their problems onto, the yes man, the tag along, the one that was always there despite getting ghosted when people got boyfriends, etc. MOH, my BFF, was the same. And so after I started dating FH, I just got tired of being the auxiliary person there only to prop people up. So I said as much, and friends fight, so I figured we'd get through it and move on. Nope. They haven't spoken to me since I called out their bad behaviour, asked them to treat me better and give me some space. I was working two jobs, plus an internship, plus going to grad school at the time and still expected to be patsy.  

Fast forward to now, I've moved countries, and I have tried several times to mend fences with these people since this happened. Nearly two years. One of them even visited where I live, so I reached out, and she gave me a one word answer. I've reached out to them dozens of times and I get it now, they want no part of me, fine. That's their right. MOH has been hanging out with them more and more since I moved. She has told me (and I wish she hadn't) that they regularly talk shit about me at parties and hanging out. It's been really hard to deal with her maintaining these friendships for me, but it's her choice and I don't begrudge her that. I'm not her lord and master. 

But last night she informed me that, of this group of friends, the girl that's engaged asked her to be a bridesmaid and she said yes and she ""just wanted me to know"" before she posted a big thing on Facebook about it. The engaged girl just fired a bunch of her bridesmaids because she has trouble keeping friends for the reason we had a falling out. So really, MOH is just filling an empty slot and I guess I shouldn't feel bad about it, but I do. The engaged girl's fiance has hated me for years which is the cherry on top.

I really resent this because it's clear that since I've been gone, I've become the scapegoat for the falling out and been painted as a huge bitch that clearly manipulated MOH into not hanging out with them. Personally, and I've told her as much, I think it's stupid to continually go back and hang out with people that treat you like dirt, but she's an adult and that's her choice to do so. 

I could really use some advice on how to deal with this maturely. I have been hurt by this over and over for months because I don't understand how someone I love can keep company with someone that actively assassinates my character and roots against me as a person. I don't know how to keep their wedding from creeping up during my bridal events now because I know that will just hurt me so much. IDK. Help please :( "

Then, the first weekend we are back together at school, we hook-up/make-out again and we also talk a lot and the night before this, she opened up to me and told me how she sometimes wants to break up with her boyfriend who cheated on her a couple times and treated her like shit the past year before he graduated (she was a freshmen and he was a junior when they started) and she doesn't like how they are living different lives since he's away from her and she's still at school and doesn't like his friends both from home and the ones from school. So the next day after we hooked up she puts their relationship on a ""break"" because she doesn't know what she wants. Then the next weekend we hook-up twice and she finally lets me go down on her. Both of these nights we continue to talk about us together and she tells me how she really likes me and has never felt like this before since her relationship she is in now is her first ever ""big"" relationship so her liking me during it is all new to her.


I'm a gentlemen when it comes to women so I have never pressured her into doing anything and have taken this all at her pace and her guidance. Up until this point I have sent her books (Breakfast at Tiffany's and Bonjour Tristesse) with cute notes in them and have also written her several poems admiring her beauty and also confessing my feelings towards her. She tells me she has never felt so desired and liked in her life and loves how romantic and honest I am. So with this in mind, I let her know that I completely understand the complex situation that she is going through and simply let her know that she is in control of what she wants but I also let her know that I will give her space and time to figure things out more, but I tell her that I am very patient and have no problem waiting for her if she needs a lot of time.


So the next weekend comes around and I have restrained from talking to her in that I wanted to give her space since she is on a break with her boyfriend, but she texts me and is flirty so we eventually hook-up again and this time we both go down on each other, her initiating it all. During this hook-up session we were about to have sex but I said I wanted to wait to have sex with her as I want it to mean something and she agreed. Later that night I sleep over in her bed with her and we just talked. A couple days go by and we are talking about our situation and she texts me:


""God idk sam something about you I just like can't resist. I think you're so smart, funny, interesting, kind, and so unique. I care about you in a real way. I'm obsessed with your family and your interests. You're so different from anything I thought I would like, Not trying to offend you but it's just kind of crazy for me and scary all at the same time. I feel bad though I don't wanna do anything to hurt you""
Which I pretty much reply telling her I just want to be with her and be a part of her life and she mine.


So, we have one more weekend before finals and summer begins and we end up spending a great deal of time together both studying with each other in the library, getting late night snacks and smoothies, and watching movies together – spending 6 full days with each other. We hooked-up 4 times during this period since her roommates were gone and I slept over 2 nights. The most significant night was the night before she left to go home and we found ourselves talking about literally everything and pulled an all-nighter together. During this session she really confessed how much she likes me and sees me as a great boyfriend/us dating and also talks more about her relationship... telling me how her sex drive is higher than her boyfriend's who has never made her orgasm (which I have), only lasts 5 minutes, and just isn't nearly as experienced or romantically sexual as I am to her (which she loves). So she continues to tell me how much it sucks that she is missing out on a good sexual relationship and confesses that she gets herself off thinking of me. We continue this convo with her telling me how much she loves us hooking up and how even us kissing is better than her and her boyfriend's as we connect on such a different level and kiss and touch each other in the same rhythm and in tandem. We also describe our ideal partners together and pretty much tell each other the other is perfect for us.


So she leaves the next day after we have one more cute little hangout (I brought sandwiches and we watched a movie) in her bed, talked, and hooked up one last time.


So we've both been home for almost 2 weeks now and have been talking non-stop, sexting and saying how we miss, think of each other, and want each other so much. Though, the other day, she tells me how she still needs to talk to her boyfriend and try to figure her side out ""before we could ever be together"" and so we talk and it pretty much ends with her saying:


""Basically I don't know if I can just end it with mike. He's been my person for 3 years it scares the shit out of me honestly. How do you just cut someone out of your life who's been there for so long? It just really really scares me. That may be stupid reason to stay with someone too but there I said it. It just sucks how I feel like I have to pick someone I guess. Like I wish I could have just met you not like this almost so I could just be normal. I honestly do see myself dating you I just don't know when. And I'd say yeah wait for me but that's not fair to you even though it would be hard for me to see with you someone else. Just do what you want I guess and I know I can't have both worlds. I feel like I'm gonna go back to school and wanna date you but that's like not right of me to tell you that or expect you would even do that so I'm not. I don't know I feel like if I just left you alone it'd be better sometimes. Not trying to be dramatic but yeah I feel like I just take the easier route naturally which sucks""


So I say:


""Well okay there it is. I dont respect making such a decision based on time when you've had to go through what you have but I guess it's just you're ""easier route nature"". It just seems like you know you want me but won't let yourself do it and I don't get it. Part of me wishes I never met you because of this and how I've just been an outlet for you. I'll give you the summer and hopefully you'll follow your heart but until then I'd like to be left alone.""


She says:


""I completely understand. I'm sorry. Have a good summer""
So, 3 days go by and I'm in the whole ""icing her"" mentality as I do not plan on talking to her at all this summer, but last night she texts me this:


""Hi I promise I'll leave you alone like you said but i thought I'd just say before you go that I don't want you to forget about me because that's never what I meant. Anyways, good luck in New York I hope it's everything you're hoping for.""
I didn't reply but am just confused as to what she meant when she said: ""I don't want you to forget about me because that's never what I meant."" Like does she want me to still think of us together and that things will work/she likes me?


I will be very busy with an internship and job down in the city so I will be very distracted which is good BUT she has an internship at home but has none of her friends with her and has to commute almost 2 hours to see her boyfriend which she once said she's ""Not trying to drive 2 hours just to hangout with him."" We both are over thinkers and she tells me she thinks about me all day so I know I will be in her head. I do believe this time apart will be great as it will show her what she's missing in her current relationship but just need your advice!


Thanks a lot!!

I'm part of a group of interns who will be in Auckland for the duration of winter. We've been exploring the few days that we've been here so far, but I wanted some pointers!

Where are some ""hidden gems"" in Auckland? What weekend activities (besides travel; we will be making trips every other weekend) should we partake in? Any areas to avoid (bad restaurants, sketchy places, etc.)

We have people that like to party, and others who prefer calmer activities, so all suggestions are welcome!

6db42p,6,2017-05-25,Exercise in becoming minimalist,soldalicious,minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/6db42p/exercise_in_becoming_minimalist/,"I live in a small campus apartment at my college. I have an internship this summer and I've packed one carry-on backpack and one medium-ish checked suitcase (we weighed it and it's like 40 lbs). Everything else I owned at school I put into storage. The plan is to be happy living out of just these two bags, come back to school, and donate everything in storage.

There's a few issues with this though. I need to use my bed until the end of school (1-2 more years) to justify the cost. There's really poor storage in the school apartment, so I need to keep my dresser. My internship is in California, so all the clothes I brought are summery, but school is in New York so I'll need all my sweaters (all of which I did wear this past fall/winter, I already donated most clothes I don't actually wear), so I can't blindly get rid of warm clothes just because I didn't use them over the summer. Also I stored kitchen stuff and some other things you need when you live in an unfurnished apartment (at school) but don't need in a fully equipped apartment (at internship). 

I had a solid dose of self-loathing taking multiple trips to the storage unit, while my housemate only has a mattress and like 4 boxes. 

I know I won't be able to come back and toss everything, which means I'll probably end up tossing nothing, which annoys me to no end. 

I don't really know what question I'm asking here, but I really envy the minimalist lifestyle and would love to be able to reduce the number of trips to a storage unit necessary at the end of each academic year when they force us to move out. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to maximize the effectiveness of this summer's exercise in minimalism. 

Thanks for reading!"

I've been rejected from all the companies (12) I applied to for an internship, and want to cold call or email a company for a summer position. I've read about people successfully getting a position doing this, like one at a chemical plant.

My questions are:

* What kind of companies should I target with my stats? Local chemical plants?

* What words/phrases should I use to describe the position I want? What kind of a position am I likely to get with this approach? Should I talk about my interests or just ask for any position?

* Would I be able to ask for a living stipend (in which case I would expand my search to places farther than I could commute to)? Doubt it, but want to make sure.

I just started an internship and I'm a new guy to NetSuite here. Bare with me if I come off as a noob, but I need some advice.

So I currently have my DSO from taking:

{trandate} - {appliedtotransaction.trandate}

After this I pulled up the billing terms by going to Paid Transaction: Terms. Now here is where I am stuck.

I want to get the Average days delinquent (ADD) by taking the DSO and deducting the payment terms with the formula (numerical) below.

({trandate} - {appliedtotransaction.trandate}) - {paidtransaction.terms}

However, the payment terms read ""Net 45"" or ""Net 60"" with the Net in front of the numerical value screwing up my formula. The error message I get reads: ERROR: Invalid Expression

So my question is: **Is there a way to ignore or omit the ""Net"" text from my formula?**

I'm assuming this is due to the ""Net"" however if anything in my formula looks off let me know. Anyways thank you everybody! If I figure it out I'll let y'all know.

6dccw1,49,2017-05-25,[Spoilers] My Pitch For Season 4,TheMattInTheBox,FlashTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashTV/comments/6dccw1/spoilers_my_pitch_for_season_4/,"So to start off, I'm going to be breaking the season into 3 parts that all kinda connect, like what Agents of SHIELD did this season. 

**Season 4A: Run, Wally, Run**

We pick up 3 months after Barry has vanished in the Speedforce. Wally wears his own version of the Flash suit (like the Wally West I Rebirth suit), and has made himself the new Flash. 

The whole team is present, except Cisco. Cisco gone, and it's revealed that he's actually gone looking for Killer Frost, who is still at large. 

Everyone is still feeling Barry's absence, and even Julian seems to be taking it kinda hard, finding the crime lab to be very empty. In all, we're just setting up the fact that everyone is missing him.

STAR Labs has reopened as an actual RnD lab, with Tracy and Harry (using the face changer) leading it.

There is a break out at Iron Heights, and Wally manages to put some criminals back behind bars, but some of the ""special"" criminals managed to vanish without a trace. 

To mirror the very first episode of the series, in the season premiere, Wally has to face down Weather Wizard. Wally comes to STAR Labs looking for help, and Harry, Tracy and Julian (who is working part time with STAR Labs on metahuman research) are able to help him out, but Iris and Joe can't be there. Them being there would compromise Wally's identity. Wally also gets a job at STAR Labs as a mechanical engineer intern.

At the end of the second episode of the season, we see a flash of lightning, and a pair of hands picking up a newspaper. We pan up, and we see Barry's face. 

Cisco in the meantime, runs into Golden Glider. She takes him to Snart, who is miraculously alive., so Cisco can fix their weapons. Snart explains how he's alive (but I don't know how he is right now), and in exchange, they help him hunt down Killer Frost.

The next few episodes are Wally and team facing off against Top and Mirror Master, Trickster, and a few other rogues. They act just as foils for Wally, as he comes to terms with maybe he's not as good as Barry and he never will be. He keeps pushing himself, but his eagerness to prove himself keeps making him screw up.

In the episode before the crossover, Cisco returns with Killer Frost. She returns to STAR Labs, but is very unsure. Upon seeing all these new people and how different it is, she kinda freaks out, leaving Wally to catch her. She manages to freeze Wally, and escapes. Cisco rejoins STAR Labs after this, and him and Wally work closely together. They start working on a treadmill that they hope will let them access to the Speedforce to rescue Barry, but unfortunately, Wally can't seem to run fast enough to use it. 

During the annual crossover, Wally is still the Flash. The rest of the superheroes are hesitant to accept him, but they eventually do. 

During the midseason finale, Wally decides he needs to get help from a more experienced Flash. He calls up Jay Garrick, and Jay starts to train him, teaching him more about how to control himself. He's feeling more confident, but his training is cut short when the Rogues start wreaking havoc on the city. 

Wally and Jay team up to take on the Rogues, led by Mirror Master, but are having trouble dealing with all the villains around them. 

Wally manages to get the better of the Rogues and takes out Mirror Master. But before he can apprehend them all, Cisco calls him, telling him to return to STAR Labs now. 

The Rogues get away, and Wally and Jay return to STAR Labs to see Barry Allen standing in front of the glass case with his Flash suit in it. 

**Season 4B: The Return of Barry Allen**

The next set of episodes have Barry reuniting with everyone. Wally is ecstatic to have Barry back, but Iris and Harry remain skeptical. 

Iris and Harry start their own subplot where they investigate the return of Barry, and try to figure out if he's the real deal or not. This causes family drama, because Wally and Joe have no idea why Iris isn't thrilled to have Barry back with them.

Grodd returns, and ends up mind controlling everyone except Wally and Barry. Wally has to fend off Vibe and tries to keep everyone safe, as Barry speeds off to take on Grodd. 

Wally manages to catch up to Barry and stops him from killing Grodd, which he almost does. Wally starts to have second thoughts about this Barry being real, but at the same time, Iris starts to be more convinced. Not wanting to break her heart, Wally keeps his suspicions to himself.

The two Flashes try to take on an alien weapon trading ring, and when a criminal calls Wally Flash, Barry loses it, saying only *he* is The Flash. 

Thus begins Barry's descent into madness. He brutally assaults criminals, and taking action against minor lawbreakers, like jaywalkers. 

Wally tries to stop Barry, saying that he can't keep doing this, and Barry faces off against Wally, breaking both of his legs and throwing him in the pipeline, and threatens to vibrate his hand through his chest. Thankfully, Harry gets Wally out and Wally has figured out who Barry really is.

Wally speeds off, and comes face to face with Barry. He throws the Reverse-Flash costume at him, asking if it looked familiar. Barry's face starts to change, and we see the face of Eobard Thawne take it's place.

The next episode starts in a serene park, which is promptly annihilated. We then see Barry and Nora Allen speaking, and Barry is begging Nora (Speedforce) to let him go back. He says that if Thawne keeps accessing the Reverse-Speedforce, the Speedforce will cease to exist, thanks to the Reverse-Speedforce eating away at it. 

We go back to Wally and Eobard fighting, and Wally is holding his own, although Eobard continues to match his punches. Eobard plays dirty, having read up on the history of the Flashes, and goes to the West household to threaten Joe and Iris. 

Wally surrenders, saying that as long as Eobard doesn't hurt Joe, he'll stop fighting. Of course Eobard is about to thrust his hand threw Joe's body, there's a flash of lightning and Barry Allen (in a brand new Future Flash costume) blindsides Eobard. 

Together, Barry and Wally defeat Eobard, and bring him back to STAR Labs. Barry and Wally together use the treadmill (mentioned earlier) and use it to send Eobard home, counting on the Speedforce to wipe his memory (which it does).

Note: The Speedforce allows Barry to return home because the Reverse-Speedforce destroyed the Speedforce prison, so there's no more imbalance.

The stinger at the end of the episode is Captain Cold and Golden Glider enter the bar that the Rogues have been frequenting since the midseason finale, while laying low and Cold claims that he's their leader now.

**Season 4C: Rogue War**

Wally and Barry return as the Flashes, but the public is scared of Barry Allen Flash. This leads Barry into a conflict of whether he should stay the Flash or let Wally take over full time. Does Central City need two Flashes?

Barry returns to the crime lab, and returns to Iris. Everyone is one big happy family again. Iris and Barry try to replan their wedding, hoping to get married soon.

Killer Frost shows up at STAR Labs and informs the team that there are rumblings in the underworld about the Rogues planning a full takeover, and everyone is on alert. Killer Frost decides to stay around and help out for a bit. 

Within the ranks of the Rogues, there is a schism. Cold wants to go big and make the big score, while Mirror Master wants to lay low for a bit more and move cities. This causes a dispute, making the Rogues pick sides.

They start to fight, which spills out into the streets. Barry and Wally race into action, and try to contain the damage, but can't do too much. The episode ends with Snart and Golden Glider freezing/trapping the Flashes and Snart defeating Mirror Master, and taking control of the Rogues. 

The finale is Barry and Wally escaping their capture and desperately trying to stop Snart and his Rogues from wrecking the city, while the Rogues start a huge crime wave, robbing banks and stores, all that stuff. 

The season ends with Iris and Barry's wedding. Just before, Killer Frost goes to Julian and asks for the cure. Being part of the team and seeing Barry and Iris reuniting and stirred the Caitlin Snow part of her to a point where she wants to become Caitlin again. 

The newly cured Caitlin and everyone else attends a small service for Barry and Iris, and the moment the couple kiss, a small storm starts outside. 

We hear thunder, and see lightning and a young boy laying in an alley. His eyes pop open, and in another flash of lightning, he's gone.

6ddary,4,2017-05-25,Transition from Internships,chancemeb111,MuseumPros,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumPros/comments/6ddary/transition_from_internships/,"Hi, again, MuseumPros.

I got a paid position!  I'm really excited for the new experience.


My question/issue might sound a little trivial considering how lucky I was to even receive this position in the first place, but I'm having a hard time transitioning from interning to working at the same institution.  I feel like interning there was a pretty prestigious spot to have and I worked on many projects that were incredibly interesting and current.  My supervisor(s) were top administrators in the department, they had a curriculum and organized policies for the interns.  I always felt like I was working on something important.


Actually working there -- with the exception of a (rather distressing) paycheck -- kind of feels like a demotion.  I'm now working on projects that have been ongoing for years with no sign of completion in sight.  It's literally the most unimportant work in the whole building.  My supervisors are now individuals who have a negative reputation among other staff and are not excited to see new people there.  I no longer have a desk or an organized spot to keep my things.  


I definitely don't want this to sound like I'm complaining in any way because I couldn't be more grateful for a paid position, but it's frustrating and difficult to deal with.  The constant advice that I heard in graduate school was ""intern because then you'll know if this is really the right setting for you.""  Well, everything about interning was amazing.  The actual job doesn't quite compare to interning.  Has anyone else had similar experiences?"

Shes incredibly energetic and I saw a confident person thats going to have a great career and be a great life partner. 

However, in the last few months I have been very distant about our relationship because I don't think our 3-5 year plans match up and its causing me to act differently around her. I just graduated and will be starting a job this month. She is taking an extra semester and will be graduating in December. After that, she wants to take up an internship with her national sorority for a year where she will be traveling the whole year, helping chapters with sisterhood nation wide. This is totally separate from her major and what she intends do to for her career (public relations).

Essentially, she wont be starting her career for another 2.5 years and this is what is causing me trouble. This, as well as other things as her not ever wanting to move out of the state, make me think that were going on two different paths.

I brought this up to her this week after she confronted me about acting distant. Her response was that she thinks its selfish of me to make her choose between her passion and me. She absolutely has a point, but it still seems like our values and paths for ourselves for the years to come don't match up. Deep down there is a part of me that thinks that I would be limiting myself by being with someone who isnt committed to having a successful career, and I know this could be selfish. I still love her and wish it could be different. 

Has anyone else been in a situation like this before? Am I being stupid or selfish, and taking a happy relationship for granted?

tl;dr: Girlfriend and I happy and in love, but plans for the future don't seem to line up due to her prolonging starting her career. It seems to be a bigger deal to me than it is for her. Am I being stupid?"

Dong-salget bliver herinde omtalt som om det var en af de største skandaler i moderne dansk politisk historie. Det til trods for at ingen konkrete beviser peger i retning af at det her var noget som helst andet end det finansministeriet hele tiden har påstået: Nemlig at Dong blev solgt til bedste bud. Efter at Rigsrevisionen nu har udtrykt [kritik over manglende dokumentation](https://www.information.dk/indland/2017/05/rigsrevisionen-kritiserer-salget-dong) i sagen, så hopper man direkte til den konklusion at Finansministeriet bevidst har forsøgte at skjule noget fordækt, til trods for at revisionen i det store hele bekræfter finansministeriet og Corydons version af historien, og at dokumentationshullerne på ingen måde er store nok til at retfærdiggøre nogen form for konspirationsteori.

### R/Denmark i selvsving

Lad mig give nogle eksempler på hysteriet:

I [nyheden](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/6ac91a/nu_har_goldman_sachs_tjent_64_mia_p%C3%A5_dongaktier/) omkring at Goldman Sachs havde tjent 6,4 mia på Dong-salget for ca. to uger siden var den suverænt højest rated kommentar følgende:

&gt; Corydon burde ærligt talt en tur forbi en guillotine. Dette er selvfølgelig ikke en opfordring til vold, back off PET.

Ikke en opfordring til vold. Men dog en ret tydelig indikation af at OP mener at Corydon har begået noget groft kriminelt.

Næsthøjeste kommentar i samme nyhed:

&gt; Jeg synes det er totalt latterligt at kritisere Goldman Sachs som ""banditter i habitter"". Det er ikke tilfældet. Det er Folketinget generelt, og Finansministeriet samt daværende regering i særdeleshed, der er ""banditter"".

Igen, implikationen er at der blev begået noget groft kriminelt i forbindelse med Dong-salget.

Hvad med nyheden fra Foljeton.dk om at Finansministeriet havde [planlagt mørklægning af Dong dokumentationen på forhånd?](https://foljeton.dk/38971/planlagt-paa-forhaand) En sag der i øvrigt viste sig efterfølgende ikke at have noget hold i [virkeligheden](https://www.fm.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser/2017/05/misforstaaelse-om-finansministeriets-korrespondance-om-dong-energy). Her er [højest rangerede kommentar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/6c9rl9/afsl%C3%B8ring_m%C3%B8rkl%C3%A6gning_var_planlagt_p%C3%A5_forh%C3%A5nd/):

&gt; Haha, gud hvor er det voldsomt. - Det er helt oppe i vores ansigt nu, hvad alle frygtede og nok også godt vidste, er nu bekræftet. Vi bliver snydt. Vi bliver bedraget. Politikerne VI betaler for at arbejde på at bedre vores samfund, sælger deres stemme og indflydelse til højestbydende filantrop. - Dong-salget var svindel og humbug, alle ved det. Ingen gør noget ved det. Det er jo for sent, ikke?

Hvad der ligeledes er rystende er en kommentar fra u/ChinggisKhagan hvor han siger at *""en masse mennesker der desperat ønsker at tro de er blevet snydt griber ud efter hver sætning der bare give et lille hint i den retning. men der er stadig intet der tyder på det.""* fik hele 39 downvotes — til trods for at manden har fuldkommen ret. Øvrige kommentarer i nyheden, der pointerede hvor absurd den var, kunne knap nok komme op på et to-cifret antal upvotes.

Højest rated kommentar i [nyheden omkring Rigsrevisionens kritik af Finansministeriet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/6bp1i7/dongsalg_f%C3%A5r_h%C3%A5rd_kritik_af_rigsrevisionen/) insinuerer igen at det der foregik i Dong-salget var kriminelt:

&gt; Statsrevisor sprog for ""I har fucket det totalt op, og i skal være glade for jeres parlamentariske immunitet""

Disse er blot udvalgte eksempler inden for de sidste par uger. Men alle tråde er gennemsyret af kommentarer fra folk der direkte mener at de ansvarlige bag Dong-salget har begået noget kriminelt.

***Virkeligheden er derimod at der er absolut intet i Rigsrevisionens rapport der indikerer at der skulle være foregået noget som helst kriminelt i forbindelse med salget af Dong. Intet!*** 

Revisionen kritiserer Finansministeriet for at manglende dokumentation i forbindelse med visse aspekter i salget. Bevares. Men disse mangler er hverken kriminelle, efterlader plads til konspirationsteorierne, eller vurderes til at have [""haft betydning for resultatet af processen""](https://www.fm.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser/2017/05/finansministeriet-tager-rigsrevisionens-beretning-om-salget-af-ejerandele-i-dong-energy-til-efterretning). 

Nu har jeg selv fået læst Rigsrevisionens [rapport](http://www.ft.dk/Statsrevisorerne/Nyheder/2017/05/~/media/Statsrevisorerne/2016/SR1616.pdf.ashx), så lad mig gennemgå hvorfor den definitivt udelukker at der skulle være foregået noget som helst kriminelt i forbindelse med Dong-salget.

### Dong havde brug for en kapitaludvidelse (kapitel 2 i rapporten)

Revisionen dokumenterer entydigt at Dong havde behov for kapitaludvidelse for undgå en nedgradering i selskabets kreditvurdering. Finansministeriet vurderede at en nedgradering kunne få store konsekvenser for Dong, da et stort antal investeringer måtte opgives. Rapporten dokumenterer (kapitel 2.2) hvordan Dong overvejede alternative muligheder til kapitaludvidelsen, såsom at optage nye lån eller lave et kapitalindskud i et datterselskab. Ingen af disse muligheder blev vurderet til at kunne rette op på kapitalstrukturnøgletallet, og på baggrund af rådgivning fra Danske Bank vurderede Finansministeriet derfor at det var nødvendigt med en kapitaludvidelse i Dong.

På grund af Finansministeriets bekymringer (2.3) omkring hvorvidt et statsligt kapitalindskud ville bryde Europa-Kommissionens retningslinjer for statsstøtte, valgte ministeriet at indstille til forligskredsen — et bredt politisk flertal bag aftalen om den fremtidige børsnotering af Dong — at Dong fik et privat kapitalindskud på 6-8 mia.

Rigsrevisionen har ikke noget at udsætte på denne del af forløbet. De skriver at:

&gt; Finansministeriets overvejelser om behovet for kapital er dokumenteret og begrundet, herunder med dokumentation for analyser, beregninger og rådgivning fra Danske Bank.


### Værdiansættelsen af Dong og indledende bud (kapitel 3.2)

Finansministeriet fik Danske Bank til at lave en værdiansættelse af Dong, hvor de kom frem til et interval for værdien af selskabet. Finansministeriet vurderede efterfølgende at dette interval burde indsnævres yderligere, og det var dette interval der blev anvendt i processen for kapitaludvidelsen.

Det bringer os det første store kritikpunkt, som Rigsrevisionen har af forløbet.

&gt; at det ikke er veldokumenteret, hvordan Finansministeriet, baseret på materiale fra Danske Bank, kom frem til det værdiinterval

Men hvilke implikationer kan vi drage af denne manglende dokumentation? Vi ved at finansministeriets ændrede interval faldt inden for det interval Danske Bank selv havde sat, og vi ved at Danske Bank i sidste ende var enig i Finansministeriets endelige interval.

Hvis der har været en konspiration fra Finansministeriets side af, om at vurdere Dong til en lavere pris end man reelt kunne retfærdiggøre, så må man nødvendigvis konkludere at Danske Bank har været involveret i konspirationen. Og lad os i øvrigt ikke glemme at Finansministeriets værdiansættelse blot havde betydning for hvilke bud staten selv ville være villige til at acceptere — ikke hvad de potentielle investorer vurderede virksomheden til.

Hvad angår de indledende bud, så fremgår det af rapporten at man i forbindelse med udbuddet kontaktede en bred skare af potentielle investorer i samarbejde med Morgan Stanley, Nordea og Danske Bank, hvoraf en række af disse valgte at gå videre og give indikative bud. 

Hvis investeringer i Dong på dette tidspunkt var en så åbenlys god forretning, som kritikerne antyder, så er det påfaldende at ***""ingen af de indikative bud var acceptable for staten,*** *men dog attraktive nok til at gå videre med processen""*. Hvoraf man må konkludere at disse investorer åbenbart vurderede Dong endnu ringere end Finansministeriets tilsyneladende ""korrupte"" bud.

### De endelige bud (kapitel 3.2 og 3.3)

Det fremgår her klart og tydeligt at Goldman Sachs' bud var det bedste. Revisionen skriver at ***""der ikke var andre investorer, som ønskede at gå ind med en tilstrækkelig stor investering til, at kapitalbehovet kunne dækkes""***. 

Revisionens store kritik af denne del af forløbet går på at Goldman Sachs' bud for værdiansættelse af Dong blev givet mundtligt og at der ikke er referat fra dette møde. Men dette ændrer ikke ved at Goldman Sachs' bud i sidste ende var det bedste. Det er blot en kritik af Finansministeriets egen dokumentation. Selve buddet fremgår stadig af beregningerne fra Danske Bank, og det endelige køb er naturligvis dokumenteret skriftligt.

Derudover så eksisterede der i forbindelse med udbuddet ikke et ufravigeligt krav om skriftlighed:

&gt; Kammeradvokaten vurderer samlet set, at det var i overensstemmelse med de EU-retlige krav om ligebehandling og gennemsigtighed, at Finansministeriet gik videre med tilbuddet fra Goldman Sachs inden for rammerne af den strukturerede budproces, uanset at dele af buddet kun var afgivet mundtligt inden for fristen.

Det var sløset af Finansministeriet at de ikke dokumenterede denne del af forløbet, men det er hverken kriminelt eller har haft nogen som helst indflydelse på udfaldet af udbuddet.

Derudover så lavede Danske Bank en fairness opinion af buddet, hvor en intern komité — uafhængig af bankens rådgivning vedrørende kapitaludvidelsen — vurderede transaktionen fair ud fra et finansielt synspunkt. Igen, Danske Bank er in deep i enhver form for potentiel konspiration omkring det her salg.

### Efterlader alt dette plads til konspirationsteorier?

Jeg skal ikke lægge skjul på at jeg mener det er hamrende usandsynligt at der er foregået noget som helst fordækt i forbindelse med salget. Og det at Dongs værdi er steget betydeligt siden da er ikke evidens for en konspiration. Der er intet usædvanligt i at selv store virksomheders værdi kan [variere betydeligt](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-biggest-gains-111820149.html) inden for meget kort tid. Og der er intet i processen omkring udbuddet der peger i retning af hverken en konspiration om at sælge Dong billigt eller at Finansministeriet skulle have været exceptionelt inkompetente i forbindelse med salget.

Derudover kan jeg ikke engang tænke mig til en konspiration der overhovedet vil være plausibel. Hvem er det egentlig I tror står bag denne konspiration og til hvilket formål?

Jeg løber tør for tegn nu, men jeg tror min grundlæggende pointer står rimelig klart. Hvis nogen mener at de har et centralt punkt omkring salget, som de mener jeg har ignoreret, så uddyber jeg gerne i kommentarerne.

Min hovedpointe er at Rigsrevisionen har punkteret alle konspirationer omkring salget, og at det derfor er på høje tid at r/denmark pakker sølvpapirshatten væk.

Jeg mener at den primære selvransagelse i forbindelse med Dong-salget må være hvor rystende let det er at piske en storm op i et glas vand. Uanset at Corydon og co. objektivt set intet gjorde forkert, så vil denne sag går over i historien som en af de større skandaler i vores moderne historie *alene på baggrund af den hysteriske reaktion som opstod i befolkningen*. Det var en sag der endte med at splitte den tidligere regering og det til trods for at al fakta peger på at der ikke blev gjort noget substantielt forkert.

Formanden for statsrevisorerne sagde [ligeud](http://www.altinget.dk/energi/artikel/statsrevisor-formand-forventer-intet-af-dong-undersoegelse) inden undersøgelsen:

&gt; Det er i højere grad ideologi og ”kalkunjagt” end saglige argumenter, der er årsag til, at Rigsrevisionen skal se nærmere på Dong-salget. Jeg tror ikke, der er noget at komme efter.

Det er sgu ikke så underligt at der er så meget politikerlede, når folk helt selv vælger at opfinde korruptionsskandaler ud af det rene ingenting..."

| B | Sub 6:00 Pace (18:36) | *?* |



### Training
After a pretty good fall cycle following my [rough marathon debut](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/57ylb6/kansas_city_marathon_debut/), I ran a [37:05 10k in October](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/5cx6l5/billy_mills_10k/), and hit my highest milege ever: 70 during super week. Unfortunately, I graduated with a degree in accounting in December and worked a ""busy season"" internship from January - April 15th. This meant waking up at 5:40 AM, getting ready and off to work, and not getting home till 8:30ish or later on most nights. My training suffered dramatically as I used my precious free time mostly to spend with my fiance, helping plan our wedding in August!!

I got back on the horse in April, after averaging maybe 10-15 mpw during my internship, and have begun my slow base build targeting the Heart of America Marathon on Labor Day as my key race this fall. The last several weeks have averaged 35-40 miles and included lots of easy runs with a tempo and long run each week, hardly any speed aside from strides and a [tough session that I thought might sharpen me for tomorrow's shenanigans](https://www.strava.com/activities/980236206). Other than that, I wanted to use this race as a fitness test to see where I am at off of ""marathon training."" I set a tentative goal of 18:36 (ie 6:00 miles) and thought I might be able to push 18 with some luck.

### Pre-race
The race was scheduled to start at 6:15 PM and was about 2 miles from my house, so I [jogged over as a warmup](https://www.strava.com/activities/1006402866). Since the race was free, it was pretty low key and our bibs were hand written numbers performed manually by some volunteers. A lot of people began showing up around 6:10, and the line to get bibs was slow, so it was nearly 6:30 before the actually race began. I did 2 strides while people were busy getting bibs. Then we lined up and were ready to go.

### Race
I took off with the leader, pink shorts, and after about 200m realized it would be a bad idea to stick with him, since he was running what felt like 5:30 pace and I was pretty sure I couldn't handle it. So, I settled in behind him and let him slowly pull away from me, reminding myself that I was running for time. I could hear breathing behind me so I knew I didn't have a lot of space. Two guys caught up to me right around mile 1, which we went through in 5:41. I didn't look at my watch, but I could tell the pace was quick and I could already feel the lactic acid beginning to flow through my veins. I decided to try to stick with the two guys, but one of them, long hair, began to ramp up the pace (more likely, I was slowing a bit). The other guy, Red socks, didn't go with him, so I settled in about 10m behind him. We hit mile 2 in 6:05 coming back towards the starting line, and I knew now was the time to see what I was made of. I was hurting quite a bit, but I was pretty sure I could hold pace and started to push my body harder and harder. I began to close on red socks and passed him around the 2.25 mile mark. The last part of the race weaves through North Lawrence in an area I wasn't familiar with, so I didn't know how far I was from the finish line. There were two really long stretches that felt like forever, each followed by a right turn and then a quick left turn to hug the Kansas river as closely as possible. I didn't know that finish line would be right past the end of the second long stretch, or I probably would have closed harder. I hit mile 3 in 5:58 and closed the last .1 in 32 seconds (Strava says 5:11 pace). 

18:17

### Post-race
Crossed the line completely gassed and shook hands with 1 and 2. I think they finished around 17:25 and 17:35. Red socks came in around 10 seconds after me and a couple minutes later I could hear him talking to a friend about how he wasn't really running to race (classic move by someone who got beat: honestly I don't think anyone was running this as a goal race, but some people just can't handle defeat!) My fiance met me at the finish line and we walked a bit to cool down, then I [jogged home afterward](https://www.strava.com/activities/1006403100).

Overall I feel good with where my fitness is thus far, and there will be a free 5k on the final Thursday of every month through September, so it will be fun to see how my time progresses, even with the non-specific training.

Thanks for reading and get ready for a whooping in the 800 tomorrow! :p

6di523,1,2017-05-26,I'm 20M and it looks like I'm going to lose my 20F girlfriend. I'm not sure if I should fight for it or give up.,beelalol,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6di523/im_20m_and_it_looks_like_im_going_to_lose_my_20f/,"tl;dr I'm having trouble with my girlfriend, I belive it stems from the fact it's been tough to see each other because of exams and upcoming internships. As a result her walls are going up and she's stopped texting and wanting to communicate. I'm a bit hurt that she's not really trying to make things work by meeting up or texting back and she's not happy at the moment and potentially wants to take a break, or break up. I'm not sure what to do at this point.
Also apologies for wording and grammar, wrote this all on my phone. 


I (20M) have been seeing my girlfriend  (20F) properly since January. Before that we met around May last year and really clicked straight away and spent all of summer together. But around October she broke things of- due to a mixture of problems like her not being able to balance time with making new friends at uni and seeing me as well as the stress that comes with university. Being in love with her I found it very difficult to let her go, and after three months of trying to get back together with her, we got back together in December. She told me the reason she broke up with me was because at the time she had no indication that I loved her and because she had also fallen in love, but didn't want to get hurt as a result of a lack of reciprocity in feelings. I like to think I am now better at dealing with and communicating my feelings.

Anyway, I ended up asking her out properly in January, and things have been going very well. I am there for her whenever she has any problems with friends, or job applications, or essays she writes for university,  and her exam prep ( I did some of the modules she is sitting this year, in my first year of university).

Recently however, there have been some issues cropping up, we both have had widely different exam schedules, she finished about three or four  weeks ago and I still have another week before I finish my exams. During her own exams we wouldn't text or see each other as much- understandably because of the importance of them. But since my exams stretch on for longer than hers, she has felt neglected and doesn't seem to have fully understood that although I love her I need to be working in the library pretty consistently in order to ensure I do well.

A week ago, this came to head when she told me that she felt the relationship was more bad than good because I wasn't seeing her as much. She was also worried about the fact we wouldn't be able to see each other much over summer as she was doing an internship in the UK while I would be going abroad  for two months for an internship. We spoke in person and I asked if she wanted to end things, she said no but that it was going to be very tough for her to adjust,  as she had never been in a relationship where a significant amount of time would elapse before seeing the other person. I told her I would do everything I could to make the time apart feel less unbearable and we agreed to do our best to see each other as much as possible from now till I leave the country. 

She then went on a five day trip to Amsterdam with a friend, I had no issue with this as although I had previously told her it is somewhere I wanted to go with her, potentially to celebrate her birthday, I understood that she was very bored and didn't have a lot of other options regarding what she could do until the rest of her friends, and I, finished our exams.

But during her trip to Amsterdam the rate at which she would text me back significantly declined,  of course this is to be expected because she is with her friend and is having fun, and is in another country. But it got to the point in the last two days where she hadn't messaged me in around 36 hours, she only messaged me to tell me that she was back home from her trip. This combined with the fact that she wouldn't say I love you back throughout her trip meant I was feeling pretty depressed about the whole situation. I called her and explained how I felt that she had been blanking my messages for the last 36 hours. She raised a lot of issues such as the fact we had different schedules, were different people, and also that she felt guilty having fun. I tried to cut through to the core of each issue but she could never seem to give an explanation. This led me to believe that actually the reasons were all because of the difficulties of being apart now as I revise and also when I'm abroad. I have never made her feel guilty for doing anything without me so it feels like it's all an excuse because she doesn't want to deal with the pain of being apart. She even stated that she didn't want to deal with the pain because it would be hard and for her, she wanted to the relationship to be easy. I tried to explain this is just unreasonable, and that I wanted her to support and accept that I needed to study and do my internship abroad, just like I supported her through the tough times she's had this year. It hurt a bit to hear that she wsnt willing ti support me the same way I support her. I asked her if she would be willing to to try and make this work but she said that we had already tried everything, I explained this wasn't true as since our last proper conversation she had just gone to Amsterdam and we had no chance to try anything or see each other more. She had said she wanted a break when talking on the phone, and asked me why I was pursuing this relationship. I told her it was obvious, it was because I loved her, I then asked her if she loved me, I said it should be a simple yes or no answer, but she just said that she didn't know. I asked her when I would next be able to see her and she said she didn't know, I asked if we could see each other the next day (today) but again she said she didn't know. And that's pretty much how the conversation ended. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, on the one hand I love her very much and we do have a lot in common when we're together we are always very happy and we have previously travelled to different countries and been very happy in each others company. But on the other hand if she really isn't happy, then that's not what she deserves and im also unsure if it's right for me, especially if she can't manage to prioritise me over herself in some aspects, by supporting me. At the moment I have resolved to let her take the initiative and decide what we should do: take a break till after summer, keep  trying, or break up. So I've not texted her back, but if I'm honest, I'm not sure that she will text me first at all. So really I'm not sure what's best for me and what is likely to happen. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

She was cold, pretty heartless, but this week something has made her feel so much more warm and welcoming to her employees. She's had lunch with interns, and instead of them coming out with puffy eyes, they are smiling and thanking her for such an amazing time together! 

Something did change, and it's not what you think. At her house, an alien symbiote slithered into her bed and fucked her brains out, filling her pussy and ass with it's silver juices, infecting her and making her into the host of it's corruption. She tried to fight it, but the pleasure the silver brings simply overwhelms anyone it takes hold of, making them need to spread it to loved ones, no matter the age or the sex. 

The CEO has invited a mother and lovely son to the company the day before to help give a nice little test run of all the fun ""activities"" the kids will do. The mother has no idea her boss is about to turn her little boy into a slut, begging for silver cum and juices, but the mother will find out soon enough...

Activities include

Transformation, non-con, corruption, sounding, waterworks, squrting, lactating, futa, anal, pegging, bi play, pegging

No age limits, this is only the start of the story, there will be so much more to do once the trial is over and everyone brings in their lovely children to unknowingly taste the silver love! 

Send me a PM with one way you think the boy should be tested :)"

6djmye,26,2017-05-26,For all Minnesota Boaters!,my_wakawaka,minnesota,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/6djmye/for_all_minnesota_boaters/,"Hey all!

I'm an Aquatic Invasive Species intern with the DNR (the people at boat launches looking over your boat for plants), and have a couple reminders for boaters on this busy weekend! 

1- Most people remember this one, but keep your drain plug out until you're at the launch please.  There will be COs out and about this weekend looking to ticket this, big education push for that this weekend.  

2- FISHERMEN: If you bring minnows, leeches or any other bait that needs water out on the lake, when you're exiting the lake you will need to dump that water out.  Even if it's from the bait shop, gas station, kitchen, I don't care.  The water in that container is considered from the lake. That law has been in effect now for a couple years and is still one most people don't know about.  I recommend stopping at a gas station and getting one of those gallon jugs, and just keeping it in your car while you fish.  Or you can drain the bait water into an empty container before you launch, get lake water for your bait, and then just use the original water when you exit.  

Why are these laws there?
Because zebra mussels can't be seen with the human eye for the first part of their life and are free floating in water.  So you clean your hand off in the lake, then grab a minnow from you bucket while your hand is still wet. If there was baby mussels on your wet hand, they're now in your bucket.  You go to a different lake, are done fishing and drain your minnow bucket, well now zebra mussels babies are in that water.  

So I know alot of people don't enjoy the extra time it takes, but please be nice to us this weekend.  We don't make the laws, we're out to educate and help make your boat in compliance.  

I would love to take any questions​ if people have any, if not, enjoy this beautiful weekend fellow Minnes ❤️"

So, I'm currently a grad student. I live off of student loans. However, this summer, I'm taking a paid internship in the state of California (I'm a Virginia resident). I was just sent some of the HR paperwork and want to ensure it's filled out correctly. I'm single with no dependents. Per the w-4 form, 1 (for yourself) + 1 (for single with only one job) = 2 exemptions. Is this correct? I've heard of people claiming less for other reasons. 

Just an FYI, the total gross salary I will receive for this internship will be $7,520.

When I plugged this info into the IRS' withholding calculator, it's telling me my anticipated income tax is $0. Is this true? Does this mean I...won't be taxed on my income?

Here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about: http://imgur.com/a/15Tgr

    &gt;I loved Elon so much, I had all the SpaceX hoodies and mission patches.
    &gt;I pray to Elon every night before bed, thanking him for the life I’ve been given.

    &gt;""Elon is love"" I say; “Elon is life”.

    &gt;My dad hears me and calls me a space bro.
    &gt;I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Elon.
    &gt;I called him a shill for the oil industry.
    &gt;He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.
    &gt;I’m crying now, and my face hurts.
    &gt;I begin writing to ease the pain.

    &gt;”Dear Elon…
    &gt;From the moment I met you, all those years ago at Code Conference, not a day has gone by when I haven't
    thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it 
    gets. The thought of not being with you- I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the Model 3 blueprints that you
    should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that will not become a scar. You are in my very
    soul, tormenting me...what can I do?- I will do anything you ask.”

    &gt;I go back to return to sleep, dreaming of a day when I will be taken away into another world.
    &gt;I lay in bed and it’s really cold.
    &gt;Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me.
    &gt;It’s Elon.
    &gt;I am so happy.
    &gt;He grabs me with his powerful engineer hands and whispers into my ear. His voice is warm and husly like 
    dark melted chocolate fudge caramel… or something.

    &gt;“My desires are … unconventional.”
    &gt;“So show me.”
    &gt;He drives his Boring Company deep into the underground.
    &gt;He launches his rocket up into the Hyperloop.
    &gt;He lets his advanced AI link with my neural systems.
    &gt;My very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba. I flush at the waywardness of my
    subconscious - she's doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.
    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

    &gt;He flies me away to his secret rocket facility.
    &gt;”Aren’t you hungry”, he asks.
    &gt;”No.” I didn’t feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full - of butterflies.
    &gt;”I would let you drive this Falcon 9 V1.2 Block IV Fullerer Thrust but friends don’t let friends drive 
    drunk.”
    &gt;”Drunk?”
    &gt;”You’re intoxicated by my very presence.”
    &gt;We arrive at SpaceX.
    &gt;We touch goodbye. His fingers were ice-cold, like he’d been holding them in a snowdrift before the 
    flight. But that wasn’t why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an 
    electric current had passed through us.
    &gt;He bids me goodbye and says we will meet again...when I am ready.

    &gt;Fast forward, the year is 2194.
    &gt;The smoldering remains of planet Earth are being ruled by Chancellor Trump XXVIII, victor of the Great
    Resource Wars. Meanwhile I am stationed on the Dagobah System, hunting down any criminals that exploit the
    environment and harvest its fossil fuels. After years of peace and prosperity, it has been rumored that a
    dark presence has re-appeared.
    &gt;I wake up in my cryo-chamber. As I slip into my SpaceX hoodie, I glance towards my robot companion. I load
    my REI credits into the 370N-XFEM-4000 and a frozen yogurt portion pops out.
    &gt;I give her a kiss good-bye.
    &gt;I put my Ray Bans on and head off to work. Outside the door, I pass a group of interns has returned 
    from their weekly trip to Space-Aspen. A tear rolls down my cheek as I fondly remember the Days of
    Learning. Away in the distance, I spot a group of liberal arts majors being led away. 
    &gt;Their fates lie in the sarlacc pits now.
    &gt;The central bell chimes. Everyone stops in their tracks and recites the morning pledge.
    &gt;”I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE,” we all chant in unison.

    &gt;I’m on my way to see the All Knowing One. He wants to speak with me privately. 
    &gt;I traverse the hill and arrive at the castle at the top.
    &gt;At the end of the Great Hall, the head of Jeff Bezos lies on a solitary pike. Below it, the God-Emperor 
    sits on his throne, made out of the un-reusable boosters of his vanquished enemies.
    &gt;Elon: “I have been watching your career with great interest, Michael.”
    &gt;He gets off his throne and pulls a curtain, showing an artifact behind him. I recognized it as one of the
    forbidden fossil fuel objects – a preserved Dodge Neon.
    &gt;A sense of shock envelops me. How could he be seen with this abomination? How could he go against the
    teachings?
    &gt;E: “I sense great fear in you. Do not be afraid of the Dark Side. It is a pathway to many abilities 
    some consider to be…unnatural.”
    &gt;Me: “You’re the oil sheikh we’ve been looking for! I have to inform the council at once.”
    &gt;E: “I do not fear the fossil fuels as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to 
    my new empire.”
    &gt;M: “YOUR new empire? My allegiance is to affordable electric vehicles. To developing a cost-effective 
    method of space exploration.”
    &gt;E: If you’re not with me, then you’re my enemy.”
    &gt;M: “You were the chosen one. It was said that you would destroy the oil companies, not join them!”
    &gt;At that point, I felt as though my limbs had been hacked away. My entire body and soul felt charred. How
    could this be? He had made affordable electric vehicles for the common consumer and a cost-effective energy
    solution that would solve all our problems and bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Was it all a ruse 
    to gain power and fame for himself?
    &gt;E: “Look into your heart, you know this to be true. Join me and we will rule together.”
    &gt;I knew. 

    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

6djvi5,1,2017-05-26,"Please advise, College student in debt predicament (Finances, Matriculation, What I am doing, Game plan option A or B)",TYLER_DURDEN_JIMMY,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6djvi5/please_advise_college_student_in_debt_predicament/,"Hello, thank you for your time for reading this, I just need advice on what to do. I have already posted this in r/advice, but want to get multiple perspectives on this situation.

Finances: 
First off, I am a college student with an interest in pediatric robotic surgery; however, I come from a family who has been unemployed for longer than 13 months now, and I am out of state and have no money to pay for school. I am already working 2 jobs, filled out FAFSA, and applied to a crap ton of scholarships.

Matriculation: 
I attend Virginia Tech as a Biochemistry (pre-med) major but since my family and I cannot afford the education (at this point I consider it an expensive brand which has the same experience as high school 2.0). I will have to pull out loans (which will add up to 100k). With my major, there is not that much flexibility I can do with Biochemistry. I took a career orientation class and an alumni came back to the school and said he was only making 35k after graduating. 

Overall, I do not like the school I am attending due to a number of factors: 1. Price 2. Education -This is a research school-Not bad, but it limits the teaching capability -You learn everything on your own -You don't form a new perspective from the curriculum set forth -It seems the administration is mostly concerned about adding infrastructure and a larger student population to increase revenue from tuition and fees -Financial Aid is terrible-especially if you are out of state/international (its expensive) -Un-diverse ethnically (at least the school is diverse politically) -Hard to make friends since the majority of the students are either in-state Virginia residencies/grew up in the metro-DC area I question my decision of matriculating here since I applied to 10 schools at once during high school and did well academically (finished with a 4.2 GPA, 4.6 GPA final semester by doing 34 college credit hours in one year of high school via dual enrollment) however, I was just pressed on time

What I am doing to help with the situation: 
I am optimizing my time at the university by doing undergraduate research where I am in line for a publication, as a first author contributing to the field of robotic surgery. I will be going to an academic conference this coming year to present my research and network with people whoa re also contributing to the field as well. I am also networking with faculty to see if I could get my masters through an accelerated program in either biomedical engineering or industrial systems engineering. I have already took graduate classes in biomedical engineering, and have already did a sales internship last year, and am thinking of doing sales for a few years to have a lucrative option to pay off the 100k in debt)

Game Plans:

Option A: -Be debt free from withdrawing from VT (but still keep the relationships with the faculty to be in line for publication (if possible)) -Move to an urban area in California or NYC -Re-take the SAT, and apply to other prestigious schools (I did really well GPA wise in high school -Become a freshmen at a much more prestigious school -Network with alumni/recruiters in either investment banking/consulting -Have a lucrative career in an urban area with a higher income

Option B: -Suck up the debt -Try to get the masters through the accelerated program -Work in pharmaceutical, medical device sales to stay relevant to my research/major, or a lucrative engineering field for a few years to save money for medical school -Take the MCAT -Apply to MD/PhD program (this program is debt free) (I will have industry experience and have masters anyway) 

Conclusion: Which option do you think might work best? I do want to stick with medicine since I did 517 volunteer hours in a hospital in three years during high school, and do not want to give up the committed time. However, I need a lucrative career to be out of the financial situation. 

Any advice? Thank you for your help and time.

6dk71g,1,2017-05-26,M4F - Sister moves in with me,Dirtymind5,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6dk71g/m4f_sister_moves_in_with_me/,"5 Months ago my “baby” sister moved in with me at my flat in the city. When I say baby I mean 20 year old, just for those that where thinking wow that’s just odd. I’m 25 and have been working out here for a good 18 months now, and have my own place. Our parents live about an hour and a half out, so when my sister wanted to get an internship she turned to me for a place to stay.

The agreement was I would not have to change how I went about life, and I wouldn’t get in the way of her doing her own thing. Before I go on, let me tell you a little about me. I’m Matt, I’m stand at 6’3, with broad well built shoulders. I have a pretty toned chest, as I go to the gym 3 times a week. Normally I can be found wearing jeans and a t-shirt. But when I do go out I will pull out the shirt. But back to how I look, my arms are of a decent size, with powerful looking thighs.

So after the first 2 months I noticed that my sister was starting to take more of an interest in the girls I would bring home on a Friday or Saturday night. At first It was little things, asking who she was, but then it progressed to how I met them etc. But more recently she has been asking for details like why I went for them, and what we got up too.

So I have to ask my self, why is she taking such a big interest in my sex life?

If you have any other ideas on this, then let me know."

I've been experimenting with the geo-targeting and trying to narrow down my audience but could use a bit of help. 

One problem I am having is that Facebook geo-targets based upon a radius from a single location. Hail doesn't fall that neatly though. I will have a hail map at my disposal but I'm struggling to find a way to only target the affected areas.

I'm currently attending my third year in University in order to receive a degree in Journalism with an emphasis on PR. 

The classes are great and the teacher are insightful and give the students great tips of on how to become great professionals. 

I do know that while a degree is great you can't learn everything in college and that degree does not guarantee you a job. It all depends on how marketable you are.

So that is my question: what other skills could I acquire that could make me more marketable once I receive my degree?

I am seeking answers past the typical responses: internships, portfolio work, etc. 

It doesn't mean that I don't think those are important, because they are, but perhaps other skills that once you're in the industry you could have wished you would have known like learning a programming language or knowing how to use an editing software. Those kind of skills.

6dmnza,1,2017-05-27,Me [24 M] with my BF [18M] in a half-year relationship may break down due to my moodiness,OminousWinds,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dmnza/me_24_m_with_my_bf_18m_in_a_halfyear_relationship/,"Well, first off, a short description of the situation. I, 24M bi, am currently living together with my 18M gay boyfriend who I met online last year and we have been in a relationship for half a year now. For both of us it is our first relationship. The reason why we moved together after such a short time is that his situation at home was insufferable and causing him a severe depression. Furthermore, since we lived about 400km away from each other, short visits were not an option. He had quite a severe depression at the time, took antidepressants and didn't even attend school. Currently I finished an internship at a company and have also been working an additional 1-2 jobs in order to support us, since he has no income on his own. He is staying at home, keeping the appartment clean. 

So after a first short visit he moved to my appartment. Initially everything went well, but things have been lately going downhill. A big issue is the way how I handle my emotions and he reacts to it. He is quite a quite and sensitive person, and when he is feeling that someone is angry, he gets somewhat frightened and kinda tries to get out of the way (I suspect that the cause is his stepfathers abusive behaviour). For example, when we are shopping for groceries while I am annoyed, he denies wanting things I know he wants, having me to forcibly convince him to buy in order for him having somehting to eat, which only adds up to my annoyance. Such phases also frequently leads to him feeling down for some time afterwards. And while he is a very sweet person, he is also in many aspects quite childish, messy and generally somewhat out of it. 

Meanwhile, I am prone to getting annoyed/angry and generally am emotionally quite unstable. Additionally, I am quite perfectionistic. This is especially true during spring where I suffer from seasonal depression. Paired with my jobs, lack of sleep and insomnia, I have further issues to handle my anger at him for different things. Being the one who had to completely financially support us these past months has put even more stress on me. This leads to us having trouble in the relationship to the point that we don't even know whether we want to continue it. I warned him beforehand of my temperamental personality, but he moved here nonetheless. 

However, we can't just break up at the moment. While he moved here with the plan of applying for government support and getting an appartment of his own, he did not follow through with it immediately, but only after nearly two months of him being uncertain whether he actually wants to follow through with it or not, even once moving back home only to return two weeks later. He finally did apply for the support two weeks ago, but this substantial delay from the plans we made and he promised he would stick to is still causing some lingering annoyance. Anyhow, if we break up now, he would have nowhere to go, but I wouldn't want to live together with my ex.


At first I was frequently unhappy with how many things went, but since I started to enforce my interests more, like imposing monthly budgets, and There are a lot of things that annoy me, like his unhealthy diet which consists mostly of chips, fries and nuggets, him generally being totally out of it, child-like behaviour or messiness. However, there are also aspects that I like about him, like his calm and relaxed aura. To be honest, I am not even sure what to do. I even have trouble describing the whoel situation. Some friends even recommended me to break up with him because it seems to them like I am forcing myself to be happy in a relationship in which I am not, and staying simply for the sake of being in one, selling my long-term happiness for some momentarily tenderness and affection. Our actual sexual life is also quite non-existent since he is all the time too stressed out from my outbursts of anger, which frustrates me further. And to be honest I sometimes think that this might be true. Since I don't have a lot of dating experience I don't even know what might be for the best, so I came here seeking for advice and input from you.
  
However, I don't know how my boyfriend sees it, this is just my point of view on the situation. He never initiates a discussion on this topic, and even then he speaks somewhat vaguely, so I am not that sure how he sees it. And I am often way too tired to having to initiate it like I have to do with nearly everything, since he is so passive. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Me boyfriend and I have trouble because he can't handle my anger outbursts which are mostly caused by stress, and we don't know how to continue. Breaking up is currently not an option since he has nowhere to go and I don't want to kick him up. What would you recommend?"
6dnfob,36,2017-05-27,My girlfriend (23F) of 4 years and I (27M) are in the last stages of a long distance relationship and everything is crumbling,LongDistance2017,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dnfob/my_girlfriend_23f_of_4_years_and_i_27m_are_in_the/,"Apologies for the long rambling post and any formatting  issues caused by being on mobile. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost four years, the last three of which have been long distance. The first year we were in the same city and life was good. At the end of the first year she decided to go to university in another city and we agreed to give long distance a try. I stayed in our original city to finish off my postgraduate degree. 

The first two years of long distance went well and we made a big effort to talk via Skype/WhatsApp everyday and visit each other 1-2 times a month. We supported each other through difficult times and any issues that we had, we were open about and talked through.

This last year however has been a nightmare. Both of us have had the most stressful year of our lives. On my end, I've dealt with my thesis, death in the family, sleeping on various sofas/floors , depression, new job, new (different) city, car, and flat. On her end, she's dealt with some pretty serious family drama, pressure from the university, internship applications, health/medication issues, friends, and exams.

We managed to navigate our way through most of this without too much issue until January of this year. Unfortunately since January, conversations have gotten shorter and less happy, visits have dropped to once every two months. Frustration with the distance has crept in and small petty issues are resurfacing and aren't getting resolved. Due to unavoidable commitments, neither of us have been free when the other was for months. 

It has been very tough but the end is(was?) in sight. Her exams finish soon and she's got a prestigious internship in my new city this summer and the plan was to visit for my birthday and live together for the duration of the internship before returning to university for her final year. She's been positive about it only being another two months until we get to see each other again whenever I've been feeling low. 

Yesterday I had a bad day at work made worse by something seemingly innocuous she posted on social media which stirred up an issue we both thought had been resolved. After calling to apologise to her for my overreaction, she admitted that she'd been feeling the strain of long distance for a while too.  She'd been dealing with the stress of exams, my moaning, and how the last two visits had felt different. She was worried that the next year of long distance would be like the last. 

She finished the phone call saying she wasn't happy right now and wanted a break. When I asked her how much time she needed and if we were still going to be exclusive on the break , she wouldn't say. I asked if she was still coming to visit for my birthday and she said probably not. 

I slept an hour last night, and I feel sick to my stomach. I don't know what to do or say. I said I'd give her some space and not speak for a week. 

It feels like we've had a dark time recently but we were about to reach the light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm scared that I'm going lose my closest friend, and that I might have already seen her for the last time without knowing it two months ago. 

Aside from keeping my word and giving her time and space, what can I do?

TL;DR four year relationship, three years long distance, incredibly stressful last six months might have killed it. What can I do?"

How are certificate programs viewed by data science professionals? Database and Data Analytics certificate of UCSC Extension at Silicon Valley seems like a good programme with good internship and employment opportunities for an international.

Also, are they a good step towards a masters or PhD degree? If the certificates are not worth doing, what else is there for an international recent-graduate looking to get into data science in the US? 

Any comment and recommendation is appreciated, thanks!"
6dnno0,3,2017-05-27,Meet Caff: He's your insane neighbourhood Victor Frankenstein.,SharksPwn,wormrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wormrp/comments/6dnno0/meet_caff_hes_your_insane_neighbourhood_victor/,"**Name/Alias:** Sebastion Hall, the husband of the late Lucille Hall. He doesn’t currently have a cape name yet, but people have noticed what he’s done. (I’ll leave his name up to the Mods/PRT, because he’s certainly not in the right mind to give himself a name. His friends, back when he remained in contact, called him Caff.

**Age:** He’s only thirty-two, but he seems far older, his skin pale from ages spent without sun, his limbs weak, and stress marring his face. Sebastion was born in 1985, on the twelfth of October, to Rory and Clare Hall.

**Physical appearance:** 

* **Height:** Sebastion stands at a fairly tall 6’2”, although you wouldn’t know it from looking at him, not any more. He tends to slouch, bending over, his real height hidden. He still seems fairly tall, just not the 6’2” from before.
* **Weight:** While Sebastion used to be of average weight, maybe even tilting the scales a little towards being muscular (though he was by no means covered in muscle), this isn’t true any longer. He’s underweight, with visible ribs and a flat stomach. He often refuses to eat, taking in the bare minimum to survive.
* **Eye/Hair Colour:** His hair is a dark black, patchy in places where he’s torn it out. It’s greasy, like it hasn’t been taken care of for a while, and messy. His eyes are a dark blue, sunken into his skull and surrounded by black pouches. He looks like he hasn’t slept in months. That isn’t true, of course. He just hasn’t slept for three days.
* **Physique:** Caff’s body is weal and abused. If his life had gone to plan, he’d be tall and confident, but as is, that’s not the case. He’s covered in little bruises and cut marks, and his hands have scars where scalpels and scissors slip and he’s cut himself. His spine is clearly visible through his back, and although he’d probably be a fairly attractive man in normal circumstances, right now he’s almost *hideous.*
* **Face:** His face is grim and tight, his skin clinging to the bones of his skull. He doesn’t appear healthy at all. He almost looks unfocused, like he can’t tell what’s going on right in front of him. If you’d look up close at his face (not that you’d want to), you’d find grime covers it, streaks of dirt everywhere.
* **Clothes:** Sebastion never changes out of his clothing, and in fact hasn’t done so for months. He wears a white coat over a plain black shirt, and blue jeans. These clothes are dirty and torn, with the jeans even having bloodstains atop them. It’s unclear if Caff cares- or even notices- the condition of his clothes. His coat is probably the worst off, as it’s covered in blood, dirt, caked mud, and general grime.

**Mentality:**

* **At rest:** While there’s no-one else around, Caff is unfocused, not thinking straight. He’s both sleep-deprived, starved and on *insane* amounts of caffeine. He’s overly paranoid, and any movement in the dark will be treated with suspicion, and provided there’s actually something there, *aggression.* If he’s left on his own for a while, and there’s no coffee around, odds are he’ll just kinda collapse. As noted above, Seb is *severely* sleep deprived, and his body is screaming at him to actually sleep for once. He’s pretty good at ignoring it, but only because he’s currently married to coffee. Without it? He’s a husk of a person.
* **Other people:** Sebastion is currently *not* in his right mind. He’s paranoid, having hallucinations, and will treat any and all newcomers with distrust. In his mind, everyone’s out to get him. Considering he’s killed three people, this may not be inaccurate. When they first meet, he’ll distrust and stay at a safe distance from anyone who may come up to him. After the second and third, he will have either gotten more distrustful- if they come off as ‘evil’ to him, he’ll likely freak out, trying to kill them. If they come off as nice and trustworthy, he’ll act rather indifferent.
* **Experiments:** Caff currently only has one product of his work. He has what he calls Lucille, but any reasonable and sane person comparing the two side-by-side could hardly tell they were once the same (more on that below.) He’s obsessed with Lucille, and even though she’s far stronger and tougher than he is, he’d prefer to go out into combat to save her. She’s the one who first drove him to murder, as her rotting body needed raw materials for him to supply.
* **Addictions:** Sebastion is addicted to caffeine. Not in the ‘addicted to heroin’ sense, as there’s no evidence (that I’ve found) that that can *happen*, but he can’t go a day without at least having some source of the stuff. This is not a new change- his nickname, ‘Caff’, came from the fact that when going through university, he’d drink as much as five cups of coffee a day to get the energy to study. But it’s recently kicked into overdrive, and his body is visibly suffering for it. His hands vibrate, he can’t stay still, though his movements are slow from the lack of energy. He’s constantly shivering, even if it’s an exceptionally warm night, and though he has no other addictions, the caffeine one is taking its toll.
* **Authority:** Caff, currently, is *insanely* terrified of any form of authority, and capes in particular. He fears that they’ll take Lucille away from him, and that they’ll kill her. He’s certainly distrustful of anyone who even *looks* like they might call the police, and if they start to do so they should probably get ready to protect themselves, because he will attack them. He’ll run from the Protectorate instead of trying to fight them, but he has no love for villains, either. He still sees himself as a good guy, despite the murders.
* **Special:** Caff has a special love for anyone who looks like Lucille did back when she was a proper, breathing person. While he won’t go as far as chaining them up in the basement, he will stalk them and eventually try and woo them. Given how Caff currently looks and acts, this does not work. It often times has the opposite effect. But he’ll obsess over them regardless. Given that “looks like Lucille” is any woman who has a flat chest, shoulder-length black hair and long legs, this is a broad range.

**Backstory:** 

* **Early life:** Born to a fairly upper-class family in Sydney, Australia, Sebastion grew up surrounded by books and information. With no real friends to speak of, being a lonely boy, Sebastion turned to reading, devouring the books quickly. Curiosity grew within him, and by the time he reached high school he was a straight-A student in all the academic parts of his grade (he remained at a C in P.E) By the time he graduated from high school, his social network was non-existent, but he was going to a good uni, and he was happy.
* **University:** University is where Sebastion *really* fit in. He became the dude to come to with any work problem, as he had a wide range of different sets of knowledge. He was top of his class, and his teacher was already calling him a prodigy. He made a fast group of friends, and met the woman who would become his wife. As his popularity and intellect grew, so did his ego, and when he graduated university with honours.
* **Career:** He spent a few years living in Australia, working at a top-class hospital. He and his girlfriend, Lillian, lived a life of luxury, and could want for nothing. It wasn’t four years after he graduated medical school (age 25) that he proposed to Lucille, and was ecstatic when she agreed to marry him. Another two years passed before they married, buying a small apartment in Sydney. He got a job offer not a year after that, a nice, cushy job as chief surgeon in an American town called Ashton. He moved there at thirty years of age, taking the position happily.
 He became quite popular at the hospital, being generally a cheerful and nice guy, full of life. He had a rather good success rate, and his home life was getting better all the time. He and Lucille were even discussing the idea of having a child, of bring another little life to live in their home. But, of course, this is Worm. And you’ve seen the personality/appearance above. And you know this is not to last.
* **Downfall:** It all started almost one year ago on the dot. He noticed his staff were acting strangely, being cagey around him. Like they were hiding a secret. After a little prying, one of the new interns broke the news- his wife had been in a car crash that morning. She’d survived, but she was *not* in the best shape. This almost broke him inside. But he was confident. He could fix her. She was in a coma, but that was no obstacle.
 What was an obstacle was the rare, freak chance. Blood transfusions were often safe. Often. But every once in a while, rarely, a blood transfusion can transfer HIV. And that was what tipped Lucille’s condition into the “very bad” zone. Her condition worsened, and the hospital couldn’t maintain the needed requirements to take care of her. So Sebastion took her into their home, having a basement built with all the required surgical equipment, where he could care for her personally, watching her waste away.
* **Descent into madness:** Despite his best efforts, Lucille’s situation was not going well. She was getting worse by the day, and her organs were starting to fail. It was one day, almost six months ago, that her heart stopped. And then, trigger. Sebastion tried to stay away as long as he could, but his desire for his wife to be healthy, to be happy, overcame him. He crept out of his house that night, finding a lone man, looking to be fairly drunk. He then clubbed him over the head, and dragged him back to the house. Since then, he’s been holed up in his house, hiding away from the world.

**Resources:** While Sebastion was once a rich man, he quit his job ages ago. He’s been surviving on as little money as he can since then, with the majority of his money going towards electricity. He has only $9500 left, and it’ll soon run out. Fortunately, he does own his house, so that can’t go away. He also has a state-of-the-art operating room, filled with what was state-of-the-art technology one year ago.

**Alignment:** He’s a villain for sure. He’s murdered before, and he’ll do it again. But he is somewhat sympathetic, as all villains. And most of his mindset/alignment comes from his addictions and lack of sleep. If he were properly awake, he’d be normal, if severely depressed from the loss of his wife.

**Equipment/Weaponry:** Sebastion is a skinny person, with no fighting skills to speak of. He doesn’t carry any weapons, but he does carry a scalpel.

**Specialisations:** He’s a great surgeon, which is only enhanced by his power. He can also make an awesome meal from relatively few ingredients.

**Power:** Sebastion is a bio-tinker. Specifically, he’s a bio-tinker that works on basically making Frankensteins, husks of dead flesh sewn together to make one horrifying beast. Fresh human parts give a max strength of the strongest man in the world, the weakest that of a little girl. i.e, what the cadaver had in life. With fresh animal parts from, say, an elephant, he could make something that could probably knock a large hole in a brick wall about .5 of a foot thick, or lift the back of a car off the ground. Unfortunately, he cannot keep this fresh, so they either need to be kept in cold areas or have some other, non-movement restricting way of preventing rot, otherwise they rot and are unusable after a while. There’s a few rules for these.

 * **RULE ONE:** Absolutely no cape powers can be transferred over after death. There's no way for powers to transfer over at all.
 * **RULE TWO:** On a related note, none of the monsters are intelligent. After death, the brain dies quickly. If Caff is not present at the scene and transplanting the brain for up to three minutes after death, then all brain function is lost. Powers are lost at the *exact* moment of death, not brain-death.
 * **RULE THREE:** Monsters rot. If a “Frankenstein” is kept out in the open (i.e not refrigerated or in a sterile environment) they tend to rot in no less than four days. Even in sterile environments, they do tend to rate after a few months, at most. Preserving chemicals mess with the delicate balance needed to keep this things moving, and if a hit tears off flesh that speeds the process. To fix the rotting issue, the doctor can transplant flesh, but this does require *living* flesh.
 * **RULE FOUR:** Animal parts *can* be transplanted, but it’s risky. Human bodies reject the foreign parts, and more often than not the whole systems breaks down in a matter of hours. If played right, however, this can be devastatingly effective. 
 * **RULE FIVE:** Caff can order these ‘flesh golems’ around, but they can only understand and obey simple orders. The fresher the brain, the more complex the order (to the level where the golems can use simple skills like martial arts, drawing, etc, but with worse hand-eye coordination), but it can’t be *too* fresh otherwise the personality and memories and everything of the person who owned that brain will be present.
 * **RULE SIX:** No, electricity does not make them stronger. It kills them.
 * **RULE SEVEN:** Mass limit that he can control of 500kg. Bigger creations tend to be dumber and less responsive, so he needs to put more effort into directing them.
There will be an example down below.

**Versatility:** It depends on the supply of materials he has. If he has a lot of high-quality, fresh, human bodies, then he can create a devastating opponent to any normal human, and one that can take on some low-tier capes (basically 1-2 rated Brutes). If he only has access to rotting animal parts, he’ll create something that falls apart the moment you touch it. And since parahuman powers can’t really be transferred over, that makes everything lack even more versitality.

**Example:** The golem stood at the edge of the street, the hunched-over Sebastion behind him. He’s got a large smile on his face, walking slowly, jumping at every slight sound. “Come, come! We need flesh, Lucille needs flesh, we need to find someone...” He pauses at the sound of a slight thumping, the sound of heavy flesh upon hard concrete. A massive golem rounds the corner, much like his own. It’s a [large green beast, made of stitched threads and heavy bolts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/31ho6x/respect_frankenstein_n52/) 

Sebastion laughs, drawing the attention of the creature across. “Flesh! Good, strong flesh! Get the flesh!” The golem at Caff’s side lurches forward, slowly meandering towards the other beast. The green monster watches as the golem reaches him, throwing punches that would’ve easily knocked out a normal man. Growing ever more annoyed, the green beast lashes out with one massive hand, sending the green one flying to the side. Starting to walk towards Caff again, he pauses when Caff’s flesh monster pushes up, slowly, the left arm of the monster hanging loosely by its side. It lurches forward once more, before the head is gripped and crushed. 

Turning his attention back towards Caff, the golem moves forward to engage, before Sebastion cackles and runs forward with a small plank of wood, hitting as hard as he can. That is to say, not hard. The board doesn’t do anything to the monster, who socks Caff in the stomach. Unlike his creation, Sebastion does not get up."

Unfortunately pretty much all of my friends have gone home or to other cities for internships now that the semester is over, so I'm finding myself pretty bored when not at work. Looking for someone to hang out with and get to know over the summer, and if we click I'm open to pursuing a relationship.

I have a tendency to tell incredibly bad science jokes. For example: what do complex analysis and Spanish have in common? I always forget to conjugate.

I'm a physics and computer science major, going into my senior year. I love reading (currently working on House of Leaves), writing (I've written two novels and a stage script, which has actually been published), watching Rick and Morty, and finding stupid videos on YouTube (for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdzCv_9eaoM).

For those who care what I look like, I'm 6'3"", slender, and I work out regularly. Anyways, I'd love to hear from you. Let's chat and see if we click. Maybe find a time and place to hang out. Grab coffee or visit a museum. Something like that."

Hence, an internship would be the best place for hands-on learning. I plan on pursuing a double major in Psychology and English, also maybe Computer Science so an internship in any of these fields would be amazing. 

Please message me or comment if you could help me in finding any such internship. I'll happily work for free and show up on time to anywhere in Bangalore ( other than Whitefield cause that's too far for me). But will be able to work full-time only for a month or two as will leave in September. 

I do have some work experience in Data Mining as I worked CERN in Geneva with regard to their gas detectors in the hadron collider. I've also been working in my schools editorial team ( and also on various online periodicals ) for the past three years. I could send in my resume if anyone is interested. I want to explore and learn more about Psychology as I'm considering becoming a psychiatrist in the future - right now all I know about that is from a textbook I bought last month. "
6doovi,6,2017-05-27,My (24f) best friend (27f) won't talk to me but it's not because she's mad at me.. should I just move on?,dontwantkids123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6doovi/my_24f_best_friend_27f_wont_talk_to_me_but_its/,"Jess is someone I have considered a very close friend since we met 2 years ago.

From January through April I let her live with me in my house rent free because she still lives with her parents and her internship was much closer to my house.

It was good for the most part, besides a few minor things such as her never locking the door when she leaves and me having to do all the cleaning.

She moved out after her internship because unfortunately her mom has stage 4 cancer and started chemo. Further, Jess was studying to take the CPA exam, she studied for 12 hours a day and took the exam last week.

I did notice when she started living with me that she is very narcissistic. She really doesn't make time for anyone except her girlfriend. They would talk every night for hours. And all Jess ever talked about was how exhausted she was and how hard she works and how she can't do anything blah blah blah. (She had a paid internship where she worked 9-6, that was the extent of her responsibilities).

Anyway, while she was studying I knew she wouldn't text me back so I didn't bother. But I started texting and calling after her exam was over. For 2 days I texted her a few times and called a few times and when she wasn't responding I got seriously concerned that her mom may have taken a turn for the worse and be in hospice or something. I was texting Jess how worried I am
And please let me know everything is OK. I even texted her girlfriend. Neither of them got back to me until 24 hours later - when they told me everything is fine, Jess is just tired and spending all of her time with her gf.

I know she constantly has her phone since I lived w her. She would get texts and ignore them and say she would respond later - that is fine, but I know she saw my texts and calls asking if everything is OK and she still didn't respond for at least 24 hours. 

Honestly idk if she might be upset with me because I got snippy with her a few weeks ago after she blew me off for a party we had planned on going to for MONTHS when she said she was just so overwhelmed with studying and cancelled an hour before it started. Her test was still 3 weeks away. But I was kind of like ""yeah well I'm busy too studying for the Bar exam so maybe we can just catch up in August when our exams are over."" She didn't respond.

I mean in general she's a good friend just incredibly focused on herself. I'm sure she's ignoring me because she's just focused on her girlfriend, but I mean I've texted and called many times saying we should catch up. 

She isn't working or in school, yet she has NO time to take 2 minutes to respond to me. 

It's just hard bc no matter what I'm doing I always make time for people I care about. She only makes time for her girlfriend, I've noticed friends are pushed to the side, she honestly doesn't even have many friends anymore.

And I know she's planning on spending the summer in another city with her girlfriend so I was hoping to see her before she leaves but it doesn't look like it will happen.

It just sucks because I have always been so good to her, all we do is talk about her issues and I listen for HOURS to the same over analyzations and speculations and I give advice. Hell, I'm studying for the bar exam right now but that won't stop me from making time for my friends. 

We used to see each other every day when she lived with me, now I haven't seen her in a month or really spoken to her at all.

Also, before we even lived together she would always call me and talk and we would always meet up and stuff - now, nothing.

Should I just cut her off or cut her some slack since her mom has cancer? 

Tl;dr -- my friend won't talk to me because she's too busy spending time with her girlfriend. I've been a really good friend to her and it seems she thinks I'll be there whenever she decides she wants to talk or hang out again. Although she may be upset since I was snippy with her a few weeks ago. Should I cut her off?"

6dp4ag,26,2017-05-27,How Reddit was slowly destroyed by the fascist left.,TheLatchKey,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6dp4ag/how_reddit_was_slowly_destroyed_by_the_fascist/,"**SOURCE:** https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/

**1) The first thing they did was take away r/ reddit.com.**
This took away the only tool for communicating with reddit about reddit. If you had any concerns about the website as a whole, you could address them through r/ reddit. Taking that away was the first step.
**
2) The power now resided in individual subreddits, obviously the most popular ones. There was a power grab to become moderators of these subreddits.**
I remember as the upcoming election loomed, all of a sudden, r/ circlejerk (one of the old default subreddits) became completely obsessed with bashing Ron Paul. I am not even a RP supporter, but that was definitely orchestrated, and NOT by some kids trying to be funny. Also, it coincided perfectly with this highly suspicious campaign to filter him out of the election.

**3) Once the default subreddits were controlled, drastic changes began to occur.**
I remember when r/ IAma was open to anyone and the popularity was decided by voting. Now it is nothing more than a cheap place for celebrities to whore out their products and you need to be ""approved"". Someone named Victoria is involved and how does that makes any sense whatsoever? Celebrities have entire teams of branding/PR/social media teams that work for them. Why do they need to be at reddit HQ and/or required to have a reddit rep? Because these AMA's are extremely organized and sponsored with money.
There are plenty of subreddits that are now covertly controlled. Check out this post which was pushed into r/ undelete for identifying a list of keywords banned from r/ technology.

**4) The appearance of shills soon became VERY apparent.**
All of a sudden new accounts started popping up out of nowhere. Cue the birth of r/ HailCorporate. ""Feel good"" military posts started appearing, like a soldier coming home to his dog. New users entered AMA's to lob softball questions ""Mr Burns, your campaign has the momentum of a runaway freight train, how does it feel to be so popular?"" From brand new accounts that never posted again.
Eglin Air Force Base = Reddit's most addicted city! I would hate to be the poor reddit intern who got fired that day! ""Didn't you read the memo Billy. US military bases are never to be included in our yearly stats!!!""
Anyone who tries to convince you that shills don't exist is either grossly uninformed or a liar. Protip: the big political subreddits can’t seem to keep the seal on the circlejerk during weekends, almost as if an entire team of manipulators is suddenly on weekend hours.

**5) Now we have blatant censorship on r/n ews, r/w orldnews etc... saying that X site is not allowed.**
What ever happened to letting people vote on the content of this website? Trash tabloids constantly go viral on political subreddits due to sensationalized headlines and the fact that most Americans are unaware of different overseas publications.
Not to mention the fact that default subreddit rules are now completely refined, sophisticated and purposely worded to allow maximum mod-interpretation. Honestly, someone with a law degree with a proud.
Major politically-charged subreddits now insist on exact titles or quotes because that stops users from being able to post the important point summary of the article as the title . Using only official titles from only approved media has turned reddit into mainstream media.

**6) Speaking of voting, they changed that too.**
We now have an entirely new way to view upvote/downvote scores. A user used to be able to see their score. But now, everything is fuzzed. For example, if you made a semi-controversial comment before, but many people agreed, you may have a score like (47/45), leaving you with a -2 next to the comment. Now you just get a -2 and nobody knows if anyone agreed with you.

**7) Hey guise, us nerds who run reddit have decided to shuffle all of the front-page subreddits, tee-hee we are so random ‿^**
No more r/ circlejerk, that pesky subreddit hits too close to home. Lets add 2X to the mix, (even though they wanted to remain an anonymous sub), fuck them, we need to show our shareholders we represent the female demographic. Lets also add a bunch of subs that we can use to share propaganda like r/ nottheonion.
And speaking of the female demographic and ""gender discrimination"" being represented, that happened around the time this person took over as CEO of reddit.

**8) You are posting too much, please wait...**
It now doesn't matter if you have confirmed your email, or been posting on this site for years. If you anger the wrong mod/admin or your posts aren't doing ""well"", then you get benched.
Or you can always just have your comments deleted. You will not even know your comment is deleted. You will still see it. Only you. The only way to know is to be inherently suspicious, and sign out of your account after clicking on the permalink of the comment.
A sneaky tactic, but hey, at least it is only your comment and not your whole account. Isn’t it great that we have shadow-banning on a website that claims to support free speech.

**9) Reddit is not a meritocracy.**
tl;dr: Your votes do not matter. The front page is not decided on merit. Different subs are given different algorithms. There is a behind the scene ranking system that gives certain content a ""head-start"". As we have learned at r/ conspiracy, if they don't like our sub, then we are banished from the front page, forever. Just like we were banished from r/ bestof, after this amazing comment that was gilden 8X and received over 3000 upvotes. They actually gave that user the boot. How dare you bring your unique, first-hand perspective to a web-forum!!!

**10) The arrival and subsequent take over of r/ undelete.**
Due to the now rampant censorship on the site, users took it into their own hands to bring the truth into the light. They created a part of reddit where users could see what was being deleted. Nope.

1**1) Now we are seeing a new site-wide trend that is designed to make it even harder to call out shills.** Which is interesting considering that nobody seems to care when the accusations are sponsored by the mob: “This guy is a Putin-bot! Everyone must think the exact same way about complex geopolitical events.”

**12) All of the proper ""checks and balances"" are now in place.**
R/worldnews has become the ultimate modern-day version of the Two-Minutes Hate from George Orwell's 1984:
a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies and express their hatred for them.
But when we really want to drive a point home, the entire front-page gets in on the action!!!
Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum. Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the manufactured consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, without any other evidence, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt. And I was gang-downvoted every time I asked.
And speaking of the BB, reddit will apparently never live down the fact that someone was wrongly accused. Why should a community be demonized for aggregating information and doing something that has proven to be successful in 90% of cases, particularly disasters? Why? Because the government can’t have people doing their own detective work, that would make their cover-ups way more difficult.

**13) Online guerrilla tactics.**
When reddit changed the voting system and people were on their last nerve with this site, a place called Whoaverse (now https:// voat. co/) became popular overnight. It is basically a reddit clone and at the time was run by one guy. He was happy about the surge but mentioned it was going to be hard to keep up with, but was committed to making it happen. Guess what happened next?
Did you guess: “Thousands of targeted spam attacks to overload and destroy the website”? Then congrats, you now understand how far these fucks are willing to go to keep the herd in their pen. Hijacking a cool brand and using it’s facade to conduct propaganda games is extremely profitable, just ask VICE. And once you have the customer, it costs much less to keep them than to acquire new ones. So we are seeing online guerrilla tactics designed to destroy the competition by any means.

**14) Shark Shank's Redemption (title credit to: u/Iridium777 )**
So I made this post and it went viral on r/ conspiracy reaching +3500. I woke up the next day and by accident I signed out and saw my user page could no longer ""be found"". I then noticed that every comment I had made was stuck at 1. After over 6.5 years on reddit, I had received my first shadowban.
So I made a new account and made this post about it, it also went viral. I was given advice to message the reddit admins about my shadowban, I eventually received this message:
It looks like you got caught up in a vote brigade, but upon further investigation it looks like you were not part of it. Thanks for writing in so promptly. I've unbanned your account.
I have no idea what ""vote brigade"" I would have been a part of and you don't have to believe me but I have never been a part of anything that even vaguely resembles a ""vote brigade"".
Anyways, the whole thing stinks to me. Like a canned response. The admin version of ""yeah, our bad"". Multiple years on reddit and I get my 1st shadowban ""accidentally"" within a day and a half of my most viral ""How Reddit Was Destroyed"". …………………………………….
It wasn't always like this. A few years ago, there were just as many disagreements and differences of opinion on reddit, but they were REAL. And the site was still a democracy. People voted and things swung from side to side, everybody learned in the end.
Now we have a completely one-sided mess that pretends to be democratic but is quickly becoming the Fox News of the internet. They designed a system that would take advantage of the Eternal September syndrome and this manipulation has encouraged the retard masses to become their useful idiots.
I believe this can essentially be boiled down to not just greed, but controlling and manipulating the information that the millions of people see on a daily basis. Reddit gets billions of views. Manufactured consensus is very real and doing it through social media is the gold standard because people are hard-wired to value the opinions of their peers.
The people who run reddit are not the ""cool bloggers"" they try to portray themselves as. There is a head running things, and it is sinister and they are making A LOT of money, and have A LOT of power, and A LOT of influence.
And they know it. You should too.

6dp65v,3,2017-05-27,"Laid off from internship in bad faith, process starting all over again. Bulldozed. (Long).",literallythrownaway0,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6dp65v/laid_off_from_internship_in_bad_faith_process/,"Last summer, during a short period of unemployment, I applied to one of the leading firms in my niche field in my part of the country. Last month they called me back about doing an interview. I passed through their extremely rigorous interview process and got an offer to intern at the same wage rate that I was making at my not-great semi-related office job, where I'd learn some in-house skills and programs. Needless to say, I was thrilled and I took the offer.

Yesterday afternoon I was finishing up some work and I got called into a meeting with one of my project managers and the office manager. Apparently the firm didn't have the resources to train me up after all and they let me go. No problems with the quality of my work. A guy with more of the specific skill set they wanted is starting on Tuesday, sitting at my old desk.

I'v been reeling for about 20 hours. I quit a job and jumped into this opportunity on the basis of the fucking lie that they would be willing to train me up to their working standards and on the fucking truth that I would be willing to learn. I spent two hours working late on Thursday perfecting a model that I'd learned to do earlier that day from a PM with the biggest smile on my face that I was teaching myself to do something useful and interesting. And it turns out they only wanted to use me as a stopgap for a month until they found somebody they actually wanted.

They just took the crown off my head and stomped on it. These are people are liberals with degrees from fancy liberal arts colleges and nice graduate degrees who will absolutely just fucking lie to your face and get you to disrupt your life to use you to fill a few things in while they wait for their dream candidate. Now I'm looking at drawing unemployment and searching for jobs for the second time in a year.

I wish I'd never made any of the choices that took me here. My undergrad, my graduate degree, my stupid connections, all based on lies. I'm looking at trying to get a position outside of my country (the US) just because I'm so disgusted with everything about this mean, small, shitty country. I was disgusted before, but it looked like I was at least on a good career track. Now it's a beautiful early summer day but everything looks shit colored to me.

Fuck you, ____ ___ _____."
6dp8ln,150,2017-05-27,Starting to resent my boyfriend for his financial expectations when we make such different salaries.,addygirl11,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6dp8ln/starting_to_resent_my_boyfriend_for_his_financial/,"I graduated from college in December, and got my first job a month ago.  My boyfriend is salary and makes good money, and would pay for things for us while I was looking for work, like food/drink, but would hold it over my head or bring it up during arguments. I never ask him for anything.  I was making a little money up until I got my job, and sold a lot of things I that I liked but weren't necessary, and whenever I did make money, it would go toward bills and entertainment for us. I haven't really spent money on myself in a long time. 

My job is really technical, but since I had no experience, and didn't do an internship, I'm making minimum wage as a temp until my review.  I work in hot conditions, on my feet and moving the majority of the time, breathing metal alloy powder and naphthalene all day. I work really hard. I'm beginning to resent him because he is salary with large cash bonuses and doesn't work very hard, and gets to play video games at his desk all day, in an air conditioned office, and spends money on himself liberally.  Our roommate can't afford his share of rent this month, and my boyfriend asked me to help. I'm happy to, but his cash bonus for one week was worth more than my paycheck. 

Without going into too much detail, I really need to buy basic things for myself, like a bra where the wiring isn't poking into my skin and the straps aren't broken, and pants that I can use at work, and shoes, and toiletries. If I look at things online, he'll peer over my shoulder and say things like,  ""You need to be frugal because you need to step up for rent this month. But don't worry. Someday you'll be making better money and then you can buy things you don't need just because you like the label, like this wallet."" And hold up a new expensive wallet he bought and laugh about it. 

He keeps saying we're a team, but when I need financial support, I have to struggle and sell everything I have to make it work on my own. 


How can I keep from resenting him?  Should I just cough up the money needed for rent and not complain about it, or talk to him? Money stuff makes me feel awkward and uncomfortable. "
6dpwzk,3,2017-05-27,No more purpose in life,needhelpsocial,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6dpwzk/no_more_purpose_in_life/,"Hello Reddit,

I am currently a 20 year old attending university studying business management and I currently feel hopeless. I feel like ever since I started university, the optimistic light in my eyes has been crushed by reality and its expectations. Although I’m doing well in terms of GPA, I feel as if my professional and social growth have been stinted. My daily routine now consists of mindlessly attending classes while completing the accompanying work. As of now, I fail to see the meaning behind my efforts put into classes that produce no meaningful skills. To make matters worse, my attempts at landing a paid summer internship have borne no fruit. My current summer plan is to attend an internship abroad that is hosted through one of my university’s programs. While this fills my time off with work, it does not offer any pay nor prestige. Facing the reality of my mediocrity has been an insightful journey, but it has led to the further development of my self-conscious behavior. 

My self-esteem has hit an all-time low. Whenever I attend extracurricular clubs and attempt to socialize, my personality takes on a very superficial persona, one that is very easily noticed. At times my mind goes blank while conversing, leading to awkward stuttering and conversations that lack depth. This result has led to many acquaintances but no true friendships. Now, I feel as if I have no one to fall back to. Due to sour relations with my brother in law, he talks poorly behind my back with my family concerning my achievements and future. Sadly, I have no retaliation to these statements because sometimes, I too feel as if my future is bleak. I’ve entered a cycle of depression where I scorn myself for having no friends, failing to make new friends through clubs, and then scorning myself more so for my lack of social skills. At this point I don’t know what it takes to break this cycle of unhappiness. I’ve talked to therapists provided by my school, but I feel as if their help is superficial as they have many patients and rely on unrealistic positivity. 
If matter continues as they are now, I fear I will become socially incompetent and become a permanent shut in. My current efforts have yielded poor results so I would appreciate any advice that would help me get back to a fulfilling lifestyle.

Thank you so much for your time.

6dpx8z,1,2017-05-27,[M4F] Looking For Some Shameless Rule 34 PWP Lines,RangerVyce,eroticpenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticpenpals/comments/6dpx8z/m4f_looking_for_some_shameless_rule_34_pwp_lines/,"Hey there! I'm currently seeking smut-centric and playfully erotic lines. (And I do admit I'd love these to be canon x OC lines; am able to provide fairly to largely detailed bios of said OCs upon request.) Highspirited action/adventure, humor/comedy and levity, copious amounts of warm passion/erotica, playful sensuality and fluff, that sort of stuff. RPs that, in short, tickles the funny bone and touches the heart...among other, more sensitive areas. :)

___

**What I'm Looking For**
--

I'm seeking partners who would play as any of the below listed female canon characters opposite one of my original characters:

* Supergirl, Power Girl or Lois Lane from *DC Comics*
* Peach, Daisy or Zelda from *Nintendo*
* Yuna from *Final Fantasy X*
* Misty or Jessie from *Pokemon* (more specific info on this craving [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6c6m1d/m4f_patiently_pursuing_pokemon_plots/))
* Katara or Suki from *Avatar the Last Airbender*
* Korra from *Legend of Korra*
* Hermione Granger from *Harry Potter*
* Android 18 from *Dragon Ball Z*

I'd also be interested in some lighthearted modern-day superheroics or magic-filled high fantasy lines.

Below are some generic smutty lines below that I’d be open to blending with any of the above settings/characters (and tweaking as needed), or playing separately...

❶ *Colleagues with feelings for one another are paired up to work on a long-term project together into the late hours of the night.*

❷ *A typically mean boss becomes vulnerable after learning her job might be in jeopardy. She gets comfort unexpectedly from an employee.*

❸ *Two employees get stuck in the elevator on their way home, after hours. They have some time to kill until help arrives.*

❹ *One employee bribes another to do their work, in exchange for sexual favors.*

❺ *Person A wants to impress Person B by baking them their favorite dessert before Person B arrives home from work. B surprises A by coming home early and dessert ends up a little messier than planned.*

❻ *A male who has a fondness of women wearing stockings or pantyhose. While he doesn’t outright stare, he finds it odd that one day, he can’t tear his eyes away from the sheathed, long legs of a co-worker/his best friend/his boss, but thinks he was discreet in his observations. Unfortunately, that was ill-assumed, as said woman approaches the man with an...interesting proposal.*

❼ *A male intern has a genuine professional respect for his older female boss/CEO's accomplishments and intelligence (not wanting to jeopardize this golden academic opportunity), and finds himself increasingly attracted to her.* (This can go a variety of ways.)

___
**OOC Info**
---

1. **All characters must be played/written at least 21 years old if they aren't already older.**

2. While I'll plot OOC via Reddit PM, **I’m only able and willing to roleplay via E-mail**.

3. I’m looking for these lines to be **largely PWP/smut-centric** (think a ratio of *65-70% smut and 35-30% plot*); one-shots, short-term and long-term are all good. That said, it wouldn’t mean they'd be mindless fuckfests devoid of any depth or meaning...just more focused on that sort of stuff, you know?

4. I write in the **third-person POV (2-4 paragraphs per post)**, so be comfortable matching that and please be on point with spelling/grammar, description and such. (Three writing samples of mine are viewable [here](https://jpst.it/X6du).)

5. I'm very laid-back and flexible with post frequency as long as you keep me in the loop. **Posting every day certainly isn’t required** (real life always comes first and the muse can be a fickle bitch at times); heck, once or twice a week is perfectly fine with me if that’s your comfort level. **Please tell me if you want to end the line instead of just ghosting.**

6. **Sex positivism is a requirement.** By this, I mean sexual encounters that are fun and mutually enjoyable for both parties, centered around shared pleasure and enjoyment. No one’s being degraded, personal agency isn't significantly hampered or removed, and there are no forced/non-con elements (mutual consent’s both sexy *and* required). **If you're seeking lines where sex is generally shameful, exploitative, debasing, one-sided in participation and/or outright rapey in tone, I wouldn't be a good partner.**

___
**Kink List and Turn-Ons/Turn-Offs**
---

[While my full kink list is here](https://www.f-list.net/c/fetishes%20and%20kinks), my main turn-ons (those listed in *italics* being especially desired/craved) and turn-offs are listed below.

Turn-Ons | Turn-Offs
---|---
Light bondage | Sexually lazy/ignorant ""welfare submissives""
Tongue-in-cheek damsel-in-distress play | Bimbos/hyper-slutty characters
*Witty banter, humor and playful snark* | Incest
*Footplay/foot fetish* | Bad personal hygiene
Foodplay | Adultery and cuckolding
Equal/“switch” pairings and role-reversal | Anything belonging in a toilet/exiting an ass
Copious foreplay | Hardcore BDSM
*Uniform/costume roleplay* | Rape/non-con and dub-con
*Erotic use of magic and superpowers* | Set in stone ""sub/dom"" sexual dynamics
Women in lingerie and high heels | Romanticized toxic couples
*Nylons/stockings/pantyhose* | Characters under 20 years old
Anal | Non-con/abusive/rapey sex
Partially clothed sex | Gross bodily secretions
Older woman x younger man pairings | 
*Body licking* | 

___

So if anything in this admittedly self-serving ad appeals to you, send a PM that includes **all** of the following:

* *What cravings and/or characters drew your interest*
* *Any mutually enjoyed kinks you'd like to include* (**please** don't give some vague reply like *""I'm down for whatever""*; be specific and know what you want :P)
* *A small RP writing sample or a link to one* (I've found it goes a long way in showing if we mesh)
* *Any RP dislikes, pet peeves and dealbreakers you have*
* *Anything else you think is relevant or I should know*

But if you decide we wouldn't mesh for whatever reason, may you soon find that partner that makes you feel dirty (in all the right ways, of course :P)!"

1. I play your new secretary or intern.  You start to influence how I dress, act and perhaps even invite me over to your house for late night teaching on the inner workings of the company

2. You catch me spying on you and decide to teach me that staring is impolite. What I say you doing is up to you ;)

3. My car breaks down and you stop, rescuing me.  When we get back to your house you either immediately start seducing/domming me, or perhaps we play a game, as I start to lose I make worse and worse bets for myself. 

4.  Some other bdsm scene. Do you have a fantasy? I love helping people live out their ideas 

Look forward to chatting!

6dqkza,5,2017-05-27,IJW: Colossal (2016),TheNerfherder38,Ijustwatched,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/6dqkza/ijw_colossal_2016/,"Far from neglecting the trappings of either monumental blockbuster or dry satirical comedy, Colossal wears its bizarre premise proudly on its sleeve. Largely, it’s all the better for it. Anne Hathaway plays Gloria, an alcoholic who is kicked out by her boyfriend, Tim (a fantastically clipped Dan Stevens), and heads back to her old hometown. Waking from a particularly rough night, Gloria turns on the TV to find a giant monster has trampled over the city of Seoul. But that’s not the weirdest discovery: after watching the creature for several days, Gloria realises it’s imitating her drunken movements as she wanders through the small town’s playground, even performing her unique nervous tic.

There are many things I really like about this bizarre curiosity of a film, even the bits that don’t quite gel. I love that it almost evades marketing in any way. Oh, the poster’s rather great (and will probably adorn a rather snazzy steelbook someday), but watching the trailers try to effectively echo its offbeat combination of crowd-pleaser and arthouse oddity is almost as fun as watching the film itself. I also love that director Nacho Vigalondo gets Jason Sudeikis to play against type so deceptively. He’s playing a childhood friend of Gloria’s, Oscar, who offers her a job at his bar and tries to help her get back on her feet. On a surface level that might not seem much of a stretch, but the role grows into something far different by the third act. I’m not sure I totally bought what that role becomes, but it certainly adds spice and allows for some great glaring between he and Hathaway.

The whole film has a blindfolded taste test feeling that brought me back to watching student previews during my early uni years, such as The Double, Frank, or Life After Beth. These were films that offered not only a break from packed multiplexes and sweaty club nights, but an anticipation that comes only from something deliberately different. ‘Anne Hathaway is a kaiju’ now rests alongside ‘Jesse Eisenberg has a clone’ and ‘Michael Fassbender has a papier mâché head’ in my personal canon of ‘Strange Premise, Stranger Film’.

And Colossal is strange. At times delivered as mumblecore drama, at others improv comedy, the film demonstrates remarkable reservation with its monster stomping. The rules of Gloria’s connection with the creature are established without contrived exposition, it’s something that we discover with the characters, and there’s no better guide than Hathaway. I’ve sorely missed her on-screen since Interstellar (I never caught The Intern, nor Alice Through the Looking Glass), and the wait has been more than worthwhile. I’m honestly not sure who else could carry the film through its few misjudged moments, or make me believe in a character who can show remorse for people thousands of miles away but seems incapable of calling her boyfriend back to say sorry.

It would be relatively easy for Colossal to thrive purely on Hathaway and Sudeikis’ grimacing or its water cooler premise alone, but it’s got far more to offer than that. The monster’s appearances, perpendicular to Gloria’s struggles with alcoholism, can be read in any number of ways. Whether it’s the not-so-subtle comment on self-destruction, what our idiocy does to people we’ll never even meet, or the somewhat deeper allusions to power as a corruptive force. One could even read the film as a comment on (stick with me here) what America does and doesn’t contribute cinematically to the rest of the world. Indie films (like the drama inhabited by Hathaway, Sudeikis and Stevens) rarely make it across the border, with US cinema represented abroad only by Hollywood behemoths (like the rampaging monster swatting helicopters from the air).

These themes do get a little lost amongst the clatter of the climax, but previous exploration of them was so restrained that I forgave it. I’m unsure whether these final moments exist purely keep mainstream audiences in their seats, but as a gentle nudge into summer tentpole season, it worked. Colossal should be appraised for refusing to skimp on shiny spectacle, but never letting it blind a genuine harmony of digital bombast and dramatic buoyancy.

6dqlkx,72,2017-05-27,My internship in Seattle [MMFFFF][Group] - Part 1,throwawq14,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6dqlkx/my_internship_in_seattle_mmffffgroup_part_1/,"I am a rising senior in a college in Midwest and I am going to tell what happened during the last summer around this time during my internship in Seattle. Currently, I am interning in the Bay Area. Looking back I had way too much fun around this time last summer. 

I went to Seattle area when I got an internship there. The tech company hosted most of their interns in corporate housing in a few areas. I decided to take rental car option that they provided and stayed at a nice place a little further in the suburbs.

I was sharing a 2 BHK fully furnished apartment with Ben. He was a fellow intern. Ben was extremely outgoing, and had very different views on life at the time than I did. Whereas I was just coming off a 2 year relationship, Ben had stuck mostly to FWBs in school. 

Only one week after we moved in, I was having few beers with interns from my team. I got home late around 11:30 PM and when I opened the door, I heard some noise that was clearly two people kissing and making out. He already had met a new girl, who had left her panties in the living room. Their kisses stopped and after what seemed like a few minutes, I heard moans and muffles. Clearly, Ben was fucking a chick. Lucky bastard.

The next night we went to a pizza place that was popular with interns. I was wearing a t-shirt that showed I was on the soccer team and shorts. Ben had on a Super Mario Bros. t-shirt, so I guessed he wasn't actually playing on picking up a girl for the night. It was a seat yourself kind of place, and it was a nice day so we decided to sit on the porch. 

When we got to the porch about half the tables were open. Rather than grab one, Ben walked over to a table with two girls who only had water and still had their menu's. One of the girl's recognized Ben and they exchanged pleasantaries. Ben got back to me and told that she is Erin, the girl he has been seeing. Ok, so he is seeing a girl now, within a week of starting internship.

Erin was a very funny, cute girl from a school in the new England region. She was an average height, fit, thick skinned blonde woman. She had a very pretty face, shoulder length hair, and 34B breasts. I was next to a very pretty brunette named Disha, and Ben was next to a Erin. We started to chat, and ordered a large pizza. They asked us what it was like playing a college sport, told us about their two other intern friends Amber and Alexa, mostly small talk. When we finished dinner, Ben announced we had some beer in our room if they wanted to go back with us, which they eagerly agreed to.

I walked across to the apartment with Disha's arm wrapped around mine, making small talk the entire time. She was a gorgeous woman. She was tall, about 5'8"", but still a good bit shorter than me. She had beige skin, a defined face, and black hair that went about midway down her back. She had on a low cut blue and white striped shirt, and from my height I could look straight down into her cleavage, She had pushed up breasts that I though had to be D cups. 


We got home and started to have a few beers. Erin and Ben were sitting on the futon, and Disha and I were sitting across form them in Ben and my computer chairs. As the drinks started, the girls loosened up even more, and told us that tonight was originally going to be a girls only night. They had gone to a party the night before. 

 Erin was tan, with a face full of freckles, and taller than Disha. She had on jeans shorts that only went an inch or two down her extremely long legs. Her legs were toned, and a golden bronze color. Ben had a hand over her shoulders, which he let slide down to her chest. She immediately put her hand on Ben's thigh as well. I decided to try it. I untangled my arm from Disha's and started to rub her shoulder. Soon I was rubbing it further towards her chest. Disha leaned in closer and put a hand around my waist and the other on my abs. 
 
 We had beers and Ben was not going to wait. He turned the discussion towards sex and some how we were discussing boobs now.
 
 ""I mean, I'm small, 32A,"" Erin was saying.

""Are you kidding?"" I asked, being serious. ""You are gorgeous,"" Ben told her, being completely honest. 

""Aww, thank you!"" she leaned over and kissed Ben on the cheek.

""C'mon Erin,"" Disha replied, ""You have nice boobs. I know, I've seen them."" 

""Umm, they are 32A, guys want bigger, like yours. 36D right?"" Disha nodded yes. 

""Well I think 32A sounds wonderful,"" Ben said. ""In fact, I can think of nothing more I would like to do right now, than have a tall, thin, gorgeous woman straddle me topless and let me kiss on her 32A breasts."" 

Erin laughed and said ""Watch out, or I might make you put your money where your mouth it."" 

Ben immediately quipped, ""I'd rather you put your breasts where my mouth is.""

Apparently that was all it took. Erin straddled Ben, her back to Disha and me. She pulled her shirt off over her head, then reached behind herself an undid her bra. Her long blonde hair covered the top third of her back. We could see that she had no tan-lines on her back, as Ben's hands were rubbing up and down it. Her arms were wrapped around Ben's neck, and we could hear her gently moaning. Disha's hand had moved to my lap and was rubbing my cock through my jeans as she watched. 

After a few seconds Erin got off Ben's lap and sat back next to us, without putting her shirt back on. She was laughing and blushing. She did have small, but very nice breasts with light brown nipples which were both very wet and very erect. 

""Big boobs are good too though."" I said, grinning at Disha. ""Is that what you want?"" She asked me in a seductive voice. 

I nodded yes as she pulled her shirt over her head. She unclasped her bra with one hand then let it fall off her into my lap. Two gorgeous, massive breasts were hanging in front of my face. She had large pink nipples which were both erect. I reached up and grasped one tit in each hand, leaned forward and buried my face between them, kissing her chest. Then I took her left nipple into my mouth, then moved over to the right. She wrapped her arms around my chest and moaned as I sucked on her. 

Disha straddled me. I kissed all over her breasts for what felt like much longer than Ben had played with Erin. I looked up at Disha and she leaned her face down to mine. I opened my mouth and let my tongue meet hers. She let out another moan as we made out. We broke the kiss and Disha got up to sit back on her chair. As soon as Disha turned around she exclaimed ""Oh My God"" covered her face and buried it against me. 

I looked over and realized why. Erin had Ben's cock out of his pants and was holding it in her hand. She looked at it then feigned surprise. 


We took the action to our respective rooms. Disha stood up and took of her shorts and panties. Her pussy was completely shaved. She got on her knees in front of me, said it was my turn, then undid my belt and took my shorts and boxers off. My cock was already rock hard and she immediately took it into her mouth. I reached down and squeezed her tits while she blew me.  

She looked up at me and asked, ""You really do like my boobs don't you?"" 

""They are the nicest I have ever played with,"" I answered. 

I pushed her onto the bed. Disha whimpered slightly at first, worrying me, but after several minutes of slow, deep fucking I had managed to work most of my cock into her and she started to moan again.

""Oh Kevin,"" she said, ""you're so thick and... Uhhhh... it feels so good you... Oh God... filling me.""

A gentle sheen of sweat now coated her soft breasts. I reached down to play with a nipple while I continued to work my cock in and out of her. Before long she was thrusting back up and me, the tight grip of her pussy taking more and more of my dick until I was buried to the hilt. 

""It's feeling GOOD,"" Disha said. ""I think I might be close to another... ooohhhhh.""

I reached down and ran the rough surface of my palm over her nipple while I began to fuck her harder and faster. I withdrew almost to the tip before shoving the full length of my thick me back into her wet folds. I rammed her faster and deeper, staring down at the unbelievable sight of her angelic face. Disha's firm breasts swayed up and down with our fucking, her lovely body coated in a soft sweat, and her beautiful eyes always staring back at me. 

I slammed into her over and over again, feeling her pussy grip me tightly. Her eyes went wide and she began to buck hard against me.

""OHHHHH GAAAAAWWD!!! I'm CUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMING!!!"" she screamed. I felt her puss muscles contract and milk my dick inside her as the wetness of her orgasm washed over my buried penis.

I worked my dick into her slowly a few more times before I paused. 

That night I fucked Disha 4 times. It was first casual sex experience for both of us.

6dqr6b,3,2017-05-27,Starting Salary CE in Toronto,throwaway1999942,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/6dqr6b/starting_salary_ce_in_toronto/,I was recently offered a job as a software engineer at a company with offices north of the 407. I am graduating in April 2018 and the job would start then. I am wondering what a good salary would be for a graduating Computer Engineer with 1.5 years of internship experience.
6dqwx1,1,2017-05-27,I don't know what to do...,throwthrowawayway9,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6dqwx1/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"I am so depressed. I was taking medical marijuana for depression and it helps me a lot despite it being illegal in my state. I ran out and that would normally be okay, but my depression has been at an all time high lately and I find myself really lethargic without being able to do much else but cry myself to sleep on most days.

My family is not supportive and they have their own problems to worry about so I usually feel like more of a burden. Back in November my brother battered and strangled me with the intention to kill me. He failed, but my parents immediately took his side and bribed me with paying for my schooling if I dropped the case (I'm an adult going back to college, they never wanted to pay for my education and kicked me out several times before 18).

I stuck with a restraining order that said he had to stay at least 500 feet away from me at all times. He constantly violates this and my parents actually let him live in the garage on their property (which I live in). 

I'm gay and no one in my family is accepting of that so I am closited, although I have come out several times to my mother (she refuses to acknowledge this and pretends I'm straight and I never told her). My dating/sex life has plummeted from almost nothing to the negatives. No one is interested in me either because my views are not the same as theirs or because of my appearance (I'm either not feminine enough or too feminine). The one person I thought was into me for me decided to awol me after I confessed my feeling to her via a letter I wrote her. I talked to other girls, but they just seem to want sex.

When I get this depressed I tend to go to the gym or take a drive. I decided to take a drive and got a $200 speeding ticked for going 5 over. I can't afford to pay it and dropped one of my college classes to try and pay it.

I have a terrible spinal injury that left me broke, without a job, and with a terrible work record because I would have to quit my physical jobs when I would get injured. This is why I'm back to living with them. The medical bills I had to pay ate up my savings as I don't qualify for medicare or any sort of disability assistance. I can't sleep in beds because of how bad it is and sleep on the floor where it is now infested with ants and other critters that get inside the house.

The only release I have is going to the gym, but if I don't make it at a certain time I tend not to go because of the type of guys that go there. There are about 4 guys who pretty much circle the machines behind me and I have caught them recording me as I work out. They don't stop and I always feel like breaking down and crying because of the it. It's my only release and I can't even do that.....Today has been the second day in a row that I can't seem to stop myself from breaking down every 30 minutes.

 I'm tired, I am so tired and I know I'm going to get berated, yelled at, and etc. because of that ticket. I dropped a class and sent my book back, but that still isn't enough to pay this ticket. I've been applying for jobs and internships for 3 months without any success. I'm failing so hard and I can't seem to pick myself up this time....I want to give up. I'm just so tired of this life. I feel like I have been nothing but a burden since I was born. Sometimes I wake up thinking why didn't my mother just abort me. Every time I try to talk to someone they just make me feel like more of an asshole ""there are people that have it worse than you do, suck it up."" They're right, I don't deserve to take up space here anymore. I'm trying really hard, but I honestly have no reason to keep going. My life has always felt like a steep uphill climb, this time it feels like an avalanche fell on me and I'm suffocating underneath the rubble. I don't know how to get up anymore.

 I can't remember what true happiness feels like anymore, I don't remember the last time I felt happy. The only reason why I'm still questioning killing myself is only because it would cost my family even more money to bury my body, only further provoking their dislike for me. They also know a lot of people who think I'm stuck up and dislike me (my prosapagnosa and social anxiety prevent me from interacting from people + all the bad experiences I've had), and it will just turn into another ""what will people say about us"" thing.

I'm so tired of this life. Its been a real shitstorm and I don't know what to do anymore. My will to live is slipping and I don't know how to pick myself up this time."
6dr5ey,2,2017-05-27,Help Finding New Planner,weepingreading,PlanningAddicts,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlanningAddicts/comments/6dr5ey/help_finding_new_planner/,"Hi y'all,

I'm a study currently looking for a new planner (mine runs out soon).  I've been using the EC Lifeplanner but it's a little too thick for me to bring to class, internships and tote around. 

I'm not picky about my planner being weekly or monthly, but I do want a vertical style planner. I was looking at the Ink + Volt Planner or the Day Designer or the Passion Planner.  Can anyone recommend any of these? Or recommend another? 

Thanks!"
6drak4,1,2017-05-27,Is there a difference between a break and breaking up? And other questions.,obeseelise,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6drak4/is_there_a_difference_between_a_break_and/,"I'm new to this sub and feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I'm trying everything to move on from this. I'm working out 3-4 days a week to not feel so depressed, on a new Keto diet to lose weight and feel better about myself, writing in a journal to let these thoughts out. I've made an appointment with a psychiatrist to finally put an end to my anxiety and depression that I put heavy blame on bringing an end to the greatest relationship I'd ever had, with the most beautiful man I had ever met. 

We'd been together for 9 months. Our relationship moved fast; I mean *really* fast. We started living together after we first met. We just couldn't get enough of each other. He was crazy about me and I [am] crazy about him. The point is: We had never been apart from each other until about two weeks ago. I got a summer internship with the Southern District Court and am staying with my parents 7 hours away for the summer (we were both in law school when we met-- he just graduated and I'm entering my second year). 

The first week was awful. Before I left, he received two job offers. One was in the town we live, a 2 year contract that, when he was done, I would be finished with school and we can stay together and figure out our next move together. However, the second job offer paid significantly more money, but was out of town. This caused a lot of stress and anxiety for me that only got worse when I came down here. For a week we fought on the phone every night about whether he would stay or go, and if he went, what he would do for our relationship to make sure it works out. I was so scared we wouldn't work out, that ironically, I was the reason it ended. 

He's also studying for the Bar this summer. He broke up with me last Saturday, 7 days ago tonight. He said it was too much for him-- our relationship (our fighting) and studying for the Bar and making sure he passes. I was hysterical. I begged him to give me a second chance, I promised I wouldn't fight with him anymore, I told him I would do anything to make sure I keep my cool from now on. But he said he couldn't risk it.

I asked him why not just a break? Why did it have to be a break up? He said he needed something absolute, clean. He said he didn't see a difference in the two. He said when he's done with the Bar, we can ""reassess"" when I get back. But for now, we're completely, 100% broken up. 

I'm devastated. This all happened so fast. He moved out of my apartment on Wednesday. I'm so mad at myself for how I treated him. I'm so mad at myself for letting my anxiety take control of my life. I hate myself so much and I'm scared nothing I do will ever fix what we had. 

During the day I'm okay. I tell myself I'm not going to call or text him, that I'm serious this time. But every evening I get hit with a wave of depression and I feel so incredibly lonely. I think about how badly I want to just talk to him about my day like we use to. We talked every single day. Our relationship was so easy. Why do we have to break up so suddenly? We're exploring how we are away from each other.. Why is this happening? 

He's ignoring my texts and calls now. He's never done that before. He'll occassionally text back or agree to talk on the phone, but that's like pulling teeth. His voice isn't the same-- he seems like he's really done. Like he doesn't love me anymore. He used to love me so much.. He loved me just two weeks ago. He said he loved me the night he broke up with me. He said he missed me, called me sweetie. He called me babe last night. 

When we talk on the phone now, he refuses to talk about our relationship. He says he only wants a platonic relationship. He says he's still mad at me though. He said he just wants me to do my thing and be happy, and he'll do the same. But I'm devastated, and he knows how emotional I am and how sudden this is for me.

I feel abandoned by him. When I start to cry on the phone, he says he has to go. I feel so pathetic. But this isn't like him. I swear, he was the one for me. He made me want a family, something I never thought I would ever want. He made me believe in a God-- I was so certain God sent him to me. 

I'm hopeless and have come here to seek help. My psychiatry appointment is in two weeks, but I wish it was sooner. He's my only friend, my best friend, so I have no one to talk to about any of this. I have no one to talk to about my day, which is really all I want. He refuses to talk about our relationship, which seems so totally unfair to me. 

Anyway, my question to you all: 

1. Is there a difference between a break and a break up? I thought the former implied exclusive dating with a guarantee that we'll reconcile later.

2. Does it seem like he's completely done with me? Are we over and that's just something I need to accept? I'm so scared that when I return, he'll tell me he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I'm scared he's just being nice (he really is a nice guy) by talking to me and telling me we can reassess when he gets done with the Bar, but that he's really unhappy in our relationship. That's the last thing I want.

3. Should I stop texting and calling him? I think I know the answer to this, but at the same time, I'm scared he'll just forget me. But I also feel like I'm annoying him and pushing him away. I just want to talk at night when I'm feeling lonely and miss him... Or any chance I get, really. 

I'm sorry for the rant. "
6drirc,6,2017-05-27,I (23/F) Only been with one guy...but I don't know if I want to keep it that way.,iamamess244,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6drirc/i_23f_only_been_with_one_guybut_i_dont_know_if_i/,"I've only been with one guy- my boyfriend. We've been dating for about a year and a half. I'm entering my last year of college coming this fall, and I am kind of regretting my lack of experiences I've had. I always stayed at home and didn't party, drink, or have much fun really. Mostly would stay home and hang out with my bf.

Well, I am currently out of the country for an internship program. I've been having alot of fun while out here, and making the most of my experience abroad. I've been meeting alot of great people! The only problem is the boyfriend back home. He has strict standards for ""no drinking, no smoking, no hardcore partying"" in place for himself, and for the person hes dating. This was never an issue before because, well, all I did was stay home or hang out with him.

Long story longer, I've met this super sweet guy while abroad...and he likes to party. And I want to have fun! But my bf back home is really upset with me for just hanging out with this guy, and is on the verge of breaking up with me. 

I know that if I pursue a summer fling with this guy, I'll be dumped easily. And I know I deserve that. But if I don't have fun while I am out here, I never will back home with my bf. I can see myself easily marrying my boyfriend, but I fear that I will never get the chance to have fun ever again once I have entered that stage of life.

Can someone offer me some clarity? :("
6dru25,8,2017-05-27,Building a revolutionary / DISRUPTIVE Vehicle simulation software platform,oshalygin,FSAE,https://www.reddit.com/r/FSAE/comments/6dru25/building_a_revolutionary_disruptive_vehicle/,"Hey guys, 


I'm the original author behind fsaesim.com.


It's been a long time for me since I graduated and was a part of FSAE.  As I continue to contribute to open source projects, I think back to how I wanted to build the best damn vehicle simulation platform the industry has ever seen.  The initial goal is of course to get models that represent as close to reality as possible but I want to add a machine learning/deep learning component that can predict vehicle reliability based on component/configure use.


My Background:  I'm a relatively successful Software Engineer by profession and have deep experience building Software(Web + Mobile).  I'm a very active contributor in the open source world and have contributed to dozens of projects(all software related).  Note, I'm not a Data Scientist.


If I was to sit down and build it with a group of engineers, would there be any interest?  I honestly need someone that understand the vehicle dynamics side of things, because I don't remember any of it :) . I can pull apart my old source code without a problem but I cannot extend it any further because I don't know the physics of it.  I have no problem with the software side of things and I'm convinced we can build something truly disruptive in the FSAE, Race Car, and Production Vehicle space.


If I had the vehicle dynamics support this is what I can foresee us building:
- A fully customizable vehicle dynamics simulation platform, think Grand Tourismo automated lap run.  First step would be a web software as a service tool, followed by an intuitive mobile application.
- Dynamic display of a vehicle going around the track with parameters such as lateral g's, speed, etc going around a track.
- Long term data analytics and collection with Deep Learning.  At some point i'd like to gather enough real world data to start drawing Machine Learning relationships and build models around reliability.  Reliability prediction is super hard to predict, but I see this as the next big step in motor vehicle development and we can prove the concept in FSAE.  
- Fully open source for anyone to use, contribute to and inspect(hosted on GitHub).


I've done a bit of work with universities(UCLA) in mentorship and internships, if you need a reference or an opportunity, this would be superb to list on your resume.  


I've actually been approached by Tesla/Ford as recent as 6 months ago to do software and VD work for them.  I'm not switching jobs or moving out of CA but keep this in mind if you're actively searching for post graduation opportunities. 


I do realize there's some overlap with iRacing, but they're a business and as far as I can tell, none of the models are public.  We wouldn't be competing with them, but instead, create an educational/learning platform that pools data and allows for other companies to leverage our APIs(Application Program Interface).

6ds6vw,9,2017-05-28,My experience switching from tretinoin to Differin (with a few pictures),CarlFriedrichGauss,tretinoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/6ds6vw/my_experience_switching_from_tretinoin_to/,"First time posting in this sub, but I just wanted to share my experience on tretinoin and what happened when I switched from tretinoin to Differin/adapalene in case anyone here is wondering about switching retinoids.

I always had some minor acne since high school, 1-2 medium-sized pimples a week that I just spot treated with benzoyl peroxide. In the summer of 2015, my acne got significantly worse because I graduated college unemployed and was pretty stressed out. Looking for answers beyond benzoyl peroxide, I discovered /r/SkincareAddiction and was convinced that I needed to start chemical exfoliation with BHA. I bought some cheap Olay night cream (Olay Age Defying 2 oz. Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream) that I read had some BHA and used it in place of Cetaphil Lotion which I felt wasn't moisturizing enough for me anyway. This ended up leading to the worst cystic acne breakout of my entire life and really shattered my self-esteem while I was in the process of looking for jobs. My face was a disaster and I honestly was feeling pretty depressed.

Being unemployed, uninsured, and broke as fuck , I couldn't really see a dermatologist but I new that I needed one. My only option was PocketDerm (now Curology), and even then $20/month was tough for me when I had rent to pay and was living on summer internship savings and food stamps. 

Thankfully, I had an amazing experience on ~1.5 years of tretinoin with my Curology formulation and ended up clearing up my acne so much that I finally stopped worrying about my face completely. I'm in a much better place both in my life and my skin than I was 2 years ago too, but I do always think about trying to save money here and there. I ended up quitting Curology since Differin gel 0.1% finally became available over-the-counter for a pretty good price. 

Compared to tretinoin/Curology, Differin was a lot less effective but I still think that it did an acceptable job managing acne, especially for the price. But somehow, Differin stopped working for me this month and I'm starting to get acne that's worse than high school/college but not as bad as summer 2015. I'm now switching back to tretinoin by resubscribing to Curology, but I'm currently waiting for my provider to reply and prescribe me a new bottle.

I can't compare Differin/adapalene vs. Retin-A/tretinoin directly, since I was always getting tretinoin combined with 1% clindamycin and 8% azelaic acid through Curology. I will say that I think that the Curology formulation worked a lot better for me than Differin alone, either due to tretinoin or the other active ingredients. On tretinoin/clindamycin/azelaic, I was getting only 1-2 very small pimples a month whereas I was getting 3-4 medium-sized pimples a month on Differin. That being said, I was actually pretty happy with Differin for the price and I would continue using it if it didn't stop working for me.

And now, time for a timeline with some pictures:

* [8/2015](http://i.imgur.com/LZphGAo.png) Looking back at this now, I almost feel like crying because of how awful it was.

* [9/2015](http://i.imgur.com/erAbEv4.png) Reset to a basic routine (Cetaphil cleanser + CeraVe AM/Cetaphil Cream) and started PocketDerm (now Curology) with niacinamide/clindamycin/azelaic acid formula. This worked okay for acne but I still had a new pimple or two every week and a ton of redness.

* [10/2015](http://i.imgur.com/y7wdMUk.png) Started tretinoin 0.009%/clindamycin 1%/azelaic acid 8% and this completely stopped my acne. No initial breakout/purging and I only got around 1-2 new small pimples a month. Redness still everywhere though.

* [12/2015](http://i.imgur.com/QLTRRcV.png) increased dose to 0.018%. After starting this, my skin was the best it ever felt, ever. Everything was so smooth and the only discoloration left was the dark spots from old cystic acne. I didn't notice any big improvement in terms of preventing new pimples compared to the lower dose, but pimples were already rare under the lower dose.

* 1/2016 - 1/2017 I never requested any changes to my prescription since it was working so well at keeping me clear. Over this period, my skin improved a LOT and I didn't really care to take pictures anymore because I honestly just stopped worrying about my skin. 

* 1/2017 This is around the time that Differin became available OTC. At $22/45g, it was a lot cheaper than $20/month for Curology and as a grad student I wanted to save any dollar I could. So I cancelled my Curology subscription and gradually switched from tretinoin to Differin by alternating the 2. I ran out around February.

* 2/2017 - 5/2017 Over these months I was using Differin exclusively along with a few drugstore retinol products. I definitely started getting more acne, maybe 4-8 pimples a month that were big enough as to where I would lance them and put a hydrocolloid over them when I saw them. On tretinoin, my pimples never got big enough to bother with. 

* [5/2017](http://i.imgur.com/Wk2e3O1.png) Went on vacation where I forgot my normal moisturizer (CeraVe PM), moved apartments, and started getting kind of a lot of breakouts. At least one new pimple every day, sometimes up to 4, but they are always very small. I think something broke because Differin doesn't seem like it's working for me anymore. Last week I started using COSRX BHA every other day and it seems like it's making the problem worse.

My current routine, which I have been using (with some actives) since 11/2015:

AM: Water, 10% benzoyl peroxide (Clearasil) spot treatment, CeraVe AM

PM: Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, Differin, CeraVe Cream
No actives currently

Thankfully, I had an amazing experience on ~1.5 years of tretinoin with my Curology formulation and ended up clearing up my acne so much that I finally stopped worrying about my face completely. I'm in a much better place both in my life and my skin than I was 2 years ago too, but I do always think about trying to save money here and there. I ended up quitting Curology since Differin gel 0.1% finally became available over-the-counter for a pretty good price. 

Compared to tretinoin/Curology, Differin was a lot less effective but I still think that it did an acceptable job managing acne, especially for the price. But somehow, Differin stopped working for me this month and I'm starting to get acne that's worse than high school/college but not as bad as summer 2015. I'm now switching back to tretinoin by resubscribing to Curology, but I'm currently waiting for my provider to reply and prescribe me a new bottle.

I can't compare Differin/adapalene vs. Retin-A/tretinoin directly, since I was always getting tretinoin combined with 1% clindamycin and 8% azelaic acid through Curology. I will say that I think that the Curology formulation worked a lot better for me than Differin alone, either due to tretinoin or the other active ingredients. On tretinoin/clindamycin/azelaic, I was getting only 1-2 very small pimples a month whereas I was getting 3-4 medium-sized pimples a month on Differin. That being said, I was actually pretty happy with Differin for the price and I would continue using it if it didn't stop working for me.



And now, time for a timeline with some pictures:

* [8/2015](http://i.imgur.com/LZphGAo.png) Looking back at this now, I almost feel like crying because of how awful it was.

* [9/2015](http://i.imgur.com/erAbEv4.png) Reset to a basic routine (Cetaphil cleanser + CeraVe AM/Cetaphil Cream) and started PocketDerm (now Curology) with niacinamide/clindamycin/azelaic acid formula. This worked okay for acne but I still had a new pimple or two every week and a ton of redness.

* [10/2015](http://i.imgur.com/y7wdMUk.png) Started tretinoin 0.009%/clindamycin 1%/azelaic acid 8% and this completely stopped my acne. No initial breakout/purging and I only got around 1-2 new small pimples a month. Redness still everywhere though.

* [12/2015](http://i.imgur.com/QLTRRcV.png) increased dose to 0.018%. After starting this, my skin was the best it ever felt, ever. Everything was so smooth and the only discoloration left was the dark spots from old cystic acne. I didn't notice any big improvement in terms of preventing new pimples compared to the lower dose, but pimples were already rare under the lower dose.

* 1/2016 - 1/2017 I never requested any changes to my prescription since it was working so well at keeping me clear. Over this period, my skin improved a LOT and I didn't really care to take pictures anymore because I honestly just stopped worrying about my skin. 

* 1/2017 This is around the time that Differin became available OTC. At $22/45g, it was a lot cheaper than $20/month for Curology and as a grad student I wanted to save any dollar I could. So I cancelled my Curology subscription and gradually switched from tretinoin to Differin by alternating the 2. I ran out around February.

* 2/2017 - 5/2017 Over these months I was using Differin exclusively along with a few drugstore retinol products. I definitely started getting more acne, maybe 4-8 pimples a month that were big enough as to where I would lance them and put a hydrocolloid over them when I saw them. On tretinoin, my pimples never got big enough to bother with. 

* [5/2017](http://i.imgur.com/Wk2e3O1.png) Went on vacation where I forgot my normal moisturizer (CeraVe PM), moved apartments, and started getting kind of a lot of breakouts. At least one new pimple every day, sometimes up to 4, but they are always very small. I think something broke because Differin doesn't seem like it's working for me anymore. Last week I started using COSRX BHA every other day and it seems like it's making the problem worse.

My current routine, which I have been using (with some actives) since 11/2015:

AM: Water, 10% benzoyl peroxide (Clearasil) spot treatment, CeraVe AM

PM: Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, Differin, CeraVe Cream
No actives currently

6dszvz,3,2017-05-28,"Me [20 F] with my BF [24 M] of 2.5 years, in a wonderful (on-off poly) relationship but I had a bisexual awakening and want to date women while I still can",Vaudevillain,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dszvz/me_20_f_with_my_bf_24_m_of_25_years_in_a/,"My partner J and I have been together for close to 2.5 years now. We started dating towards the end of my first year at a women's college and have been together since- he obviously didn't go to my school but a nearby one, and we met online and hit it off immediately. I've dated casually and had one six-month relationship, but it was in high school, so I consider J my first serious partner of either gender, though he's had a number of relationships before- however none as serious or long-lasting as ours.. I am bisexual, as is he, though neither of has had many forays into same-sex relationships, and are both curious.


I love him dearly. We're each other's best friends and have been for years- we support each other, make each other laugh like hell, we have a ton in common, we have fun together. Our relationship is healthy, and pretty stable, mostly because we communicate well when we run into issues and work hard to solve them. I'm fairly attracted to him, and the sex is pretty good- not mind-boggling, but I'm much more in it for who he is. However, we've had a bit of a bumpy time throughout part of the past year.


Our relationship began polyamorous, as both of us wanted to form a primary partnership but be open to dating other people. I quickly discovered that alongside focusing hard on classes and being on the rugby team, I barely had time to date my partner, let alone others. He doesn't have many good friends locally or a particularly present social circle aside from me and as such, used to date to make connections, and to feel a little bit of a 'safety net' after going through a horrible breakup right before meeting me. I tried dating and hookups occasionally but never got much off the ground, oddly not feeling super into many of the women at my college and not finding many men I was particularly interested in. We were poly for a long time, and I always sort of struggled with feeling twisty and gross inside when considering his partners and knowing he was out on dates, but desperate to somehow figure it out, to read enough literature on how to maintain a poly relationship that I could logic it away. We were very open talking about this, and while he let me know that if we wanted to be monogamous, we could be, I always turned him down, insistent that I'd find a way to make it work because it was really important to me to be able to. I didn't really feel like it was an option because he had so few friends. We didn't really explore the gamut of poly, since I was never really able to enjoy the flip side of being able to date people because I was too busy. He didn't date too often, occasionally going on dates here, hookups there, but nothing too serious or anyone he really liked, mostly passing the time. 


Ultimately, he eventually started dating a student from my college, N (who was also poly/queer, and ended up also dating one of my best friends on the rugby team at the same time- whoof) and my really struggling to be okay with it. She was very experienced with poly, and an older grad student, and I felt pretty insecure about how much more general life experience she had. I tried incredibly hard to be okay with it but felt worse and worse, often feeling so anxious I wanted to vomit when I knew they had gone on on dates, having to distract myself with work. I eventually tried to instill something closer to a DADT policy to manage my own feelings. Throughout all of this, we were talking about me feeling gross, but I maintained that I wanted to stay poly, because what if I eventually met someone? And even so, giving up because of all that irrational jealousy that I couldn't find a way to work through felt like a huge failure. 


About six months ago, I accidentally came across a horrible tidbit of info from one of L's other metamours that had not made it through to me, which is that N was HPV+. It turned out that she thought she'd told J at the beginning of them starting to date a month-ish prior, but had mentioned it so casually- i.e. ""Hi, my name is N and I have brown eyes and blonde hair and HPV""- that my boyfriend hadn't even registered what it meant. They'd slept together, and had mostly protected sex, but as someone who had gone into this with an abject terror of STIs and some preexisting serious anxiety issues regarding them after encountering firsthand how much they could destroy you through someone close to me, this was absolutely awful. I freaked out, there was a lot of stress and miscommunication, we nearly split up a couple times, it was a clusterfuck. I was scared of poly but at loathe to stop because my boyfriend didn't have a lot of friends and N was one of the only other people besides me in his life, though I'd repeatedly encouraged him to find SOME friends since it was a lot of pressure, and because I felt guilty about the prospect of asking him to end it, since I knew he'd do it. I was panicked, it was a horrible time, I didn't eat for days from the anxiety. It took us a lot of talking and working through and emergency therapy (this was all tied up in a very fun trauma reaction for me, while N's life was also falling apart at the same time... yikes.) It ended up with me finally asking him for monogamy and him agreeing- he broke up with N, and we moved forward, fucked up and confused but still wanting to make it work. Since she's dating my friends, I eventually made up with N, and while we're not super close, we're quite cordial and fine being around each other.


I was so fucked up about the possibility that I'd ended up with an STI through poly, it messed with our sex life a lot, and I wasn't comfortable with sex for months after even though we were monogamous. He was really supportive and we took it slow, and have come back to it over time. I feel comfortable with them and sex now because it's monogamous and whatever the result, we're together and have the same shit (if we have it- medical professionals told me they wouldn't give me an HPV test because I'm too young). It's taken some doing but we healed and moved forward, and are now in a decent place.


Cue the highly inopportune ~gay awakening~. 


We went forward with monogamy, but with the understanding that it was fine for me to continue to make out with members of the team( it's an odd part of the team culture but one that's quite prevalent and not incredibly serious, mostly just fun with stripping drinking games and things and reveling with being half naked and very gay and on the rugby team at a women's college, and one that he's known about and been completely fine with.) I was one of the captains this semester, and have never seriously dated anyone on the team because while many members dated each other, I thought it was important to not cause drama and to remain on good terms with everyone without making waves since I was focused on leading people. So of fucking course this is when I start being into the other women on the team- right after becoming monogamous and a captain. I'd sort of admired from afar for ages a particular girl named L, and we started feeling some really intense chemistry a few times- ending up together at the end of a night of partying a couple times, talking, realizing we were very into each other. We'd end up kissing rather a little beyond the 'spirit' of the agreement, not surrounded by drunken chanting teammates but alone at the end of the night. She spent the night in my bed once- not sex, just making out and cuddling and falling asleep drunk and half naked together- we both really wanted to but maintained that boundary set, and though we never took it farther and I kept J very in the loop about what had happened/was going on (with his permission and understanding), it flipped some kind of sapphic switch in me. 


I was unbelievably attracted to L, more so by miles than I was to J. It felt electric, and though we never had sex and she was wildly emotionally unavailable, something felt like it changed in me. I'd walk around campus and notice women, and marvel at how attracted to them I was. I knew I was bisexual but had preferred guys by a wide margin before, and this was a brand new feeling, like seeing the women around me in color after black and white for my whole life. I got distracted by girls I'd seen all year and not thought twice about and lose my train of thought marvelling at how god damn attracted to them I was, and wanting to flirt, wanting to engage with it all. Throughout all of this, I talked to J, and he understood, and we laughed about the ""gay awakening"" I never knew I missed. I'm definitely not a lesbian, I really do genuinely love men, but Lord, I'd never been into women like this before and it was beautiful and exciting and new. I also unfortunately realized that the levels of sexual/physical attraction I'd been experiencing to J were lower, sort of stagnant and I hadn't realized because I hadn't had much to compare it to. We talked about this too, and discussed working on our sex life and more of the kinds of things we were into to bring it back up after a weird, rough year. 


I considered opening up the relationship, finally feeling like I understood how poly could work. We discussed it, but it was nearing the end of the year. We talked about opening it back up to some sort of gay poly- they could explore and date men, and I could date women. This would be ideal if there were more gay men in the area for him to date, and if I wasn't so freaked out about contracting STIs that part of me wanted it and part of me was batshit terrified. We're still monogamous for the summer and it's long-distance. He's working multiple jobs, and I'm doing an internship overseas, so neither of us will have a ton of time to date anyway. But come the fall, I'm not sure what to do.


Especially because at the end of the year, J threw it out there that he wouldn't rule out moving with me to wherever I go to grad school. I work my ass off in college and plan to pursue a research PhD after graduating, and he barely graduated college after five years- struggling with depression and being a 1st gen student, and are going back to community college to try and build a marketable science degree and work towards grad school eventually as well. I worry that our careers might not be super compatible, and we've never lived together. I didn't expect him to offer that, and it's part wonderful, part scary. I really do love him, and staying with only him after the STI fiasco makes things miles easier on my anxious brain. But I'm scared of tying myself down, and of missing the opportunity to date queer women when at a very gay women's college throughout my entire time there. I don't want to have our relationship end, and me regret having gone to a damn women's college and not dated women when I really really want to. At the same time, poly crashed and burned before, and STIs are terrifying and easily transmittable, and I don't know if I can juggle poly relationships during the academic year on top of maintaining my relationship with J. I'm young, and in a place where there's more gay women than I'm ever going to encounter again. Finding queer women in the wilds of post-grad is hard, and I'm really scared I'm missing out big-time on something I'll never be able to do again. I don't know if I want to commit so long-term to J, and the prospect of my first and only boyfriend following me across the country and living with me is pretty scary. Part of what's scary is the sheer stability- I think we'll probably stay together a fair while if that happens, and and part of me doesn't want to spend all my prime dating years with my first serious boyfriend. I want some variety, to explore, but at the same time, we're really, really good together. I love him a lot, and we're so damn compatible, and J is incredibly kind, devoted, supportive of me, and understanding. 


But I keep worrying and turning over in my head what to do. I don't know if this relationship is as amazing as it seems to me because I haven't had any others to compare it to. I'm skittish about tying myself to something for a long time, even if it's a really good thing, because I'm a lot younger and have a lot less experience than he did. And I'm especially nervous about missing out on dating women when I'll still be able to find them, and worried that if I miss it now, I'll just end up dating men out of convenience for the rest of my life and never be able to explore what that part of myself is like. I worry that I'm being incredibly ungrateful for how good J's been to and for me- a very stabilizing presence for my neurotic ass. I know I've been good for them too, and we've made each other better. I don't know if this is a strong and good relationship I'd be an idiot to throw away because it's such a rare thing to find, or if it's not that rare at all and I just have no perspective on dating. I'm scared I'm getting locked down into such a serious relationship when I'm so young and never expected to. 
 
---
**tl;dr** I love him, he's amazing, we're good for each other and could work long-term, but I'm pretty young, it's my first serious relationship and I really want to date women while I'm in a place with the most queer women I'll ever encounter, and I'm worried if we try poly again it'll crash and burn. Can anyone knock some sense into my neurotic brain and tell me if I should shut up and be grateful for a good relationship, or to let it go and explore while I still can, and what to do? "

6dtoip,5,2017-05-28,I'm (M26) still having trust issues after 3 years with gf (F25) who didn't break up with her ex after we were together,freakfingers12,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dtoip/im_m26_still_having_trust_issues_after_3_years/,"My trust issues didn't develop until further down the road. Here's my story with my girlfriend of 3 years and how I've learned that I have a problem. Bare with me it's quite a lengthy story.

When we first met, our relationship took off really quick. We were studying but we only first met at our internship company. So after 3 months we were supposed to fly off overseas back to our studies. We started within the first month at the company. Everything was like a summer love, breezy and nice. We said the ""I love you"" words and planned to contact each other after separation. Then one day, towards the end of the internship, together with a bunch of our friends ready to celebrate, I saw a text on her phone that changed my life. The text says ""Hey baby, I'm heading to ma's home now."" But it wasn't from me obviously, I was just holding her purse when it rang and I thought it was her sister looking for her. So I kept quiet and dull the whole evening. That evening, I never forget because I so wanted to get back at her for this. 

I waited and waited and waited. Then, I asked her, politely. Who the fuck was that. She told me it was her boyfriend back at University, but they only got together because her mother wanted her to. (Insert questions here) I blanked... 

Okay, then what do you plan to do from now on? I asked. She said, I will break up with him, he's only who my mother wanted me to be with, I have no feeling for him, we barely did anything and we just held hands. 

Okay... (Still processing, should I dump her or trust her). I took the chance to trust her. Of course it ended with I love you and I promise. Then, I gave her an ultimatum to break up with the guy or else... Hmm, or else, I also have no idea what to do in this case, I'm not going to freaking kill the guy. 

When we were back in our own universities, she told me the difficult part with breaking up with the guy was because she might hurt her mother. I said politely again, I don't care. After weeks or maybe a month, she broke up with the guy, but still sits his car to class everyday. I put another ultimatum to cut contact with this guy because 1. I'm not comfortable with my gf being with her ex all the time while I'm far away alone, 2. Her ex bf will reply my texts and ask me to go away. 

For 1 whole year, I trusted this girl and we graduated, and she still hang out and had class projects together. For 1 freaking year I put up with it. After graduation, I asked her how long have u been together with this ex bf. She told me 2 years since before she knew me. And you haven't done anything with him other than holding hands? I asked quite angrily this time. I needed to know the truth, the whole truth whether I liked it or not. 

1. She was only together with this ex bf for the sake of her mother's request? 
2. For 2 years they've been together and all they've done is holding hands? I've seen her Facebook pictures cuddling and hugging. 
And;
3. I had also caught her off guard saying that it was difficult for her to break up with the ex bf not because of making her mother sad. It was all a bullshit 3 years ago. 

Until today, I have been having quarrels with her about this matter. I asked to break up many times (probably 5-6 times) but it ended up with her wanting to suicide. I now have trust issues whenever I find something relatable to this ancient story 3 years ago. I feel like I'm digging out silly quarrels. But I can't help it. The good times with this girlfriend really seems normal, everything is loving and warm. Only that I sometimes have a sudden clarity of not wanting to believe this girl... 

TLDR; girlfriend of 3 years used to have a boyfriend at the same time when we started, the ex boyfriend was interfering with our relationship for about 3 to 5 months before she finally ended it with him. Now, I'm still constantly having trust issues with this girl and I do not know how to solve this. "

On Monday we were fine, on Wednesday, we were fine. I text her for a call before going to bed, she doesn't want to talk anymore, she was ""speaking to her parents"" an hour later, she's on the phone with one of her friends.

Later that night, she starts wanting distance to ""think about us"". I can't deal with not being with her. We've been friends for 5 years now, dating for 2. She was the perfect match, or so I thought.

I'm slowly losing my mind. Thursday morning, I text her asking to see her as we had already planned. She first agrees, then changes her mind. Later that night, she tells me we need to talk. She thinks she made up her mind, but doesn't want to let go of us. I just lose it. I've never cried so much in my life.

I end up forcing her to call me, since she had already given me the news that we were going to break up, so I just want to end it as soon as possible.

She calls me, tells me it isn't working for her anymore, and that we should move on.

How can I move on. She was my first serious girlfriend, she was my first sex partner. We were planning a future together. I was planning on surprising her at her graduation on Tuesday.
I wanted to propose to her. She was the best match for me, and now it's over.

I can't tell how I'm feeling right now. I've been crying almost non stop since, I'm barely eating, I'm barely sleeping... I feel like I'm going to lose my internship. I'm losing my mind and I can't let go of her. I don't want to let go of her, this all feels too unreal to be happening to me right now. Everything was fine. It's just ""not working anymore""...
I've been texting her every day just because I can't help it, she got me through the hardest semester of my life (Almost got in shit for a teammate plagiarizing on a project, a bunch of family problems). We dealt with it, we went through it...

How can she just give up like that. We were happy, she was happy. Just Monday she was as bubbly as can be, and so was I until family problem strikes. Same thing on Wednesday, another family problem.

The family problems are almost over, I won't have to deal with them much longer (it's about my dead grandfather's will)... It's almost over, I'm going to be fine family wise... I don't know how I'm going to get through life without her...

How do I move on, when she's all I want...

6durdi,2,2017-05-28,"Starting a new life, is it possible, worth it, or plan B?",Kschl,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6durdi/starting_a_new_life_is_it_possible_worth_it_or/,"So I'm starting a new life and I think I may have under-planned and underestimated my situation.

First, Age: 23 

Degree: BA in psychology
 
Revelant experience: none (no internships or anything mostly costumer service jobs) 

Income: 0/month at the moment 

Debts: school loans of 35k ($400/month) 

Credit: 720+ for almost four years average but don't looking in taking any loans or credit.  

Married. (Wife: literature degree) - experience: costumer service jobs only.

So previously me and my wife were living at my parents house (Florida) with our only expenses being food, gas, and gym. One can only endure that situation so long (my wife) so we decided to try and start a new life in South California despite the high costs of living and etc. I have a friend here who is willing to get an apartment together and he alone qualified for the whole apartment alone but can't afford to pay it all by himself since I have no income yet, but we haven't signed the lease yet. It's pretty far from the city. I say this because there are almost no jobs only labor jobs so I'd have to commute 60-80 minutes a day and adding all that wear to the car (that I'm borrowing from a friend haven't paid yet.) Wife has no driver's license, needs to take driving exam. She's willing to work at a cafe and walk to work since there a nearby area to the would be future apartment but pay would be $10-11/hr most likely part time as full time isn't guaranteed. She's actually been called to interview for $12/hr full time jobs but in LA and that's 2-3 hours by car with traffic, and without a drivers license even living in the city she would need to drive or me to drive her around everywhere.) I also would like to start saving for retirement soon if possible of course.

This is what we estimate to be paying:

Rent: 1,110 (planning on getting an additional roommate which would lower it to 850 but until then this is what we would have to pay.) 

Car insurance: $150? (just me) 

Gas: $250 (long commutes) 

Food: $200-300 month (what we used to pay) 

Gym: $20 

Utilities: $150/month ( three bedroom apartment split two ways is this accurate?) 

Car maintenance: $100/month (long commutes = wear and tear) 

Student loans: $430/month

Credit card: $0 debt 

Cell Phone: $25/month


Wife doesn't have health insurance so I'm accounting for the penalty at the end of the year for no having health insurance if not we're looking to pay $200-300 more a month. (Wife is from foreign country which is why she has no health insurance or drivers license, I'm covered by my parents until 26 years old.)

65/month for the penalty at tax time.

Total: Depending on prices it can be as high as $2,600/month?

My second thoughts are this is too high, and without any marketable skills I'm looking to make $12-15/hr.

Currently we are living with Airbnb hosts and it comes out to around $250/week + $50/week for food using our combined savings of $8k.

So my fear is am I looking for work full time and scraping by? First months rent including the deposit and the car I need would cost around $4500 not including the extra fees, I'm also yet to get a CA Drives license since I have no proof or residency in the state.

So with my math I'm looking at being negative and eat into my savings at least until I move up somewhere and get better skills which is something I can't depend on happening, same goes for my wife.

So am I in over my head? Would it be prudent to sign the lease or to abandon the idea before I'm legally committed.

Other plan would be to move somewhere cheaper? But my wife isn't to fond of anything that isn't downtown because she sees anything outside the city as the countryside haha and she's used to taking trains and buses to get around. 

We can also go to her country (Japan) where I'd make the same as I would now probably teaching English (not required to pay taxes for two years) at first and she can get an office job, and then we'd have transportation taken care of. I can speak the language and have lived there before without a job just studying self funded for two years with just 3k so I can estimate how much my expenses would be. We also talked about when we want kids we want them to be born in Japan due to birth and insurance being considerably cheaper than the US.

So what would be the best move here?"

6dv8ac,1,2017-05-28,Should I change schools jump from Aerospace Engineering to becoming a technologist due to my GPA?,supernintendan64,UBreddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBreddit/comments/6dv8ac/should_i_change_schools_jump_from_aerospace/,"It's a bit of a read but I needs some advice...
So I'm in a bit of a stressful decision that needs to be made soon. I'm currently an Aerospace Engineering student at the University at Buffalo. My first year went pretty well however things went downhill my 3rd semester with my semester technical GPA sinking from a 3.0 into a 1.8... I was put on academic warning which is just a step away from academic probation which would servery limit what I can do in the university and rule out most possibilities to transferring. I've wanted to be an aerospace engineer for over a decade since I was young (i'm currently 19). The problem is that if my GPA goes any lower I run the possibility of getting kicked out of the school of engineering and end up having to go somewhere else. My backup plan was to transfer out of UB and head over to Buffalo State which is a smaller less renowned school to do Mechanical Engineering Technology and become a technologist. While this is a bit of a let down it feels like its a safer path to take with less risks of loosing a lot. There are some perks to doing this switch. The major advantage is since the rigor or Buffalo State is less then UB, my current school, I would actually be a bit ahead with some junior classes already completed since I had to do them in my sophomore yeah at UB. Also the amount of credits required for a technologist degree is 120 while the aerospace engineering degree required 134! and they expect students to do this in 4 years. Since Buffalo State would only require 120 credits to graduate with the technologist degree I could theoretically work part time and try to get some work experience in the industry as an intern which I feel is vital for job interviews. It also seems that at this point to get my Aerospace Engineering degree at UB would take 5 years since I had to retake classes but at Buffalo State I could still finish in 4 years and spend that 5th year working on an MBA. Buffalo State is only 20 minutes from UB so I would be loosing my friends which is good.


So that's my story so what I'm curious to hear is what you guys would do in a situation like this. I've given this a lot of thought but it would be nice to hear what other engineers think.


Would you change schools/major to clear a bad GPA to help with getting an internship and have more time to work in an internship and possibly be a little happier and less stressed?


Thanks for your time in reading this. I really appreciate it"

Just started an internship at a fortune 500 company this summer (yay!). Dress-code is business casual to casual (it's a tech company). Pretty much have most of that covered up until my feet (I'm a product of r/sneakers). I have a pair of dark brown brogues from Cole Haan, but I was looking for something a bit more versatile that I could slip-on. Something like the [Tommy Bahama Felton Nubuck Slip-On Shoes](http://www.tommybahama.com/en/Felton-Nubuck-Slip-On-Shoes/p/TB7S00049-282) really caught my eye. However, after researching this subreddit and seeing all the negative feedback on TB + the $225 price tag, I think it's probably best I stay away from TB unless they go on sale.


So my question is, does anyone know of any similar slip-on shoes that could be dressed up/down? I really like the TBs I linked above, but the $225 price tag is kind of out of reach (and apparently not very good quality). If not, I guess I can always go with the [Bass Weejuns](https://www.ghbass.com/product/larson+weejuns.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;from=fn&amp;selectedOption=205043). But I really like the perforated upper of the TB. Feels like it's slightly more appropriate for what I'm looking for, especially for the summer. Thanks guys!"

I am a junior finance and Information System major with no internship this summer. I lost track of time my junior semester is couldn't land an internship this semester and only have 3 semesters (year and a half) left of college. As most of you know, getting an internship is a key role in landing a good career for business majors. Many of my friends start there internship soon with great companies and I am left wondering how I can efficiently spend my summer. I just applied to a lot of leftover internships in hope that one would offer me a position. At this point, I doubt that there is much options left for me. What is the best thing to do that puts me in my best position for the following semester so that companies don't think I took the summer off to do nothing? I can try to ask my former boss at a start-up I interned for last year and see if he has a position he can offer me but I don't know how likely he would say yes and I doubt its going to be related to my major. I am currently living in the DC Maryland Virginia area."
6dx77r,7,2017-05-28,"Me [22m] with my ex-GF [23F] of 1 year, I've hooked up with her twice after she came back from her overseas internship where she had cheated on me. I kinda want to continue the casual hookups, is this a totally stupid idea?",turksan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dx77r/me_22m_with_my_exgf_23f_of_1_year_ive_hooked_up/,"the title pretty much says it all. We dated for a year, and she went to Australia for an internship for 4 months. After about three months she admitted to having cheated on me once with one of her co-workers, although since then some mutual friends have suggested it was a couple more times. I broke up with her and cut contact with her. That happened a month ago. One week ago, she returned back to our city and as my miserable luck would have it, she went to the same bar as me. I avoided her as best I could but as I was leaving the bar for another, by myself, she and I crossed paths. I felt like something had to be said because we were waiting at the same cross walk.

So I said hello and we started talking and then arguing, and I should have just turned around and gone back to my friends at the bar but instead we took a turn to a quieter street and we proceeded to argue and yell and fight. I called her every name in the book and she kept saying sorry but was upset I just ghosted her after I found out. Anyway, we were drunk and getting in each other's faces and the next thing I knew we were kissing passionately. I know everyone will say this is dumb of me but just understand this was actually the first time I had seen her in months and although I despise what she did I think I'm still very attracted to her on a physical level. So anyway we ended up back at my place and had insane sex, yadyadyada and I woke up in the morning with her on the other side of the bed and I just felt kinda dirty about it but it also felt like it was a good thing, like closure.

So fast forward to a couple nights ago, five days after the first interaction. I had just gotten home from a night shift, about 12 PM
And as I was sitting down to a beer she called my phone. Keep in mind I had blocked her initially but had unblocked her after our hookup to arrange for a pickup of some items from her place. Anyway, I answered and she said she wanted to talk about the other night and to formally apologize for everything. Me being stupid, I not only answered it but said sure come on over. Well she came over and she sure apologized, although it meant nothing to me. But to be honest she was looking good (I think she had been out with her friends) and so I kinda just grabbed her by the hips and sure enough we were at it again. Afterword I just passed out and said she could stay or go. She chose to stay and slept on my side but we didn't cuddle or anything. We had sex again in the morning then she left. 

So that's how things have gone. I despise her for cheating on me and hiding it for as long as she did. She asked me if I loved her still and I said of course not, and it wasn't even hard to say that. So what I want to really know is, could I get by with having a purely sexual, once a week type of thing with my ex until I get tired of it?  And more importantly, should I? Not to brag or anything but my ex is gorgeous and we have great sexual chemistry. I want nothing more than a FWB type of situation but recognize that I'm playing a dangerous game as far as feelings go. Ive hooked up with other girls since the breakup but I just don't really have the same chemistry with them. She also quite possibly wants to win me back so these past two hookups were nothing short of great.

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: My ex cheated on me while she was working abroad. I broke up with her. A few weeks later, I saw her at a bar for the first time since she went overseas and after some arguing we somehow ended up hooking up. About a week later we hooked up again, and I kind of initiated it. I don't feel any feelings of love or whatever for her anymore, I just like the sex. Any advice on if I should continue it for a while or should I be kicking myself and getting as far from her as possible?"

When I was 14, my father passed away, and I went through a short time of rebellion. I was arrested around that time for domestic violence. She had my phone, and I snatched it from her, she called the police, they arrested me on domestic violence. Shortly after, I was baker acted for having a meltdown over not being able to go to a concert with my friends, throwing a chair to the floor, and saying ""I wish I was dead,"" (angsty teenaged moment, honestly). Mom called police, I was again ""arrested"" and baker acted (involuntarily placed in a psychiatric hospital for 72 hours - which was terrifying). 

This all happened about 6-7 years ago now, and I haven't been in trouble since. The only thing on my adult record is a warning for tint. No traffic infractions or any arrests. I'm not sure if I was ever charged, and I know a lot of the police report was very embellished (even my mom had said so, she called the police because she herself was going through a difficult time, and didn't know how to handle me - it was the recommendation of her therapist). I was put on ""probation,"" but it was never truly ""probation,"" as there were no check-ups, drug tests, or monitoring. 

My main goal is to apply to be a game warden, but I'm also open to being an officer in any local county. I'm already planning on being 100% honest, there's no reason for me to lie. 

How greatly will this affect my chances of landing a job in law enforcement?

6dxuu1,0,2017-05-28,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6dxuu1/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
6dygls,8,2017-05-29,My [25F] boyfriend [27M] asked if I wanted him to stop seeing the dog he got with his ex [27F].,topupornottopup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6dygls/my_25f_boyfriend_27m_asked_if_i_wanted_him_to/,"Hey, Reddit. A bit of backstory: I’ve been seeing “Tim” for 4 months now, and we’ve been officially together for 3. I was never much of a relationship person but this guy… Ugh. I’m pretty sure that, if not the one, he’s very close to being -it-. I can definitely see us being together for a long, long time.

Now, about his ex and their dog. They were high school sweethearts, together for 9 years. Last August she moved cities to be with Tim in his apartment and they got a dog together right away (according to him it was her decision to get it in the first place). Long story short, things didn’t work out and he broke up with her and asked her to move out just 4 months later, in November. They remain friendly, but talk less and less each day.

  ---   

According to him, especially in the beginning, he used to have the dog around all the time. Either cause his ex asked for it as a favor or cause he asked to hang out with the pup. But during the 4 months we saw each other he had the dog over just twice. Once on the first days we started dating around and once sometime in our first month together, during a weekend I was over at his. 

Since we started seeing each other we’ve been pretty much inseparable, especially on weekends, it would always be either me or him at each other places or us travelling somewhere together. The excessive closeness is mainly due to the fact that our relationship will become long distance for 3 or 6 months in July, so we wanted to reaaaally enjoy all available time together before then. So during that time there wasn’t much space for the dog in our routine, even tho his ex asked at least three other times for him to have the dog over, he said no cause really we wouldn’t be at his place at the periods. 

Now that I’m close to going away overseas for an internship, he brought the subject up, cause he hasn’t seen the dog for a while and now he would start having time to do so. According to him it was very hard to be away from the dog in the beginning, but now, 4 months barely seeing her, it doesn’t feel as bad, cause he was basically 4 months with the dog and 4 months without. He cares about the dog and feels responsible for it somehow, even tho he doesn’t consider it -his- dog anymore. He says that, if he is to have the dog over, it’s just because he thinks the dog will be happy to see him, nothing to do with doing favour to his ex or anything. So it was important for him to know my opinion on the subject.

So. Here I am. I friggin love dogs and feel bad for potentially being the one depriving the cute thing from having contact with Tim. And I feel like an evil controlling girlfriend being the reason he stops seeing his dog, even tho he tells me he completely understands if I don’t feel comfortable with the situation. At the same time I don’t like the idea of him having an important reason to have a (super long term) connection with his ex. And I also don’t like the idea of them meeting up while I’m away. 
  
  ---   

  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend asked if I’d like him to stop seeing the pup he got with his super long term ex-girlfriend. I feel uncomfortable being the reason for him to be pup-less, but I’m also uncomfortable with him having such connection with his ex. What do I doooo?"

•	Why would parents be in the early stories, but later retract them from the stories? 

•	Discuss possible scenarios such as getting fake parents who need organs for their child to receive the organs from Seth Rich.  

•	Bob Creamer is at the WH on July 6th w/ Joe Capone and on the 12th, and 15th.

•	Police need to put out the death certificates or publish autopsy. 

**217.17**

•	Seth Rich was trying to prove Hillary was moving money from “Berniecrats to Hillacrats.”

•	Hillary on the 7th had the NGP data wiped out in anticipation of the Rich murder and moved it to the Clinton Foundation. 

•	May 25th and around June 7th or 8th Podesta needed about a week to figure out how to cover this with the coming Wikileaks so they came forward with their own hacker and named him Guccifer 2.0 (1.0 was the Sony hacks). This way we can muddy the waters with the hack vs leak semantics. Then you must hack congress (the DCC leaks) to threaten them and get them in front of the camera blaming Russia. Guccifer 2.0 also says he hacked DCC so it covers the Awan brothers that actually hacked them. Guccifer 2.0 serves a dual purpose for the DNC (Seth Rich) leak and DCC (Awan brothers) leak cover. This also explains why Republican congress is ignored and only the democratic congress was hacked.

**217.18**

•	Finished Rod Wheeler interview. Will be viewable in soon after it is cleared with his attorney.

•	Talks about reports on the 2 killed in South Carolina. Kill-the-killer goes back the Arkansas days of Clintons.

I wonder if anyone would have some experience in the MSc Economics at UCL to give me some advice.

I have a double background in Engineering (BSc)/Statistics (MSc) and have been doing the transition to Economics in the past couple of years, through online courses, reading and and internship and my goal is to do a PhD, preferably in a good UK University. 

My main area of interest is quantitative analysis of development issues. I have a very solid math/stats background with some considerable experience in Econometrics.

I was accepted to the MSc program at the UCL and I wonder if anyone could give some input on the level of difficulty of the program for someone who comes from a different (and heavily mathematical) background. Is it doable? What are the main difficulties students usually encounter?

The doubt arises because I also have an offer to the Two-Year program at LSE (although I applied for the one-year) and I am having a hard time deciding between the two.

Thanks!"
6dz5e4,2,2017-05-29,"[Support] Feeling Stuck, Anxious and Conflicted. Defending myself against Mother.",NanabPizza,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6dz5e4/support_feeling_stuck_anxious_and_conflicted/,"Hello, everyone. A friend of mine referred me to this subreddit a few days ago. I checked out several posts around here before gathering up the courage to make my own. I hope this will not come off as sloppy. As of this moment, it is the middle of the night, and I feel very anxious with thoughts about my family swimming through my mind that i'm incredibly tempted to type it all out now while I still have the motivation to do so.

A little bit of background about myself: I am a 22-year-old male who recently graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. I have been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at an early age, primarily a social disability that I have been carrying with me for my entire life and have made great strides in managing it to function amongst the real world. I also found out that I struggle with anxiety, though I am unsure of how severe it may be. I struggle a lot with social interactions outside of my family even to this day, and I don't have many people that I feel comfortable with venting to, since I have very specific needs and demands for people that I approach, which in turn is one of the many things that makes me wonder whether or not I can properly function amongst everyone else.

I've grown up in a pretty controlling family, primarily with my mother. I don't know whether or not she's a narcissist by definition, but reading several stories and posts on this subreddit has made me make a few connections to the behaviors of other Nrents to my own mother. My mom had a real rough childhood, being raised in a very different culture where she was forced to work and survive at a pretty young age in a developing country. She eventually immigrated to America with my dad in her early thirties, and was essentially forced to adapt to the new lifestyle by herself, all the while raising several children along the way, me being one of them. She eventually learned a few ropes and bounds of being in the US, eventually got her Master's degree, and is currently running her own nonprofit organization by herself.

And she constantly judges and evaluates all of us to her standards, despite us not being her, and for me, not being born and raised in the culture that she was in. There are a *myriad* of examples I could bring up going all the way back to my childhood all the way to me being in adulthood, but I'm afraid i'd derail my post if I keep digressing like I do, so I will keep it recent.

My mom *loves* to compare herself to her children whenever we have an issue that may or may not revolve around her, even down to the simple concept of feeling tired. I cannot speak for everyone who has Asperger's syndrome, but I know for myself that I have increased sensitivity to everything around me, whether it be sounds, touch, or taste, among others. I also know that the art of physical conversations can be very physically taxing for me since I have to actively think about what I have to say or how to say it, and a myriad of things can get lost in translation when I try to speak. Both of these factors leave me using more energy than the average person would, tiring me out more easily, and requiring me to rest and relax longer than average if I am allowed it. I do my best to keep a straight face or to tough it out whenever I can, but a concept such as fatigue is apparently foreign to my mother, since she laughs that a 22-year-old like me can be tired compared to someone who is in her fifties who is pulling the entire house around, and accusing me of making up excuses for attention, when I am simply trying to justify why I feel this way towards her. This has also been going on for a while.

On a related note, I have had a very busy past few months, where I recently graduated, but I was not allowed to pause anything on my end to take a break. I had to contend with us as a family moving to another neighborhood (the move taking months to complete) along with being active in an internship I currently have, along with dealing with food poisoning for one week and having one of my wisdom tooth removed for another week. I could go into a fair share of details on each of them, but I will summarize that all of these events have left me physically and mentally alert as all of it was going on, and I was unable to truly rest and digest until it all ended about a few weeks ago. It left me real fatigued as well, and I spent several days inside of our new house to recharge from being outside more often than not. When my mom confronted me about my relaxation, she accused me of being lazy, and guilt tripping me that there are people out there who are having it much worse than I am, and that I need to find a job to keep myself out of the house, refusing to hear my side of the story and why resting is important for me. That was also ignoring the fact that I would eventually find part-time work, but feel that I need to rest to gather up the motivation and energy to go back outside and search when I am in a better state, physically and mentally. She decided to ignore that because I looked fine on the surface, and decided to put me down and guilt trip me with very little regard to how I feel.

Adding onto that, I also have an older sister who recently graduated with her Master's Degree, and is further along with her life than I am. My mom also *loves* to compare her to me, saying how she's successful and I need to be more like my sister if I even want to stand a slight chance in the outside world. My problem with that is that my sister is the type of person who likes to take on everything and anything all at once, which got her sick a few times at her own admittance, and me trying to go at her pace would be overstimulating for me and I would crash and burn much harder than she would. My mom also seems to take my sister getting her Master's as a way to subtly invalidate me getting my Bachelor's, since i'm not as advanced as she is, even though i'm at a point where I do not know what to do, despite me working hard at working towards my degree mostly by myself (aside from finances, which I am deeply grateful for). Despite her intentions, my mother is *not* helping things by telling me what i'm doing wrong, and *not* telling me how I can go along with things with what I currently have. She has conditioned me to avoid her or try not to confront her, because talking with her feels incredibly one-sided. She is always ready to complain about something or someone, or to put me or anyone else down if we even breathe the wrong way.

I am unsure whether or not I am overreacting to all of it, but her words do hurt, and she does not seem to care that her words hurt, constantly insisting that i'm denying the ""truth"" if I try to speak up to her being hurtful towards me, or saying that I have a problem that I need to figure out, or that something is my fault, even if I am FULLY aware that it is my fault rubbing it in will not help with that, no matter how ""truthful"" it may be.

My mom also has a bad habit on asking me to do extensive things, such as heavy lifting or cleaning the house with very little warning, regardless on whether or not I feel tired, or if I am in the middle of something that needs to be finished. When I try to respond back to her, she starts to call me selfish and inconsiderate for not helping out my poor mommy and that I won't get a good wife or girlfriend with my kind of attitude, apparently. She also hopes that I do find a bad girlfriend and the like to ""punish"" and ""teach"" me what it'd be like to not have her around. I would honestly prefer a ""bad"" girlfriend over her, as long as they don't constantly feel entitled to bring themselves up, as if I owe them for giving birth to me. Excuse me, I didn't ask to be born, you brought me into this world by your own choice. Why do I have to pay back a never-ending debt that I have no say in? The emotional manipulation eventually sets in, and I help out my mother, all the while feeling resentful for her being unreasonable and making me doubt my own capabilities once more.

I tried talking to my other family members about my mother, and only a handful of them agree on her behavior to an extent; my oldest sister agrees that my mom is unreasonable, but pins a chunk of the blame on me for being so negative and constantly in my own mind, and asks me to be more proactive, even if I am doing all that I can to help out my mother when the time calls for it. Apparently I have to help out even when things do not call for it, and I have to magically read my mother's mind to even try to appease her. My dad seems to understand my introversion, among many of my other personal matters that I bring up, but he mostly dons a ""hands-off"" approach to family matters. He was raised to not be very outwardly emotional, and I think the abuse he's endured from my mom over the years has left him tired and disillusioned.

My mom refuses to go to therapy and the like since she has tried it several times with my dad, in terms of couples therapy, and has not found anything satisfactory, discontinuing it all. She distrusts the words of many experts and decides to go for her own truths, even if they are factually incorrect. She acts like she is *never* wrong, even in the face of contradictory evidence. She will do all she can to put others down if the need calls for it. If there is one thing I really hate about my mother, it is her hubris. Touting how she's done so many things that we are unable to and acting very *proud* of that fact. She is also very unsympathetic, along with the majority of my family members with her. I am usually the butt of many of my family jokes, mainly stemming from the sound of my voice, or my inflections, or how I move from time to time. I am forced to laugh along with them, because if I do not react to a joke too well, they'll accuse me of being ""oversensitive"" or that I made fun of *them* for calling them out on their poor tastes in humor. Double-standard much?

A lot of what I have mentioned has made me very anxious. I am convinced that my mother is a big part of why I struggle with anxiety, whether it be socially or in general. However, when I try to bring that up to her, she would say that *I* am the problem that needs to be fixed more often than not, and that I try to use her as a scapegoat to cover up my own insecurities and inadequacies. While I will not completely disagree with the notions she has mention, she has refused to take responsibility for her own actions and how it has affected her children. Not once has she apologized for hurting us or put us to tears.Whenever she tries to comfort us when we are very down and vulnerable, more often than not it is very backhanded and sarcastic, cooing us and calling us little babies for crying, for example.

I don't have many people I can talk to as outlets to relate and vent to with my problems, so i'm forced to internalize these issues and pacify myself, which I hate doing because I am naturally a transparent person with very little to hide, yet I am so afraid of opening up to the outside world since I know it can be very cruel and vindictive. I am not sure how much of it is my own intuition or how much of it is my mother's own talk, but I feel I need to share it. I know my mom has had things very rough, and I will never forget her struggles. I wished that she did not have to take it out on her children and leave them with their own scars to heal, while touting that her scars are more important than ours.

I really hope I came across coherently. I have had a myriad of thoughts and feelings that I dumped all at once, and I suppose I want another outlet to try to hastily assure myself that I am not crazy for thinking all of these things. I don't know if I made my mom look worse than she actually is from typing all of this, but this is how I feel, and I'm sick of dealing with her nagging and emotional abuse almost every single day. We changed for her, but she refuses to change for everyone else. I wish I can move out of the house, but I know that will take some time since I do not have a stable income as of yet, and I am already struggling to find a good job as is, along with being aware of my own personal health and accommodating it all the best I can. I know I am not perfect, but I have come a very long way ever since I was diagnosed, and I do not feel like my mother acknowledges my own personal struggles that I still deal with to this day.

I apologize for rambling, or if this comes off as a bit disjointed. If you all managed to read this far, then I thank you and I hope you understand where i'm coming from."
6dzlnv,1,2017-05-29,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6dzlnv/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I am doing a CS graduate degree but every time we've had to design an ad or an ad campaign in class I felt genuinely excited and I did really good too. 

That's why I am kinda considering that career path, or at least for an internship to see what it's like. I'd be more of a brainstorming/writer/designer kind of person than actually making it come to life.

6e0oam,69,2017-05-29,The drunk cold email that changed my life.,jonbuchan,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/6e0oam/the_drunk_cold_email_that_changed_my_life/,"Hey folks,
 
My story: A good few years ago, I was desperate for sales after my word of mouth work dried up.
 
I got hellishly drunk one night and wrote a completely absurd cold email. I was still tipsy the next morning and decided it was still a good idea to send it to pretty senior Marketing Directors at big brands.
 
To my astonishment, it worked. I can't attach images to this post but I got the most amazing complimentary responses and requests for calls/meetings.
 
My favourite one succinctly said ""My colleague forwarded me your spam email and we would like to meet you to discuss opportunities.""
 
I’ve met with senior decision makers at RedBull, Pepsi, Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, HSBC, Barclays and countless other global brands, exciting start-ups and regular ol’ SMEs.
 
I’ve used this same style to get senior editors at large publications to respond to me and publish my clients content. I’ve used it to help people get as many job interviews as they want - and to meet people I really look up to. I’ve recently used it to get booked on some podcasts too.
 
If you’d like to be able to write cold emails, or direct mail that cut-through the noise and get responses like these, have a read… If you find it useful or have any questions, do comment below.
 
You can see the copy here: https://twitter.com/SallyB_W/status/740110981922197504. This is it in letter form. I wanted to increase my open rates so started sending it in the post, and then following up with an email. The subject line said “Sorry for the ferret in the post”. It worked. Open rates &gt; 80%.
 
I'm not saying my way is the ONLY way - but it works for me :)
 
OK - here goes nothing…
 
[MAKING IMPACT]

- Impact -&gt; Communication -&gt; Persuasion
 
So many cold approaches such because they go straight to persuasion.
The very first line starts with something like … “We’re the best people in the world at X… We’ve worked with X client and are ground-breaking X technology is a world’s first…”
YUCK! Of course, that gets deleted!
Your job is to sell the idea that a call or meeting with you is not a bad idea. Not to give every little detail – or to sell your entire offering in one go. Those steps come later…
Dave Trott talks about this when talking about effective advertising.
He brings it down to a level anyone can understand.
Imagine for a moment that you wanted your other half to make you a cup of tea or coffee.
You need first make impact.
“CATH!”
That gets her attention.
The communication is next…
“Cath, will you make me a cup of tea?”
However, that’s not very persuasive.
“If you make me a cup of tea, I’ll take the trash out.”
The same rule applies to direct mail or cold email or any form of effective advertising.
You need to make impact first.
Then communicate.
Then persuade.
You need to stand out.
Your prospect likely gets a ton of other letters and emails (and cold calls) – and they all look and read the same.
You need to make IMPACT.
It’s the single most important thing you should focus on.
Without that, it doesn’t matter how good your communication is. It doesn’t matter how persuasive you are. It doesn’t matter how good your product or service is.
Most people think persuasion is the most important.
They focus on using specific words and formulas and forget you're writing to a human.
You're not trying to beat a machine at chess.
You need to get a reaction. A bite. A nod. A smile. A laugh.
You need people to actually see and read and listen before you can communicate and persuade.
Being able to get cut-through - especially if it's done in a unique or clever way - is persuasive in itself.
Think about that.
 
[The Warren Buffett Technique]

- Unusual honesty. Credibility.
 
People get so much crap in their email and in the post. You need to make your prospect switch gears.
We can learn something here from Warren Buffett. In his stock presentations, he starts with bad news.
Why would he do such a thing?
a) He gets the bad news out the way. b) It’s the honest and correct thing to do. c) Everything else he has to say has more credibility.
How can you do the do this in your cold approaches?
 
[Five Things People Get Wrong When Cold Approaching]

- DISARMING CANDOUR
 
What most people get wrong… and what all of my successful approaches have in common.
 
Here is a list of 5 common things people get wrong with cold approaches...
They are full of ego
They try to impress with design or persuade with jargon
The rhythm and cadence are bland and boring
They make presumptions - This is common with ‘problem-solving’ type emails
They play it safe! (This is huge!)
 
You need to write captivating copy. From the subject line to the last line.
 
All of my successful approaches - from the absurd to the serious - have one thing in common.
 
They tell a story.
 
This is going to sound like pretentious fluff... but there is truth in here.
 
Why is a story important?
 
Think about it.
 
When did you last hear someone say “I saw a great PowerPoint presentation the other day""?
 
When did you last hear someone say “S/he told a great story""?
 
Do you have a compelling story that your prospect can be part of?
 
Or are you just going to write them a boring advertisement?
 
Are you writing as if you are speaking to one person individually?
 
Or are you rehashing key statistics, industry trends, and speaking in bullshit jargon?
 
One is compelling and interesting and entertaining.
 
The other is dull and boring and what everyone else is doing.
 
One of my key ‘stories’ I call “The Ambitious Underdog”.
 
What’s your story?
 
Are you writing something that your prospect can read and understand where you are coming from?
 
Will they want to be part of that story?
 
Will this break through the ‘us and them’ dynamic that normal sales emails reinforce?
 
Or will it raise the ""sales alarm bells""?
 
A big part of this is making your intentions known.
 
It’s about pushing your ego aside.
 
It’s about taking a chance.
 
Sometimes this means using humour.
 
Sometimes this means letting your guard down and being more honest than is normal and expected.
 
[BREAKING NEWS!] 

- PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE!

Ok - a little bit on mindset…
 
I never had an issue with writing to serious and important and busy business people in an informal way.
 
I have the opposite problem. I can't write with jargon. I can't hard-sell. I can't do the 'serious and professional' thing. At least, I find this more difficult.
 
It hasn't been to my detriment.
 
Of course, you can't be completely off the wall bonkers if it doesn't match your personality and yes - there are circumstances where you may have to take a more serious tone.
 
But when everyone writes in the same cadence, you need to stand out.
 
Be daring. Try something different. You need to illicit a response. Make your prospect smile, or laugh or go ""That's clever""... or even ""This person is different...""
 
It doesn't matter whether someone is a CEO of a global brand or an intern at a start-up - they are all HUMAN! Dun dunn dunnn!!!
 
So don't put them on a pedestal.
 
Show some personality.
 
What's the worst that could happen?
 
They ignore your message?
 
That's likely to happen anyway!
 
BUTTT Maybe they will send an angry/mean response?!
 
You're sending a cold email... you're interrupting their day! That could happen anyway too!
 
So you may as well take a chance…
 
By being distinct - you're going to get far more positive responses than blending in and being boring!
 
Whenever you get this particular fear, remember... ""PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE!""
 
Ok. I hope that wasn’t too painful. I hope this post has got you thinking…
 
Please fire any questions, concerns or weirdly personal insults below.
 
Stay outta trouble,

Jon

I currently own a MacBook Air. I am planning on using Adobe Captive as well as Articulate. In addition, I use the Adobe creative Suite. So as of I'm running out of space and I have not made projects yet. 

My laptop has 8GB Ram and I am running a little low on the memory. I also have a 1.6 Ghz on my processor. 

Here are my ideas...

1) Keep my laptop and purchase a terabyte to store projects.  Is 8GB ram enough for these programs? 

2) Get another cheaper laptop with at least 16GB ram and 1Tb Memory. Possibility a Lenovo. I would use this laptop for captivate and articulate only. Use mac for creative cloud.

3) Buy an iMac. I am hesitant about this option because I will start ID internships in the future and I probably need to carry my own laptop that has the programs. 

I'm an undergrad student so I don't have thousands to dump into a fancier laptop.

Any advise?

6e18yu,1,2017-05-29,21 Year Old Considering Future Plans,Skcuhc1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6e18yu/21_year_old_considering_future_plans/,"Hello redditors, I apologize if I am jumping the gun a bit but I wish to consider my options.
 

I am currently a senior in State University, graduating in May of 2018 dual majoring in Accounting and Finance with a minor in I/S. I have had two Accounting Internships (one for a small computer store, and another at a national group of companies) with a current GPA of 3.3. When I graduate college, I am expecting to have around $9.6k in student debt (all federal, average 4.04% interest). My estimated payments per month are supposed to be $100 on a 10 year period, but I plan on paying those off as soon as possible given my circumstances.


Until recently, I have been planning on living at home for a year after I graduate to pay my student loans before interest accrues, then create a starting emergency savings (estimated $6k which should cover me for 3-6 months). However, I have come to the realization that I am miserable at my hometown. I do not have many friends there, and there is very little opportunity to mingle or grow. I am considering moving to the Pittsburgh area once I graduate (plans on living with 1-3 roommates) so I can push my life forward. I have been in the town with friends from college and I enjoy the city/lifestyle a lot. There is so much more to do and many more opportunities to be with people my age range.


***COST PROJECTIONS [i](Monthly):***
 
***If I were to stay in my hometown:***

* $1,800 income per month after 401k contribution and taxes (based on $35k salary).

* $20 spent per month on cell phone expense.

* $100 spent for food expense (I usually spend $50, but estimating worst case).

* $50 spent for gas expense (travel, etc.)

* $70 spent for car insurance
 
**Left Over:** $1,560
 
 
***If I were to live in Pittsburgh:***

* $2,050 spent per month after 401k contribution and taxes (based on $40k salary).

* $12.50 spent per month for Renter’s Insurance (Assuming $150 yearly)

* $700 spent per month on rent expense, after roommate split and utilities (includes cell phone).

* $200 spent for food expense (I usually spend $150, but estimating worst case).

* $100 spent for gas expense (travel, etc.)

* $70 spent for car insurance.
 
Left Over: $964.50
 

My biggest questions are:
 

1. Can I financially afford to move to Pittsburgh straight out of college? While I am positive on my leftover income, I wish to be sure that I am not missing any details. I am usually pretty frugal and do not spend a lot of money most of the time.

2. Do my budgets look reasonable? Food and gas are costs that I have estimated based off of my Mint history but the yearly income, rent/insurance are all estimates.

3. Should I be more worried about financial stability or personal happiness? From what I am seeing it looks like I can survive moving out financially but it would dent me a bit due to initial costs (security deposit, furniture, moving, etc). However, while I would be financially better off to live at home it would take a toll on my mental health.
 

Tl;dr College kid is considering future plans, wants to move out but is unsure if projections are accurate and desires are realistic/reasonable. Pls halp

6e1n5i,1,2017-05-29,College Summer Split,gman00910,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6e1n5i/college_summer_split/,"Well, well, it's been a week and a half abouts and I'm still not over this.

So this girl and myself have been talking for a couple months, we met snowboarding here in Colorado and we got to the same school. I'm a Sophomore and she is a Freshman(as of this past year), and we started hooking up after I texted her to come over after we were both drunk at parties one night. Surprisingly she did, with only driving up to Board one time before! So basically everythings fine and dandy up till the last couple weeks of school when we start talking of summer. But yeah, before that we were saying we really liked each other. Although really busy, we could only hand out 1-3 a weeks, mostly her just spending the night and having amazing sex, sometimes getting sushi and her taking me to her sorority's date rush and formal. I'm in engineering and I snowboard 3 days a week, so let me tell you I now realize I wasn't perfect with her. We didn't text a whole bunch, but mostly everyday but was just about our days and hanging out. So most days I would just be too tired or busy to text her or try really hard to hang out a lot, and that is the biggest regret of 2017 so far. I wish I didnt smoke weed after 10 hour class days or snowboarding all day, then becoming too lazy to try really hard most days to be with her. Although she was totally okay with it and understood, as she has her own busy freshman sorority life too. So it was okay, things were good between us as we liked each other and when we could have sleepovers and get sushi.

So here's when thing started going down hill. Two weeks before we discussed Summer and she was really cool with trying to keep our feelings and being positive, saying this summer could make it better and seeing each other that much better. And I said the same thing, few days later we talk again about it and she expresses a little more worrisome, which I totally get. And I still tried to keep it optimistic which I still think could have worked which is why I'm not over this still. She then led to saying that she doesn't know if this will work anymore(summertime hope) and she doesn't know what she will want next year because she'll be gone for 3 months. She expressed that shes seen friends blow up over summer and yatata, I guess I agree. I then expressed that we should put it on hold or be friends and turn out friends or it works out (I kinda regret this, because now she's kinda set on staying in the middle ground with me but I want her to show affection like we used to, or then the likelihood of coming back together is greatly diminished?)

Now the reason for this downfall is what made me go a little coocoo. I just didn't understand how her view on it can change so fast. Ss I asked what else is going on, did you lose something? She explains how she lost ""little"" feelings because of some things. Let me explain, before we talked about summer she talked to me about how she wanted to be more open with me and how it feels like I pushed her out because we havent gotten personal yet. I told her I Just didnt get the hints sometimes, and also said that we went to straight hooking up, so that makes it a little different you know? Like it takes time to build that relationship and make that sexual relationship more personal, but I guess I was too slow and blind from my business. When we talked about this at the time she said it wasnt her ending things. But now she said this led to a little more overthinking(such as thinking I dont like her sorority friends or what she does, which is totally untrue and told her that and she seemed to understand that it was just overthinking) and cause to lose her little feelings. So this is what led her to lose her hope this summer. Now she has to tell me that she doesn't want to promise anything or get our hopes up because she doesn't know how the feelings will drift because it's 3 months, and because if we have hope and something goes wrong than that's always a bummer. I totally agreed with her but at the same time I'm now going crazy because I will never understand why she couldn't have given it a chance, I truly think summer could have been so easily if we stayed positive. Like its just hard to accept that her overthinking changed it all and now lost all optimism when a week before this she was telling me summer could make it better. From this experience I have learned how important emotional intelligence is and how much I lack it, I've never felt so broken in my life because of this. I've never been fully depressed I'd say until last week for that whole week, it was awful.

So now let me explain about our talks. It basically went on for the whole last week of school, where I kept texting her about it with long messages just trying to understand everything. I let my emotions get to me, and I got out of control. Let me say now that after our last talk she was still obviously a little annoyed or ""overwhelmed"" but she said its okay and understands, which I'm really happy for, because maybe it will show her how much more I care now. It's impossible to explain everything, but I was ranting about a ton of things. How next year could be so much better with out my stoner roommates that don't do shit, that I'll be living in a funhouse of 6 guys who actually like to drink and go out. So she and I both will feel more comfortable with her staying over all day and talking to them, because this year it was just leaving in the morning. Never talking to my roommates much and never cooking here. Also after we talked about opening up we did tell eachother everything, she had a rough childhood with  fighting parents and thats what she wanted to talk about, pretty horrible story and I feel so bad that I had no idea that that happened and I wish I asked earlier. Told her many personal things about me. So every day for a week I blew her up with messages and she took forever to respond, it drove me mad(I never blew up or anything), it was always me trying to make it better or something. LIke explaining how busy I was with my internship and snowboarding, and how better next year could be and how much better I want to make myself and time management for you. But the sad thing is that she realizes that I'm trying a lot harder than I was, which is truly, ever since she ""half denied"" me as I like to say, I've ebee ncrazy about her and made me want her so much more. ""you want what you cant have"" literally drove me insane. Finally after teh week and not really answering all my questions because she said I was ""repeating"" things a lot. And she was just trying to stay in the ""middle"" ground and content. No matter what I said or how deep I got it was always I just want us to be content with the plan, were friends and we either work out next year or not.

So I thinks thats enough info on that, but now its been a week since the last time we talked about it. One night I said I miss you so much, and she said I miss you too. and I've been saying goodmorning almost every morning from advice from a good girl friend. But also have been trying really hard not to text or snap her at the same time. We went two days earlier with out texting earlier this week and she said hey, which made me happy. I sent her a picture of us and said it makes me smile everytime I look at it and she replied nicely with a smiley and all. Also, another reason why she was worried about summer was because she works at a camp for a month back home and doesn't get good signal or time to talk. 

So yeah, THink about her everyday and started a little journal to contain my thoughts, yesterday I was real close to ending it with her because I was feeling angry at how she didnt give it a chance and stuff like that. Idk, I know the blame is on me and I couldve been better. And im slowly getting my motivation and happiness back. I'm starting a gym program and plan to pack on some pounds and get ripped again, doing summer classes with my internship, looking into GHB and Nootropics to help me further practice socializing and being the funny guy at the party. As I'm really horrible with communication and forming my thoughts when I get high, even sometimes when I'm sober, and I want to out grow this and be better at my speech and being more ""strong"" with my voice.

So yeah, my sister really helped me a lot and told me I just need to distance yourself and she will start missing me and it will make it better, but then my other friend told me to say good morning. 

So I'm asking more more perspectives and advice on how I shoulder proceed. I would seriously appreciate it so much, and I know this has been long and if you've made it this far I actually love you. My problem is that I don't want to feel pushy anymore, Im not trying to chase her, as she said ""I don't give second chances they just have to happen."" I know my feelings wont fade because I seriously like her so much. So yeah the question is, let her text me first some days, whether it take a few days or not, or say goodnight and try to talk to her a lot before she goes to camp? My problem is its only been a week, and although she still has feelings for me and misses me we have to stay in the ""middle ground."" It still feels fresh and kinda like my text bombs pushed her a way a little bit. I said goodmorning beautiful how was you trip this week? and she replies ""Morning. It was great yatatata."" So I dont know if I should feel down about her not being flirty with me anymore, or maybe just give her space like my sister said and let her miss me. But Im scared that that will push her away even more since really the only problem with her was that we didn't get personal and text a lot. So what should I do, I'm trying to facetime and call her more, but maybe in another week or so when all this is not so fresh and weird. Oh also, I kinda already came up with a plan to just keep it casual and friendly, obviously still show I have feelings every now and then with a goodnight kissy face or good morning beautiful up until the last two weeks of summer. Then text her with about if she still has feelings for me and if she wants to get sushi the first week back or come over for a party? OR should I do that AND say mid summer, ask her if she still has feelings and tell her I still do?

Idk, it made me crazy at how she changed her mind so quick about the summer, but not starting a relationship right before summer is probably the best idea I agree, but it still hurts at how she cant even ""promise"" anything next year. Like why do you even have to mention that, because you don't want to give me false hope? Oh well thanks, minus well just break up with me right now....is how I feel right now.

Any help/advice/tips would be greatly appreciated!"
6e27q1,4,2017-05-29,"My [24f] best friend [27f] of 2 years suddenly will barely speak to me, seemingly out of nowhere?",yaz1123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6e27q1/my_24f_best_friend_27f_of_2_years_suddenly_will/,"Katie and I met about 2 years ago and hit it off right away. We hung out all the time and this January she actually moved into my house because she had an internship close to my house, and she still lived with her parents who are much further away.

Anyway, I did not make her pay rent or anything, and although I really need my alone time, it was kind of nice having a roommate. A few things she did would get on my nerves, I often felt she acted like a guest and I had to clean up after her, but I let it go.

Her mom has stage 4 breast cancer. She recently started chemo so Katie moved back home. It's very sad, but I think Katie tries to pretend it's not happening sometimes. 

The thing about Katie is she can be very narcissistic. She has let a lot of friendships die because she's always soooo tired or busy or whatever. But she's honestly not that busy - she had this 9-5 internship and she was constantly just exhausted and couldn't do anything else. Now, she's done with school, she's not working until OCTOBER so she's going to stay with her girlfriend in Chicago, and she's just studying for the CPA exam. Yet, she cannot take 2 minutes to text me back. This is what I mean by narcissistic. It's like, if she is studying or working or has something going on in her life, it's all about her and she cannot do ANYTHING else.

A week or so after she moved out there was a party for my work we were planning on attending for months. She was really excited, asking me what she should wear, etc. The day of the party, 2 hours before, I get a huge text from her saying she's so overwhelmed with studying (she was studying for the CPA exam but it wasn't for a few weeks after the party) and she's not coming anymore. She said she was really sorry. Honestly, I was pissed because I would never blow her off like that -- my response was ""it's kind of lame of you to blow me off 2 hours before but whatever."" 

She texted me a few days later apologizing again. I let it go and she started saying how she will be busy for the next month studying but after that we should hang out. I guess I was still annoyed she blew me off, and how she's just too busy to make anyone besides her girlfriend a priority, so I responded kind of bitchy. I said something along the lines of ""well maybe we can hang out in August then since I'm busy studying for the Bar Exam until then."" I also said I would still be social and go out, but I doubt she would want to come. 

She didn't respond, and I left it alone because I knew her CPA exam was happening in a few weeks. After the exam was over, I texted her and called her. No response. It had been 2 days. She usually takes forever to text back, but that is when we are just talk-texting and writing long responses. My texts were more like ""hey you still alive??"" 

Anyway -- I was worried I hadn't received a response. I even messaged her girlfriend. I seriously thought her mom might've gone into hospice or something bad. I even went through the obituaries to make sure. I texted and called saying I was worried and to please text me back and let me know she is OK. 

I finally get a response a few days later and she's just like - ""hey I'm fine I've just been really tired and hanging out with Paige, how are you?"" So, I responded within an hour, and that was about 5 days ago, no response since. I have even texted and called more times, invited her out, told her to call me so we can catch up, etc. Absolute radio silence. 

I know she's not doing anything since she doesn't have a job and her exam is over. She's probably just hanging with her girlfriend all day. Yet she can't find 2 minutes to respond to me.

It really hurts. We were so close and best friends. It is especially hard since I am used to seeing and talking to her every day when she lived with me. And I really am a good friend. I listen to her issues all the time, I listen and help her overanalyze and speculate about EVERYTHING. I never made her do anything when she lived with me. I go out of my way for her, I always make sure my friends are happy and OK even if it inconveniences me. 

Hell, I'm studying my ass off for the Bar exam but I still make time for my friends and I never ignore texts/phone calls. 

It sucks. I have a lot of other close friends but Katie was the one I felt closest to. Honestly, Katie doesn't have that many friends anymore because she doesn't keep up with people. She's popular and people like her, but the main people she talks to on a regular basis was me, her girlfriend, and her family. Maybe she made a bunch of new friends? I don't know.

She's always been flaky with texting back -- And since I lived with her, I know she'll get a text from someone, read it, and not respond or forget or whatever. But I have sent her so many, and called her, it seems like this is purposeful. I know my one text a few weeks ago was bitchy, but I didn't think it'd end our friendship. 

What should I do? Leave her alone? Wait and see if she responds?

  **tl;dr**: My best friend all of sudden won't speak to me and doesn't even seem to care about me anymore, for no reason?"

  * And it's it's it's been a rumor that the National Harbor--because it's under the control of DC, DC police--for the longest time is funny business at the National Harbor
  * So it's kind of one of those on-the-waterfront type meetings
  * {{ swimming with the fishes sounds lovely }}

* [[Day 217.12. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bJN44ZAzMs)
  * Okay. This is day 217 this is part 12
  * I'm here with Jason Goodman and you can see Rolling Thunder has caused an unrolling traffic-jam god yeah
  * So we heard a AJ Goodman is taking some heat for the Joe Biggs thing
  * It was funny because the first thing we heard of that this morning we kind of knocked it down in two minutes with that just on the Seth Rich which with just only the two letters we entered
  * We avoided that but
  * So what I'd like to do with AJ is he's a great supporter of ours and he's a great--connect the dotter I guess for a lack of a better word
  * AJ you can call my phone number at five oh three nine one nine zero seven four eight we are on the trail of several big interviews this afternoon
  * That's all we can say right now
  * But if you'd like to call in and record ,we are not doing anything other than sitting in raffic
  * So we've we would love to help you out in any way we can
  * Jason Goodman says hi and no relation maybe you guys are related?
  maybe you never know
  * there's another Goodman than we ran across today
  * J: yeah somebody had a lead right yeah yeah
  * So anyway yeah one of another journalist ao we're wondering it not Amy Goodman of course
  * J: you brought you've interviewed into her I told her I've got this open source fact-checking website she ran the other way I guess she didn't want her a facts checked
  * Now everybody's going to go watch Amy Goodman ambush
  * J: she didn't have it on video unfortunately oh that was when I was making HRC voters in Trump land she was there in in the michael moore film
  * yes just going to catch a little bit of the Rolling Thunder
  * So people get a little bit of -- this is just a tiny fraction there's mostly I guess about 20,000 motorcycles
  * J: they have stopped the city I mean we've been stuck in this traffic
  * we missed our interview we've been in the traffic for over an hour the worst of rescheduling it little later yet
  * So Okay. And if anybody wants to do a little research on Goodbody media Goodbody media that's the new search term metadata for this video

* [[Day 217.13. Hillary'Hillarys , Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPXuSjelhKQ)
  * Okay. Day 217 part 13
  * I believe though some things they're starting to crystallize around the coroner's report the death certificate and the autopsy
  * So this is going to maybe shock a few people but I believe he was shot
  * I believe Seth Rich was shot I don't think he was at the corner very long at all
  * I believe he was taken to Howard University Hospital
  * I believe she was declared brain dead at 5:59
  * I believe the reason why the parents were there in the original reports were to sign a consent form
  * I think there's going to be a consent form donation consent form that's going to be loom very large I think it can be FOIA-ed
  * I don't know if tom Fitton is watching this for judicial watch or alt or ACLJ
  * People can tweet out to ACLJ
  * I don't think they're familiar with the series
  * I believe he's declared brain dead at Howard and I have basis for saying this
  * And then he has taken up the hill to MedStar
  * I had known this it was called the black mile or in the in the business has foggy bottom but you end up being a donor
  * And I'm not going to go through the rest of the scenario but I am seeing footprints I do believe
  * Now that the Seth Rich was declared brain-dead at Howard University 

---
* [[Day 217.14 Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZphjB7qWdk)
  * Okay. It's day 217 I think this is 13 or 14
  * I think we might have solved the puzzle/ At least
  * J: That was you
  * That was me. But if you remember the resident and I'm going to just say Dr. Eowyn
  * And he does the initial triage when the guy comes in, when Seth Rich comes in
  * And he does and I've talked about this in previous videos
  * J: it was all over 4chan or reddit or something
  * Been in a lot of different places
  * But that resident says he doesn't leave the hospital till 8 hours later
  * And then he's declared VIP status
  * And then there's a cordon around him for about 8 hours not two hours.
  * But the problem here is--I went to both Howard and MedStar
  * And I had a researcher from Springfield, Illinois--you know who you are
  * You talked to both hospitals.  And both hospitals had what they call ""hush meetings""
  * The hush meetings are:
  * J: When they have a VIP they don't want anybody revealing the identity are talking about it.  They say (too close) they not want everybody talking about it
  * J: So they say gotta be quiet are you going to get fired
  * J: the craziest thing about the hush meeting is : when you went to the hospital
  * {{ George cuts Jason off }} I went to the hospital that night at about 1:00 a.m. you can check the videos
  * There was a whole group of people coming out of a restaurant like this
  * It was about 12 Nigerian guys and I'd gone into the hospital
  * Everybody at the attending was Nigerian guys
  * So you have the pressure of throwing people out of the country if they don't have a Visa
  * ***So anyway they were also having a nighttime hush meeting for the graveyard shift***
  * J: *and there was one white guy leading the meeting, right?*
  * One it was one one white guy leading the meeting and there was these 12 Nigeria guys
  * And I asked him as they came out of the meeting, do any of you guys know Seth Rich
  * Now they had just come out of the meeting
  * And this was a year ago when the Seth Rich meeting occurred
  * And all of them looked like I had just
  * J: said exactly the wrong thing
  * Said exactly what the guy had said ""don't say this""
  * And then all of them, almost in unison, pointed ""the information officer is right over there""
  * And like they knew immediately who I was talking about
  * They didn't say ""Seth Rich? Can you give us some more information?""
  * This was a year ago!
  * How would they know?
  * J: That's strange.  How many people knew about it a year ago?
  * How would they know?
  * So anyway this this jives was something I'm going to break this
  * This is direct testimony to me from Joe Capone
  * The reason why the first reports came out is that the parents were there and talking to Seth Rich,
  * J: sitting up in the ambulance, and in the hospital
  * And I think there was this brother also Aaron.  I hope that's not Aaron Wasserman that day but
  * J: no no we saw Aaron Rich on a TV interview right okay
  * So Aaron also said they saw him sitting up
  * But Joe Capone's story changed about whether he was at the beach or or
  * J: in the bar that night
  * In the bar that night
  * Bernard we still haven't been able to get Bernard or Bernie
  * J: Brandon Brendan Bernard Brandon whatever Warren
  * Warren who have we haven't gone to his house yet
  * But the interesting piece of this
  * J: we've actually been advised not to go to that house by someone who in law enforcement
  * Somebody in law enforcement said that's not a good idea yeah
  * But I think we're gonna go buy it shooter we'll check it out the picture
  * But anyway Joe Capone says to me--and I've spent about four days with Joe Capone
  * So it's kind of like the Colombo like the last night there was two DC cops ready to throw me out
  * And he said but there but he was sitting up in the ambulance and people were talking to him in the ambulance
  * And I couldn't figure out why would he say--that why would he say that?
  * J: George I think now is the time for Joe Capone to come forward and come clean
  * J: He's got to get on the right side of this before it's too late.
  * There's all these inconsistencies
  * And then it came to me: Seth Rich can't be dead if he's going to be taken at one o'clock ~~in the afternoon~~ up the hill the MedStar
  * J: one o'clock in the morning
  * One o'clock in the morning
  * If he was declared brain dead at 5:59 a.m., they could still keep him alive at Howard until he had to go up in the morning
  * And the intern--if you read if you read the intern the WHC guy he said he was on loan from somewhere else
  * J: where's that somewhere else?
  * He was on loan to Howard University Hospital at the bottom of the hill
  * That's that's what all the testimony and everything here makes sense. The fake parents 
  * J: we need that resident to come forward
  * And we need Fitton and ACLU but ACLJ we need ACLJ also to FOIA the consent form
  * J: We gotta see those signatures and compare to it his parents'
  * And there's a very extensive thing that you have to do in order to get consent form
  * And all the doctors watching will will pour onto this
  *  Because we got an emergency room doc at Iowa City for the VA hospital
  * J: Now is the time for everybody come forward
  * Now it's time for everybody to come forward
  * And also the doctors come forward and talk about the procedures for declaring brain death
  * J: yeah yeah
  * But I'm almost positive once you declare brain death you'd still need the consent of attorneys for organ donation
  * That's the update our big interview is still yet to come

---
* [[Day 217.15. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uOym781Zcc)
  * Okay. Day 217 I think this is 15
  * So Martin Shkreli it looks like Martin Shkreli might be trying to get a hold of us through an intermediary
  * People who don't know him he's the guy who tried to do the thing with the Epipen
  * J: You know when I saw an interview with him that changed my opinion about the news that came out about him. I don't want to pass judgment. There's a lot of details there that we don't know.
  * I'm not trying to pass judgment I'm not just saying that people probably would remember him
  * J: It wasn't an EpiPen. It was a it was an antifungal drug that he bought from a pharmaceutical company
  * Was it Mylan pharmaceuticals ?
  * J: Something...and then he increased the price 7x
  * My land pharmaceuticals and he was a young guy did congressional here and
  * J: Epipen with somebody else
  * But I do want to say this Thank You Martin Shkreli for putting up $100,000 reward for whoever finds the answer yeah just just Rich
  * J: why did he want to do that? What's his connection to Seth Rich?
  * I think he's just being a good guy
  * And I want to say right now I think we're getting close I don't I do not want a penny of this
  * J: me neither
  * So I think we're going to if we do receive $100,000 when this thing is over and it's giving it up we're going to divvy it up
  * J: So right
  * Now anybody who was in the hush meeting yeah from the last video
  * J: If you haven't seen the last video, you got to go back and watch about the hush meeting that George witnessed people coming out of, ask them a question that revealed that they were definitely in the meeting
  * So there's two hush meetings and there would be no reason to have two hush meetings
  * One at MedStar which was the transplant hospital--the recipient hospital
  * And one at the bottom of the hill, which was the donor hospital which is Howard
  * J: And there is also a lot of reasons to think something weird was going on, because no one's come out with the hospital that he went to 
  * So and I admit that the this is circumstantial evidence
  * But I call it the Trump game--which is the best evidence we have is the four year intern and his report
  * J: Right. And it did seem credible, I mean it's not proof of course, but it was certainly written by someone with medical knowledge, and and everybody to come forward with better evidence to refute that if it's not true, like that police
  * Maybe yeah the police
  * So so I I think that's maybe a five of Spades or six of spades, but it certainly beats the two of spades
  * J: Unless somebody throw down a seven or an eight
  * Right and anybody who can Trump that with the with the more metadata or more facts
  * J: we're talking gin right now not president
  * Yeah we're talking poker right now
  * So what I'm going to do is divide it for chips now
  * So if you were at the hush meeting at Howard
  * Or you are at the hush meeting at MedStar
  * Or you're an ambulance driver and you took Seth Rich up the hill at about noon on July 10
  * Or if you're an ambulance driver you come forward
  * Or if you are a paramedic
  * J: Or somebody checking people in at the hospital an orderly anybody who knows
  * And if you were a part of a transplant team
  * J: Right
  * I'm thinking that you have about an hour for a heart
  * You have and that's why they kept alive I believe
  * You have about three hours or four hours for a liver
  * J: How would the resecting of the intestine play into this theory?
  * I have to think about that: why they didn't wash the intestine? That's interesting. Okay.
  * Well anyway you have longer for a kidney you can do a kidney on ice for 24 hours or longer sometimes up to 48 hours I think the doctors out there will say that
  * I think the pancreas is about eight hours I think you can go up to four hours on the liver
  * But the really critical one is the heart
  * It's only an hour you got that golden hour I know peak you can peruse the heart and put it on a machine and do that sort of thing well
  * J: But this all explains the sort of eight hour gap between when he came in and when you died
  * This is the only testimony that's out there that is credible
  * Now it's a five or six
  * The police are certainly welcome to produce a coroner's report and a death certificate
  * I think we're going to have a death certificate or a declaration
  * I don't know if there's a different form for a declaration of brain death
  * So anybody out there is an expert, you can let us know what the two differences are, because I don't think the coroner can do the actual certificate of death until they call it, and pull the plug and there's no heartbeat
  * J: And there's also this crazy thing about the parents were there they were not there someone's going to have to find the power of attorney or whatever it is to give up the organs right? What is that? The consent form?
  * The consent form
  * So so I want to divide up up to four ways the Martin Shkreli is $100,000
  * So if you were a part of the transplant team the scrub team on the o.r with a transplant
  * If you were the paramedic and I think maybe the paramedics are being spit or--rewarded or bribed for every body they produce
  * So that's not going to probably happen 
  * J: Well so we're at a point now where we need Mr. Shkreli to get in touch with us and see if he's on board with this plan
  * Yeah if he's on board if I'm just saying if we receive it I would like to interview him
  * J: yes sure yeah he's in New York he's in New York
  * So Jason's willing to go and interview you Mr. Shkreli
  * Obviously we have 20 thousand from Julian Assange still in play right
  * They have my 20,000
  * We have Mike Cernovich's 20,000
  * J: There's a lot of money here, somebody's going to come forward
  * I don't know if that's in play if it's a money thing--what I suggest:
  * If you want anonymity you have a neighbor have their kid go to the library, send the message
  * Get it three somehow get or get it to AJ Goodman
  * J: We haven't heard from AJ
  * Or who else would you--I think that's a good list
  * Jerome Corsi
  * J: Yes Dr. Corsi he's apparently got some bombshell information coming on Tuesday we're really looking forward to seeing that we had a great conversation with him the other night
  * But he runs the DC bureau of InfoWars, right?
  * So that some people didn't know when we said Dr. Corsi are you talking about a doctor
  * CORSI he's a PhD PhD
  * So Okay.
  * That's the wrap from here and we have a lot of reporting left to do
  * The big ones coming up
  * J: that's right well yeah
  * All right talk to you soon 

---
* [[Day 217.16. Hillary'Hillarys , Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e1G12IOEkU)
  * Okay. Day 217 I think this is 16th
  * Just waiting for our interview
  * Everyone's asked about the parent and the parents
  * Why did they why would they put the parents there in the early stories in the early versions, and then later recant like Joe Capone told me that the parents actually were in Omaha
  * So why would they say the parents were there?
  * Were they actors or whatever?
  * And the answer I think is very simple and it's what you do if you're setting up a one of these operations is you use as many unwitting participants as possible
  * Because what you don't want is to have the coach people create suspicions
  * In the parents situation what you would do is you would get parents of a child that needs organs and you would have them go and say look: they can't find the parents of this person, he's brain-dead, the organs are going to go to waste
  * ***And you are so sincere when you talk to them, and you tell them: ""the only way we can get your son or daughter organs right now is if you go in and just sign the papers and say you're Seth Rich's parents""***
  * Everyone at the hospital then sees them sign
  * It it's normal standard procedure
  * ***They see the pain in the parents eyes, and the parents have no incentive after those organs leave Seth Rich's body and go to their child that they're trying to save, they're never going to talk--there's no way a hundred thousand or a million dollars whatever pry that information from those parents***
  * I still think to this day those parents don't know that their organs that save the life of their child came from Seth Rich's body
  * Again I'm putting together the evidence that's out there
  * None of this is my evidence--this is their evidence
  * And I am just putting together the most rational explanation with their evidence complete with completely within their constraints of what they put forward
  * So the other ESA's Bob Creamer
  * Bob Creamer is at the White House on the 6th with Joe Capone he's also there on the 12th right after they're Seth Rich murder and then he's there on the 15th
  * Now in any of these situations, you're going to have people come forward with evidence
  * And you need to somehow either destroy evidence or in some cases destroy the witness when those evidence is too overpowering
  * And I believe that Bob Creamer came back to the White House to do that
  * The long term offer of a Martin Shkreli
  * Now I'm not saying Martin Shkreli did this
  * But what you want to do is you all want to offer a very high reward to make sure that anyone outside of the system that doesn't trust the authorities--let's say you don't trust the DC police from past murders like Vince Foster or whoever, you want to make sure they come forward to **you**
  * So that you can still go back and destroy evidence or in some cases destroy witnesses
  * So that's what I think that is happening the with the Shkreli thing potentially
  * He can always up a reward or again the police can easily Trump my working theory here as we look for more footprints, by simply putting up the death certificate putting out the certificates I published, the certificates you would need to publish for organ donation, and publishing the autopsy
  * Again, this is a homicide which requires there to be an autopsy
  * Now I can see why if the person went up to MedStar from Howard which happens in brain dead type situations
  * They don't know that it's a murder
  * They don't they know that's just a gunshot wound
  * They don't know the circumstances of the gunshot wound
  * And all they know is they've got a brain-dead person in the next room
  * I would say no one's even examining that for wounds because they say the person's brain dead
  * Why would you then go into the room and perform an autopsy and look for wounds if the person's already brain dead?
  * The people at MedStar are also innocent in this--it's only the intermediaries--it's only the intermediaries
  * The people in the ambulance may also be unwitting intermediaries, thinking well it's a brain dead person there's nothing we could do
  * You only need one person: one doctor on rotation from up on the hill at MedStar to impersonate a fourth-year surgery resident and give everyone the feeling that there was adequate care, there was quality care
  * One person could carry out this operation: if you just go down the hill, file the report, and go up the hill, and then be the receiving doctor
  * After you've declared somebody brain-dead at the bottom of the hill, then you go up and you're the receiving doctor at the end
  * You only need one person in this compromise
  * And again if your name is Dr. Alteyevich {{@TODO get correct spelling from prev part }}, and you change your name to Sava, and you had experience doing organ harvesting in Kosovo in the yellow house in Albania: this would be nothing new

* [[Day 217.17. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvV85TWb4U)
  * Okay. Day 217 I think this is 17
  * So the everyone's asking what you makin such a big deal about NGP a van for?
  * NGP van and GP van
  * Well Seth Rich was trying to prove that you were moving that Hilary was moving money from the Berniecrats over to the Hillacrats
  * Especially in Nebraska where he supported the Senator for reelection as well
  * And in order to do that I believe that conversation with Gavin McFadden was we need a zip code by zip code breakdown of where that's actually happening
  * Because the further you can breakdown anomalies, the easier it is to prove
  * For instance if a Berniecrat got very strong in a certain County got $100,000 in the Hillacrat got $10,000 then all of a sudden later on the records were changed in such a way that it was reverse
  * If the situation was reversed--it would be very easy to trace
  * Because remember NGP van is an engagement model
  * It talks about the first time somebody knocked on the door
  * It talks about their previous voting and the previous elections
  * It talks about the notes that a door knocker would have saying I think I could get a contribution
  * And it's going to be a slow build to--I talked to him and--I had them at the thousand dollar level my intention is to get them to the five thousand dollar level I brought in--
  * There's going to be this kind of sales record this CRM record a customer relationship management record of this slow build and a very detailed set of footprints up to oh this is how it got to a hundred thousand
  * Then it's going to be on the flip side with a Hillacrat side there's going to be this very scant record of oh this this this and this and then rice shipments came in over here in Baltimore
  * And then something happened with the flight into Sugar Land Texas over there
  * And then Hillary met with Javed
  * And then all of a sudden oh--a whole bunch of Hillacrats across the country got a ten thousand dollar or ten thousand dollar contribution
  * It's going to happen like that when it's but it's laundered money it's going to happen like that
  * Because you just don't have that same reality of metadata when you pushing money through without really building a grassroots effort
  * When you're money laundering it's just the curvature of that slope of a building to getting somebody to make a commitment to money is going to be a much different footprint
  * So that's what the NGP data was it was the description of that curvature of that--build to when that person made that commitment
  * Same thing for buying a used car
  * Same thing for button--buying a house there's going to be this very verbose communication back and forth
  * Well what kind of bathroom can't we--the here's to what the inspection said here's what the--all the different things that the finance people talked about lots and lots and lots of chatter before the actual finalization even down to the last when is the closing meeting going to be
  * Versus--the Awan brothers type transactions are going to be this instantaneous
  * A lot of times you're going to find in their car when they were laundering money for the car companies, you're not you're going to have the car actually ever change hands
  * You're going to have any VIN numbers
  * You're not going to have any--you know Mahmood with Global Towing went and got the car over here in Chantilly and took it over to Woodbridge Virginia--you're going to have that kind of an audit trail because they don't want that those are footprints
  * So it's going to be this more instantaneous transaction of 50 car sales in Falls Church Virginia
  * Well it's the same to same concept with the NGP data
  * That's why Seth Rich was he that's why he was giving that NGP data in addition to the WikiLeaks emails the DNC emails he was also doing the NGP van information
  * And that's why Hillary when moved the data on the seventh in anticipation of his murder
  * Moved it to to the Clinton Foundation because all that had to be scrubbed
  * So you're going to find there's going to be yet another situation that happens and other patches applied and the data is going to be wiped out
  * Now getting back to timeline
  * Remember, you have the Seth Rich, as I said, between I think May 25th because that's the last email
  * So that was the opening of the window
  * and the closing of the window is going to be around June 7th or June 8th I think
  * Because you you have to figure Podesta needed about a week with {{ Donilon @TODO who?}} and Robbie Mook maybe helping a little bit to figure out exactly how they were going to cover this
  * Because remember these WikiLeaks these DNC leaks are going to be coming and you don't know what's going to be in there
  * So you have to have a strategy
  * So the strategy was we're going to get in front of this we're going to come up with our own hacker
  * We're not it's not going to be a leak we're going to make it a hack we're going to put forward what we want forward before the Wikileaks come out we know WikiLeaks is going to drop them on July 25th, right before the convention starts
  * So we got to get out in front of that we want to get out in front of the news cycle
  * So they came up with this idea of Guccifer 2
  * The reason why Guccifer for 2 was because Guccifer for 1 had just been brought over, and been arraigned for the Sony hack
  * So the public had already been pre-sold on this idea of Guccifer 1, so, hey, we'll call it Guccifer, 2 --the public won't have to remember a new name.
  * We'll just call it Guccifer 2, like Rocky 2
  * And then we'll say he hacked DNC
  * That way we can always have this argument: ""hack"" versus ""leak"" -- we're still having that same argument almost a year later: ""hack"" versus ""leak""
  * Now the other piece to it is the fact that you have to also threaten members of Congress
  * When the wiki leaks do come out on the 25th, you're going to need the senators to go in front of the cameras and go, ""oh it's a Russia hack it's a Russia hack""
  * So that's where the congressional hacks come in--you have to hack Congress
  * You have to hack everyone in Congress at least in the Democratic caucus
  * So that's where the DCC leaks come from
  * The reason why you also construct the reason why Guccifer 2 also says he hacks the DCC leaks is so that it covers the Awan brothers hacking of the actual senators information
  * And each ~~Senator or~~ congressman--so each one is going to be slightly different: over here it's going to be some kind of campaign contribution you shouldn't have taken over here, it's to be threatening somebody on an appropriation, whatever, it's going to be kind of this dirty tricks hack
  * So that's why Guccifer serves a dual purpose: you need the DNC leak cover to get out in front of the press, but you also need the DCC hacks--the Democratic caucus hacks--and those are can be done by the Awan brothers--to then threaten the Senators or the Congressmen and Senators when they get to the convention--
  * You need to remind them right before they get in on camera that ""oh by the way we have--this this nasty email or that nasty email about you""
  * Everybody's kind of forgotten about the DCC hacks
  * But that's why the Awan Brothers did the DCC hacks, because you have to have some kind of very fresh dirt on on everybody, to keep--
  * Because we don't really care about the Republicans at this point--that's why we didn't hack the whole Congress and whole house
  * It's just the Democratic Congress that we were worried about
  * So that's why we do the caucus hacks"

6e38i9,12,2017-05-29,how to be an adult???,HungryDirtDevil,raisedbynarcississts,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcississts/comments/6e38i9/how_to_be_an_adult/,"Hello everyone, I've read many, many posts here that have helped me with my Nmom, but, for a change I'm posting.

BACKSTORY: I am a 20-year-old female who's home for the summer from college. I've been interning in town, and will hopefully be hired on the team. I am in a steady relationship (Nmom grumps about it and tries to get me to break up with him) I've had a job on campus for 2 years, run a writing club, and am a budding freelancer. All in all, I'm pretty content with who I am now as a person. 

Since I was 18 Nmom has pushed, 'you want to be treated like an adult act like one' card. So this evening, while Nmom was screaming at my brother who's in HS for his grades, she stomps into my room. Flinging open the door she starts yelling at me saying if I want to be treated like an adult I need to act like one. I was sitting on my bed, writing like I usually do, so she started yelling that, 'were going to have a talk if all you're going to do all summer is sit in here online."" 

At this point I'm pretty done trying to fight back against her. She yells at me that I don't do the dishes, that I'm not home enough when I go out, she even complains about my internship hours saying they're too long (9-5). She yells that she isn't doing my laundry anymore, which I do my own anyway so I don't see the problem. And she needs to be involved in every conversation, inserting herself even when you're not talking to her. It's been like this for a very long time, and after she's done screaming she tries to act all buddy- buddy again.

Does anyone have any advice? 

((and yes I'm already stashing my money to hopefully have my own place in a year)) "

1) I've had some troubles financially due to me losing my internship. How my financial life is going to be for the next upcoming months? Will I get another internship? 

2) On the previous reading you said I am going to meet someone in 2 years and my future husband in 4 years. Can you tell me more about those two people, how they're like and how we are going to meet? I do live in Brasil, but there's a possibility of this man I'll marry being Spanish? My mom's friend mentioned something like that. 

3) Do I have any spiritual guides with me, if so, do they have any message/advice for me? 

Thanks a lot!! "
6e3ux8,4,2017-05-29,Always assume that cops are being dishonest! Why cynicism can be a great thing! Learn from my experience.,666MultipliedBy1,police,https://www.reddit.com/r/police/comments/6e3ux8/always_assume_that_cops_are_being_dishonest_why/,"Sorry in advance for the long post, but I had to bring it up. I know that the point I am going to make here is going to sound blatantly obvious to some of you, but I feel that many people aren't cynical enough and have become too trusting when it comes to law enforcement. 

With that said, it's generally not a good idea to be an asshole to the cops, it's best to be cordial and cooperative to a certain extent. However, if you happen to have drugs or anything illegal with you, NEVER incriminate yourself by acknowledging the fact that you knew it was there as to ""make their job easier"" in hopes of being let off easy (the whole ""I throw you a bone, you throw me a bone"" thing). This is precisely where I fucked up. 

I was pulled over for failing to signal at a stop sign and I had a just under an ounce of weed in the glove box. I couldn't find my wallet (it had fallen between my seat and the center console, which I call the ""abyss""), so he ordered me to step out of the car after failing to produce my ID. He also claimed to smell weed. After patting me down and searching my pockets, he called a K-9 unit to come check my car and told me that if I ""made his job easier"" by coming clean before the dog arrived that he would intern let me off with a warning and allow me continue on home. At this point I knew that they were going to find my stash whether I let them search it or not, so I came clean. 

Before you say it, I know... it was a stupid fucking move. I should have played dumb. But in my defense, I had a few run-ins with the police prior to this and they had all let me off with warnings. So I assumed this cop was being honest and would end up doing the same, but I still cannot believe I fell for that shit. I complied and told him where to find my stash and was immediately arrested, spent a few nights in jail, and I am still dealing with the legal consequences to this day (I was arrested in november 2016) and will continue to be on probation for another few months. 

The moral of the story is; stay polite and cordial as to give the APPEARANCE of full cooperation, if they end up searching you and find anything, NEVER INCRIMINATE YOURSELF!! YOU'RE FUCKED ONCE YOU CONFESS!! If you don't admit to anything, it's easier to deny/fight the case in court as long as you have a decent attorney! Remember your 5th amendment right of silence!! But if silence isn't your thing, just play dumb and act as if you had no idea it was there to begin with (this allows you to assume a stance of plausible deniability at your trial), and lastly, never trust any cop on his/her word! It is legal for the police to lie to you, and many of them will do just that if they think they can trick you into practically arresting yourself. There are a lot of great cops out there who have honor and take pride in their ""word"", but there are also plenty who don't give a shit about integrity/honesty and will do some shady shit if it means an easy arrest. 

Again, sorry for the long ass post, I just hope that my experience might help someone who is confronted by the police in the future. Never go full retard in the presence of a cop like I did. Thanks for reading, and let me know if you have had a similar experience or have any other tips/advice when it comes to dealing with cops."
6e44gg,5,2017-05-29,Going through a really hard time,Greedily,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/6e44gg/going_through_a_really_hard_time/,"This is going to be a really long post, sorry in advanced.

So about 10 years ago, I was playing an online game. I met a very fun person who I quickly became really good friends with. However, after about a year, she disappeared and I though I saw the very last of her. Fast forward about another year, and I'm just walking through a town when I get a whisper from somebody (new account), really excited that they saw me. It was the same person as before, and we quickly resumed where we left off. This friendship kept blooming until about 6 months later, on Valentine's day, when we were just casually talking about how much the day sucks and all, when I kinda blurted out that I liked her. She responded in similar fashion, and a new relationship was born. Now, it is important to note that we were both very young at this point (14 and 16). Anyways, fast forward to the holidays, and we make plans to be able to meet (we lived 11 hours away from each other). All the while, we send letters to one another with quirky love poems and other such stuff. We met up finally and had the most wonderful time, it was really the best times of my life.

Well, the visit ended quickly and leaving was the hardest thing I ever had to do, but I was really in love at this point. We made plans for another upcoming holiday, this time for her to visit me. Fast forward to then, and we have another amazing holiday weekend together, and then she has to go back home. About 6 weeks later, she tells me she missed her period, and that she took a pregnancy test and it turned out positive. Huge bomb shell, I really didn't know how to react. I consulted with my older brother, and talked to my parents about it, but her and I came up with the same answer, we wanted to have the baby. Both of our parents were super understanding and they left her move in with me. I am just 15 at this point, and her 17. Everybody was worried it was going to be a huge mistake, but they wanted to be supportive and make things work out. Our relationship continued wonderfully for a long time after.

We worked things out well, I took good care of her while she was pregnant. The baby was born, and we were both in heaven. We had our fights here and there, but things were always really good between us. After our daughter stopped breast feeding, I think she started to change. It was like her connection with the baby was slowly starting to fade. Things between us were fine, and she was still a good mother. But slowly and slowly, she seemed to grow farther from her daughter. Fast forward years, and she was not the best mother in the world, but certainly not the worst. Things between us were still fine, the honey moon phase was certainly over, but we still loved each other very much. We lived in my parents basement, and that made her feel a bit depressed. This went on for a while.

Fast forward to my senior year of college, after a successful internship, I got offered a full time job. I really wanted to provide for my family, so I gladly accepted it despite knowing it was going to be hard. We moved out shortly afterwards to a new apartment, and things were going wonderfully. This Christmas was a very defining moment in our relationship, as she was having issues with her dad, and she broke down and I was really there for her. Things were wonderful. But about 3 months down the line, things  were getting distant. I was busy with school and work, she was bored at home without a job. I stopped trying as hard to do stuff together, she did as well, and we just grew apart. It happened before while we live with my parents, but we got over it and made it through. I was just a few months from graduating and I knew that it would get better once I did.

Well, that was a big mistake. She played Overwatch heavily during this time, and made some friends that she became a play group with. This was usually at night, but I was busy with work and school so I was just happy she was doing something that made her happy. But slowly, she started not showing up to bed at night, and I would find her sleeping on the couch. She was usually drunk, so I just assumed she didn't find her way to the bed. I started to not wait for her to go to bed, and it kept happening over and over. Before long, it was a few weeks before I graduated, and I found out that she was really hanging out with a single guy, and they were getting drunk and falling asleep together talking on the phone. Obviously, I was furious, and we fought. A lot. She told me she was falling in love with him, and she wanted to see where it was going with him. She told me she still loved me, and that she wanted to make it work out between all of us. I wanted none of that, I wanted her to myself, and that caused even more fighting. We were still together at this point, and the day I graduated from college things really went south.

The next couple of weeks are a blur of us fighting about it day after day. Finally, she tells me that she wants to be with him and not me anymore. Now he lives in another state, and it is purely long distance. But they keep spending time together and it really is driving me nuts. So now, she is in Chicago with him for the weekend, and on her way home from the trip as I am typing this. She says it went well, and she wants to pursue things with this guy. Here I am, not knowing what to do with my life. I am madly in love with this woman, and I don't know what to do anymore. She says she still loves me, but not in the romantic way anymore. We still have sex and cuddle and it's really probably not healthy, but I take what I can get because I just can't get over her. 

At this point, I am just completely at a loss about what to do. I haven't eaten anything all day, I've been super depressed and have constantly had suicidal thoughts. I've been living this way for weeks now and I honestly don't know what to do. I've talked to friends and family about it, and they always tell me I'm better off, that she wasn't right for me, that I can find somebody better. Hearing all of this just pisses me off. Like they are invalidating how I feel, all of these intense passionate feelings I have for her. They have no idea what I am going through, and they just keep saying the same damn thing, and it just isn't doing anything for me. I grew up with this woman, she was a major part of my childhood, and I just can't let her go.

She wants to stay best friends, because there is a lot of chemistry and friendship built up over the 8 years we have been together. But really, I don't know what to do. I want to be with her, even if it means sharing her. She says she doesn't feel the same anymore, and says she is completely over me. I just don't understand how it has changed so much over just a few weeks, and I am just completely emotionally fucked up at this point. I feel like I can't live a life without her.

This was a very long post, and I commend anybody who made it through it. It feels good to have this off my chest, but I still have no idea what to do. She can't afford to live elsewhere because she didn't have a job or go to school to take care of our daughter. Now she is still living her, and her boyfriend is still in school and cannot move. So I am stuck living with her, or paying for her to have another apartment (which I can't really afford). And every time I see her I just want to throw myself at her. I want to tell her how I feel, and I have tried, but I can't just get it right. Every day I think about killing myself to just end this pain and torture. Everybody keeps saying it will all be okay, but I can't see it. This woman was half of my life, and I can't just get over her. I love her more than anything, and I let things slip between us. I regret it so much every day, and I just wish I could go back in time and fix things. I wish I never stopped bringing her to bed with me. I wish I just said fuck school today, I am gonna be with my wife. I just don't know what the hell to do anymore.

I am not gonna go grammar check this. I know it is a mix of many things, and it's very long. But it is what it is. I am fucking lost and I don't know where to go."
6e48au,5,2017-05-29,[25M] It's 2:30am and my (ex?) girlfriend just told me she's sleeping with another guy. Help.,Zomaksiamass,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/6e48au/25m_its_230am_and_my_ex_girlfriend_just_told_me/,"We've been together for a year and a half. The first 6 months together and the rest of the time we've been seeing each other about once every 1-2 months. After February we haven't had the opportunity to see each other. We loved each other a lot but in the last times the long-distance was a creating a bit of tension. Nothing too serious really. It just felt like a bit of a stressful thing to her, obviously to me as well. I mean, what LDR isn't? 

In early May, in a a matter of just a week or so, she did a complete 180. She went from sending me pics and loving things to telling me that she wanted a break. She told me she's young (21) and wants to explore what it would be like with other people. It caught me completely off guard and I couldn't believe it. I've always been a loving and caring boyfriend but she told me that things weren't as exciting anymore (and I thought, well of course, we are not in the same place having sex and doing road trips...). At first we stopped talking but then went back to skyping and reminiscing, telling each other every tiny thing about our relationship that created that bit of tension, and how to improve it. It was beautiful, I thought now that we finally talked about it, we could get back together soon. She was also about to come to my city for an internship so what better time. 

But things changed tonight. In the middle of the night she told me she is sleeping with someone. We Skyped. I was devastated but managed not to cry, because I cried so many times when skyping with her during the break and I knew it would make things harder for her to see me cry again. I also don't want her to associate me to a crying suffering guy, I want her to remember me as the exciting guy she met in Rome. 

Back to the guy, she told me it's a sexual thing and that she still has feelings for me. The thing is, she is going to see him again, so she liked him. She will be in Rome in just one month. I was really looking forward to it, it was hard to wait because I'm going through a super rough time since I'm trying to graduate so that I can go study what I dream of studying in London (where she lives btw). Now that this happened, I am scared. Guys, I've really never been this sad in my life, and I have had my heart broken before. I have a super busy month ahead, my heart is filled with pain and next time I will see her she might be in a relationship with this guy and I won't have the opportunity that I wanted in order to reunite with her. I loved her and love her so much. I just wanted an opportunity to see her in real life again, to remind her what it's really like, to remind her that our long distance relationship was less exciting because it wasn't the real thing. She loved me so much, I can't believe this is happening. I really hope I don't lose her. 

I'm sweating and feeling anxious and depressed. I can't sleep. Please help. "

6e5avi,33,2017-05-30,My family won't stop asking me [26 M] for legal advice,totesnotalawyer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6e5avi/my_family_wont_stop_asking_me_26_m_for_legal/,"The title pretty much sums it up, but I'm going to provide some background detail to help explain the exact problem. I recently finished my second year of law school and decided to visit my family for 2 weeks before starting my summer internship. The entire time I've been back, my parents have been ""jokingly"" asking me for legal advice. I put it in quotations because their requests are always framed as a joke, but I don't see it as such. And sorry for the length, this got much longer than I had expected it to be.

For example, one of my mother's friends has cancer and is terminal. Her friend wants to disinherit one of her children but is worried about the will being thrown out in court. My mother knows that I took a class last semester on trusts and estates. She called her friend while we were in the car together, talked to her friend for a few minutes, put the call on speaker mode, and laughed while suggesting that I should give her friend some advice. Her friend got really excited by this idea and I said no. I explained that her friend needed to talk to an estate lawyer. But, they kept asking me to give her some advice and kept talking about how simple this would be. I continued to say no and told them that if they really wanted to make sure that everything would work out, then they should get a lawyer. After a few minutes, my mother hung up. Then she got kind of quiet and started telling me about how she thought this was something simple I could do for her friend, since it is so hard for her friend to find the time to see a lawyer with all her doctor appointments. I apologized and explained that I cannot give legal advice. Aside from not being qualified, I can actually get into big trouble for giving legal advice as a law student. If the bar examiners found out, then they might not admit me to the bar, making the time and money I've invested in law school pointless. After I said this, my mother waved her hand and said that it's not a big deal, she was just joking around.

The next day, my mother was on the phone with her sister, my aunt. My mother mentioned to my aunt that I was in the room and my aunt asked my mother to put on speaker mode so she could talk to me. My aunt said hi and then started asking me for advice regarding her son who violated parole. I told her that I couldn't help, and she should talk to a lawyer. My aunt continued to ask me and my parents (who were both in the room) started to laugh and urge me to just give her some advice. I said no, and gave them the same explanation as last time. I told them that I wasn't qualified, and that I could get into a lot of trouble if anyone found out. After that, I walked out of the room.

Today was the final straw. I logged onto Facebook and saw a post on my wall from my mother. I won't copy the entire thing here, mostly because it's kind of long, but here's the essence of what it said: My grandparents have been having trouble with the IRS (no surprise, we'd talked about this many times). They've made some progress and have an administrative appeal coming up. However, they want me to look over some of their documents and tell them what arguments they should make because they've had a few ideas but don't know which is best. I took the post down as soon as I saw it and called her to tell her that this was not ok. I explained, again, about the trouble I could get into and how I wasn't qualified. She and my father, who was in the car with her when I called, laughed it off as a joke and said they were sorry, but I shouldn't get all worked up over it. After the call, I checked my email and found an email from one of the deans at my law school. We're friends on Facebook and she had seen the post. She emailed me to ask what was going on and to say that if this was unlicensed practice of law, then she'd have an ethical obligation to report that to the Board of Bar Examiners. I replied to her email to explain that it was just a joke from my parents, they didn't understand how serious unlicensed practice was, and that I had talked to them to explain what was going on. No reply from her yet though.

Now I'm furious. I've repeatedly explained why I can't give legal advice and my family, my mother in particular, seem to have no respect for my boundaries or the trouble I could get into. Part of me thinks that I need to have a serious conversation with my parents and relatives about this, but I honestly have no idea what to say other than what I've already told them. I've been dreaming of being a lawyer for years and it makes me both furious and on the edge of tears to think that my parents' could have been so thoughtless as to ruin that dream for me with a single Facebook post.

6e635u,6,2017-05-30,First ever sales job/internship tomorrow,C0MMANDO,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/6e635u/first_ever_sales_jobinternship_tomorrow/,"Hey guys. I've been lurking in this sub binge reading pretty much every post relating to cold calling, insurance, or prospecting. You guys have been a great help. I've also read some sales books that were recommended. Tomorrow, I will have to start cold calling people for my internship. Considering how hyped I was initially on making my commission, I'm actually feeling alot of resistance just thinking about it. It's a weird feeling. It's like that feeling in the backstage 10minutes before the show. You are 100% certain that you're going to perform, but every bit of your emotions are telling you no and holding you back . But I guess this is perfectly natural.

The purpose of this post is to see what you guys think of my plan for the internship.

I accepted Northwestern Mutual's internship program. I'm only licensed to sell insurance at this moment, but I can do joint work with others in my office to sell investments and other things. My ""quota"" for the first month will be 10 factfinders- pretty much just an appointment. And we have to write 5 lives in the next 3 months to continue on the internship. 

When I was internviewing for the internship, I had to make a list of 100 people who are my friends and family that I could call, but I don't want to do that for various reasons. That said, I plan on building my book through cold calling random people on linkedin, facebook, chamber of commerce, and referenceusa.

I'll be testing alot of stuff, like turning my instagram into a professional instagram profile with social proof, using instazood to be active within a target demographic in my city. DMing people on linkedIn, facebook, insta.   

But I plan on spending 90% of my time cold calling with this script NW provided.
&gt;Hey, this is ____. I'm a financial representative locally with Northwestern Mutual. Do you have a moment to speak?

&gt;Yes

&gt;Great! Well, the purpose of my call is to introduce myself and see if you'd be interested in in getting together to show you the type of work I do to help clients reach their financial goals

&gt;objection

&gt;I'm not sure if you are familiar with Northwestrn mutual, but we are recognized as one of the leading fiancial companies across the united states.

&gt;objection

&gt;I don't assume you have any imediate financial service needs. I'd just like to share information about my company and the process I follow that my clients find useful fo rtheir financial plans. 

&gt;I'll be in your area next wednesday and thursday. Would morning or afternoons on either of those days work for us to get thogether?

&gt;Wednesdays!

&gt;Great, so we'll meet at your office at 2 on wednesday afternoon. Again, my name is ___ I'm really looking forward to meeting you. Thanks again. bye

Next in the meeting, I'd give an overview of financial security, explain the 3 step approach, then lead into the factfinder. I'll see what his needs are. If he doesn't have any, I'll just ask for referals, if he does, we'll scheudule another appointment.

And try to close in the second meeting. 

Assuming each cold call is around 3 minutes and I work from 8 to 6, and I take 2 hours out for meetings, the leaves rom for 160 cold calls a day. And assuming 10/3/1 works, I'd get around 4.8 appointments a day and if we're being conservative, 1 of them will be a close. Does that sound reasonable?

I also have a couple questions I couldn't figure out. How do I check the do not call list for numbers? since I'll be calling around 3000 people a month, does anyone know of a way to keep track of the numbers? Should I use something to mask my cell phone number? I read that some of you use google hangout, but I'm not sure why you guys do that?

Tips and tricks in general are always appreciated.

First it was so I could ""grow as a person"". Then it was really because I'm too defensive and I think in black and white too much. During the conversation, I asked if he was breaking up with me because I had heard a similar speech before. He said yes. He later said he didn't think about it, and just went with it. Hadn't planned it. He cut and run just like that, after I decided to date him and support him emotionally and financially when I wasn't fully capable of it at the time. I stuck by him, even when I was discouraged that he didn't possess some of the traits I wanted in a future partner. One day we were fine, the next he just left, when he could have chosen to step back and we could have talked more.

But I loved him, regardless. I loved him despite his flaws, but he couldn't look past mine. I regret not listening more, I really do, but it's hard sometimes with two internships, college, and a job. But I take responsibility as well.

I want to blame something. Maybe that he never really had a healthy relationship to model from in his life. But maybe we really weren't compatible. And stupid, stubborn me would give him a second chance.

For whatever reason, I decided to look at his social media after I had deleted him off everything. From what I saw, it looks like he misses me too, but I think he's too stubborn to admit it and apologize. Then I texted him... like I really expected a response. I induced two anxiety attacks for no reason. The past two days I had woken up feeling not depressed, and able to eat, and I just relapsed. Self destruction can be so tempting.

I went really more properly NC 12 days ago. I'm trying so hard to keep my head above water. I have friends and parents who love me, a therapist, and things I can do to distract myself, but I'm so tired of going through this again. I hate not being able to sleep or eat, the anxiety attacks, the constant wondering how he is, the loneliness, the depression so bad I can't get out of bed, and the overwhelming urge to talk to him. I sometimes feel like the easiest way to get over this is to do what I did last time: get angry. But I don't want to.

All of this, and I logically know that he probably isn't the one, there are better people out there, and I have to move on."

Some people know him from Joe Budden's podcast, but he's been around for a minute, working with the video director Aristotle Torres and MTV, etc. etc. etc. And it's an incredible listen, he has a lot of great stories.

...including the fact that he was a Def Jam intern right when Kanye was putting out MBDTF.

https://soundcloud.com/awasteoftime/121-rory-farrell

Rory says:

I was in meetings that interns were not supposed to be in. Like, I was in some shit that they would never be like, ""Yo, you have this kid here for one month? Get him the fuck out of here!"" I could say this, I guess, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has been out long enough..sigh...

Kanye comes in (the Def Jam offices) in July -- when did it come out, November of 2009? 2010? He came in, ""Runaway"" was about 20 minutes long and of course Kanye made us listen to all 20 minutes. This was the Rosewood era...so, the Taylor Swift shit happened, he disappeared to Paris. No one had seen him. He shows up out of nowhere at the Def Jam offices like Lupe and Nas trying to get their albums out, in a full suit. He has - I want to say Don C's son, but don't quote me - there's a child dressed identical to him, carrying a Louis Vuitton bag. Comes in and is throwing a fit at how shitty everyone is dressed. So he says, ""I'm not doing business today unless everyone here is wearing a suit."" So the next day, people are scrambling to find - not just regular suits - black suits, white shirts, black ties. And of course they're not gonna look like what Kanye buys. Everyone comes into the office looking like a terrible funeral. I went to H&amp;M, I had no money. I looked a mess, a lot of execs I won't name looked worse than me.

He comes in, the child opens up his Louis Vuitton bag, throws a blanket over the conference table. Takes out two goblets - the medieval wine glasses. Pours him either white wine or water, it was in one of those unmarked bottles. And Kanye says, ""I'm parched. We can begin now.""

He then takes out his laptop and begins playing My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. At this time, it was called Donda's Boy, I don't know if that ever went out but it was called Donda's Boy and the idea was that it was going to be 10 tracks, each of them 10 minutes long. Runaway was 20 minutes long, Pusha wasn't on it. Kanye was singing for 15 minutes of it, at the end. What was the shit he put out on Hot97 with Beyonce? ""See Me Now."" It didn't make the album. He played that without Beyonce but it had Beyonce on it on the radio, she must've recorded it an hour after that meeting. It was him just singing the hook. ""All of the Lights"" without Rihanna or The-Dream, it was all Kanye. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy but it was just Kanye West. And it was amazing. "

The Way Way Back

It's kind of a funny story

The Duff

Charlie Bartlett

The Kings of Summer

The Spectacular Now

Paper towns

There were some others recommendations but to be honest I enjoy movies that are more recent and not very old.

Apart from these I also enjoy silly-ish movies like The Internship, Wedding Crashers, everything starring Seth Rogen, Due Date, I Love You, Man, Forgetting Sarah Marshall etc. Generally something that's enjoyable even if it's slightly cliche or predictable.

Thanks for your time!"

6e85to,24,2017-05-30,Levimasole.....A fact finding mission.,lessharm,DNMUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/DNMUK/comments/6e85to/levimasolea_fact_finding_mission/,"After reading some of the comments on the coke EC test results post I got the feeling that some ambiguity exists with regards to the toxicity of levimasole. I went on a mission researching medical literature to try and understand the level of threat levimasole contamination poses. I have previously responded in a thread about my own views about levimasole which I will repeat before the nitty gritty stuff. The amount of cocaine that has levimasole in it is very high (some government reports stretch to around 30% of cocaine tested although often this was in the context of hotspots). Using logic and ignoring potentially biased medical literature, the sheer number of people around the world using cocaine would lead one to expect a much higher level of levimasole toxicity reporting in medical literature but the reality is that reports remain infreqeunt and revolve around case reports (studying one or a few cases as oppose to using scientific methodology to rule out other factors etc). This made me question if the problem is exagerated. The simple fact that stands against my personal view is that none of the problems associated with its use have mandatory reporting in health governing, as oppose to say TB infection which has to be reported to a public health body for every newly diagnosed infection. The result is that a large number of incidents maybe treated by doctors and not reported however the medics lust for publications in journals would suggest that if a trend was emerging someone would have capitalised.

Levimasole is a drug that has been used to treat parasitic infection in humans and mammals since then 1960s. It is considered an essential medicine by the WHO, bearing in mind parasitic infections are far more common in third world countries and their impact is more pronounced as they tend to spread quicker in improvished areas. Its removal from UK and US prescribed drugs lists was due to the availability of newer drugs that have less side-effects and better results. The dose used in this context was 50 - 150mg given as a single dose and repeated in 2 weeks if no improvement. It is worth noting that reports of 'major' side-effects are lacking from this indication however studies of its anti-parasitic effect in humans have not been repeated in over 15 years (only english medical literature reviewed).

More recently (last 5 years) several reports of patients who have admitted to taking cocaine have emerged after they developed agranulocytosis (lack of white blood cells to and lack of immune response), vasculitis (immune cells attacking blood vessels of the smaller size causing brusing in joints or skin and rashes) and skin lesions which have in very rare cases led to destruction of flesh and appearance of ulcers/rashes. Agranulocytosis is very rare 0.05% - 5% however it is a very serious condition and can cause little symptoms until a serious infection develops. The medical literature cannot be exact as to the actual rate of this risk as there are no large studies of patients who have had this problem purely from cocaine contamination and in the reports authors failed to rule out other causes as often patients did not get asked or disclosed their full drug history. This means that other factors could be in play. Vasculitis is less serious although can cause significant damage to blood vessels and requires treatment with steroids. A large number of reports failed to positively identify levimasole in urine due to its very short half-life and quick excretion and few went on to look for metabolites using more detailed techniques, ie some evidence in this regard is almost anecdotal.

More recently it has been used as an immune modulator in the treatment of some cancers. The dosages used in this regard are much higher. One report of &lt;20 cases in Taiwan collected adverse reactions in patients recieving as little as 100mg per day for 1 week and as much as 750mg per day. One patient in the report developed symptoms after 6 months of treatment at 225mg per day. These patients developed a very rare brain condition that caused lesions in the brain and wekaness of muscles. The majority of these patients were taking the drug for rhematoid arthritis. All cases resolved after stopping the drug.

Cases of agranulocytosis seem to be more likely with iv cocaine or smoking crack although the samples were not large enough to make this trend a likely fact. Of those cases almost all developed problems in the 2-6 weeks after using cociane. The majority had subtle symptoms of fever, aching joints, skin rashes of any kind and bad guts before major infection led to hospital admission. Again it is impossible to comment on how likely this is in the particular context of levimasole in cocaine but given the overall risk of agranulocytosis being so low in general use rare would be reasonable quantification of risk. Another point worth mentioning here is that one of the main methods of treating cancer is supressing immunity which means that agranulocytosis can happen with a lot of chemotherapy drugs. This may cause the cancer treating community of doctors to take this problem far less seriously so again it could be under reported.

What can be taken away from all of this IMO is:

1) problems from levimasole are very rare and it is still used to this day for treating patients with relatively few problems.

2) the dose does not seem to play a part in severity or likelihood of a reaction however co-exisiting illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, the use of other medicines and having a rare genetic subtype maybe more significant than dose

3) Infrequent use is probably safe however regular/daily users probably need to be more cautious

4) Symptoms develop weeks after intake so being vigilant with regards to unexplained symptoms particularly fever, excessive tiredness, skin rashes, ulcers, joint or neurological problems should be taken very seriously or at least met with immediate cesation of taking cocaine

5) By keeping an eye out for symptoms it is plausible that stopping cocaine EARLY if concern develops should be sufficient to prevent any further problems

This is by no means a medical report. I am a stranger and this is the internet so please do your own research but I hope this forms a good starting point. Would be great to hear everyone's thoughts.

Looking for some advice on how to get started searching for an entry level software sales role (BDR, inside sales, etc.) in Toronto. I would prefer to get a role with a larger organization (SAP, Oracle, IBM, etc.) because I think the training is valuable but I am open to suggestions. Here is a little bit about me: 


* Recent Engineering Graduate (Management/Systems/Industrial whatever you want to call it)

* CGPA: 3.80+ (4.0 Scale)


* Solid 12 month Internship with solid references although not sales related whatsoever 


* Would like to begin a career in sales for a multitude of reasons:


* I understand the value of communication skills and the ability to sell (products and ideas); I would love a job the forces me to hone these skills and push myself


* Software sales because I have a technical background and enjoy working with/learning new tech

* I would like to have the opportunity to be in a client facing role in the future. I can get a job as an analyst at a F500 org but the repetitive nature of those job tasks may not fit with my personality (I get bored easily)

* I don’t mind taking a ‘risky’ job right out of university when I don’t have too many responsibilities 

* More reasons


I am assuming that the hiring period is over for a lot of these organizations with respect to new graduates but I also know that an email to the right person can go a long way. Furthermore, most of the information on the organization websites pertains to students in the US. 
I am hoping some of you can tell me what the best strategy is. What sort of opportunities should I be looking for and who should I email (recruiters, BDRS, AEs). Any sort of help is much appreciated.

- How do you like working for X?

And I'll probably have her look at my resume to get some feedback. 

Her company also tend to hire more Ivy League / top tier schools in the nations so I doubt I am going to get in, but she did say she can help with internships (I don't know with her company, but she did intern at Google 2x in her undergrad). As of right now, I'm going into my junior year and currently in a developer program at another San Francisco tech company.

How did he lose his job?  It was slow, and hopefully painful.  In January, Andanar lost his cool and told Filipinos to ""[go to hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5pmwp1/andanar_to_dutertes_trolls_go_to_hell/)"".

More than just slamming the Filipino populace, Andanar showed arrogance by alienating the very people who should have been his partners while he is in office: the media.  And not just [foreign media](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/61kmeg/andanar_asks_bacolod_crowd_who_would_you_believe/), but those covering the Palace and senate.

The situation became too much, that [reporters banded together](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5v8fkq/unprecedented_feat_andanar_unites_unorganized/) against a common enemy: ANDANAR HIMSELF.  

I mean who could blame them when Andanar went on record at that presidential podium, accusing media of [accepting $1,000 as bribes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5va28c/andanar_loses_cool_over_questions_about_1k_bribe/)  As if his earlier accustations of [being inaccurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5ookl4/palace_media_slam_andanar_over_misreporting_tirade/) is not enough.

Don't pick fights with the people you're working with.  Andanar even tried to make peace by making himself the surprise guest in a dinner party for media practitioners hosted by no less than Koko Pimentel.  While they rehearsed a skit, declaring themselves as a new loveteam *daw* and that they should be called **Koko Martin**, they were not able to deliver that spiel.  As this [picture reveals](https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/1AFAD5B488854035AFEE4F975F46D0A8/17094042_10154992531417954_454894233_n-1_1AFAD5B488854035AFEE4F975F46D0A8.jpg), it did not go well.  He was ignored by the reporters.  [Those who were there left instantly, those who were there but hungry ate and then left, and those on the way didn't bother to show up anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5x1dud/all_is_not_well_between_andanar_and_senate_media/deehu3p/)

And yes, the [hard questions continued](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5vfp9n/sabong_over_ouster_plot_palace_journos_to_andanar/), with media people doubting Andanar's pronouncements and poked fun at him using their respective publications every chance they get.

Not only that, Andanar seems to understand facts on his own, [contradicting fellow spokesman Abella](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5u63ng/just_another_day_in_philippine_politics/) on a lot of things, and then discovered to be the one with the wild imagination.

On top of that, Andanar does not know a lot of things, [including how to do his job](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5nvggw/when_stupid_gets_called_out/).

Now is it any wonder Andanar wanted to get rid of mainstream media and [replace them with bloggers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5v2ohr/andanar_is_gathering_all_the_bloggers_would_like/) that ~~he has paid to like him~~ he says echoes the voice of the people?  Is it also a wonder that he has [six marine bodyguards](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5z5m4o/alt_malacanang_revelations/), paid for by you and me?  

These bloggers that he visited personally, no matter where they were?  ~~using our taxes for plane fare and accommodations~~ Such as the woman who runs [the Maharlika Blog](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/STID-84SiD0/0.jpg), [Ethel Constantino and the staffers of the hacks newspaper](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/2e6e9f_e213e2574a0c4e339871517bb22376e4~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_467,h_271/2e6e9f_e213e2574a0c4e339871517bb22376e4~mv2.jpg), both of whom are in the States.  He also reportedly visited [Sass](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1tiTmQWIAErQQR.jpg), together with TP in Europe.

And is it any wonder that he has [been depressed](https://twitter.com/AltMalacanang/status/840766349303414784) of late?

And even though he does not have daily interactions with Palace media anymore, he's still [afraid of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/6e6kzg/andanar_hides_from_media_after_new_pcoo_blunders/)

Just for fun.  Here's a photo of him when he [first accepted the job](http://imgur.com/a/854LM), and here is one of him a [few months ago while doing his job](http://imgur.com/a/sVBGE), and here is his [most recent media photo](https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/8CCF483B2FD14A8CB36BEAABF19182A5/20170530-pcoo-andanar-office_8CCF483B2FD14A8CB36BEAABF19182A5.jpg).

6e900a,134,2017-05-30,AMA - Achievement Hunter Editor Neal,roosterteeth,roosterteeth,https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/comments/6e900a/ama_achievement_hunter_editor_neal/,"We're back! This week we have AH Editor /u/AH_Neal

Neal original answered questions about GTAV edits. If you have any more questions about that videos or anything else he does, ask away! Like last time, here's what he's already answered so there aren't any repeats:

**What advice do you have for someone new to editing? What should I do or shouldn't do?**

If you want to be an editor, get you hands on some software and some footage and start editing.  Practice makes perfect, and every craft takes years to master.  The difference between a professional with 3 years experience and one with 7 years is huge, but you can typically find work as an assistant editor or freelance editor with just a couple years of experience, a one to two-minute demo reel, and a professional website.  If you are in school, use school computers and edit videos for an AV club.  Almost no one judges you by your college work, but you can learn the basics and experiment in a safe environment with people your own age.

The most important thing for finding work and improving is to find mentors and network through them.  Use every opportunity you have to meet professional editors who work on projects that interest you.  Offer to buy them lunch in exchange for advice, or offer to assist them on their next project.  Try to snag an internship with a post-production house or small-scale studio.  If you work hard and are well-liked, these professionals will start offering you paid gigs as their assistants, or they will recommend you for projects that can't afford them or they are too busy to take.  The larger your network, the more success you'll have.

Remember to think of yourself as a business with a brand.  Read articles with tips for entrepreneurs and freelance creatives, and treat every client with respect.  You never know which one will end up recommending you for your next big break.

**how did you start with AH? Did you know all the editing tricks before hand?**

My first video edits were for high school assignments and my own short film projects when I was in high school, and I continued to edit videos throughout college.  I had been freelance editing in Austin for a year before Achievement Hunter hired me, working for a variety of clients as both an editor and an assistant editor.  I learned most of the software tricks and shortcuts over time, but occasionally I would watch an online tutorial to learn something I needed to know.

I started working for Achievement Hunter because of a referral from a friend and colleague who worked in the Live Action department.  I freelanced for two days for the Day of Doom sponsored project.  Five days later, Lindsay Jones offered me a full-time position to help fill out the AH post team.  It took a few weeks for me to learn how to edit Let's Plays in particular, as I had rarely used the multi-cam function in Premiere, and I was more adept at editing live action shoots based on scripts.  But thanks to my experience with Premiere and video editing in general, I adapted quickly to the work, and I now feel quite comfortable cutting the content we produce.

**Is the AH editor job the best job you e ever had?**

My first job was as a lifeguard at a YMCA. I then worked a summer as a janitor at a label-making factory, then another summer as a carpenter's assistant.  I didn't work as a full-time filmmaker until I began freelancing in Austin in 2015.

Being a freelance video editor was actually pretty exciting, since every project was different and I had to work with a bunch of clients.  Part of the excitement came from not knowing where I'd be working the next month, though, or if I'd have work at all. So while I do miss the variety of work from that period, I definitely prefer the stable job at Rooster Teeth right now.  I get to come in every day and work with cool and friendly people, we get to make fun, dumb content that makes a LOT of people really happy, and I get to make thumbnails in Photoshop, which I never had to do before and I really, really like doing!  Plus, they feed me sometimes. So yeah, best job ever.

**who's GTA footage is the bestest and why is it Gavin's?**

Gavin gives me the best GTA footage because he is the worst player at GTA.  Whenever he dies first in some sort of minigame, such as Stunters Vs. Snipers or Top Fun, he is savvy enough to turn of his HUD display and provide some neat camera shots for me to work into the edit.  So thanks for sucking, Gavin!

**Who is your favorite to cut to, in terms of things they do, things that happen to them in game, and their reaction?**

Geoff.  If Geoff is screaming, you've got to cut to Geoff, because something absolutely amazing is happening to him.

**are facecam videos more difficult or just fun for you? always more fun imo, but I don't know if that's just me lul**

In general, I prefer watching videos with facecam (my favorite series we make is Let's Play - Gmod: Murder), but editing with them typically takes more time.  One of the reasons is that our webcams and capture software goof up occasionally, and will get out of sync with the audio and gameplay. This means that part way into the edit I may have to go back, hide a cut to the camera, and adjust the timing for part of the edit just to get the lips moving to the right words coming out of the face holes.  They also tax the computer's processor and graphics card more than a simple nameburn would, so when bigger projects slow down I sometimes have to disable the webcam while I edit, then turn them back on for my polish pass.  Facecams also make it harder to use editing tricks that tighten the conversation and shorten the overall video, since the audience is more likely to notice a jump cut.

That said, editing with webcams can be really fun, because I get another element to play with.  A good example is the GTA V when Jeremy was in his high-chair, which segues into our next question…

**how did you react editing the GTAV where jeremy was raised up high**

Let me tell you, opening those files was an interesting moment.  You wouldn't know it to look at the finished project, but the original recording was almost an hour and forty minute long! So right from the get-go, I knew this would take more time to cut than a typical Let's Play.  I rather enjoyed editing the opening shot, where I put Michael and Gavin's face on the bottom of the screen and had Jeremy's camera looking down on them.

I also enjoyed replacing Ryan's facecam since he had lost his capture (usually that is due to a computer error). I took a GIF I found on an image search, re positioned it, cropped it, and slowed it down to a crawl so that it would change throughout the Let's Play.  I then cut to Ryan's channel sparingly, so that people could enjoy getting to see Michael, Gavin, and Jeremy's faces as much as possible, since it was such a treat.  If there had just been nameburns I probably would have cut to Ryan more often.

Then there was this whole bit where pizza showed up and they started stuffing their faces on camera. Normally I would have tried to cut that almost entirely, but between the webcams and the documentary-esque aspect of showing Michael hand Jeremy his slice, I had to keep most of it in.  Most of the time saved was cut between the missions, while Ryan was on his way to the CEO building, but I tried to keep the best moments in while making it feel like he got there at a natural pace.

All in all, that particular episode took me about three days of work to edit, which is twice as long as a typical episode of Let's Play - GTA V, but what you end up with is a very fun, long, and unique episode, so I never regretted the extra time it took.

**I understand the video part but how do You manage the audio??? That's a pain for me with only 5 minutes videos.**

Great question, Leo.  When I first joined the team, editing the audio drove me nuts!!! I had to learn to trust the audio compressor Trevor had preset to level their voices, and try not to be so picky about every single line of conversation.  When you are trying to cut a 40 minute video in a single day, you simply don't have time to get things perfect.  I've always been very particular about audio, so that was the hardest lesson for me to learn coming into this team.
Now I mostly set up the audio before I start cutting, boosting each person's gain just enough for the compressor to level them out comparably. I then use the pen tool while I edit the video, lowering the volume of less important conversation threads by about -5 dB and boosting important lines by +2 dB.  I only do this if I can't hear what was said, not based on the audio meters.  Occasionally I use the blade tool and cut out stretches of prolonged silence in a track to eliminate room tone/echo, or to remove something someone said that can't be published (such as something covered by the company's Non-Disclosure Agreement).  

** what is the most technically complicated yet satisfying thing you've done while editing?**

[For this video](https://youtu.be/rlst_EQxcIo), I created a multi-cam track that had four channels. One was of Jeremy's game capture, nameburn, and the live action camera; the second was Jack's game capture, nameburn, and the live action camera; the third was of the live action camera with both game captures at the bottom; and the fourth was of the live action footage without any game capture at all.  I then exported each of these channels as a low-res proxy, replaced their sequences with these proxies, edited the video (this part was now super simple!), then replaced the proxies with the full-res sequences.   

**do you cheer a little bit every time someone loses footage because it's one less screen to edit?**

It's always a bummer when we lose footage, because it gives me less flexibility when it comes to creating the best possible video.  That said, I do king of like it when it goes from five angles to four, because the multi-cam function in Premiere Pro is easier to use with four cameras, as all four fit well together into a single window.

**how do you put up with the dumb editing requests from the AH crew?**

If the guys make a request for a special gag edit part way through the video, I have to weigh whether the joke is worth the time it would take to get it ready. Sometimes there are copyright or technical hurdles to their request, so I just cop out. [Example](https://youtu.be/5a5WCvUyKmQ?t=2m33s)

Other times, I will go all out for a gag edit because I have the time and feel inspired. [Example](https://youtu.be/bFvOB0jDX8E?t=3m57s)


And occasionally, I'll deliberately screw them by doing the gag in a way that would annoy them but still amuse the community. [Example](https://youtu.be/uTXCcnqkeak?t=7m37s)

So long as we are ahead of schedule, these requests are a fun opportunity to get creative, so I usually appreciate them.

**Are you ever tempted to spend longer on a video than you need to? Are there times when you have to make yourself call it 'done'?**

Yes.  There have been days when I need to edit an entire forty-plus minute video with five angles and facecams, plus create the thumbnail and metadata, before leaving the office.  You usually don't get to do a polish pass on those edits, so you trust your cut and push through to beat the clock.  Luckily, these situations are the exception and not the norm.

**Whos capture do you choose for GTAV during epic crashes or explosions?**

Whichever angle looks the best! These days I prefer to cut from the person getting blown up right as the explosion starts, to whichever nearby angle can see the explosion the best. This way we get fewer ""WASTED"" shots, and more variety in the angles.

**UPDATE** Thanks everyone! "

6eadg3,7,2017-05-30,Farming (Part 2): A Farewell,A_Decent_Man,CollapseSupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/comments/6eadg3/farming_part_2_a_farewell/,"Hello Community,

I would like to take this opportunity to expand upon my experience as a farm intern that I started with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/comments/67j7f9/farming_part_1/?st=j3c2i8pn&amp;sh=180a2096) post, and conclude with a farewell (at least for now).

I have been at my position for about 1 and one half months, which is approximately one quarter of the total internship length (I anticipate moving on from this position around mid-October, give or take). Since my original posting, some developments have occurred in my life.

The other long-term WWOOFer, who I had anticipated spending the duration of the season with, has since moved on to pursue an opportunity elsewhere as a farm intern amidst the San Juan islands of Washington State. It was a tough pill to swallow, especially for the farm hosts because of how they had relied on his presence for the duration of the season to see the season through. From my perspective though, I empathized more with his position: he was looking for a more formalized and rigorous opportunity that would prioritize educational development in parallel to farm management, something he did not feel he could find here after two months of being on the job. It sucks to have him go back on his commitment, and see the way he is disparaged by the managers and my parents alike after I told them about it, but I feel for him. He was nothing short of a hard and friendly worker, trying to figure out his path in life, that jumped an opportunity that he felt he could get more out of. As someone in the same situation, I understand his rationale. 


Beyond that, it’s been tough adjusting to life here without him, but at the same time, I am appreciative of the opportunity to reconcile with the change. For those who have been following this sub and my postings, you know I am developing my own sense of spirituality, in large part in response to the world that I’ve known coming under threat of collapse. Because of this, I am specifically exploring the thought of Buddhism, Taoism, and broader Eastern Philosophy, ways of thinking that have recognized that Life is Change, Life is Interdependent, and Life is Impermanent. As a young man in his early 20s, I feel that if I develop these ideals now, they will help me establish a way of life I can take solace in for the long run amidst a world that, for all intents and purposes, is on the decline. 



One of the biggest struggles I have had to come to terms with is my own sense of self. My position allows me to visit my family, as frequently as every week if I so choose. After the last visit, though, I have been having a really tough time of being face to face with my Mom and Dad. I don’t feel secure or confident with my own portrayal of myself in their presence. I will often times seclude myself in my room, and it had gotten to a point in which my Mom called me out on it, on my absence. We talked about it, and we came to the decision that I just needed some time and space away from them, in order to figure myself out, without being tied to an ideal about how I should be among them. My parents are still together (something that cannot be said for many of my friends’ families), and I still have a home in the same childhood house I’ve only ever known. But there is a feeling that I cannot move on with my own life as long as that home remains. I feel so much has changed since I’ve grown up and graduated both high school and college, that that house is just a reminder of things that no longer are, especially as I have this realization that the world I have to look forward to could be so utterly different than the world I grew up with. 


As I move forward with my life, I am giving significant thought to where I see myself in the short and long term. Once this internship wraps, I hope to move on down an agricultural path, with a hope to travel beyond just Washington state. I have my eye on a specific internship program in Oregon, as well as keeping my options open for the broader United States, and potentially even abroad (I have a vested interest in British Columbia, and currently one of my best friends goes to school there, and is willing to explore opportunities together). The more I adjust to and feel comfortable with my current internship, the more I am learning about openings that my current hosts can hook me up with, too. One of the greatest advantages of working in Ag is how much potential there is across the country and across the world, and that is something I would like to be able to take advantage of. In that same vein, for those who don’t know, I also have a vested interest in the cannabis industry, and how that is one market that is ever-expanding amidst an economy that is by and large becoming more and more stagnant. While I would not like to see myself in that industry for the long-haul, it could be a valuable jumping off point for a career in a new location/abroad, and be profitable in the short-term to fund ventures that I am genuinely interested in (i.e. Homesteading, permaculture, localized food production and community building, etc). 


Lastly, as you can see from my posting title, I am saying goodbye to this community. At least as /u/A_Decent_Man. I feel this profile has outlived its use. I am turning over stewardship of /r/CollapseSupport to /u/Xanthotic and /u/whereigohereiam, two people among us who I feel am more than capable of having this sub’s best interest in mind. I still plan to be around occasionally under a different profile, and those who are perceptive enough may even be able to make the connection ;)


Thank you all for reading and I would appreciate any and all questions, responses, advice or guidance and I wish you all the best as we cope with what lies ahead. 


Thank you,


/u/A_Decent_Man

I am considering getting a loan from Avant and paying it off when I get paid next week. The payroll system was unable to register my hours from last week for which I was supposed to be paid this week(Thursday). This was due to last week being my first week as an intern there. 
  
I read about asking your manager for an early paycheck under these circumstances, but 1. my manager is on vacation until next week, 2. I'm not sure if the balance would show up on time.  
  
However, I work at IBM, and that was one of the examples of a company with cash laying around so I should probably just ask tomorrow.   
  
Should I just leave the loan to the last minute just in case I can't get a paycheck early?

* [[Day 217.18. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdVdBbAJK8)
  *Okay. It stayed 217 I think this is 18
  * Wow Wow it seems like the days are forever
  * I just got done interviewing Rod Wheeler he was sitting right here a couple of feet away right there with Jason Goodman and we just got a call from H.A. Goodman
  * So I think we're going to do a phone interview tomorrow and to kind of tie it together join forces whatever
  * And I think everybody is in the same boat--we just all want just truth and to come forward
  * So I won't go through I post on crowd source the truths on Jason's channel the feedback, so if you want to see the feedback from the interview you can go there
  * I'm getting--I've had many people send me the two guys that got killed in South Carolina the day after Seth Rich was murdered
  * And this kill the killer thing goes all the way back to Arkansas I've seen it so many times it's just such a repeating pattern
  * And--it's almost like Anthony Weiner goes over--gets two guys with the Guatemalan embassy and then goes home--to sync his Blackberry with MWW
  * Now I'm not saying that's exactly what happened--he might have synced his blackberry first, and then got the two killers at the Guatemalan embassy, or maybe got coffee in there somewhere, but that seems to be this repeating pattern
  * And this threatening the parents and then putting a PR person in front of the parents seems to be this repeating pattern all the way back to Arkansas
  * Now having said that Brad Bauman we would confirm tonight Brad Bauman was in every meeting with the parents
  * And I do think this is this is hardball and the one thing after being on Washington two weeks here
  * It's just all about intimidation
  * It's all about intimidation both on the Republican side and the Democratic side
  * And it really is a--the deep state is a serious thing, and it really does need to get cleaned up
  * If you let it go the one thing I've learned is if you let it go it just gets worse and worse and worse
  * If you let adult organ harvesting go you get the child organ harvesting at double the rates
  * When Dana Priest it our article about all the private security firms that were doing surveillance on innocent Americans, when when that was 2000, if you let that go four years later you end up with 8,000
  * G4S type firms of--the Booz Allen type firms--where you're hiring--your tax dollars--are hiring surveillance firms to come back at you
  * So we're going to look at Aguillera
  * This Christopher Wits Diamont--Christopher Wits Diamont called me tonight, and sent me a lot of really kind of compelling information about this Aguilera
  * I just think of Christina Aguilera's brother being shot in Myrtle Beach, along with the partner
  * And he said that he was not only an operative for Hillary Clinton but also a senior person
  * Now if the day after Rich rich is killed a senior operative is killed
  * I mean this reminds me so much of the Arshad Mahmood killings and the other MS-13 cleanup killings in Long Island, Long Island serial killer
  * That that really has to be explored because that's again this is repeating pattern of modus operandi
  * So that's my last thoughts for the evening
  * Jason Goodman will put up the interview the cut interview probably in about a week, because we have to go through Rod Wheelers attorney for final approval, but that's the initial impressions for today
  * And we look forward to another big day tomorrow hopefully we will chat with AJ Goodman and compare notes 

---
* [[Day 217.19. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ0pmVl_MuM)
  * Okay. Day 217 this is I think 18
  * We are really trying to get to sleep, but two more breaking things at the end of the night here
  * Muller may declare state secrets for the South Ridge case
  * {{ Jason shakes head in disgust }}
   * So now we really only have--if you sweep away the school play stuff--we only have four pieces of information
   * The FBI went to get the laptop, they went to get the phone, we have FBI bullets perhaps and now we've got Mueller declaring state secrets
   * J: If he does that is just your number one indicator that something screwy is afoot
  * Yeah I mean if that's not a clamp on what the metadata is for Seth Rich and McFadden talking back and forth, I don't know what is
  * The other one is Ray McGovern--Ray McGovern is also weighing in
  * 40 or 50 year, 45 year FBI and CIA guys saying that
  * J: vouching for Murray Craig Murray
  * Craig Murray's saying he the ambassador saying I picked up thumb drive in American University on the 22nd of September
  * J: and McGovern it was
  * For WikiLeaks
  * J: And McGovern is important because Craig Murray is not allowed into the United States
  * Right
  * J: and United States and Uzbekisant he said are the only two countries that won't allow him in but
  * And that's because he told too much truth about torture in Uzbekistan and the CIA kind of took him out with the MI6
  * But but when you have a 45 year vet of the Intelligence Agency talking about the deep state
  * And talking about how that drop did happen
  * J: incredible journalists
  * Yeah he's great and but here's what I want to do I run all these things to ground
  * I want to actually go to the exact spot
  * I want Craig Murray or Ray McGovern to guide me
  * We went back by the dumpster I think that's where it was backed by the busses on the upper side of the campus
  * But I want, for credibility, I want Craig Murray to tell me exactly where he got the thumb drive
  * J: can Craig Murray contact us? Does anyone in the network have any kind of...
  * He has a Twitter and I would just kind of send this out to Craig
  * J: That would be so great if we could
  * I will do a live thing. We can do that tomorrow morning we'll walk directly when--Craig Mary might be getting this right now at 8 o'clock
  * J: That'd be great
  * We'll walk directly to where the to the exact spot
  * J: I would like to go to England and interview Craig Murray
  * We could do that as well I first would like to reenact where Craig Murray got that thumb drive
  * And then who did he get it from?
  * How tall--start with a metadata--how tall was he? Build, race, accent, nationality?
  * J: Ws it Eric Braverman?
  * I think was Eric Braverman
  * But it might not be
  * It might have been--it could have been Braverman tried to pass the drive I still think and Chelsea on the 15th
  * J: thumb drive
  * The thumb drive
  * He tried to pass the thumb drive in Chelsea
  * And they blew it up
  * J: Blew up the bomb [pressure cooker bomb] right in september
  * But I think Eric Braverman may have said, ""I'm gonna go, I'm gonna,""
  * I think maybe Craig Murray comes over as a second attempt at getting the thumb drive and Braverman gets it
  * Why? Because McFadden dies that night the handoff happens, and then Braverman goes to the embassy the next morning
  * J: I think we should say it again, because people don't put enough attention on the fact that Gavin McFadden, Jon Jones, Mike Ratner,
  * Mike Ratner all died within three months
  * J: Seth Rich, Shawn Lucas
  * And then there's the two MS-13 guys that died in...the day after Rich dies in South Carolina
  * If those are attached to Hillary's campaign which were working on Aguilera that's seven
  * J: what about the Federal prosecutor who washed up in Florida?
  * Well that that wasn't in the three months stretch, but that's another one that's
  * J: No but there's just so many people related to this that are just dropping like flies
  * So we got to reenact the drop for Craig Murray to the exact spot
  * And again like a like a good cross-examiner would do, they'd say, ""oh I got a thing over in Louisiana""
  * Well okay we're going to leave it that? No, no: ""What city. What--what Park Bench. Was it what time of day was it?""
  * Because then we can verify it with with cameras
  * American University is going to have cameras all over the place
  * So we're going to be able to verify that--there's going to be people who were at the speech. Even he gave a speech there that day so they're going to say, ""what did he do before or after the speech?""
  * Somebody's going to tour the campus with him, and showing them around in the campus
  * He's going to have I want to know exactly what time of day
  * And we just know it's a wooded area
  * We need to get very specific well
  * J: I think we just need him to get in touch yeah
  * So please tweet this to Craig Murray
  * And we'll do the walk
  * We'll reenact the handoff tomorrow morning

---
* [[Day 218.1 Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Byq5rFQAwh0)
  * Okay. Day 218 this is part 1
  * Here behind me, the FBI vault in Clarksburg West Virginia
  * No actually that's not
  * We're still in Washington DC, but it's not far from here
  * And that's where I think the laptops and Blackberries have been moved from Lorton Virginia
  * If you go to Crowdsource the Truth, you can have a more extensive discussion
  * But a lot of people think Comey declaring state secrets in the Seth Rich case
  * J: ""Mueller""
  * G:  is going to shut it down, actually it's Mueller, excuse me Mueller.
  * Mueller is going to shut it down with state secrets
  * Actually that's a good thing--that's that's great metadata, because we interviewed Rod last night
  * He said door number one was robbery
  * Door number two was a family issue
  * Door number three was work. work.
  * Well this is this is eliminating all three of those and creating a door number four, which is WikiLeaks
  * The only way this could be Muller, and Muller signing a PR person, Pat Hall--I think is the name--is because it's WikiLeaks
  * Now we have a third piece of metadata, which is
   * Mueller, state secrets is one.
   * The FBI confiscating the cell phone and the FBI confiscating the laptop [is 2]
   * And then the only other piece of data really is Seth Rich's own testimony which is 1222 is the address he lives at
  * So the only thing you can take all the school play stuff out of it, and the only thing you can conclude as the FBI raid was at 1222 [is 3] and they got his phone and his laptop and it had state secrets on it that's the only thing you can conclude from the metadata
  * {{ 1: state secret, 2: 1222 his address, 3: took cellphone and laptop from 1222 -- ***if Seth Rich's murder was a streetside robbery, then why did the FBI take his phone and laptop from his home?*** }}
  
---
* [[Day 218.2. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3iGkqN9Jz0)
  * Okay. Day 218 Seth Rich
  * So the three pieces of metadata I covered in round one
  * First one is Robert Mueller has decleared state secrets--that means it is state secrets
  * He should know his ex director at the FBI -
  * Two: the FBI has his phone
  * Three: the FBI has this laptop that's all we really know for the only testimony we have from the victim is ""I lived at 1222 not 2113""
  * So the fourth or fifth piece of evidence that's still being weighed
  * It came from a very reliable law enforcement source is there's an FBI bullet
  * Now everyone wants me to comment on this burglary that's supposedly happened down at W and Flagler
  * That is a cover to explain the FBI bullet that got pulled out of seth Rich
  * The hospital pulled the bullet out--somebody pulled that bullet out of the third lobe of the liver
  * And now you have to explain how did an FBI bullet get into Seth Rich?
  * The only way you can do that is you have some kind of *hokey robbery*
  * Now there was a robbery.
  * There could have been a robbery--but it for the radio
  * To give the secure radio to the perpetrators
  * Because the reason why you need the radio is you need to know about pursuit, ***you need to know about law enforcement that isn't in on operation***
  * But the FBI bullet:
  * ***The reason why it's in Seth Rich is because the FBI shot Seth Rich***
   
---
* [[Day 218.3. Hillary'Hillarys , Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8c5vphPc8A)
  * Ok Day 218 Part 3
  * National Portrait Gallery behind me over here on the beautiful Verizon Center and F street
  * A couple of blocks from K street.  I still haven't gotten that job as a lobbyist /s
  *  But anyway, the reason why you have to go to Howard, is if Rich has the bullet at the 222 raid, more closer to Lou's Bar and Grill or I say Acre121
  * But if he has that wound in the liver, you have to take him to Howard.
  * You no choice because you have to get that FBI bullet out of him before you take him up the hill to MedStar
  * The reason is you don't want him coming into MedStar as a gunshot wound
  * The reason they leave the discontinuity in the bowel is so there's something wrong with him
  * So what they do at the top of the hill at MedStar is they close the bowel--there's gotta be something left.
  * They don't even know that there's a bullet wound
  * Because it's the same Doctor--it's Dr. Sava, it's Dr. Ateljevich
  * Dr. Ateljevich comes down, pulls the bullet wound [sic] out as Dr. Ateljevich
  * He goes up the hill as Dr. Sava and does the wound-close and closes the discontinuity in the bowel
  
---
* [[Day 218.4. Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko5O2NirfII)
  * Okay. Day 218 part 4
  * Jason Goodman is alive don't worry
  * J: Still Alive
  * National Security Letters. You know what a National Security Letter is?
  * So if I'm the FBI, and I want somebody not to talk and gag them, I can give them what's called a National Security Letter an NSL
  * J: Oh like Sibel Edmonds
  * Yeah NSL Sibel Edmonds
  * J: She talks about that
  * State secrets. I think she even wrote a book called State Secrets
  * {{ 911bs: It's actually called [""Classified Woman: the Sibel Edmonds Story""](https://www.amazon.com/Classified-Woman-Sibel-Edmonds-Story/dp/0615602223/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8), and [here are her other books, including 'Lone Gladio'](https://www.amazon.com/Sibel-D-Edmonds/e/B007XXPJ6W/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1). Here is her listener-supported, alt-media channel, [NewsBud](https://www.newsbud.com/) which I highly recommend }}
  * J: Oh.
  * Anyway people say well the special investigator, Comey, not a special prosecutor special investigator they're trying to make it sound like a special
  * J: Mueller?
  * Mueller.  Mueller.  Did I say Comey again?
  * J: Yeah
  * Because they're so close!
  * J: Mueller Mueller
  * And ANDY
  * J: Isn't he a special prosecutor in the uh [ALLEGED COMEY MEMO NONSENSE]
  * But he's a special investigator..but he doesn't have the subpoena powers, I don't think
  * J: that'll be good question better check that
  * Yeah but anyway everyone says, ""well, don't worry about him declaring state secrets, he can't do that""
  * Well all he has to do is pick up the phone, and call Andy [Andrew McCabe].
  * J: Yeah I mean he was the head of the FBI for years... under...
  * 14 years?
  * So he just picks up the phone and calls Andy and Andy gives the NSLs
  * J: yeah of course
  * Andy NSLs MedStar and he NSL's Howard
  * J: why hasn't he done that already?
  * He's already done it
  * Andy has already done it.
  * J: McCabe
  * McCabe has already done it. He's already done it he wouldn't be saying it now, and introducing it now, and put it bringing in a PR guy now, if it wasn't the cover for something that they've already done
  * So they have already done I believe they've already done it
  * Now Judicial Watch can FOIA
  * So Judicial Watch is tried to FOIA they got rejected, said no response
  * Now they can sue
  * So now the lawsuits coming
  * J: How long does that take?
  * That's going to take forever, but but it does prove that they've declared state secrets 
  * So that is a confirmation that Seth Rich case is a state secret case
  * J: Which means that he's obviously involved with Wikileaks. If it's a street robbery how is that state secrets?
  * Yeah yes I mean that I mean they've proven that part of the case
  * It's like Comey and then the FBI coming out and saying if the desktop sych was how the transfer of the six hundred thousand emails
  * J: Quarters / Coroners here
  * Okay. See you later everybody
  * {{ 911bs: GOV has 20 business days to respond to FOIA, after which you can sue but it's better to contact the FOIA ombudsman first because they can light a fire; if you don't get a response from them within 3 days you ought to start suing, then if you get a response from their activity you can drop the lawsuit.  Judicial Watch is probably burned out on dealing with Ombudsman and just goes straight to suing, which makes sense if you're getting nothing but obstructionism from all of the government.  I would like to see JW file a FOIA for every government document in existence and sue them for each one they do not get within the minimal timeframe the gov is allowed legally }}

* [[Day 218.5 Hillary's Leakers, Hackers, and Henchmen - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquN0GG8FGo)
  *  Okay. Day 128. {{ 218 }} Here is part 5
  * So everyone Jason is working on our second interview
  * I think I'm breaking into two parts one and two
  * Together it's again on the roof
  * It wasn't in Ice Station Zebra conditions with 90 mile an hour winds
  * This one is a little bit better it was like a 85 degree
  * J: 80 mile an hour
  * Yeah it was pretty bad
  * So Jason's doing lot of noise reduction and all that stuff that he does--takes out the hums and errs and and stuff
  * I wanted to talk about Atel and this is just rode rode time and all that
  * But everybody--says oh this is satanic and this is a satanic symbol and all this stuff
  * Actually what they are are tells {{ 911bs: aka 'spy signalling', 'winks', semaphores }} and the reason why you use *tells* in the information, info business, in the Intelligence community is so that you don't have to constantly communicate things
  * For instance let's say you wanted to say 'always interview this police officer'
  * There's going to be five police officers listed
  * And you want them to go to Wingate Robinson ok?
  * Because he went to Georgetown and he knows John Podesta really well
  * So if you're the FBI agent you're going to have to call somebody, and say, ""well who do you want me to take to do the to do the cover story?""
  * Or not the cover story, but who do you want you need an interview, if we have to go and interview one of the five officers that was at the Seth Rich scene supposedly
  * So you say well we'll capitalize it and then we'll put the word 'win' in there because we always win: we're the FBI--we win win win
  * J: So as A J Goodman would say 'all they do is lose lose lose'. That's what they say about the Democrats sorry oh
  * Yeah. The FBI is damn good so don't
  * J: Ya I know I'm just saying just a little plug for AJ yeah
  * So anyway, you would like let's say you have a home that's owned by the Awan brothers
  * You would have the other partner--the fake partner that you're going to dump all the dead on, and you're going to dump all the parking tickets on--will be Winfield. Okay.
  * And again you'll capitalize it in all your press releases
  * So if you see the press release of the five police officers, the first one there is going to be this track super star, running back super star--he's kind of got that he's the GQ I mean he's--he's gonna have a big photo appeal
  * Windgate Robinson hasn't really been brought forward as the superstar yet but he's going to be brought forward
  * J: Well I'm not to release too much but he did come up in our conversation with Rod Wheeler
  * His Sharon came up who linked to Rod Wheeler yesterday
  * Rod Wheeler said, ""why did Sharon WinGate Robinson connect?""
  * J: Very weird right?
  * So that's a set up for, ""Hey this is coming, if we have to go to the police officer, if we get forced into police officer interviews, we're going to go to Wingate Robinson""
  * This guy--you look them up you ran track of Georgetown it was an epic
  * J: Is it a real guy or is that a fake name?
  * No what they do is they take the real name Robinson, and then they add a hyphen in front of it with Wingate, Winfield, Win something {{ wincroft }} and that way you don't have to change the name of the person's real name
  * {{ 911bs: what's the 'gate' part?  The new Watergate? EmailGate? Gatekeeping? LionsGate? Gate to MedStar? White house gate jumper? The Gate the SS crashed? Bill Gates? All the above? }}
  * Now like for instance with doctor Ateljevich down at down at Howard, you have him writing that anonymous, fourth-year intern piece
  * And then all of a sudden now people are trying to guess his name well, they're like oh what are we going to do?
  * So they come up with a character out of what is it, 'Lord of the Rings'? {{ Dr. Dilbro Wingate?  No.. }}
  * Isn't Eowyn...? {{ Ohhh. }} I'm not a Lord of the Rings guy, but Eowyn and I think is the Lord of the Rings guy
  * And of course--it's some blogger, who is the man who loved cat dancing or something that's going to take you off in some wacky directions and then somebody's going to write a blog about how cat dancing is fundamental to this whole thing and--
  * It's not it's just them saying I don't go any further: this is a stop sign.
  * Don't interview doctor Eo-*WIN* [Eownyn] that's a ""no don't do that"".
  * {{ I wonder if Dr. Eo WIN hangs out at LOSE City Bar? }}
  * So it's going to be a solid it's going to be a tell you veg but I'm just trying to say why you would use a towel and why those are important because every time you communicate out to get your story straight, if your story changes, then you need more footprints
  * So tells are really important--whatever you want to call them winks or tells
  * J: And and might be the first time anybody's ever spoken about it on the Internet that I've heard of
  * G: Um. Well. Ok.

  * Okay. Day 218 I think this is six
  * And we're Jason I are having our endless tousle about production quality of that interview who are or release it in this part one part two so--
  * We're just kind of filling the time here with spycraft stuff, until we get to ~~our favorite small sounds[sic]~~Eric Braverman's moms' house in New Jersey and Cherry Hill just over the Ben Franklin Bridge,
  * Not far from Dover, actually where the servers are located for NGP van.
  * J: Oh really?
  * NGP van it's in Dover. It's a little bit further I mean I'm not saying it's ...but in Delaware it's not very far at all from from where she lives
  * GPS: Watch Out: Object on Road Ahead
  * Object on road. Ok. It's not any of
  * J: So long as it's not an IED
  * It's not an IED so we're good
  * So spycraft stuff: the reason why *tells* are important, because as your organization gets bigger, and you start rolling out covert folks
  * I mean the first really great model--and I'm not in any way a Hitler fan, obviously, us being we're Jewish--but Hitler had his bicycle clubs
  * And basically through the bicycle clubs they would go on the end the weekend they do all these activities, and everyone would be like oh gosh Germans love to run around on bicycles
  * {{ 911bs: Now it's civil war and ww2 reenactment groups (nazi cosplay) in america (((and still bike clubs))) }}
  * Well it was the cover for the German Army {{ inaudible }}, Wehrmacht and the SS
  * So there was two levels being trained right under the nose of Europe
  * And you could do the same thing I'm just saying how easy this would be in the United States
  * I'm not saying Rolling Thunder is that organization, but you could take a thing like Rolling Thunder, and then have the bottom 10% being prowler teams {{ recall how HarleyClaus was looking at you }}
  * So again they would have license plates or license plate they would have to make licenses which would have Win somewhere in the last name
  * You really wanted to make an obvious you would capitalize the Win
  * So it'd be GoodWin, Godwyn Winblatt, Winsome, Winfield, Wingay {{Winstone, Winterthur}}
  * You can put win in the middle but sometimes, but that it's hard to read late at night when you pull somebody over
  * But it's basically a tell through JTTF that, ""Hey that let this guy go""
  * A lot of times in the Intelligence business you need to stop traffic you need to stop the target from getting to a drop
  * So you'll pull over a police officer
  * You'll speed you pull over the police officer to get the police officer to stop, and then set up something with the local police,
  * Then you can start saying hey I got to do here's what the next OP is going to be, to really think on your feet quickly
  * So you don't have time to go, ""here's the verification step and then--radio back to Washington DC to check credentials""--you need that tell right on on the license
  * Now if somebody in law enforcement can come back--anybody who's been on JTTF teams (I'm not holding my breath)
  * But anybody who's been on JTTF teams--if you want to come back and verify what I'm saying--we'd be very helpful
  * J: That's crazy
  * Well, I'm just saying that's how you would do covert and then there were certain bicycle clubs which had certain symbols
  * {{ Maltese cross, skull with snake going thru it and dagger, for instance }}
  * And here's where everybody gets off track thinking this is demonic
  * It's just some bicycle clubs were known as the Wehrmacht other Bicycle clubs were the SS--which I can't member how to say in German {{ [[SS = Schutzstaffel]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel) Think of someone shooting a duffel bag full of nazi uniforms }}
  * And the East Germans picked it, right up right after the war for theirs until 1989
  * J: Stassi?
  * Stassi yeah
  * So this isn't something new and it wasn't invented by the CIA, or anything like that, just been around a long time
  * So spycraft Road stories I guess
  * J: That's really cool
  * Yah that's kind of fun

  * So anyway there's going to be an official story coming out sometime this week, that's going to be a bombshell type of thing
  * We don't know who's gonna provide that bombshell yet
  * But I can tell right now by the set up that it's going to be *Wingate Robinson*.
  * Wingate Robinson is going to be the officer
  * He's going to be the GQ guy, he's going to say, ""hey I was there at the site and there's nothing to see here folks. I was there.""
  * J: By GQ you mean a fancy looking guy?
  * Yeah yeah yeah""
  * Again it's a diversion away from 1222 that was over by I can remember street name
  * 1222 that was over by at Lou's City Grill which is the seven-minute block versus the 40 minute long walk
  * J: Hey I just thought of something: Win is a tell. Is LOSE also a tell?
  * Well
  * J: Lou's bar--he's losing his life! I think that's something
  * {{ 911: You guys really need to read my interjections in these transcripts more }}
  * Well let's look at all the Lous around the country.Lou's lous' win and lose?  Ah the losers, all the winners you're good!
  * I think I think you got one on me I'm blushing out that's terrible
  * I got it I got it well let me be - that may be the tell for the day,
  * Win and Lose
  * The targets are always it loses, and the winds are always people that will get them
  * And aren't we a great team for winning for people
  * {{ Jason thumbs up }}
  * No I mean Pantomiming a CIA/FBI person, FBI counterterrorism ***not field***--
  * That we're saving these--we're taking these terrible criminals (that are Germans {{ie: innocent americans on HRC's 'naughty list'}}) and getting their hearts to people who really need them {{ ex: rich, terrible people like Rockefeller, Soros, McCain }} and their scientists, wonderful writers {{ club fed, bill nay, space tyson }} that just happen to give 1M to Hillary Clinton
  * So you're gonna see this Podesta linked to Wingate Robinson that I do believe is coming, in a big way, probably Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday "

___________________
It was an era when many young priests and nuns were advocating social activism at the same time they were questioning the personal and emotional demands of celibacy that the church imposed. And it was a time during which Sister Catherine, according to a colleague, Sister Helen Russell Phillips, had fallen in love with a Jesuit priest.[...]

*Romantic relationship*

John A. ""Pete"" McKeon, a former Christian brother who met Sister Catherine at a 1969 retreat for Notre Dame sisters in Boston, described her as ""extremely intelligent, extremely sensitive."" He said she was chosen to help lead the retreat ""for her poetic ability, because of her sensitivity to pick up on other people's feelings.""
But, like many young religious in the late 1960s, Sister Catherine was troubled by the regimented life of the convent.

She had also developed a romantic relationship with the Rev. Gerard J. Koob, a young Jesuit she had met when he was an intern at Keough. Mr. Koob, now a Methodist minister, told The Sun recently that he and Sister Catherine were deeply in love but that ""it was a love between two celibates in a commitment to Christ.""

He described Sister Catherine as a naive, unworldly young woman who had no sense of her own beauty -- or its effect on others. Mr. Koob said his sister in Boston once gave the nun expensive clothing, including a bright red suit. One day, Sister Catherine styled her hair fashionably and wore the suit to see him during a visit to Manresa, the Annapolis retreat where he lived and worked.

""She was beautiful,"" Mr. Koob recalled, and his fellow Jesuits just stared at her. ""I remember thinking, `Do you know what you've done?' And I said that to her later.""

Mr. Koob said he asked Sister Catherine to marry him before he was ordained in 1968 and before she had taken her final vows. She refused, but the two continued to see each other regularly and exchanged letters. Mr. Koob remained a Jesuit priest for a decade after her death.

When Sister Catherine didn't return by 11, her housemate grew worried and placed a frantic call to Father Koob at Manresa. Father Koob and Mr. McKeon -- who also knew each other from the 1969 retreat -- had just returned from dinner and a movie in downtown Baltimore when the phone rang. The two men rushed back to the city.

*Manhunt begins*

After several hours of anxious waiting at the nuns' apartment, the three took a walk to ease the tension. That was when they found Sister Catherine's Maverick parked illegally at Carriage Court and North Bend Road, a block from the apartment.

""We went to it and opened the door,"" said Mr. McKeon, who left the Christian Brothers in 1972. ""There was a broken umbrella in the back seat. It looked like there had been a struggle.""

City police took the car to the Southwestern District station, and a manhunt began in Southwest Baltimore and the neighboring areas of Baltimore County. But aside from the car, no trace of Sister Catherine was found until the hunters stumbled upon her body weeks later.

County police say now that no unaccountable fingerprints turned up in the car. Except for the umbrella and a twig hooked with yellow thread on the turn signal lever, nothing significant was found.

After the body was discovered, Dr. Werner U. Spitz, then deputy chief medical examiner for Maryland, said Sister Catherine had died from a 2-inch circular fracture of the left temple that was inflicted by a heavy blow with a blunt object, probably a brick. Marks on her neck indicated that she also had been choked.
In his report, the pathologist was unable to say with certainty whether she had been raped, because the lower body had been mutilated by animals. But he noted that ""the disarray of the clothing suggests a sexual background to this killing.""

Dr. Spitz said in a recent interview that he thinks Sister Catherine was killed somewhere else the night she disappeared and then dumped in the Lansdowne field.

The $255 Sister Catherine got from the bank was never found, although her purse -- containing personal articles -- lay near her body, along with several articles of clothing. Her rings and watch had not been removed, which prompted detectives who handled the original case to doubt the robbery motive.

Police still don't know how and where the nun was abducted or how her car, its wheels muddy, was returned to her neighborhood.

A Carriage House resident who knew the nun by sight told police at the time that Sister Catherine's car was pulled into its regular parking space about 8:30 p.m. But no one could say who was driving or how many people were in the automobile.

Other neighbors told police they noticed the car in a no-parking zone near the apartment about 10:30 p.m. To her friends, that meant something was wrong, since the law-abiding Sister Catherine would never have parked illegally.

*People close to nun*

Police say they still are unable to account for those two hours and never have found anyone who saw an abduction or heard screams.
Another witness told police that a similar car pulled up near Sister Catherine's automobile and that she followed it. ""She knew who pulled in behind her,"" a former investigator said. ""She either met them at the bank or the shopping center."" But the report of the second car was not substantiated.

In the original investigation, police concentrated on people close to the nun and on Gerard Koob in particular, although he had a strong alibi.

Mr. Koob, who now lives in New Jersey, told The Sun that he submitted without protest to police interrogations and underwent two polygraph tests in an effort to convince investigators of his theory that a stranger had taken Sister Catherine.

""I did everything they asked me to because I wanted them to get past the idea that it was someone who knew her,"" Mr. Koob said. Sister Catherine was such a gentle person that she wouldn't have resisted an attack, he said. ""She wouldn't have struggled. She'd have been like a bird, frozen.""

Mr. McKeon told The Sun that he confirmed Father Koob's account of his whereabouts the evening of the slaying -- that he and the priest had met for dinner and a movie. He said they had just returned to the Manresa retreat when Sister Russell's call came.

""I just happened to be there when she called. Gerry did not leave my sight that night. I was his alibi. I took the polygraph test,"" Mr. McKeon said.

Some former detectives and commanders still feel that their investigation was on the right track and was short-circuited by church officials.

A major impediment, said three retired police investigators and a commander -- including a lieutenant and a senior detective sergeant in the city homicide unit -- was the interference or lack of cooperation by the Archdiocese of Baltimore.

For example, Harry Bannon, then a detective sergeant and one of the city's top homicide investigators, said he was forced to end his interrogation of Gerard Koob prematurely because of intervention from the church.

""We had to stop questioning him because of some pressure brought by the archdiocese,"" Mr. Bannon said. ""The archdiocese sent a couple of priests who were lawyers. The priests went to {Police Commissioner Donald D.} Pomerleau, and the inspector wanted to know why we were holding Koob. We had more questioning to do, but we were ordered to charge the priest or let him go.

""We were absolutely certain we were going in the right direction. . . . If {Father Koob} didn't do it, he knew who did. We were all very aware of the potential for scandal because of everything that was going on inside the Catholic Church between priests and nuns.

""In fact, we were hoping someone would step forward who had heard the murderer's confession. We were both personally and professionally disappointed we didn't close the investigation. She was really a popular nun, but going into court in this murder would have shook the church to its foundations.""

*No cooperation*

Another former investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had much the same description of the incident. ""The word came down from Detective Inspector {Julian I. Forrest} to charge Koob or release him. I thought he was a very good suspect before we had him in, from my knowledge of the relationship between the two and the letters between them.""

Mr. Pomerleau and Inspector Forrest have died.
Who the priest-lawyers were and where they came from remains a mystery. Mr. Koob denied making any request for intervention. As a Jesuit, he said, he had no contact with the archdiocese and did not seek any assistance from superiors in his own order.

Some Baltimore County investigators said they ran up against similar roadblocks. ""We never got any cooperation from the church,"" said former Maj. Leroy Duggan, who was head of the county's major case unit. Mr. Duggan said it was as if the church was operating ""a judge's gag order.""

Another former ranking Baltimore County commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his superior told him to read and destroy some supplementary reports. ""There was stuff in there the church wouldn't like,"" the former policeman said, adding that he cannot remember details of those reports with absolute certainty today. [...]

So I am currently being offered $15 per hour for a remote internship with a startup. However, I am developing a critical portion of their platform. Am I being undervalued?

What to do.,bink1time,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6eb848/29_m_got_accepted_to_grad_school_what_to_do/,"I'm currently working as a senior data engineer for a small consulting company. I make 90k. I live in nyc so my cost of living is higher especially rent.

My take home after 4% 401k, taxes and health insurance is 4,450. I also get paid for lunch 3 times a week when I am on site. It is reimbursed at the end of the month. It's about 140 extra every month.

My expenses are high:
Rent: 1745
Internet bill:50
Food and travel: 1500( I know I need to bring this down)
Electric bill: is paid by gf.
Phone bill: parents still pay this, they don't mind. I have asked to pay for it, they have said it's fine we are happy to do it.

I am saving about a thousand dollars a month.

I have 46 thousand dollars split between my checking and savings account. I have no debt and no other expenses. I don't own a car and my girlfriend pays for Netflix.

Now for the hard part. I have received an acceptance letter to NYU masters program. Looking at the per credit course it seems like it would be about 60k for 2 years. Unfortunately because I didn't get an undergrad degree in computer science I will have to take undergrad courses I'm not sure how many. They will send me a letter. I'm guess 4 so that's another 15 thousand. So I'm look at 75k in school costs + books.

I have talked to my employer and informed them that I would be quitting to attend school. I have asked them if I could work low amount of hours at a high hourly. They seemed to be open to the idea I was going to ask for 70/hour for 10 hours a week.

Because I live with my girlfriend I can't really downsize on the rent. The rent is 3500 a month, although it seems expensive is fairly well priced for a luxury building in the city. I know luxury building... You are going to be a student you don't get to live in a luxury building. But I don't think my girlfriend would be too ok with downsizing. She makes a substantial amount of money more then me and is already living way below her means. I don't think a downgrade would be healthy for my relationship.

Given all that what do I do. What's my best course of action? Do I take out student loans and live on the 46k. I'm looking at two and a half years of school.

If I work 10 hours a week at 70 an hour. I would be making 2800 and that would probably be 2200 after tax. That could cover my rent and if I can bring my food budget down to 800 I would be spending 2545. Giving me a burn rate of 345 dollars a month. That's about 10k in a year a half. I have not accounted for insurance, this could be as little as 7k in two and a half years to as high as 30k? I'm just not sure at this moment. Will probably know this number by July.

I know that's kind of an unfair assessment because I would want to take internship and other companies and I don't know how my consulting firm would react to that so I may not have a job after my first year of school.

Just looking for perspectives on what to do to come out with the most gain from the program and as low a debt as possible.

Obviously I'm doing this because
1) I want to learn more, I like the program and I think it will advance me.
2) I think with a master I can demand for more in the long run and move up quicker."

Now, two weeks later, she is still having some anxiety and acting weird and distant. We are on summer break from college and live about 2 hours apart. I told her tonight over text that it's getting hard for me to keep going like this especially since the night before she got drunk alone in her room and worried me about her safety. She also is having self esteem issues and thinks she isn't pretty or desirable. She replied that she thinks this isn't working and we are forcing it, and that after her STD scare she doesn't feel like being sexual with me (usually she is very sexual and submissive to me). I replied asking if she wants to end it (2 year LTR) and she said no but she doesn't know what she wants. 

Now I'm not sure what to do. Should I instill dread? I work 8+ hours a day at my internship plus gym after so I was thinking of severely limiting how much I text her during those times (usually we text all the time). I also was thinking of talking to girls at the gym and from my hometown and going downtown or to see a movie with them. It seems others have done this and gotten good results. Does this seem reasonable?"

6ecjg3,0,2017-05-31,Recent graduate looking for advice: work and study in europe or pursue my dream and move to Japan?,A_Wapishana,LearnJapanese,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/6ecjg3/recent_graduate_looking_for_advice_work_and_study/,"Hello everybody,

I stumbled across this subreddit while looking for answers and I think this is the perfect place to ask for advice, as we all share a love for Japan and its language. Thank you in advance if you decide to read this and I'd love to receive some suggestions from you guys.  

First a bit about me: I have just turned 26, european national with a degree in international business achieved less than a year ago from a british university. I have completed my internship in accounting and now I am working freelance as an interpreter and an English tutor in my hometown.  

I am planning my next step and I am torn between 2 options: preparing the GMAT and applying to the best universities for business in EU, pursue a master and find a job in consulting, or moving to Japan for +1 year to become as fluent as can be in the language and find a job there.

My Japanese background: I always loved Japan since I was little, my first degree course was in business and Japanese and despite doing really well in my first year I ended up quitting Japanese after  many struggles. In my 2nd year I started dislking the course due to how lackluster and un-engaging the teaching was, which lead me to lose my motivation. I was also struggling with depression and physical health problems that lead me to fail my language exams and required me to take a year off university. When I went back to uni I decided to just get a degree in business. It was a tough decision. Before following that path I decided to visit Tokyo for a month and study at a language school there to be absolutely conscious of what I was leaving behind me. I honestly loved it so much, it felt like being back at home as weird as it sounds and Tokyo didn't feel too big for me, it felt like I was meant to be there. I still quit japanese due to how miserable that course had made me feel. After that things started looking up, I got pretty good grades in my final year and ended up with a 2:1. 

I would say that at that point I accepted the fact that Japanese for me wasn't going to happen and my plan for the future was to apply for a master in management in europe. However a few months ago I had a near death experience (was hospitalised and put in intensive care due to a heart infection) and my expectations have changed. I don't want to have regrets in my life and I am truly considering going back to Japan, become fluent in Japanese and find a job there. 

When I quit my level was around n4, in the month I was there I had no issues having simple conversations while getting around Tokyo, ordering food or asking for directions. It's been almost 3 years now though and I forgot a lot. 

I feel like staying here in Europe (or the UK) would probably be the cheapest, safest and overall best choice for my career but it doesn't excite me as much. I want to finish what I started, move to tokyo, become fluent and work there for a few years before coming back (at the moment I can't see myself living my entire life in Japan, it's something I want to do and experience but I know for a fact that I'd want to come back to Europe, for many different reasons, such as my sexual orientation). I also applied to a company in Tokyo but ultimately I didn't get selected after the final interview cause my Japanese was too poor. 

Guys what should I do? Do  I risk ruining my career if I move to Japan and study the language for 1-2 years? I am already 26 and age is also playing a role in this. With a british degree in business and let's say, jlpt 2 achieved in 1/1.5 years would it be reasonable to find a job there? In case you are wondering I can't do the JET programme cause I am not from an English speaking country (I'm Italian). While going to Japan is definitely what I would want to do if I had to follow my passion, I am concerned I will struggle to find work even in Tokyo after achieving business fluency in the language. I have read on various posts here and on other sites that Japanese adds very little ROI and I'm concerned. I am not at an age where I want to make any more mistakes if I can avoid to, what would you guys suggest me to do?

TL;DR: 26 yo, studied japanese and business in undergrad but quit japanese for various reasons. Now I want to go back to Japan and study japanese full time for 1+ years at a language school. However I am not sure it's a smart move for my career when I could work and get my masters here in Europe. I am concerned about the end results, could moving to tokyo and learning Japanese benefit my career in business in some ways? I am very open minded but I don't want to just blindly follow a passion if it'll ultimately have a negative impact on my future.

&gt; My fellow delegates, it's been a pleasure to meet you and discuss policy with you in the last few hours. I understand fully that I have few allies in this room, and the ones I do hardly have a nation to go back to. It's in consideration of this fact that I've called you in today to discuss the the main situation at hand. I have heard of the Dresden Conference, and while I do not know what occurred in it rumors say they have plans to completely chop up the Eurasian Federation. We will not allow this to happen. 

&gt; In today's conference we will discuss realistic goals that don't involve destroying one of the main columns of stability in the modern world. We understand that many of you are used to the administration of the past, but I can assure you, I am a much different president. Many of the demands that will be shortly given to you may surprise you, as they represent those of a reasonable person, that understands that many of you have fought for valid ideas and legitimate reasons. It is with this pleausure that I hand out a list of sheets to the delegates in this room, to be carefully read over and discussed. 

With this EF Interns began to hand out a paper sheet to the delegates in the room. 

&gt; You'll find that many of these demands are realistic. We don't want to keep all our land-- I understand that is an impossible goal.

&amp;nbsp;

After the delegates had been given 20 minutes to look over the document Anastasia Poklonskaya went back to the chamber room stage and made a second speech. 

&gt; I understand that while many of you will be happy with the results of this deal, others will not. It's due to this that I have made a concession with you. You are allowed to negotiate the results and offer counter proposals for the Eurasian Federation, and even may outright refuse a clause if you so disagree with it. However, some parts of this document are nonnegotiable for the Eurasian Federation, and must be implemented.

&gt; You're probably wondering how I'll possibly be able to implement these measures. Just a month ago [I readied](https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/6eakrm/secret_we_will_not_be_hostages_to_be_bartered_with/) the entirety of my Nuclear Triad in preparation for war. At this point the nations in this agreement have two options. Agree to my conditions with possible small concessions, or get nuked by either of the three of my nuking capabilities. Whether those nukes will land on your soldiers, your population centers, or your capital, they will land, and they will destroy society as we know it. 

&gt; It's your move.

&amp;nbsp;

^^1: ^President ^Poklonskaya ^was ^born ^in ^Crimea ^so ^I'm ^afraid ^this ^is ^nonnegotiable. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EDIT: A deal has not been able to be reached as every country denied the agreement, listing such stupid things as  ""The EF shouldn't be in Asia,"" which is a little bit retarded in my opinion. Because the season is done and players cannot agree (for that matter, no one even made a counter offer) to reasonable demands the Eurasian Federation will appear as it is now on the final S4 map, with us controlling the Baltics, Belarus, half of Ukraine, and the rest of Eastern Europe while not controlling the Pacific and Caucasus region. Hope everyone's happy. "

first post here, just felt like sharing my story.

I wasn't obese during school but once i entered university my weight skyrocketed. I drank a lot of energy drinks and my main dish was bread with mayo and ham/cheese/salami; inevitably i hit ~90kg after just 1 1/2 years (November 2014, 20yo, 178cm). When i was home for half a year for an internship my parents convinced me to lose weight. They introduced me to a diet powder (my father tried to lose weight too; won't say which product we used because this isn't an advertisement) and over 4 months i lost 12kg iirc. The support at home and the fact, that my mum could cook delicious &lt;500cal recipes were amazing.

Well, of course i was too stupid to recognize the temporary nature of this diet. You see, this powder was really effective but i didn't think about changing my eating habits after that.

So, after 1/2 year i was back in my flat and started gaining again. Over the next 2 years, supported by our good friends depression and hating-myself i went up to 96kg. So after the finals (May 2016) i finally decided to do something about it. It had worked before and this time, i knew how to prevent bouncing back. So i bought the powder again and went at it. I learned some low-cal meats and cut carbs nearly completely (~20-40g per day) and drink alcohol ~1time/2months. After just 3-4months i was down to 80 again and felt amazing. Started my job in October and lived completely alone for the first time. I started to do some smaller exercise (only pushups at first) as well.

And i held 80 until New Years Eve, i was happy and proud of myself.

Then i decided that i wanted to lose more. So in February 2017 i started again, losing 5kg in 1 1/2 months before i went on vacation and had to pause. We went hiking in Norway and there i realized, that my stamina and legs were absolute garbage. So three weeks ago i started again and one week ago i started running (2-3km each morning before works, 5/7days so far). I also included situps, planking, russian twist and weights into my home-exercise because i want a sixpack this summer/fall.

So here i am, i lost 24kg in the last year and got rid of a lot of bad habits. Every day i train from now on i'm in the best shape i've ever been for my whole life.

I'm planning on cutting the powder forever next week, it was very useful for losing weight fast but now i can control my weight without it (I am and have always been aware that using it isn't very healthy long-term).

Anyways, it's always encouraging and motivating to browse this sub, you guys are a bunch of cheerful and supportive bastards."

Or is this some kind of missunderstod logic ?_?

Edit 2: ""How do you say it's a good game and then complain about every aspect of the game?"" you ask. Well, it's a very good game, just not for me. I personally didn't like the game but I don't deny the fact that countless others did. It's a favourite for many fans of the series and new comers as well. Everything that I said about this is a very subjective and personal opinion. So I need to remind you, yeah, you probably won't agree with any of the points given below. And that's cool, you're not supposed to agree with every or any point I mention. You're free to go ahead and disregard my opinion, it's just something that I personally shared, giving you an insight from the perspective of someone who doesn't like this game so much(since a lot of them like it, nobody talks about why and how they don't like it). I don't hate the game, but I will say it was not as enjoyable to ME as the others in the series :)

This is probably gonna be down voted to hell, but I'm okay with it. I just want you to hear me out, you may not agree with me, but hear me. Black Flag is a very good game, no doubt about it. But quite honestly, it's one of my least favorites. A lot of people don't realise the faults in the game because they are too concentrated with the story. I'll try to explain why I don't like Black Flag as much as I like the other games.

1. Difficulty
The first thing I noticed with Black Flag as soon as I started is the difficulty. The game is so damn easy. Your health hardly takes a bite even with gun shots. A gun shot is pretty much fatal but in BF, you can take 3 gun shots and be fine and dandy. I didn't upgrade my health at all in the entire game and had no problem taking on tons and tons of enemies. I never upgraded any pouches, health and weapons. The only thing that was sort of challenging was the naval parts. Even then it wasn't too difficult, after getting a bunch of upgrades for my Jackdaw, I was taking on multiple frigates AND Man O' Wars without any problem. I was so overpowered the entire game.

2. Stealth:
I guess it makes you feel like a badass pirate but stealth is a joke. The lack of stealth in an Assassin's Creed game felt so weird. Yes, AC was never too deep on stealth, but it at least had a tiny tiny bit, BF on the other hand had hardly any stealth. There were hardly any part were you had to avoid detection and even those parts were stupid easy. I actually liked the ship stealth, it was unique and never done before. But that's all, there are hardly any other stealth parts. You can go into full blown combat as long as you don't alarm too many people. I kid you not, I would run around the restricted areas and shoot and stab people without hesitation because there were no consequences for not being stealthy. The stealth in Unity is much hated but boy did it do stealth well. Not being in stealth meant you were vulnerable, like you should be. Guns did so much damage to you, like they should. You couldn't cheese stealth by running around. The Black Box missions were amazing if you know how to play them. 

3. Combat:
Oh god, this is probably the worst part. Not only is it easy, but there is no life or flavour to the combat. Remember how in AC2, AC:B and AC:R you had to dodge, disarm, push etc other than just spamming the counter button? It doesn't help that they added a slow-mo effect, making it even easier. The enemy variation is embarrassing, there were like 3 types? One normal who died instantly with one counter, one guy who you couldn't counter, and one guy who can block. Snipers? Just, just forget them. You can take a billion shots to the face and love, why even bother with them. Oh and you also have meat shields, so snipers are so useless other than just being a minor annoyance like a mosquito buzzing near your ears. Back in Ezio games, you needed to time your counters, and the counter window changed with weapons. For example, if you were using hidden blades in AC2 and AC:B, it was much harder to counter when compared to countering with a normal weapon but if you did counters it can kill all types of enemies. It doesn't help that there are hardly any weapon types. 

4. Naval combat:
This is probably the best part of this game. Yet it gets so boring and repetative. After boarding the 10th or so ship, you realise this is it. This is all the naval combat has to offer. Attack a ship&gt;weaken it&gt;board&gt;do 1 out of the 3 template objectives of boarding. Done. Is that all you could muster up? Kill 10 people/Kill the captain/ Kill the snipers/ Take down flag/ Combo of any two. Why not something like, ""Take down flag without killing anyone""/ ""Take down the masts""/ ""Kill only the captain"". Come on, I'm sure you could've come up with more ideas Ubisoft.

5. Animations: 
Something about BF animations is just annoying. Mainly combat animations. There are like 3 counter animations, since there is no weapon variety, you get only those 3. The animations are so finicky, they are not stable. Things don't connect, things clip out of each other, the swords don't even touch the bodies many times. There is no weight to the animations. AC3 had brilliant animations. Go watch it's combat, it's so good. The animations in this game are so floaty. Free running is pretty much the same, nothing new about it. But it's kind of annoying, even more so than the previous titles. Trying to climb a pole to cut the flag? Why not keep running up and falling down again and again. Oh you waited for 3 seconds after your last attempt? Yeah now you do the same thing and this time it will work. Trying to assassinate someone? Play generic animation 1. You want a variation? Haha lol we only have one for that. Trying to blend in? Oh yeah about that, we removed the animations that we did have during the E3 demo and now you can do the same with no animations! The animations of the character models feels like a downgrade from the past titles quite honestly. And the audio wouldn't synch with the slow mo kills (at least on X360, don't know about other versions).

6. Missions (aka the main content):
Jesus Christ, this one. The entire game can be summarised with this type of missions: Find target, eaves drop, follow, kill. This is the entire game. Naval missions? Find target&gt;blow up minion ships&gt;destroy main ship or go to store and kill main target. There were like 3 cool moments: Ship stealth (the act was boring but concept was cool), running through a city on fire onto a ship and destroying the enemy. And the one where you get drunk and have hallucinations. Sure you could say that about a lot of the AC titles but each of them had significantly more variation than this game. AC2 had carnival and flying machine. ACB had Leo machines and disguising as a guard. Haven't played ACR but it had a mission where you disguised as a guitar guy (don't know what they are called) and the tower defense​. Unity and Syndicate had Black Box missions, which in idea were pretty much same but the level design changed the way you played. No tombs, no cool parkour sections, no cool cinematic moments. 

7. Locations (and this parkour):
The locations are, on the outside, very beautiful. But you realise how hollow they are when you land on the 3rd island. There is hardly any variation in the cities (you can't really blame them for this I guess, since there are like 2 cities and they had to fit the scene). But the islands? 70% of each island was unexplorable. 20% of each island was linear (forest pathway). 10% was barren land. Rogue had much smaller islands but the islands were cool, the level design was very nice there were drops, slides, caves, ice etc. It's boring to explore the map of BF because it takes too long to sail from one part to the other (but this depends on your taste, if you like naval you might enjoy this) and when you get there, what awaits you is a disappointing piece of land with hardly anything other than cougars on it.

8. Modern Day:
Let's be honest, MD has never been a strong point of the series (despite bring the most significant part of the series). But this lowers the bar even more. Look the concept sounds cool, but on paper it's fucking terrible. I don't wanna play Apple iPad Internship Simulator 2015 (or 2014 whatever). I wanna play as an Assassin in modern using what I learned through my ancestors. They never got to this (albeit some small segments in AC3, which were quite cool IMO). Yes having computers and reading Lore felt like we were some double agent or something, but it's not for everyone. Not everyone wants to read bits of para by hacking other computers. I'd play Dishonored if I wanted that. The MD story was okay, nothing too great but not too shabby either. They introduced Sages, which is quite cool. Killing Desmond was honestly one of the biggest mistakes Ubi made in AC franchise. It felt so abrupt and all the effort put into making him the greatest assassin feels pointless. He never got to use his skills much. 

The other parts of the game are forgettable or not worth. Side missions? Lol. Collectables? A pain in the ass. Crafting system? Why bother. Sea diving? Cool for the first time then it's the same. Whale hunting? Fun gimmick which gets boring quickly.

Rogue did a made a lot of improvements on the flaws of BF. One thing I remember is that the collectibles is Rogue were fun to collect because the places they were located in had a cool scripted level design, in contrast to the bland level design of BF. I don't remember correctly but when playing Rogue, it felt like a significant upgrade of BF. I'll try to replay Rogue and pin point what it made it better than BF.


Edit: A lot of you have mentioned that all these can be applied to almost all other AC games as well, which I almost agree with. The different is that, the other games had a some very strong points and a few weak points. Let me try to explain how:
"" A lot of the nitpicks of this game apply to other games, but those games did at least a few of these right. For example AC2-ACR did animations, stealth, combat and locations well. AC3 did animations, location, parkour, combat and MD well. Unity did animations, stealth, location and customization (crafting) well. Syndicate? Yeah let's not talk about that... But it did location very well to say the least. ""
The previous titles had some redeeming qualities. Not to say that BF is irredeemable, it's just that it doesn't have a lot going on for it other than a good story (it is pretty touching) and the fun factor. "

I watched from afar as I saw the three teenagers, no older than 15 or 16, circling the woman's house. One of them was girl, pretty with long white hair and sparkling blue eyes. The other two were boys, gormless and muscle bound. I've had my eye on these three for a while. Most of my job consists of making sure that the adolescents don't find out about their biological abnormalities, so when I heard about a group of teens jumping off the fifth floor of an apartment building unharmed, I was immediately suspicious.

I tailed them for a few days, watched them as they discovered their immunity to pain and death. They spent days stabbing each other and shooting each other in the face and chest. My teenage partner, Melanie, came up beside me. Despite her being underage, the Agency decided to take her on as an intern due to her excellence in the aptitude tests. There's no guarantee that she'll keep her ability into adulthood but she sure is useful right now. I've been assigned to show her the ropes. This was her third overall mission.

""You know who's house it is ?"", she asked.

""Linda Carst's. She's a 36 year old nurse. I've seen them stalking this house for a while now. I did some background info on the occupant of the house. She's not affiliated with them at all. They just chose this house for some reason.""

""What are their names ?""

""The girl is Kat. The other two, Randy and Saul.""

""Hmm. I guess we better head on in then.""

""Lets make it happen, Cap'n.""

The group of teens entered the house through the front window. Melanie went around the back as I picked the lock on the front door.

I peered into the house. The two guys were patrolling the hallways while I could just about make out Kat in Linda's bedroom. Linda was tied to a chair with mascara stained cheeks.

""Man, I don't know about this. I mean, what if we really can die ? What if we have ....like nine lives or something, you know, like a cat ? And we've wasted eight of 'em"", said Saul.

""And even if we can't die, we can still go to jail for the rest of our lives. I don't wanna have to shit in front a prison guard every day forever"", agreed Randy.

Kat, obviously after hearing the commotion, stormed out to the two guys.

""What did I tell you two chicken shits ? We are gods ! We can do whatever the fuck we want. No one can stop us. Now go keep lookout.""

I had previously thought that the guys had pressured Kat into doing this, as is the usual, but apparently Kat seemed to be the mastermind behind all of it.

Saul wandered into the kitchen while Randy took the living room.

Melanie crept into the kitchen. She took out a syringe and jammed it into Saul's neck. She injected the yellow liquid into this neck. He stumbled and then collapsed, unconscious.

I followed Randy into the living room. He turned just as I was about to inject him. He swung the metal baseball bat he was holding and whacked me in the face. I barely flinched as I took hold of him. He pulled out a knife and jammed it into my stomach. His face went slack as I calmly pulled it back out.

I stabbed him with a syringe full of the tranquilliser. He flailed about and collapsed. I approached the bedroom. Kat was pouring oil over Linda. She screamed. 

""Stop right there !"", yelled Kat. She pulled out a katana and put it to Linda's neck. ""Stop and throw your little drugs out the door or she gets it !""

I had no choice but to comply and throw my syringes out the door. I caught a glimpse of Melanie dragging the two guys out the kitchen door. 

""You don't know what you're doing"", I warned Kat.

""Oh I think I do, asshole.""

Kat released Linda from her restraints and Linda immediately stopped crying. Linda chuckled evilly and shoved a kitchen knife into her own gut, without any consequence. She easily pulled it back out and pulled out a vial of strange, purple liquid.

""I think it's about time we took down the Agency, eh Kat ?""

Last year I couldn't study full time but now I have a 40 hour a week internship. In a few weeks I will finally be getting my degree. I was pretty proud of myself since I felt like it was going well, even though it was stressful.

Yesterday I heard that I will not be getting a job offer at the place I intern at and I am kind of crushed. I really liked this company! All other interns are getting offers(they are in the same type of field, just a different branch if that makes sense) and I feel really insecure. I thought I was doing a good job.
They think I am not pro-active enough and not enthusiastic enough. Those things are so hard for me because of my anxiety/depression and being an introvert. And even though I have improved a lot on this it apparently isn't enough. I feel rejected and like no matter how hard I work, it will never be enough. I want to lie in bed and cry and am so ashamed. Part of me doesn't want to go to my internship anymore and just quit(I know it is not an option and will see this through but it is costing me mentally). 
I tried looking at other jobs but it is making me so anxious and I feel like I am not good enough to work anywhere.

It feels like if I dare to feel I will only get more depressed and I don't know how to deal. My next therapy session is in 2 weeks because I just had one and I am really bad at talking to anyone in real life(working on that too...). Does anyone know how to get through this? "

My wife and major tasks at hand.  I am a 28YOM and she is a 27YOF.  I am a Paramedic and earn roughly 55k a year and she works as an administrative assistant making 32k a year.  I am currently full time in school as well and have about a year and half left.  My wife is quitting her job to do a one year masters program at University of Michigan.

Expenses: 
$1200 mortgage
Car: $370
Car insurance: $220
Utils/internet/food/fuel/phone~800

We have $9,000 in savings and I have a 403B with $26,000.
I have been paying for school entirely out of pocket with the help of my companies education reimbursement program of 5k a year.

I do have about 6k in student loan debt from school when I was younger that I did not complete due to family issues (as well as being pretty irresponsible when I was younger.)  

My work is very stressful and would love to go part time in order to focus on school.  I'm doing well in school so I feel that I can finish while working (though I will have an internship next summer.)  However, for my own sanity, there is a nagging piece that wants to do this the ""traditional"" way and finance school.  I will still be entitled to the tuition reimbursement.

Secondly, You noticed that my car payment is super high.  Well that is because I allowed lifestyle creep 3 years ago when I got a promotion at work and leased a dodge charger.  The lease is up in December and I am doing to need wheels.  This will lower my insurance and I would like to pay cash.  I don't want to dip into savings because we will need this over the next year with just me working.  I want to pay around $5,000 for a decent car.  I can take a loan against my 403B and pay 4%.  It's earning an average of around 8% annually making the net earnings after paying myself the interest roughly 4% (I Hope I am thinking of this the right way.)  Or, should I just Finance a used car and pay whatever market rate for cars is (I have no idea)
Credit score is 780 according to credit karma.

Any other random advise is welcome too!

If I knew that your ""low point"" was going to be this bad I wouldn't have gotten into this relationship in the first place.

You expect me to be there for you for months and you won't even spare me a fucking day? What the fuck.

I don't even plan dates anymore because every single damned time you ask me to ease drop on strangers' conversations because you hear them talking about you when it's PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to hear what they're saying.

I just wanted a fucking stable relationship where I can happily go on dates, be physically and emotionally intimate, have adventures.

I'm suffocating you, I'm withdrawing. Well maybe if you listened to what the fuck I've been saying for the past month you'd realize something is fucking wrong. Fuck

And you know what. What's been convincing me it's worthwhile to stay? I thought you wanted to put effort into this too. 

Thinking about it though you only visit my place when you have business in the area. You only planned a date this past month when I asked you to. You may be fine hanging out at your parents' but it's boring as fuck there. I have nothing to fucking do and the one time I tried having sex with you this past month your mom ended up walking in by accident. (She was very nice about it afterwards.) So now I'm too mortified to even attempt anything there.

You wake up in the middle of the night breaking down. You smoke weed almost daily now and offer me some which would be fine but I quit DUE TO MY CAREER PATH.

I listened to you talk about killing yourself, freak out about your paranoid breakdown that your parents were switching your meds, tried to maintain a positive attitude when we were on dates and I was attempting to do the impossible which would cause you to turn on me in exchange. You didn't ask me to take care of you. BUT I CAN'T SHUT DOWN WHEN YOU BREAK DOWN IN FRONT OF ME. Not because I'm some kind of hero who can ""save"" you but I love you and I don't enjoy seeing my loved ones in pain.

And now I'm struggling with all the stress. YOU don' know what to do? I don't know what to do when you break down but I keep trying my best. Fuck I thought you'd be there for me but you're not. What the fuck. You can't even spare the fucking time to talk. This is fucking bullshit. Fucking hell. I still want to try to make things work but now I'm grasping at straws.


You are a wonderful caring person but god you can be so self-absorbed sometimes.

We're about to try long distance for your summer internship. I'll focus on myself, ~~I already have plans to travel with my friends, white water rafting for the 7th year, I could learn sport kayaking this time, hell I might try heading to Montreal for the just for laughs festival while visiting a friend in Quebec - I'll practice my poor french skills with her and say hi to her cats, or visit a friend working at Amazon this summer in Vancouver, maybe stop by Alberta to say hi to my friend who went home for the summer and listen to her talk about her recent breakup, I'll learn how to make macrons with a friend across the street from me, I'll get my brother to teach me how to lift even though I'm weak as hell, I'll drink to my friend's graduation before he moves back to Singapore, my high school friends are planning to meet up so that'll be fun, I'll have kbbq with the chicks I can always have a laugh around, my mom offered to have a family trip this summer so why the hell not?.~~ I'll hang out with my friends. I have enough money saved up to do most if not all of these things. My coworkers are always looking for more shifts and I know who's free during mine so booking time off is easy. I need to schedule around my classes but the marked assignments are biweekly and lectures are posted online so I can always catch up. 

You don't want to put in effort. I'm too tired to at the moment.

Maybe doing all these things will alleviate the resentment. Although maybe it'll cause me to forget about you completely. 
I'm pretty good at moving on with my life.
Venting on reddit helped a lot but I'll probably hide this post later today due to too many personal details. I made a post last night and the only advice I really got was to talk to a councilor or a support group but I find that I'm good at dealing with my problems anonymously while doing some self-reflection. Maybe read some articles. It'd be nice to have some support but I know realistically finding support about providing support to you is counter intuitive.

Aside from the paranoia and more frequent breakdowns we're weirdly compatible. You're dorky and sweet. A bit awkward but not in a way that makes people uncomfortable. You're charming and silly. You're wicked smart and ambitious but not high strung. You're emotionally open - maybe a bit too often lately. People naturally gravitate towards you but you don't notice. I love you.

You're killing me here though."

6eg302,2,2017-05-31,Avoiding to meet up for sex?,honiggeschmack,gayyoungold,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayyoungold/comments/6eg302/avoiding_to_meet_up_for_sex/,"Hi. I'll try to keep this to the point.

I'm 24, he's 44. We started hooking up mid-February. I’m living in the US temporarily for an internship, and I’m going back to Europe to finish my program in a month. I've always been very forward about having sex with him - we text almost daily, but lately it just seems like he's avoiding meeting up for sex.

Things seemed different for a bit after I drunk texted him a couple weeks ago. I said I wanted to talk to him about something, but I made it sound too serious when it was just about sex. And then I said I was growing attached to him and that I hated it. He laughed the drunk texting situation off the next day, but that same weekend when I talked about a random guy being just my type he seemed a bit jealous and told me to hook up with him. Things then felt off, but our texting eventually normalized.

Last week he told me two possible days for meeting up, ended up that none of them actually worked out. Memorial Day weekend came, and we both traveled to different places, texted and sent each other pictures. Yesterday I brought meeting up for sex to which he replied ""We'll see pushy boy lol"".

I don't know, I might be overreacting. He might as well just be busy, but I feel like he's avoiding sex with me... and I'm like, only here for another month, which he's very well aware of - he actually suggested we have dinner at a great restaurant before I leave and all. I don't know how to approach this. I want to continue having sex with him, but at this point I'm rather conflicted and wish I knew what he's thinking...

Yes, perhaps I shouldn't be making such a huge deal about something so casual. My main reasoning for wanting to stick with him is that so far he's shown me something that I've got very little of in the past years: respect. When I'm with him, the sex is good, but I like more the fact that we actually talk to each other before and after. 

Any thoughts?"

6egr96,1,2017-05-31,Shy Indian guy with zero romantic experience. Require Help.,sharmilabalak,IndianProblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianProblems/comments/6egr96/shy_indian_guy_with_zero_romantic_experience/,"Hello redditors of India, 21 yr old, Shy guy a.k.a Sharmila Balak speaking here. I need a bit of dating advice or just advice in general related to women/girls.

I have been introverted or shy for as long as I can remember. What I've increasingly begun to realise is that I've had no experience with girls and women my entire life upto this point. I'm straight btw. I do despise this and want to change this now. My life story in brief till now.

Till age 15 I spent my time living in the beautiful city of Mumbai. In high school, I remember discovering pornography and begin to like girls. Although I never acted upon those desires. I never asked a girl out or engaged in texting, which was a rage back then and which was how you came into contact wih girls. Consequently even in a metro city like Mumbai, I ended up with zero experience with the fairer sex. Note that, I can talk to women normally, like make banter or idle chit-chat but am still clueless from a romantic point of way.

The years 15-17 were spent preparing for the dreaded JEE, enough said, I certainly didn't get some during this phase. And oh also neither did I make it to IIT, I got into BITS instead.

Coming to college, I remember initially that I definitely did entertain the thought of getting a girlfriend, the logical thing to do in college, right ? But for whatever reasons, I found programming and engaged in relentless pursuit of my academic endeavors. I have realised that I've used that as an excuse to not approach women at all. And have come to sadly realise that I didn't approach them because I didn't know how to ? I was inexperienced hence I didn't approach women and I didn't approach women because I was inexperienced. See the Catch-22 situation here ?

This is what plagues my existence right now. The sheer inexperience I have in matters pertaining to romance. To make matters even worse, I had a personal tragedy while I was in college, my mother passed away out of the blue. Which made me even more of a recluse and not seek the company of women. I have literally zero experience in pursuing women or romantic relationships. Shouldn't come as a surprise that I haven't even kissed until now. I have a grand total of 2 women's phone numbers one of who was a colleague during an internship and another an old-school friend who I suspect might be interested in me.

I am looking for some concrete steps so that I can pursue and fulfill my romantic desires. I will start of with these questions -

How does dating actually work in India ? I have been a consumer of popular TV shows of all kinds, I am certain you can't approach random women on street and ask them out lest you want to be labelled as a creep.

How do I go about expressing my romantic interest in girls/women ? How do I start off ?

Say I'm friends with a girl, how does the whole process of ""making one a girlfriend work"" in India ? Do you actually propose a.k.a confess your pretentious love before you date ?

At what point do I ask a woman who I might be interested in for her number (definitely not right off the bat) ?

Do guys feel insecure about approaching women ? Do you only approach someone who might say yes ?

All of these questions should pretty much tell you that I'm a bit socially handicapped. People are afflicted with various diseases, me I'm afflicted with the condition of having zero experience with women. I am an adult for all purposes for now, I will soon be getting a job, I desperately want to change this situation.

I'm an ordinary guy. I work out, am hygienic etc. I respect women, I wish I'd just be a bit more open around people and more specifically with women. Women seem to be like an alien concept to me, even now.

Understand that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. I'm genuinely looking for help, please stay to the point and avoid jokes, memes etc.

Thanks/Dhanyavaad."
6egub8,3,2017-05-31,I ruined everything over 6 years,iamveryfontofyou,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6egub8/i_ruined_everything_over_6_years/,"Today is day 2 of NC, and this isn't the first time it has happened. My ex-boyfriend and I just recently broke up. We have been together for 6.5 years, but we split twice before that. 

The first time we broke up was 2 years into our relationship, and I was acting out of hand and was getting insecure because he became comfortable. I grew up in not the best environment, and I never knew what a stable relationship was or looked like. So my boyfriend wanted to take a break, but he also said that he liked someone else. I was devastated and I thought that he was not going to come back. So I stupidly hooked up with my ex-boyfriend (whom I dated before him). I felt awful and guilty and I told him what happened. I also didn't give him the details right away and so to this day he still thinks I am hiding stuff from him, and he has major trust issues with me. I feel like I also never did a good job controlling my emotions and helping him regain his trust. I always got mad at him and berated him over every little thing, and I acted out a lot. A lot of it, as I am realizing it now, came from my insecurity and self-hatred for myself. From day 1 into our relationship, I depended way too much on him for everything that I could not give myself. I should have loved myself before getting into this relationship in the first place. 
My boyfriend was so perfect and had such a big heart, and he was the first person to ever care about me, and I feel like I ruined everything. My behavior never changed or got better no matter what. He threatened to leave me plenty of times, and I always cried and begged and said that things would be different, but they never were. 

He had about enough and I let him go again, about three years ago, I got on Tinder to see what was out there and to fill the void, which was also a stupid idea. I just hung out with 2 different guys and I realized it wasn't what I wanted. He eventually texted me one day saying he was lonely and he wanted to talk, so we agreed to give it another shot. Well, obviously nothing changed and I didn't learn and grow like I was supposed to because everything pretty much stayed the same, but we were closer and I also started going to therapy after what happened, but I did not realize a lot about myself until a year and a half ago. I was always blaming him for everything and I should have been blaming myself. I feel so awful and he did not deserve to be treated the way I treated him. In January I got an internship where we lived, but my parents were moving, so I kind of forced my way to live with him, and we both agreed if things did not get better until May we would call it quits. 

Things were always up and down thanks to me. Ever since him losing his trust for me, he was always standoff-ish in our relationship, he never wanted sex, never gave me affection, and stopped telling me he loved me, he would only do it when he was asleep. He started looking to buy a house because his mother died, and he was left with an inheritance. At first, he did not want me involved, but then he changed his mind. Last month, he found the house that he wanted, and he is expected to close and move in the house in 2 weeks. A week after he put an offer into the house, he told me he did not want me living there. I was crushed, but I understood why. I was about to graduate college, and all this change was about to happen and I took it out on him, and he warned me several times to stop, and I didn't. I feel like I was a child, and I acted like such a fool, why couldn't I have done something before it was too late? Things started getting out of hand, and my boyfriend was losing his temper, so we both agreed that it was best for both of us to end things before it got worse. We both love and respect one another greatly. I

 feel like he still never gave himself time to forgive me for what happened, and that he never gave himself time to get over it or get through it either. When we tried to go no contact last week it was a disaster, we both kept talking to each other. He said he liked to text me because he wished that's how I was in person, and that made me really sad because I feel like a crazy person who has a lot of growing up to do. Last week I read a book that helped me open my eyes even more to my behavior and how I was and I apologized to him. He then told me he felt a lot of anger towards me, but he was still talking to me and kept asking for sex, but I kept refusing, and it started to make me mad. 

On Monday, we decided to meet with each other to have some closure, and we, of course, slept together, and it was amazing, I made sure I would not give myself false hope and I was okay with it. We made a deal to stop talking for at least 30 days after this, and we would check up on one another. He told me that he regretted breaking up with me for a minute because he missed me and wasn't sure if this was right, but he knows we both need time for ourselves to grow. The scary thing is I know what I need to do, and I'm mad at myself for not doing this when we first took our break. I hate how long it took me, and I hate how I destroyed everything. I gave too much of myself away I feel like, but now that we are apart I feel like I can breathe. I still believe it is possible that we can be together and I hate that I am so hung up on it. I'm terrified he is going to find someone else, and that will probably destroy me, but he deserves it after putting up with my crazy. I told him that he should probably go talk to other females to make sure that we are right together. He told me to stop being hopeful about us getting back together, but I can't help it and it won't go away. 

I love him so much and I hate that I destroyed everything, and it was the one thing I wanted in life. We used to talk every single day, and I feel like I am coming off an addiction. It doesn't help that I work in a quiet office with no one around, so my mind wanders like crazy. I just want some peace of mind. I'm tired of obsessing honestly, but it's still in my head. Is there hope for us in the future? How can I stop thinking about it? "
6egv8u,1,2017-05-31,Going away for awhile; am I going to be okay?,26872990,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/6egv8u/going_away_for_awhile_am_i_going_to_be_okay/,"Hey, so about a week and a half ago, I was jumping into a pool. I didn't realize how shallow it was, and my right foot stomped hard into the pool ground. It did not roll; I landed flat foot. It hurt very bad for about the first 30 seconds, and I had a limp due to a pain in my heel for the next two days. After, I was able to walk without a limp again, but with a moderate pain in every step.

My heel has had absolutely no discoloration or swelling, just pain when stepping with pressure on it. The pain is concentrated seemingly in the back inside of the heel (as opposed to the pain being on the surface of the skin like a bruise). Massaging it or pushing on it with my palm causes no discomfort either. I can feel a bit of pain when squishing it from the sides with both of my palms, but it is different than the pain from walking.

It's not a major pain, but my concern stems from the fact that it seems as though it has not gotten better since the two day mark I mentioned above, and the fact that I am leaving from my parents house to an internship half way across the country tomorrow.

I took a single Advil every 24 hours for the first week or so, but in the past few days I haven't. The pain has been a bit worse, but it is probably because I walked a lot yesterday. I was back to limping a bit too.

Should I be concerned?

6ehiiu,43,2017-05-31,"Western Saviours and learning how to deal with them. As an activist in the developing world, how do I learn to tolerate the saviours? Western perspectives welcome.",teengunalagaan,SRSDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/6ehiiu/western_saviours_and_learning_how_to_deal_with/,"This is meant to be a request for advice/education but it might turn into more of a rant.
 
I'm an Indian man in my late 30s. I'm mostly a writer but I've been involved in activism since my teens. My wife runs an NGO focused on underprivileged women in urban areas and I've been involved with this organisation for the last 12 years, but my main livelihood is dependent on being the local ringer/journalist for western media orgs.

I've always had problems with western journalists and activists who get involved with Indian issues, but there were always avenues to get around/lessen those problems. But it's been getting worse nowadays. A lot of it is what Teju Cole talked about in his essay on the White Saviour Industry, except I have begun to call it the Western Saviour Industry considering how some of the most egregious fuck-ups I've seen are from POCs from western countries.

What I'm talking about her is this weird mixture of arrogance, ignorance, self-righteousness, and just pure obnoxiousness. And in my experience as well as the experience of many many others I've been talking to, these issues seem to be institutionally entrenched if not promoted within western organisations, be they media companies, non-profits/ngos, volunteership programmes, academic programmes etc. etc.

This is all based on my interactions with journalists that I've met through my job and activists and volunteers I've met through my wife's organisation, her NGO has a few tie-ups with Global Poverty organisations and since she receives a lot of her funding through them it comes with the catch of having to receive and cater to western interns/volunteers/academics/activists etc.

Some of the kinds of people I've had problems with are as follows-

* The CV builders- These actually have proven to be the least problematic group. Here I'm referring to the kinds of people who see working in the developing world as a bullet point in their resume and nothing more. They may not do much substantive work but in most cases they tend to stay out of the way. The journalists that fall in this category will pretty much leave all the work to a local ringer like me and then edit the written material into their style and add their name to the byline. The interns/volunteers also follow the same sort of modus opperandi and stick to light grunt work. These people at least aren't generally harmful or a liability. I just don't understand the need to fly halfway across the world and not gain any real experience but whatever.

* The know-it-all know-nothings- A fair bit more problematic, these are the people who are unaware of their ignorance but still have a compulsion to voice their opinions and defend them over and over again even in the face of more experienced and knowledgeable opinions. My wife is better at dealing with this sort of stuff since she doesn't suffer any fools and when faced with entrenched foolishness she just ignores those voices. I on the other hand end up arguing with their foolishness and my lack of temperance tends to force them to hold on to their points of view a bit more strongly. Some examples- My wife recently had a young German lady as an intern who was working on a project related to the sexual abuse and exploitation of women in homeless shelters, this lady posted a picture of one of the victims on her social media with a long caption that detailed the issues the victims faced, now this might have been a reasonable thing to do in her circles but it's an absolute no-no here. Revealing personal details of a sexual assault victim in general is massively unethical/exploitative and in this specific case it was also a criminal act since there was an active criminal case regarding the assault where her identity is protected by law. My wife was apoplectic with her and pretty much strong armed her into taking down the post, but the intern was convinced that she was in the right saying that putting a face helps in promoting anti-sexual assault messages. It took my wife a really long time and a lot of patience to explain all the negative consequences that might take place if her identity becomes public knowledge, not to mention the clear violation of the trust the victim had placed in the organisation. The intern ended up agreeing, if begrudgingly so. This one was actually one of the less egregious ones in my wifes experience, she's even had her funding suspended because some have complained to the organisations that provide her funding based on ignorant ideas. 
I've worked with journalists who fall under this umbrella as well, a fucking horrible journalist from a well-respected British media organisation who in his reporting would consistently refer to [Panchayats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayati_raj_%28India%29) as Kangaroo Courts, completely dismissing their status as official forms of self-governance for small and under-resourced rural communities. I refused to work with this person after a pattern of ignorant and dismissive bullshit became clear, that news org replaced me easily with someone else while the journalist continues reporting his shit.

* The westerncentric ones- The most problematic group by far and also the most institutionally entrenched. From academics to journalists, every western person I've ever interacted with has been overwhelmingly western-centric in their thought processes and practice. This ranges from media companies preferring their own people in every aspect rather than the local voices, to foreign academics who are unabashedly western-centric and refuse and resist any criticism on that. Some of the worst instances- the American WOC academic who uses Critical Race Theory to approach Caste Discrimination in India and then the uses the wonky conclusions to hector actual Indian Caste activists. The British media company that hired me to write on the death penalty issue and then removed all the quotes I got from local experts and replaced them with quotes from British experts, the themes of said quotes differed considerably. The British Indian documentarian who hired me to interview some of the subjects off camera and then removed my translated transcript and replaced it with the translation she came up with, even though she doesnt speak the dialect of the subjects and made massive translation errors.  
In all of these cases any protest from our side is completely ignored, the British media company specifically told me that they routinely replace local experts quotes on policy issues with their own ones because they believe local experts tend to be defensive about their own country/region/community etc. So essentially they'd rather be wrong than have a genuine local voice that might or might not be defensive. 

The reason I'm posting this here, is that I was recently having a conversation with a visiting South African Academic and I was telling her about the German Intern debacle, well it turns out she has her own litany of similar experiences with western folks, some of her stories were actually quite worse. Ironically enough during our discussion another visiting academic, this time western, came and told us that it can't be that big an issue because of the rising understanding of intersectionality and awareness of privilege. Which was absolute bullshit, but this lady was a complete immoveable object. It should have been hilarious but it was just another item in a long exhausting list.

I've started taking fewer assignments from western media companies nowadays, and end up pretty much keeping my mouth shut around the academics and interns from those places. But it's pretty difficult. How do I deal with this sort of frustrating bullshit, how do I communicate with such people?

I met my girlfriend on one of those sleazy dating apps and was immediately drawn to how outgoing and confident she was. Incidentally, she's also the smartest person I've ever met (valedictorian of her ivy league medical school)(see also: she's beautiful and charming and I like her a lot). Now, I'm not dumb (masters degree, professional career) but anytime we try to have an intellectual debate, I feel blown out of the water. It's getting to the point where I'm wondering if we should just cut this short and break up before it gets too messy.




She's a Libertarian and I'm as far left as it gets. I actively assist people in receiving welfare benefits, she has the cover of Atlas Shrugged framed on her wall. We not only disagree about almost everything political but our actual conversations drive me a little insane. She's brilliant with debating so she has this way of pushing my buttons. Example, yesterday she tried to explain to me that she could easily live on $187 food stamps per month... in NYC, didn't agree when I said she couldn't. Or, our legendary fight about Wiki-leaks. Like I've mentioned before, she's smarter than I am so I usually fall behind or misquote something eventually (getting Assange and Snowden mixed up), she calls me out, and then I feel stupid. Ultimately I'm responsible for my reactions and I'm the one getting mad, I can SEE where she's coming from I just... can't agree.




A lot of these things (also her opinions on crime, drugs, etc) come from a place of privilege but I can't seem to bring myself to say that (nor would I ever want to). There is also this alarming arrogance that sometimes comes through, she'll say things like: ""I'll never meet anyone as smart as I am"" or ""Talk therapy doesn't work and isn't a thing"" which is a pretty big deal because I'm a therapist and like that's my livelihood. There are a few other red flags that I won't mention but the main thing are these arguments. I've tried to just not respond and listen, I've tried to avoid the conversations completely... it doesn't work. I'm starting to think that she likes them. 




Besides the politics, I do like her. The sex is pretty good, we've met each other's families...we've briefly talked about the future and what we both want- kids, dog, house. The only thing is that she's about to start her intern year at a hospital and will be constantly working for basically the next 3-7 years. She mentioned that she'll want to start a family as soon as she's put her time in and like, same tho, but I worry about us committing to each other if we just aren't compatible. My last relationship really messed with me and since then I've basically pushed everyone away/ghosted at every chance to avoid getting hurt. She's the first person I've wanted to work through stuff with but I don't want to resent her and I don't want her to feel like she's settling for me.

Everyone stopped talking and turned towards Mr. Carlisle. He scanned the room before his eyes finally landed on Mary and me. He sighed and continued walking across the floor. ""But Mr. Carlisle..."" I called and tried to follow him.

""Why is that window open? Close that window!"" Mr. Carlisle barked.

Some immediately shut the window and closed the blinds. ""Is it coming?"" solemnly asked the man who had shut the window.

Mr. Carlisle stood silently hanging his head. ""Yes... it is..."" Mr. Carlisle finally admitted.

He passed his hand over his face, and a few tears rolled down his face. ""I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry,"" Mr. Carlisle said hoarsely looking towards me, ""You're so young.""

I turned around to look at Mary behind me. She was leaning against the back wall in tears. We were just interns at this place trying to make a bit of money and gain some experience. ""What about the people on the lower floors?"" I asked.

""There are no more lower floors,"" answered Mr. Carlisle darkly.

Everyone was silent.... until there was a scream. The scream was sharp and chilling. It was Mrs. Lambert who was still standing near her cubicle. Her entire body began transforming into nothingness- a black void- as did everything around her. 

I ran towards Mary and held her as the darkness began overtaking the floor. ""What if... What if there's life beyond this? What if it's not just emptiness?"" asked Mary as we watched the office staff succumb to the void's vicious jaws.

""I don't know. I never particularly wanted to find out,"" I said as the palpable blackness barreled towards us."

I'm a 25 year old male Swedish computer science student looking for a studio or room in a flatshare for summer.

I'm going to stay in London for summer (12th of June to 5th of August) since I got a tech internship in Chelsea. I'd prefer someplace not to expensive not to far away from Chelsea but I am open for almost anything. Shepherd's Bush, Hammersmith or something south of the river would be perfect. Something around £150 a week would be great but like I said, I'm open for any offers.

I'm a pretty laidback person but I enjoy going out to pubs/bars/clubs as well, I enjoy having people around me most of the time. In my spare time I mostly play games or play around with some programming stuff. 420 friendly is a plus.

Send me a PM or write in comments if you have any questions,

Thanks,

How do you cope with knowing your ex's life is exponentially better than yours?

We just graduated from college and she has a full time job lined up (which I helped her prepare for), new BF, is studying for her CFA.  She didn't even tell me she got the offer, I had to ask like 2 weeks later :/

I know the correct thing to do is focus on my own life, but its so hard. It feels like she left me behind. 

I used to be there and support her, encourage her to go for jobs out of her comfort zone (we both live in Canada and I pushed her towards applying for an internship in Manhattan (which she was able to get).

Now, my life isn't complete shit either - I've been getting interviews from top companies in the Bay area (I'm a Computer Science grad). I'd like to think I'm good at programming. 

Lately though, I just feel no motivation to apply to jobs. Every time I sit at my computer and work on my resume or doing interview preparation, I just think to myself ""Dude you're far behind. She is set. Her career is going to skyrocket. She's going to be making so much more money than you""

I know this is so dumb, but it absolutely sucks feeling like this."
